<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Disclosed is a game system provided with a monitor for displaying and outputting a game screen, a touch panel overlaid upon the monitor, and an external storage device for storing sequence data wherein operation time periods of the touch panel during a game are described. The sequence data includes an object corresponding to a specific operation time period for which the time interval between the following operation time period is to be less than a predetermined value, and display start information for setting a display start time period which is earlier than the following operation time period. In addition, the game system, on the basis of the sequence data, associates a second object separate from a first object corresponding to the following operation time period with the specific operation time period to cause display to start earlier than the following operation time period.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a game system in which an operation timing of an operating unit provided in an input device is indicated to a player, and a control method of controlling a computer used thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are game machines in which a plurality of players alternately operates an operating unit in tune with a rhythm of music. Of the game machines, there has been known a game machine in which a plurality of players play a game, and each player alternately operates the operating unit while deciding a next player to operate an operating unit through an operation of the operating unit (for example, see Patent Literature 1). Further, there has been known a game machine in which a game is played such that two players alternately hit back an object indicating an operation timing, and the velocity of the object moving toward the other party side changes according to the position of the object at a point in time when each player hits the object back (for example, see Patent Literature 2).

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0006">In the game machine disclosed in Patent Literature 1, a difference between an entering timing at which a light shot serving as an operation indication mark indicating an operation of an operating unit enters a control area of each player and an operation timing of each player is evaluated. In the game machine disclosed in Patent Literature 1, a back ground music (BGM) is mainly used as a playing time. Meanwhile, in the game machine disclosed in Patent Literature 2, an operation performed in tune with a rhythm of music is evaluated, but a time on music is not associated with an arrival timing of an object serving as an operation indication mark. For this reason, in this game machine, an interval between a certain operation timing and a next operation timing does not become short according to the progress of music. Meanwhile, when a time on music is associated with an operation timing, there are cases in which an interval between a certain operation timing and a next operation timing becomes short according to the progress of music. In this case, a moving time of an operation indication mark is short, and thus a moving velocity of an operation indication mark may be too fast to be appropriate for an indication of an operation timing.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0007">In this regard, it is an object of the present invention is to provide a game system and a control method used thereof, which are capable of preventing the moving velocity of the operation indication mark from becoming too fast.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0008">A game system according to a first embodiment of the present invention comprises: a display device that displays and outputs a game screen; an input device including a plurality of operating units; a sequence data storage device that stores sequence data in which an operation timing on each of the plurality of operating units during a game is described in association with information indicating any one of the plurality of operating units; a game region presenting device that causes a game region in which a plurality of operation reference portions respectively corresponding to the plurality of operating units are set apart from each other to be displayed on a screen of the display device; and a mark display control device that displays an operation indication mark for indicating an operation on the operating unit while moving the operation indication mark in the game region such that the operation indication mark arrives at an operation reference portion corresponding to an operating unit associated with an operation timing indicated by the sequence data at the operation timing, wherein the sequence data further includes display start information setting a display start timing of an operation indication mark corresponding to a next operation timing next to a certain operation timing to a timing earlier than the certain operation timing when a time interval between the certain operation timing and the next operation timing is less than a predetermined value, and the mark display control device starts to display an operation indication mark separate from the operation indication mark corresponding to the certain operation timing at the display start timing based on the sequence data as the operation indication mark corresponding to the next operation timing.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0009">According to the first embodiment of the present invention, when an interval between a certain operation timing and a next operation timing is less than a predetermined value, it is possible to start a display of an operation indication mark corresponding to the next operation timing at a timing earlier than the certain operation timing separately from an operation indication mark corresponding to the certain operation timing. Thus, when a time interval between operation timings is short, a plurality of operation indication marks are displayed before the certain operation timing, a moving time of an operation indication mark corresponding to the next operation timing having a short time interval increases to be larger than when an operation timing is indicated by only one operation indication mark. Thus, even when a time interval between operation timings is short, a moving velocity of an operation indication mark can be prevented from becoming too fast.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0010">In an aspect of the game system according to the first embodiment of the present invention, a timing matching a display start timing of an operation indication mark corresponding to an operation timing before the certain operation timing may be set to the display start information of the sequence data as the display start timing of the operation indication mark corresponding to the next operation timing. In this case, the operation indication mark corresponding to the operation timing next to the certain operation timing can start to be displayed at the same time as an operation indication mark corresponding to an operation timing before the certain operation timing. As a result, the moving time of the operation indication mark corresponding to the next operation timing can be sufficiently secured, and natural appearance of the operation indication mark can be rendered.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0011">Further, in an aspect of the game system according to the first embodiment of the present invention, in the display start information of the sequence data, in addition to the time interval between the certain operation timing and the next operation timing, when a time interval between the certain operation timing and a previous operation timing which is earlier than the certain operation timing is less than the predetermined value, all display start timings of operation indication marks respectively corresponding to three operation timings of the next operation timing, the certain operation timing, and the previous operation timing may be set to match a display start timing of the previous operation timing. In this case, it is possible to sufficiently secure the moving times of the operation indication marks corresponding to the certain operation timing and the next operation timing, and it is possible to display the operation indication marks at the same time as the operation indication mark corresponding to the previous operation timing, and thus, natural appearance of the operation indication marks can be rendered.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0012">Various input devices may be used as the input device. For example, in an aspect of the game system according to the first embodiment of the present invention, a touch panel arranged on the display device so as to cover the game region may be used as the input device.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0013">The game region may have various shapes. For example, in an aspect of a game system according to a first embodiment of the present invention, the game region presenting device may cause a region which is formed in the form of a quadrangle, and includes two operation reference portions extending in the form of a straight line which are set at both one ends of the quadrangle so as to face with each other to be displayed on the screen of the display device as the game region. In this case, for example, it is possible to actualize a game of a match-up type in which two players respectively corresponding to the operation reference portions at both ends of the quadrangle execute an operation at an appropriate timing based on an operation indication mark moving at an appropriate velocity.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0014">In an aspect of the game system according to the first embodiment of the present invention, the game system may further comprises an evaluating device that evaluates an operation in at least one operating unit based on a timing of an operation on the operating unit and an operation timing designated by the sequence data. In this case, a timing of an operation on each operating unit can be evaluated based on an operation timing described in the sequence data. Thus, amusement of the game can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0015">In an aspect of the game system according to the first embodiment of the present invention, the game system may further comprises: an audio output device that reproduces and outputs a sound; a music data storage device that stores music data used to reproduce music; and a music reproducing device that reproduces the music through the audio output device based on the music data, and wherein an operation timing of each of the plurality of operating units during reproduction of the music may be described in the sequence data. In this case, it is possible to actualize a music game in which the operation indication mark moves between the operation reference portions so as to arrive at the operation reference portion corresponding to the operation timing at the operation timing corresponding to a rhythm of music, and when an interval between the operation timings is short, a plurality of operation indication marks are displayed in advance so that the moving velocity of the operation indication mark does not become too fast.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0016">A control method of controlling a computer of the present invention is a control method of controlling a computer incorporated into a game system comprising: a display device that displays and outputs a game screen; an input device including a plurality of operating units; a sequence data storage device that stores sequence data in which an operation timing on each of the plurality of operating units during a game is described in association with information indicating any one of the plurality of operating units, wherein the control method of controlling the computer comprises the steps: a game region presenting step that causes a game region in which a plurality of operation reference portions respectively corresponding to the plurality of operating units are set apart from each other to be displayed on a screen of the display device; and a mark display control step that displays an operation indication mark for indicating an operation on the operating unit while moving the operation indication mark in the game region such that the operation indication mark arrives at an operation reference portion corresponding to an operating unit associated with an operation timing indicated by the sequence data at the operation timing, wherein the sequence data further includes display start information setting a display start timing of an operation indication mark corresponding to a next operation timing next to a certain operation timing to a timing earlier than the certain operation timing when a time interval between the certain operation timing and the next operation timing is less than a predetermined value, and the mark display control step further includes a step that starts to display an operation indication mark separate from the operation indication mark corresponding to the certain operation timing at the display start timing based on the sequence data as the operation indication mark corresponding to the next operation timing. It is possible to actualize a game system of the present invention by executing the control method of controlling a computer of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0017">A game system according to a second embodiment of the present invention comprises: a display device that displays and outputs a game screen; an input device including at least one operating unit; a sequence data storage device that stores sequence data in which an reference timing during a game is described; a game region presenting device that causes a game region in which a plurality of reference portions are set apart from each other to be displayed on the game screen of the display device; and a mark display control device that displays an operation indication mark for indicating an operation on the operating unit while moving the operation indication mark in the game region such that the operation indication mark arrives at at least one reference portion among the reference portions at a reference timing designated by the sequence data, wherein the sequence data further includes display start information setting a display start timing of an operation indication mark corresponding to a next reference timing next to a certain reference timing to a timing earlier than the certain reference timing when a time interval between the certain reference timing and the next reference timing is less than a predetermined value, and the mark display control device starts to display an operation indication mark separate from the operation indication mark corresponding to the certain reference timing at the display start timing based on the sequence data as the operation indication mark corresponding to the next reference timing.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0018">According to the second embodiment of the present invention, in a game in which the operation indication mark arrives at at least one reference portion at the reference timing described in the sequence data, the moving velocity of the operation indication mark can be prevented from becoming too fast. In this game, it is preferable that one operating unit be operated in tune with an arrival at one reference portion, and thus this game can be played by a single player. In other words, according to this embodiment, a game that can prevent a moving velocity of an operation indication mark from becoming too fast and be used in a one-player game can be actualized.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0019">As described above, according to the present invention, it is possible to prevent the moving velocity of the operation indication mark from becoming too fast.</p>

The display control unit <b>12</b> causes a predetermined image to be displayed on the monitor <b>3</b> by rendering an image corresponding to image data provided from the game control unit <b>11</b> in a frame buffer and then outputting a video signal corresponding to the rendered image to the monitor <b>3</b>. The audio output control unit <b>13</b> causes a predetermined sound (including music or the like) to be reproduced from a speaker <b>14</b> by generating an audio reproduction signal corresponding to audio reproduction data provided from the game control unit <b>11</b> and then outputting the generated audio reproduction signal to the speaker <b>14</b> serving as an audio output device connected to the control unit <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0046">The game control unit <b>11</b> is connected with an external storage device <b>20</b>. As the external storage device <b>20</b>, there is used a storage medium in which data remains stored even when power is not supplied such as an optical storage medium including a digital versatile disc-read only memory (DVD-ROM) and a compact disc-read only memory (CD-ROM) or the like, or a non-volatile semiconductor memory device including an electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0047">A game program <b>21</b> and game data <b>22</b> are stored in the external storage device <b>20</b>. The game program <b>21</b> is a computer program necessary for the game machine <b>1</b> to execute a music game according to a predetermined procedure, and includes a sequence control module <b>23</b> and an evaluating module <b>24</b> in order to actualize a function according to the present invention. When the game machine <b>1</b> is activated, the game control unit <b>11</b> executes various kinds of initial settings necessary to operate as the game machine <b>1</b> by executing an operation program stored in an internal storage device thereof, and then sets an environment in which a music game is executed according to the game program <b>21</b> by reading the game program <b>21</b> and then executing the game program <b>21</b> from the external storage device <b>20</b>. When the sequence control module <b>23</b> of the game program <b>21</b> is executed by the game control unit <b>11</b>, a sequence processing unit <b>15</b> is generated in the game control unit <b>11</b>. Further, when the evaluating module <b>24</b> of the game program <b>21</b> is executed by the game control unit <b>11</b>, an operation evaluating unit <b>16</b> is generated in the game control unit <b>11</b>. The sequence processing unit <b>15</b> and the operation evaluating unit <b>16</b> are logical devices actualized by a combination of computer hardware and a computer program. The sequence processing unit <b>15</b> executes music game processes such as a process of instructing the player to make an operation in tune with reproduction of music (musical composition) selected by the player and generating a sound effect in response to the player's operation. The operation evaluating unit <b>16</b> executes processes such that a process of evaluating the player's operation and then controlling a game based on an evaluation result. Incidentally, the game program <b>21</b> includes various kinds of program modules necessary to execute a music game in addition to the modules <b>23</b> and <b>24</b>, and logical devices corresponding to the modules are generated in the game control unit <b>11</b> although not illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0048">The game data <b>22</b> includes various pieces of data to be referred to when a music game is executed according to the game program <b>21</b>. For example, the game data <b>22</b> includes music data <b>25</b>, sound effect data <b>26</b>, and the image data <b>27</b>. The music data <b>25</b> is data necessary to cause a piece of music which is a target of a game to be reproduced and output from the speaker <b>14</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a single kind of music data <b>25</b>, but the player can actually select a piece of music to be played from among a plurality of pieces of music. In the game data <b>22</b>, one or more pieces of the music data <b>25</b> are recorded in association with information identifying each piece of music. The sound effect data <b>26</b> is data in which each of one or more types of sound effects to be output from the speaker <b>14</b> in response to the player's operation is recorded in association with a unique code for each of the sound effects. Sounds of musical instruments and various kinds of sounds are included as the sound effect. Pieces of sound effect data which are equal in number to a predetermined octave number and have different musical pitches according to a kind may be prepared. The image data <b>27</b> is data used to cause a background image, various kinds of objects or icons, and the like in a game screen to be displayed on the monitor <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0049">The game data <b>22</b> further includes sequence data <b>28</b>. The sequence data <b>28</b> is data used to define an operation to be indicated to the player. At least a piece of sequence data <b>28</b> is prepared for a single music data. The details of the sequence data <b>28</b> will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0050">Next, an outline of a music game executed by the game machine <b>1</b> will be described. The game machine <b>1</b> is configured as a music game machine of a match-up type which competes for a result by operation timings of two players (including a case in which the game machine <b>1</b> functions as the other player) when the two players execute an operation in tune with music. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates only one game machine, but the game may be played through a plurality of game machines <b>1</b> connected to share a game situation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram schematically illustrating a game screen. The game screen <b>50</b> includes a game region <b>52</b> for guiding operation timing to the player and an information region <b>53</b> for displaying a score and the like of each player. The game region <b>52</b> has a rectangular shape. A first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A and a second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B serving as an operation reference portion are arranged so as to face each other on both ends of the game region <b>52</b> in a longitudinal direction. Each of the operation reference portions <b>55</b>A and <b>55</b>B extends in the form of a straight line in a direction orthogonal to the longitudinal direction of the game region <b>52</b>. Each of the operation reference portions <b>55</b>A and <b>55</b>B is used as a reference of a current time on the game by the player of the game. Specifically, the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A is used as a reference of a current time of a first player, and the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B is used as a reference of a current time of a second player. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a red straight line is used as the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A, and a blue straight line is used as the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B, and different colors for each player are used for identifying each player. Further, the information region <b>53</b> is arranged around the game region <b>52</b>. One end side of the game region <b>52</b> in the longitudinal direction is used for displaying a score and like of one player, and the other end side thereof is used for displaying a score and the lie of the other player.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0051">Each of the operation reference portions <b>55</b>A and <b>55</b>B includes a plurality of rebounding points arranged at predetermined intervals. The plurality of rebounding points R<b>1</b> included in the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A are connected with rebounding points R<b>2</b> included in the second operation reference portion through a plurality of paths W. In other words, provided is a plurality of paths W that reach from one rebounding point R<b>1</b> included in the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A to a plurality of rebounding points R<b>2</b> included in the second operation reference portion. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, as examples of the plurality of paths W connecting the rebounding point R<b>1</b> with the rebounding point R<b>2</b>, five paths W<b>1</b>, W<b>2</b>, W<b>3</b>, W<b>4</b>, and W<b>5</b> extending from the rebounding point R<b>1</b> are denoted by dashed lines. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, any one rebounding point R<b>1</b> of the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A has the five paths W<b>1</b>, W<b>2</b>, W<b>3</b>, W<b>4</b>, and W<b>5</b> that extend to the five rebounding points R<b>2</b> included in the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B. During execution of the music game, that is, during the progress of reproduction of music, an object <b>60</b> serving as the operation indication mark indicating an operation is displayed on the path W connecting the rebounding point R<b>1</b> with the rebounding point R<b>2</b> according to the sequence data <b>28</b>. Incidentally, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, for convenience of description, the paths W<b>1</b>, W<b>2</b>, W<b>3</b>, W<b>4</b>, and W<b>5</b> are denoted by the dashed lines, but none of the plurality of paths W is displayed on the actual game screen <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0052">The object <b>60</b> appears at the rebounding point R<b>1</b> or the rebounding point R<b>2</b> at an appropriate timing in music, and then moves along the path W extending from the rebounding point R<b>1</b> or R<b>2</b> from one of the rebounding points R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> at the appearance position toward the other of the rebounding points R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> positioned at the opposite side according to the progress of the music. Then, the rebounding point R<b>1</b> or R<b>2</b> at which the object <b>60</b> has arrived serves as an appearance position of a next object <b>60</b>, and the next object <b>60</b> moves from the appearance position toward the rebounding point R<b>1</b> or R<b>2</b> positioned at the opposite side. For this reason, the object <b>60</b> alternately rebounds from the rebounding points R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> and repeatedly moves between the operation reference portions <b>55</b>A and <b>55</b>B. Further, each player using the operation reference portion <b>55</b>A or <b>55</b>B at which the object <b>60</b> has arrived as the reference of the current time is required to perform a touch operation of touching the position of the operation reference portion <b>55</b>A or <b>55</b>B at which the object <b>60</b> has arrived in tune with an arrival of the object <b>60</b> at the operation reference portion <b>55</b>A or <b>55</b>B. When each player performs the touch operation, a time difference between a time when the object <b>60</b> matches each of the operation reference portions <b>55</b>A and <b>55</b>B and a time when each player has performed the touch operation is detected. The smaller the time difference is, the higher an operation of the player is evaluated. Further, a sound effect is reproduced from the speaker <b>14</b> in response to the touch operation. A well-known method may be used as the method of reproducing the sound effect. For example, as the well-known method of reproducing a sound effect, there exists a method of adding a sound effect from music while reproducing the music and a method of reproducing a sound effect corresponding to a misoperation while muting the music when missed. Further, for example, there also exists a method in which when music is divided in parts, each part is assigned to each operation timing, and an appropriate operation is executed, a part of the music assigned to a corresponding operation timing is played back (a method of forming the music by an appropriate operation at each operation timing. For this reason, when a misoperation is made, a part of the music to which the operation timing is assigned is not reproduced).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0053">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the object <b>60</b> moves toward the rebounding point R<b>2</b> of the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B along the path W<b>2</b>. At this time, it is preferable that the second player using the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B as the reference of the current time performs the touch operation at the position of the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B at which the object <b>60</b> arrives in tune with an arrival at the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B. Further, the object <b>60</b> is displayed in color corresponding to the operation reference portion <b>55</b>A or <b>55</b>B of a destination toward which the object <b>60</b> is currently moving. In other words, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the object <b>60</b> is displayed in blue until arriving at the rebounding point R<b>2</b> of the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B, and a next object <b>60</b> appearing at the rebounding point R<b>2</b> at the arrival position is displayed in red. In this embodiment, a plurality of operating units are configured by a combination of each of the operation reference portions <b>55</b>A and <b>55</b>B on the monitor <b>3</b> and the touch panel <b>5</b> superimposed thereon. Incidentally, in the following, each of the operation reference portions <b>55</b>A and <b>55</b>B may be used as a term representing the operating unit.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0054">The path W along which the object <b>60</b> moves from one of the rebounding points R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> at the arrival position to the other of the rebounding points R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> at the opposite side is decided according to the position of the object <b>60</b> when the operation reference portion <b>55</b>A or <b>55</b>B is touched. In order to make a comparison of position easy, the object <b>60</b> is divided into a plurality of regions. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagram for describing regions of the object <b>60</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, dashed lines represent the paths W<b>2</b>, W<b>3</b>, and W<b>4</b>, and an alternate long and short dash line <b>62</b> represents the boundary between the regions. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the object <b>60</b> is divided into four regions, that is, a contact region S near a contact point at which the object <b>60</b> first comes in contact with the operation reference portion <b>55</b>A or <b>55</b>B, right and left regions R and L that establish the boundary of the contact region S, and the remaining region O. And, as a path along which the object <b>60</b> moves, from among the paths W reaching to the rebounding point R<b>1</b> from the rebounding point R<b>2</b>, the straight line path W<b>3</b> reaching to R<b>1</b> at the shortest distance is selected when the contact region S or the remaining region O is touched, the first right path W<b>4</b> reaching to R<b>1</b> through a right side wall <b>52</b>R of the game region <b>52</b> in the longitudinal direction is selected when the left region L is touched, and the first left path W<b>2</b> reaching to R<b>1</b> through a left side wall <b>52</b>L of the game region <b>52</b> in the longitudinal direction is selected when the right region R is touched. In other words, the moving path used when the object <b>60</b> moves to the operation reference portion <b>55</b>A or <b>55</b>B of the next destination is decided according to a positional relation between an operation position of the touch operation and the position of the object <b>60</b>. Since the moving distance differs according to the moving path, the moving distance along which the object <b>60</b> moves to the operation reference portion <b>55</b>A or <b>55</b>B of the next destination differs according to the positional relation between the operation position and the position of the object <b>60</b>. Meanwhile, an operation timing to touch the object <b>60</b>, that is, a timing at which the object <b>60</b> arrives at each of the operation reference portions <b>55</b>A and <b>55</b>B is constant regardless of the moving path. For this reason, the moving velocity of the object <b>60</b> differs according to the moving path. In other words, the path W and the moving velocity of the object <b>60</b> that moves toward one player change according to the other player's touch operation. Since this changes a difficulty level of a game, and each player executes his/her operation while being conscious of influence on the other player. An example in which the second right path W<b>5</b> and the second left path W<b>1</b> are selected will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0055">As described above, the object <b>60</b> moves between the operation reference portions <b>55</b>A and <b>55</b>B, that is, between players in order to indicate each player's operation. However, depending on music, there are cases in which an interval between one player's operation and the other player's operation is short as a matter of a performance interval. An example of this case will be described using &#x201c;tan&#x201d; representing a crotchet and &#x201c;ta&#x201d; representing a quaver. For example, let us assume that music is performed in order of &#x201c;tan,&#x201d; &#x201c;tan,&#x201d; &#x201c;ta,&#x201d; &#x201c;ta,&#x201d; and &#x201c;tan.&#x201d; In this case, &#x201c;ta&#x201d; representing a quaver is shorter in the performance interval than &#x201c;tan&#x201d; representing a crotchet. Thus, when this performance is alternately executed on the operation reference portions (it is assumed that two operation reference portions B and A are provided), for example, when the performance is executed in order of B(tan)&#x2192;A(tan)&#x2192;B(ta)&#x2192;A(ta)&#x2192;B(tan), the moving velocity of the object <b>60</b> indicating B(ta)&#x2192;A(ta) is twice as fast as the moving velocity of the object <b>60</b> indicating B(tan)&#x2192;A(tan). When the short interval like this is guided only by one object <b>60</b>, there may be generated a inappropriate guidance such as a case that the moving velocity of the object <b>60</b> moving between the operation reference portions <b>55</b>A and <b>55</b>B becomes too fast for the player to recognize. In order to prevent the inappropriate guidance like this, when an interval between one player's operation and the other player's operation is shorter than a predetermined value, the number of objects <b>60</b> to be displayed is increased to two at an immediately previous operation timing of one player at which the short interval occurs. Of the two objects <b>60</b>, one object <b>60</b> moves toward the other player in order to guide a next operation timing, and the other object <b>60</b> moves toward the other player more slowly than one object <b>60</b> in order to guide an operation timing at which the other player is to make an operation after the other player's next operation, that is, an operation timing of the short interval that may occur after one player's operation when only one object <b>60</b> is used.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0056">For example, an example in which a moving time from the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B (B in the above music example) to the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A (A in the above music example) is shorter than a predetermined value (when &#x201c;ta&#x201d; is indicated) will be described. In this case, two objects <b>60</b> appear at an appearance position of an object <b>60</b> of second previous movement (B(tan)&#x2192;A(tan) in the above music example) at which movement (B(ta)&#x2192;A(ta) in the above music example) shorter than the predetermined value occurs, that is, at the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B (B in the above music example) at which second previous movement starts. Then, one object <b>60</b> moves toward the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A in order to indicate a next operation timing (A(tan) in the above music example), and the other object <b>60</b> moves toward the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A in order to indicate an operation timing (A(ta) in the above music example) after a next operation timing (A(tan) in the above music example). In other words, one object <b>60</b> moves to indicate a next operation timing (A(tan) in the above music example), and the other object <b>60</b> moves to indicate a thirdly subsequent operation timing (A(ta) by movement of B(ta)&#x2192;A(ta) in the above music example) having an interval shorter than the predetermined value when only one object <b>60</b> is used. That is, when a time interval between a certain operation timing (B(ta) in the above music example) and a next operation timing (A(ta) in the above music example) is shorter than the predetermined value, the number of objects <b>60</b> to be displayed is increased to two at a timing (B(tan) of B(tan)&#x2192;A(tan) in the above music example) at which an object <b>60</b> corresponding to an operation timing (A(tan) of B(tan)&#x2192;A(tan) in the above music example) before the certain operation timing having the short time interval therefrom starts to be displayed, one object moves to indicate a nearest operation timing (an operation timing before the certain operation timing, that is, A(tan) in the above music example), and the other object moves to indicate the operation timing (the operation timing subsequent to the certain operation timing, that is, A(ta) in the above music example) having the short time interval therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> schematically illustrates a game screen of a state in which the number of objects <b>60</b> is increased. The example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a state in which the object <b>60</b> arrives at the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B, and thereafter the number of objects increases such that the object is divided into two, that is, a first object <b>60</b><i>a </i>and a second object <b>60</b><i>b</i>. Further, the path W is selected such that the first object <b>60</b><i>a </i>and the second object <b>60</b><i>b </i>move along different paths W. The example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a case in which the right region R of the object <b>60</b> is touched on the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B. In this example, one first object <b>60</b><i>a </i>moves along the first left path W<b>2</b> corresponding to the touched right region R, and the other second object <b>60</b><i>b </i>shares the path halfway with the first left path W<b>2</b> and then moves along the second left path W<b>1</b> having the different rebounding point R<b>1</b>. Further, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when the left region L of the object <b>60</b> is touched, one first object <b>60</b><i>a </i>moves along the first right path W<b>4</b>, and the other second object <b>60</b><i>b </i>shares the path halfway with the first right path W<b>4</b> and then moves along the second right path W<b>5</b> having the different rebounding point R<b>1</b>. In other words, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the second left path W<b>1</b> and the second right path W<b>5</b> are set as paths of the second object <b>60</b><i>b </i>when the number of objects <b>60</b> is increased to two. Meanwhile, when the contact region S or the remaining region O is touched, the second object <b>60</b><i>b </i>moves along the straight line path W<b>3</b> which is the same as the path of the first object <b>60</b><i>a</i>. Incidentally, the present invention is not limited to the embodiment in which the second left path W<b>1</b> and the second right path W<b>5</b> are set as the paths for the second object <b>60</b><i>b</i>. For example, the paths W<b>1</b> and W<b>5</b> may be shared between the first object <b>60</b><i>a </i>and the object <b>60</b>. Further, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, one object <b>60</b><i>a </i>and the other object <b>60</b><i>b </i>move along the paths W different from each other based on a previously set rule, but various relations may be established between a moving path of one object <b>60</b><i>a </i>and a moving path of the other object <b>60</b><i>b</i>. For example, unlike the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the other object <b>60</b><i>b </i>may move along the first right path W<b>4</b> which is opposite to the path of one object <b>60</b><i>a </i>or may move along the first left path W<b>2</b> which is the same as the path of one object <b>60</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> schematically illustrates a game screen of a state in which a predetermined time has elapsed from the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, of the objects <b>60</b><i>a </i>and <b>60</b><i>b</i>, one first object <b>60</b><i>a </i>arrives at the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A, then newly moves toward the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B, and so is positioned immediately before arriving at the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B, whereas the other the second object <b>60</b><i>b </i>is positioned immediately before arriving at the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the distance from the first object <b>60</b><i>a </i>rebounded at the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A to the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B is shorter than the distance from the second object <b>60</b><i>b </i>to the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A. Further, the first object <b>60</b><i>a </i>is faster in the moving velocity than the second object <b>60</b><i>b</i>. For this reason, the first object <b>60</b><i>a </i>first arrives at the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B, and thereafter the second object <b>60</b><i>b </i>arrives at the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A soon. When these operation timings are indicated by only one object <b>60</b>, the object <b>60</b> needs to move from the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B to the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A positioned at the opposite side in a short time immediately after arriving at the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B. However, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the object <b>60</b> does not move in a short time, and instead, the second object <b>60</b><i>b </i>is used to cause an arrival of the second object <b>60</b><i>b </i>to the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A to be anticipated, that is, to cause an indication of an operation timing to the first player to be anticipated. Incidentally, the rebounding point R<b>1</b> or R<b>2</b> at which the object <b>60</b><i>a </i>or <b>60</b><i>b </i>has arrived is not necessarily used as the appearance position of the next object <b>60</b><i>a </i>or <b>60</b><i>b</i>. For example, in order to restore the state in which an operation timing is guided by a single object <b>60</b>, the first object <b>60</b><i>a </i>or the second object <b>60</b><i>b </i>may disappear upon arriving at the operation reference portion <b>55</b>A or <b>55</b>B. Further, depending on the performance interval, the rebounding point R<b>1</b> or R<b>2</b> at which the object <b>60</b><i>a </i>or <b>60</b><i>b </i>has arrived may be used as the appearance position of the next object <b>60</b><i>a </i>or <b>60</b><i>b</i>, so that the state in which the two objects <b>60</b> are displayed may be continued, or a third object <b>60</b> or a fourth object <b>60</b> may appear at the rebounding point R<b>1</b> or R<b>2</b> at which the object <b>60</b><i>a </i>or <b>60</b><i>b </i>has arrived.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a diagram schematically illustrating a game screen of a state in which the number of objects <b>60</b> is further increased. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, after the first object <b>60</b><i>a </i>arrives at the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A, a third object <b>60</b><i>c </i>is additionally displayed at the arrival position, and thus a total of three objects <b>60</b> are displayed on the game region <b>52</b>. The third object <b>60</b><i>c </i>moves toward the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B at the velocity slower than the first object <b>60</b><i>a</i>, and guides an operation timing to the second player when the performance interval is short, similarly to the second object <b>60</b><i>b </i>in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Incidentally, the second object <b>60</b><i>b </i>need not necessarily arrive at the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A between the arrival of the first object <b>60</b><i>a </i>at the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B and the arrival of the third object <b>60</b><i>c </i>at the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B so that an operation timing is alternately guided to each player. In other words, the first object <b>60</b><i>a </i>and the third object <b>60</b><i>c </i>may consecutively arrive at the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B and consecutively indicate operation timings to the second player. In the following, when the objects <b>60</b><i>a </i>to <b>60</b><i>c </i>need not be distinguished from one another, the objects <b>60</b><i>a </i>to <b>60</b><i>c </i>are described as the object <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0060">Next, the details of the sequence data <b>28</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The sequence data <b>28</b> includes a condition definition portion <b>28</b><i>a </i>and an operation sequence portion <b>28</b><i>b </i>as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The condition definition portion <b>28</b><i>a </i>includes information designating an execution condition of a game that differs according to the music such as information designating the tempo, a beat, a track of music, and a sound effect to be generated when the touch operation is performed on the object <b>60</b>. Incidentally, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the condition definition portion <b>28</b><i>a </i>is included only in the head portion of the sequence data <b>28</b>, but the condition definition portion <b>28</b><i>a </i>may be added to an appropriate intermediate position of the operation sequence portion <b>28</b><i>b</i>. Thus, processing of changing the tempo of the music, an assignment of a sound effect, or the like can be actualized.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0061">Meanwhile, in the operation sequence portion <b>28</b><i>b</i>, a timing to touch the object <b>60</b>, a display start timing, and information indicating a player (or each of the operation reference portions <b>55</b>A and <b>55</b>B) are described in association with one another for each object <b>60</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of content of the sequence data. As partially illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the operation sequence portion <b>28</b><i>b </i>includes an operation timing portion <b>28</b><i>c </i>that indicates a timing (operation timing) to make an operation in the music, a display start information portion <b>28</b><i>d </i>used to set a display start timing to start a display of the object <b>60</b>, a display position indication portion <b>28</b><i>e </i>that indicates a player (or each of the operation reference portions <b>55</b>A and <b>55</b>B) in which the object <b>60</b> starts to be displayed, and a mark information portion <b>28</b><i>f </i>indicating the object <b>60</b> to be displayed. And, the operation sequence portion <b>28</b><i>b </i>is configured as a set of a plurality of records in which an operation timing to perform an operation in the music, a display start timing of the object <b>60</b>, and a player (or each of the operation reference portions <b>55</b>A and <b>55</b>B) in which the object <b>60</b> starts to be displayed are described in association with one another for each object <b>60</b> to be displayed. The operation timing and the display start timing are described such that a bar number in the music, a beat number, and a value representing a time in a beat are separated by a comma. The time in a beat refers to an elapsed time from the head of one beat, and is represented by the number of units, from the head of the beat, obtained by equally dividing the length of one beat into n unit times. For example, when a time in which n is 100, and &#xbc; elapses from the head of the second beat in the second beat of the first bar of music is designated as an operation timing or a display start timing, &#x201c;01,2,025&#x201d; is described.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0062">The operation timing portion <b>28</b><i>c </i>includes an operation timing in which a time interval between a certain operation timing and a next operation timing subsequent to the certain operation timing is less than a predetermined value. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a certain operation timing <b>28</b><i>cs </i>corresponding to the certain operation timing, a previous operation timing <b>28</b><i>cf </i>prior to the certain operation timing <b>28</b><i>cs</i>, and a next operation timing <b>28</b><i>cr </i>corresponding to the next operation timing as an operation timing subsequent to the certain operation timing <b>28</b><i>cs </i>are surrounded by dashed lines. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a timing matching a display start timing set to the previous operation timing <b>28</b><i>cf </i>is set to a display start timing of the next operation timing <b>28</b><i>cr</i>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an operation timing corresponding to the first object <b>60</b><i>a </i>corresponds to the previous operation timing <b>28</b><i>cf</i>, and an operation timing corresponding to the second object <b>60</b><i>b </i>corresponds to the next operation timing <b>28</b><i>cr</i>. Further, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an operation timing corresponding to the first object <b>60</b><i>a </i>corresponds to the certain operation timing <b>28</b><i>cs</i>. The next operation timing <b>28</b><i>cr</i>, the previous operation timing <b>28</b><i>cf</i>, and the certain operation timing <b>28</b><i>cs </i>are associated with information indicating different objects <b>60</b> from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0063">A player in which the object <b>60</b> starts to be displayed is described as &#x201c;P<b>1</b>&#x201d; when a first player is indicated, or is described as &#x201c;P<b>2</b>&#x201d; when a second player is indicated. Incidentally, the indication of the player corresponds to a indication of the color of the object <b>60</b> to be displayed. For example, a blue object <b>60</b> is displayed when the indication of the player is &#x201c;P<b>1</b>&#x201d;, and a red object <b>60</b> is displayed when the indication of the player is &#x201c;P<b>2</b>.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0064">In the mark information portion <b>28</b><i>f</i>, for example, information indicating the object <b>60</b> to be displayed is described by a letter such as &#x201c;A&#x201d;. &#x201c;A&#x201d; is used as a letter corresponding to a first object <b>60</b> to be displayed on the game region <b>52</b>, &#x201c;B&#x201d; is used as a letter corresponding to a second object <b>60</b>, and &#x201c;C&#x201d; is used as a letter corresponding to a third object <b>60</b>. In other words, various kinds of letters according to the number of objects <b>60</b> to be displayed on the game region <b>52</b> are used as the information indicating the object <b>60</b> to be displayed. In the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 to 7</figref>, &#x201c;A&#x201d; is described when the object <b>60</b> or a first object <b>60</b><i>a </i>is indicated, &#x201c;B&#x201d; is described when a second object <b>60</b><i>b </i>displayed on the screen is indicated, and &#x201c;C&#x201d; is described when a third object <b>60</b><i>c </i>is indicated. Further, the information indicating the object <b>60</b> represents a correspondence relation between operation timings. Specifically, between operation timings associated with information indicating a common object <b>60</b>, the position at which the object <b>60</b> corresponding to a certain operation timing arrives functions as an appearance position of the object <b>60</b> corresponding to another operation timing to which a display start timing closest (or equal) to the certain operation timing is set. Incidentally, when a plurality of records designating the same operation timing are present, the appearance position of the object <b>60</b> (the object <b>60</b> which will appear next) corresponding to another operation timing may be specified by specifying any one of records designating the same operation timing such as a record which is earlier in a display start timing or a record which is earlier in describing order in which the sequence data <b>28</b> is described, based on a predetermined specifying condition or the like. Further, information associating the arrival position of each object <b>60</b> with the appearance position such as information of an object <b>60</b> serving as a division source may be separately described in the sequence data.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0065">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a display start timing, an operation timing, and an operation reference portion at which an object <b>60</b> starts to be displayed are indicated such that a blue object <b>60</b> is displayed on the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A which is used by the first player as the reference at a start point in time (000) of a fourth beat of a first bar, and the blue object <b>60</b> moves along the path W from the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A so as to arrives at the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B at a timing in which &#x201c;010&#x201d; elapses from the start point in time of the fourth beat of the first bar. Further, a red object <b>60</b> is displayed at a timing in which &#x201c;010&#x201d; elapses from the start point in time of the fourth beat of the first bar using the rebounding point R<b>2</b> at which the object <b>60</b> arrives as the appearance position, and then the object <b>60</b> moves from the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B along the path W corresponding to the player's touch operation position so as to arrive at the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A at a timing in which &#x201c;016&#x201d; elapses from the start point in time of the fourth beat of the first bar. Furthermore, a red first object <b>60</b><i>a </i>corresponding to the previous operation timing <b>28</b><i>cf </i>and a red second object <b>60</b><i>b </i>corresponding to the next operation timing <b>28</b><i>cr </i>appear at the rebounding point R<b>2</b> of the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B, used as a reference by the second player, at which the object <b>60</b> arrives shortly before at a timing in which &#x201c;024&#x201d; elapses from a start point in time of a second beat of a second bar, the first object <b>60</b><i>a </i>moves along the path W so as to arrive at the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A at a timing in which &#x201c;030&#x201d; elapses from the start point in time of the second beat of the second bar, and the second object <b>60</b><i>b </i>moves along the path W so as to arrive at the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A at a timing in which &#x201c;036&#x201d; elapses from the start point in time of the second beat of the second bar.

<p id="p-0065" num="0066">Next, processing of the game control unit <b>11</b> when a music game is executed by the game machine <b>1</b> will be described. The game control unit <b>11</b> reads the game program <b>21</b>, performs an initial setting necessary to execute a music game, and then enters a standby state to receive a game start instruction from a player. For example, the game start instruction includes an operation specifying data used in the game such as selection of music to be played in the game or a difficulty level. A procedure receiving the instruction may be the same as in a known game.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0067">When a game start is instructed, the game control unit <b>11</b> reads the music data <b>25</b> corresponding to the music selected by the player and outputs the read music data <b>25</b> to the audio output control unit <b>13</b>, and thereby the music starts to be reproduced through the speaker <b>14</b>. Through this operation, the control unit <b>10</b> functions as a music reproducing device. Further, the game control unit <b>11</b> causes the game region <b>52</b> and the information region <b>53</b> to be displayed on the monitor <b>3</b> by reading the sequence data <b>28</b> corresponding to the player's selection in synchronization with reproduction of the of music, generating image data necessary to draw the game region <b>52</b> and the information region <b>53</b> with reference to the image data <b>27</b>, and outputting the generated image data to the display control unit <b>12</b>. Furthermore, as processes necessary to display the game region <b>52</b> or the like during execution of the music game, the game control unit <b>11</b> repeatedly executes a sequence process routine illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a path decision process routine illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, and an operation evaluation routine illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> at a predetermined period. Incidentally, the sequence processing unit <b>15</b> undertakes the routines of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, and the operation evaluating unit <b>16</b> undertakes the operation evaluation routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates an example of a flowchart of the sequence process routine executed by the sequence processing unit <b>15</b>. When the routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> starts, in step S<b>1</b>, the sequence processing unit <b>15</b> of the game control unit <b>11</b> first acquires a current time in the music. For example, clocking is started, by an internal clock of the game control unit <b>11</b>, from a reproduction start point in time of the music, and the current time is acquired based on a value of the internal clock. Next, in step S<b>2</b>, the sequence processing unit <b>15</b> acquires data of a display start timing which is present within a time length corresponding to a display range of the game region <b>52</b> and data of an operation timing from the sequence data <b>28</b>. For example, the display range is set to a time range of about two bars of the music from the current time to the future.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0069">Next, in step S<b>3</b>, paths W of all objects <b>60</b> to be displayed in association with each acquired operation timing are decided. For example, this decision is actualized by executing the routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates an example of a flowchart of the path decision process routine executed by the sequence processing unit <b>15</b>. When the routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> starts, in step S<b>11</b>, the sequence processing unit <b>15</b> first determines whether or not this is a game start time. When a positive determination is made in step S<b>11</b>, the process proceeds to step S<b>20</b>, but when a negative determination is made, the process proceeds to step S<b>12</b>. In step S<b>20</b>, a previously set initial path is selected as a path to display the object <b>60</b>, and then the process proceeds to step S<b>19</b>. For example, the path W<b>3</b> extending from the rebounding point R<b>1</b> that is included in the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A and is at an n-th position from the left side is previously set as the initial path.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0070">Meanwhile, in step S<b>12</b>, it is determined whether or not a display of the object <b>60</b> is a display at a display start timing. When a negative determination is made in step S<b>12</b>, that is, when it is determined that a display of the object <b>60</b> is not a display at a display start timing and a path to be displayed has been already selected, the process proceeds to step S<b>21</b>. In step S<b>21</b>, a previously selected path as a path to be displayed, that is, a current path is selected, and the process proceeds to step S<b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0071">In contrast, when a positive determination is made in step S<b>12</b>, that is, when it is determined that a display of the object <b>60</b> is a display at a display start timing and a path to be displayed has not been selected, the process proceeds to step S<b>13</b>. In step S<b>13</b>, it is determined whether or not the touch operation has been performed on the operation reference portion <b>55</b>A or <b>55</b>B with reference to an output signal of the touch panel <b>5</b>. When a negative determination is made in step S<b>13</b>, the process proceeds to step S<b>22</b>, but when a positive determination is made, the process proceeds to step S<b>14</b>. In step S<b>22</b>, a predetermined path is selected as the path to display the object <b>60</b>, and the process proceeds to step S<b>19</b>. For example, the selection of the predetermined path in step S<b>22</b> is actualized such that a path adjacent to a path on which the object <b>60</b> corresponding to the object <b>60</b> that starts to be displayed, that is, the object <b>60</b> that has immediately previously arrived at the rebounding point R<b>1</b> or R<b>2</b> used as the appearance position of the object <b>60</b> that starts to be displayed has been displayed or a path which is at the shortest distance from the appearance position toward the operation reference portion <b>55</b>A or <b>55</b>B to arrive is set as the predetermined path.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0072">Meanwhile, in step S<b>14</b>, an operation reference portion on which the touch operation has been performed and a timing (a time in the music) at which the touch operation has been performed are determined based on a signal output from the touch panel <b>5</b>. Next, in step S<b>15</b>, a nearest operation timing described in the sequence data <b>28</b> with respect to the operation reference portion on which the touch operation has been performed, that is, an operation timing which is closest in time and associated in the sequence data <b>28</b> with respect to the object <b>60</b> on which the touch operation has been performed is specified, and a time difference between the operation timing and a time at which the touch operation has been performed is acquired.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0073">Next, in step S<b>16</b>, the sequence processing unit <b>15</b> determines whether or not each player's operation is appropriate by determining whether or not the time difference is within a predetermined range. A predetermined time range around an operation timing of a comparison target is set as the predetermined range. When a negative determination is made in step S<b>16</b>, the process proceeds to step S<b>22</b>. In step S<b>22</b>, a predetermined path is selected as the path to display the object <b>60</b> as described above, and then the process proceeds to step S<b>19</b>. In contrast, when a positive determination is made in step S<b>16</b>, the process proceeds to step S<b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0074">Next, in step S<b>17</b>, the positional relation between the operation position at which the touch operation has been performed on the operation reference portion <b>55</b>A or <b>55</b>B and the position of the object <b>60</b> is determined based on a signal output from the touch panel <b>5</b>. Specifically, any one of the contact region S, the right region R, the left region L, and the remaining region of the object <b>60</b> that has most recently arrived at the appearance position is determined as the touch position of the object <b>60</b>. Next, in step S<b>18</b>, the sequence processing unit <b>15</b> selects a path to arrange the object <b>60</b> according to the positional relation determined in step S<b>17</b>. For example, the selection of the path is performed as follows. First, any one of the right region R, the left region L, the contact region S, and the remaining region O is assigned to each path W (incidentally, when there is a path used when the number of the objects <b>60</b> increases such as the second left path W<b>1</b> or the second right path W<b>5</b> of the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, this path may be excluded). Next, a path assigned to the touch position is selected from among a plurality of paths W extending from the appearance position based on the determination result in step S<b>17</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in the rebounding point R<b>1</b>, the straight line path W<b>3</b> is assigned to the contact region S and the remaining region O, the first right path W<b>4</b> is assigned to the left region L, and the first left path W<b>2</b> is assigned to the right region R. Thus, the straight line path W<b>3</b> is selected when the contact region S or the remaining region O of the object <b>60</b> is touched, the first left path W<b>2</b> is selected when the right region R is touched, and the first right path W<b>4</b> is selected when the left region L is touched. Incidentally, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the second left path W<b>1</b> is set as a path of the second object <b>60</b><i>b </i>in advance when the right region R of the object <b>60</b> is touched in a state in which the two objects <b>60</b><i>a </i>and <b>60</b><i>b </i>are displayed, and the second right path W<b>5</b> is set as a path of the second object <b>60</b><i>b </i>in advance when the left region L of the object <b>60</b> is touched in a state in which the two objects <b>60</b><i>a </i>and <b>60</b><i>b </i>are displayed. Meanwhile, the straight line path W<b>3</b> same as the first object <b>60</b><i>a </i>is set so as to be selected as a path of the second object <b>60</b><i>b </i>when the contact region S or the remaining region O is touched.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0075">Next, in step S<b>19</b>, a path selected in each of steps S<b>18</b>, S<b>20</b>, S<b>21</b>, and S<b>22</b> is decided as a path to display the object <b>60</b>, and then the current routine ends.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0076">Referring back to the routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, in step S<b>4</b>, the sequence processing unit <b>15</b> calculates coordinates of all objects <b>60</b> to be displayed on each path W in the game region <b>52</b>. For example, this calculation is performed as follows. First, the path W to display each object <b>60</b> included in the display range is determined based on the processing result of step S<b>3</b>. Next, the position of each object <b>60</b> from the operation reference portion <b>55</b>A or <b>55</b>B in the time axis direction (that is, the moving direction of the object <b>60</b>) is determined according to the moving direction (the operation reference portion <b>55</b>A or <b>55</b>B at the arrival position) corresponding to each the object <b>60</b> and a time difference between each operation timing and a current time. Through this operation, it is possible to acquire the path W to arrange each object <b>60</b> and coordinates of each object <b>60</b> necessary to arrange each object <b>60</b> on the corresponding path W along the time axis from the operation reference portion <b>55</b>A or <b>55</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0077">Next, in step S<b>5</b>, the sequence processing unit <b>15</b> generates image data necessary to draw the game region <b>52</b> based on the coordinates of the object <b>60</b> calculated in step S<b>4</b>. Specifically, the image data is generated so that each object <b>60</b> is arranged on the calculated coordinates. An image of the object <b>60</b> or the like may be acquired from the image data <b>27</b>. Next, in step S<b>6</b>, the sequence processing unit <b>15</b> outputs the image data to the display control unit <b>12</b>. As a result, the game region <b>52</b> is displayed on the monitor <b>3</b>. When the process of step S<b>6</b> ends, the sequence processing unit <b>15</b> ends the current sequence process routine. By executing repeatedly the above-described processes, the object <b>60</b> is displayed on the designated operation reference portion <b>55</b>A or <b>55</b>B at a display start timing described in the sequence data <b>28</b>, and the object <b>60</b> moves between the two operation reference portions <b>55</b>A and <b>55</b>B so as to arrive at the designated operation reference portion <b>55</b>A or <b>55</b>B at an operation timing described in the sequence data <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0078">Next, the operation evaluation routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> will be described. When the operation evaluation routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> starts, in step S<b>31</b>, the operation evaluating unit <b>16</b> first determines the presence or absence of the touch operation on the object <b>60</b> with reference to an output signal of the touch panel <b>5</b>. At this time, when the position other than the operation reference portions <b>55</b>A and <b>55</b>B is touched, it is determined no touch operation has been performed. When it is determined no touch operation has been performed, the operation evaluating unit <b>16</b> ends the current routine, and when it is determined the touch operation has been made, the process proceeds to step S<b>32</b>. In step S<b>32</b>, the operation evaluating unit <b>16</b> determines a timing (a time in the music) at which the touch operation has been made based on a position signal output from the touch panel <b>5</b>. Next, in step S<b>33</b>, the operation evaluating unit <b>16</b> specifies a nearest operation timing described in the sequence data <b>28</b> with respect to the operation reference portion on which the touch operation has been performed, that is, an operation timing which is closest in time in the sequence data <b>28</b> with respect to the operation reference portion on which the touch operation has been performed, and acquires a time difference between the operation timing and a time at which the touch operation has been performed.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0079">Next, in step S<b>34</b>, the operation evaluating unit <b>16</b> determines whether or not the player's operation is appropriate by determining whether or not the time difference is within the evaluation range. A predetermined time range around an operation timing of a comparison target is set as the evaluation range. For example, a plurality of steps of levels is set centering on an operation timing, and a time range in which the levels are set is dealt as the evaluation range. When it is determined in step S<b>34</b> that the time difference is outside the evaluation range, the operation evaluating unit <b>16</b> ends the current routine. Meanwhile, when it is determined that the time difference is within the evaluation range, the process proceeds to step S<b>35</b>. In step S<b>36</b>, the operation evaluating unit <b>16</b> specifies an operation position at which the touch operation has been performed on the operation reference portion <b>55</b>A or <b>55</b>B and an operation timing which is closest in time in the sequence data <b>28</b> with respect to the operation reference portion at which the touch operation has been performed, and acquires a position difference between the operation position and the arrival position of the object <b>60</b> indicating the operation timing.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0080">Next, in step S<b>36</b>, the operation evaluating unit <b>16</b> decides an evaluation on the player's touch operation based on the time difference acquired in step S<b>34</b> and the position difference acquired in step S<b>35</b>. For example, this evaluation is actualized as follows. First, the evaluation related to the time difference is actualized by determining whether or not a timing of the touch operation belongs to any one of the plurality of levels set in the time range. The plurality of levels are set such that the time range is divided in units of predetermined time periods, and the touch operation that belongs to a division close to an operation timing of each division is evaluated high. Further, the evaluation related to the position difference is actualized by comparing the center position of the object <b>60</b> and the touch operation position. For example, in the evaluation of the position difference, a region up to twice the diameter of the object <b>60</b> is evaluated as &#x201c;GOOD&#x201d;, and the remaining region is evaluated as &#x201c;MISS.&#x201d; Alternatively, the inner side further than the outer circumference of the object <b>60</b> may be evaluated highest, a predetermined evaluation range may be set such that an evaluation is steadily lowered in units of certain distances from the outer circumference, and the evaluation may be determined according to the evaluation range to which the position of the touch operation belongs to. In this case, a difficulty level of the game is improved. Thereafter, the operation evaluating unit <b>16</b> proceeds to step S<b>37</b>, and controls an output to the display control unit <b>12</b> such that the evaluation result is displayed on at least one of the game region <b>52</b> and the information region <b>53</b>. When the process of step S<b>37</b> is completed, the operation evaluating unit <b>16</b> ends the current routine. Incidentally, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, step of acquiring the difference between the position of the object and the position of the touch operation may be executed before step of acquiring the difference between the operation timing nearest to the operation reference portion and the time at which the touch operation has been performed. Further, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the evaluation of the position difference is configured so as to be evaluated as &#x201c;GOOD&#x201d; or &#x201c;MISS&#x201d; according to a region. However, when the position difference is outside the predetermined range, similarly to step S<b>34</b>, the subsequent process may be skipped, and then the current routine may end. In this case, for example, when an operation on the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A is required, an operation on an inappropriate position outside the predetermined range such as an operation executed on the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B can be excluded from an evaluation target.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0081">As described above, according to this embodiment, the moving path and the moving velocity of the object <b>60</b> moving toward the next operation reference portion can be selected through the touch operation. Thus, one player can variously change a difficulty level of the game of the other player through his/her operation, and thus amusement of the game can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0082">Furthermore, according to this embodiment, the sequence data <b>28</b> includes the display start information portion <b>28</b><i>d </i>in which the display start timing matching the display start timing of the previous operation timing <b>28</b><i>cf </i>is set to the next operation timing <b>28</b><i>cr </i>in which the time interval with the certain operation timing <b>28</b><i>cs </i>is less than the predetermined value. Thus, the second object <b>60</b><i>b </i>corresponding to the next operation timing <b>28</b><i>cr </i>can start to be displayed at the same time as the first object <b>60</b><i>a </i>corresponding to the previous operation timing <b>28</b><i>cf</i>. As a result, when a time interval between operation timings is short, the two objects <b>60</b><i>a </i>and <b>60</b><i>b </i>can be displayed from the display start timing of the first object <b>60</b><i>a </i>corresponding to the previous operation timing <b>28</b><i>cf</i>. Thus, a moving time of the object <b>60</b> corresponding to the next operation timing <b>28</b><i>cr </i>can be increased to be longer than when only one object <b>60</b> is used. Thus, even when a time interval between operation timings is short, the moving velocity of the operation indication mark can be prevented from being too fast. Further, since the display start timing of the second object <b>60</b><i>b </i>matches the display start timing of the first object <b>60</b><i>a </i>corresponding to the previous operation timing <b>28</b><i>cf</i>, natural appearance of the second object <b>60</b><i>b </i>can be rendered.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0083">In the above-described embodiment, the external storage device <b>20</b> of the game machine <b>1</b> functions as a music data storage device and a sequence data storage device. Further, the control unit <b>10</b> functions as a game region presenting device and a mark display control device by causing the sequence processing unit <b>15</b> to execute the routines of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>. Furthermore, the control unit <b>10</b> functions as an evaluating device by causing the operation evaluating unit <b>16</b> to execute the routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0083" num="0084">In the first embodiment, a game played by a plurality of players is executed such that a plurality of players or a game machine itself functions as the other player, but the present invention is not limited to this embodiment. In a second embodiment of the present invention, the same configuration as in the first embodiment will not be described, and a main difference with the first embodiment will be described. A game executed by, for example, the game machine <b>1</b> as a game system according to the second embodiment of the present invention may be actualized such that a single first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A is set to correspond to the operating unit, and the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B is arranged to simply function as a wall that causes the operation indication mark to rebound. And, the game may be executed such that only the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A is provided on the game screen, and the operation indication mark moves while rebounding from the wall serving as the reference portion provided in the boundary of the game region and then arrives at only the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A or the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A and the wall (or the other walls and the like) arranged at the position facing the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A at a timing described in the sequence data. In this case, it is possible to actualize a one-player game in which a difficulty level of a game can be variously changed. Further, in this case, the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A, the wall arranged at the position facing the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A, and the like function as a plurality of the reference portions according to the present invention. Further, a reference timing instead of an operation timing is used as the timing described in the sequence data, and among the reference timings, a timing of an arrival at the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A functions as an operation timing.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0085">The present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment and can be implemented in appropriate embodiments. In the above-described embodiment, the sequence data <b>28</b> in which the display start timing, the operation timing, and information indicating each of the operation reference portions <b>55</b>A and <b>55</b>B are associated with one another for each object <b>60</b> is prepared as the sequence data in advance. However, the present invention is not limited to the embodiment in which the sequence data <b>28</b> is prepared in advance. For example, there may be further provided a data generating device that generates additional sequence data in which a display start timing, an operation timing, and information indicating each operation reference portion are associated with one another for each object based on basic sequence data in which only an operation timing is indicated without distinction between previously prepared operation reference portions or the like. And, in the routines of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 to 11</figref>, the additional sequence data may be used. Further, in this case, the control unit <b>10</b> may be configured so as to function as the data generating device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of the basic sequence data in which only an operation timing is indicated. The basic sequence data <b>80</b> includes a vertical axis <b>81</b> representing an elapsed time (the progress of music). As the vertical axis <b>81</b> proceeds upward, an elapsed time increases. Further, the vertical axis <b>81</b> is provided with a plurality of horizontal lines <b>83</b> set at predetermined time intervals. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, in the basic sequence data <b>80</b>, a block <b>85</b> is arranged at an appropriate timing according to the progress of the music. Each block <b>85</b> represents an operation timing.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0086">Meanwhile, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a data generating process routine of generating the additional sequence data, which is executed by the control unit <b>10</b> when the control unit <b>10</b> functions as the data generating device. When the data generating process routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> starts, in step S<b>41</b>, the control unit <b>10</b> first acquires an operation timing included in the display range from the basic sequence data <b>80</b>. Next, in step S<b>42</b>, operation timings indicated by the basic sequence data <b>80</b> are classified according to each of the operation reference portions <b>55</b>A and <b>55</b>B, and the operation timings are sorted so that an operation timing for the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A and an operation timing for the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B can come in an alternating manner. Specifically, information indicating each of the operation reference portions <b>55</b>A and <b>55</b>B is added to the basic sequence data, and each operation timing is associated with information of each of the operation reference portions <b>55</b>A and <b>55</b>B so that an operation timing for the operation reference portion <b>55</b>A and an operation timing for the operation reference portion <b>55</b>B can come in the alternating manner. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of sequence data <b>80</b><i>a </i>(which may be hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;sorting data&#x201d;) in which each operation timing is sorted according to each of the operation reference portions <b>55</b>A and <b>55</b>B. The sorting data <b>80</b><i>a </i>includes a horizontal axis <b>86</b> which is disposed with respect to the vertical axis <b>81</b> representing the lapse of a time and a thick line <b>88</b> which is disposed at the center of the horizontal axis <b>86</b> and extends in parallel to the vertical axis <b>81</b>. The thick line <b>88</b> divides the horizontal axis <b>86</b> in units of operation reference portions. And, the left side of the thick line <b>88</b> is used as a first region indicating the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A, and the right side is used as a second region indicating the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, in the sorting data <b>80</b><i>a</i>, the blocks <b>85</b> are alternately arranged on the regions of the operation reference portions <b>55</b>A and <b>55</b>B with the lapse of a time.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0087">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, in step S<b>43</b>, information indicating a display start timing of the object <b>60</b> corresponding to each operation timing is set on each operation timing. The display start timing is set based on an operation timing immediately prior to each operation timing. Specifically, as a display start timing on a certain operation timing, an operation timing immediately prior to the certain operation timing is specified, and the timing corresponding to the immediately previous operation timing is set. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of sequence data <b>80</b><i>b </i>(which may be hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;display start timing data&#x201d;) in which information of the display start timing is set to the sorting data <b>80</b><i>a</i>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, in the display start timing data <b>80</b><i>b</i>, one end <b>85</b><i>a </i>of each block <b>85</b> arranged at an operation timing of the sorting data <b>80</b><i>a </i>extends up to the position corresponding to the other end <b>85</b><i>b </i>of the block <b>85</b> arranged immediately before each block <b>85</b>. In other words, in the display start timing data <b>80</b><i>b</i>, one end <b>85</b><i>a </i>of each block <b>85</b> is set as information indicating the display start timing, and the other end <b>85</b><i>b </i>is set as information indicating the operation timing.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0088">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, in step S<b>44</b>, a time interval between operation timings is calculated, and it is determined whether or not the time interval between the operation timings is a predetermined value or more. Specifically, a time interval between a certain operation timing and a next operation timing is calculated, and it is determined whether or not the time interval is equal to or more than the predetermined value during which the operation timing can be appropriately guided to each player. When a positive determination is made in step S<b>44</b>, that is, when it is determined that a time interval between each pair of all objects <b>60</b> included in the display range is the predetermined value or more, the process proceeds to step S<b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0089">In contrast, when a negative determination is made in step S<b>44</b>, that is, when it is determined that an operation timing having a time interval less than the predetermined value is included, the process proceeds to step S<b>46</b>. In step S<b>46</b>, a certain operation timing determined that the time interval is less than the predetermined value and a next operation timing are specified, and information indicating an object <b>60</b> different from the object <b>60</b> corresponding to the specified certain operation timing is added to the specified next operation timing. Next, in step S<b>47</b>, information of the display start timing set to the specified next operation timing is changed such that the display start timing corresponding to the next operation timing specified in step S<b>46</b> matches the display start timing set to the operation timing prior to the specified certain operation timing.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of the sequence data <b>80</b><i>c </i>(which may be hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;adjustment data&#x201d;) in which information indicating the object <b>60</b> is added to the display start timing data <b>80</b><i>b</i>, and information of the set display start timing is changed. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a plurality of lanes R are provided on the horizontal axis <b>86</b> of the adjustment data <b>80</b><i>c</i>. Each lane R is used as information indicating the object <b>60</b>. Further, the plurality of lanes R are divided into a plurality of lanes Ra of the first region included in the region of the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A and a plurality of lanes Rb of the second region included in the region of the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B with the thick line <b>88</b> as the boundary. A correspondence relation having the object <b>60</b> as a common term is present between each lane Ra of the first region and each lane Rb of the second region. Specifically, the second lane Ra<b>2</b> from the left of the region of the first player is used as information indicating a display of a first object <b>60</b>, a fourth lane Ra<b>4</b> from the left thereof is used as information indicating a display of a second object <b>60</b>, and a sixth lane Ra<b>6</b> from the left thereof is used as information indicating a display of a third object <b>60</b>. In addition, the second lane Ra<b>2</b> from the left of the region of the first player has a correspondence relation with a first lane Rb<b>1</b> from the left of the region of the second player, the fourth lane Ra<b>4</b> from the left of the first player has a correspondence relation with a third lane Rb<b>3</b> from the left of the second player, and the sixth lane Ra<b>6</b> from the left of the first player has a correspondence relation with a fifth lane Rb<b>5</b> from the left of the second player. In other words, in the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 to 7</figref>, the second lane Ra<b>2</b> from the left of the region of the first player and the first lane Rb<b>1</b> from the left of the second player indicate a display of the object <b>60</b> or the first object <b>60</b><i>a</i>, the fourth lane Ra<b>4</b> from the left of the first player and the third lane R<b>32</b> from the left of the second player indicate a display of the second object <b>60</b><i>b</i>, and the sixth lane Ra<b>6</b> from the left of the first player and the fifth lane Rb<b>5</b> from the left of the second player indicate a display of the third object <b>60</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0091">In the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>, among operation timings in which a time interval between a certain operation timing and an operation timing subsequent to the certain operation timing is less than the predetermined value, a next block <b>85</b>R corresponding to the next operation timing is surrounded by a thick line. When the display start timing data <b>80</b><i>b </i>illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is compared with the adjustment data <b>80</b><i>c </i>illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, each of the next blocks <b>85</b>R<b>1</b> and <b>85</b>R<b>2</b> surrounded by the thick lines in the display start timing data <b>80</b><i>b </i>has moved onto another lane in the adjustment data <b>80</b><i>c</i>. Specifically, in time-series order from the front side, the next two blocks <b>85</b>R<b>1</b> and <b>85</b>SR<b>2</b> of the first area of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> have moved onto the sixth lane Ra<b>6</b> and the fourth lane Ra<b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, respectively. Further, in time-series order from the front side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the next two blocks <b>85</b>R<b>1</b> and <b>85</b>R<b>2</b> of the second area have moved onto the third lane Rb<b>3</b> and the fifth lane Rb<b>5</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0092">Further, in the display start timing data <b>80</b><i>b</i>, the position of one end <b>85</b>Ra of each of the next blocks <b>85</b>R<b>1</b> and <b>85</b>R<b>2</b> also has changed. Specifically, in the display start timing data <b>80</b><i>b</i>, the position of one end <b>85</b>Ra of the next block <b>85</b>R<b>1</b> of the first area corresponds to the position of the other end <b>85</b>Fb of the previous block <b>85</b>F<b>1</b> which is positioned in front of the next block <b>85</b>R<b>1</b> of the second area. Similarly, the position of one end <b>85</b>Ra of the next block <b>85</b>R<b>1</b> of the second area corresponds to the position of the other end <b>85</b>Rb of the next block <b>85</b>R<b>1</b> of the first area, the one end <b>85</b>Ra of the next block <b>85</b>R<b>2</b> of the second area corresponds to the position of the other end <b>85</b>Fb of the previous block <b>85</b>F<b>2</b> which is positioned in front of the next block <b>85</b>R<b>2</b> of the first area, and the position of one end <b>85</b>Ra of the next block <b>85</b>R<b>2</b> of the first area corresponds to the position of the other end <b>85</b>Rb of the next block <b>85</b>R<b>2</b> of the second area, respectively (in the following, when the previous blocks <b>85</b>F<b>1</b> and <b>85</b>F<b>2</b> need not be distinguished from each other, the previous blocks <b>85</b>F<b>1</b> and <b>85</b>F<b>2</b> are collectively referred to as a &#x201c;previous block <b>85</b>F&#x201d;). In other words, in the display start timing data <b>80</b><i>b</i>, the position of one end <b>85</b>Ra of each next block <b>85</b>R corresponds to the position of the other end <b>85</b><i>b </i>of the block <b>85</b> which is positioned immediately before the next block <b>85</b>R in time series. Thus, each next block <b>85</b>R is short in the length from the position of one end <b>85</b>Ra representing the display start timing to the position of the other end <b>85</b>Rb representing the operation timing.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0093">Meanwhile, in the adjustment data <b>80</b><i>c</i>, one end <b>85</b>Ra of each of the next blocks <b>85</b>R<b>1</b> and <b>85</b>R<b>2</b> extends in a temporally retroactive direction so as to correspond to one end <b>85</b>Fa of each of the previous blocks <b>85</b>F<b>1</b> and <b>85</b>F<b>2</b> which is positioned immediately in front of each next block in the same region as each of the next blocks <b>85</b>R<b>1</b> and <b>85</b>R<b>2</b>, that is, correspond to one end <b>85</b>Fa of each of the previous blocks <b>85</b>F<b>1</b> and <b>85</b>F<b>2</b> which is positioned two blocks ahead in time series. For this reason, each of the next blocks <b>85</b>R<b>1</b> and <b>85</b>R<b>2</b> is longer in the length from position representing the display start timing of one end <b>85</b>Ra to the position representing the operation timing of the other end <b>85</b>Rb than the display start timing data <b>80</b><i>b</i>. As a result, in the adjustment data <b>80</b><i>c</i>, an instruction is made such that an object <b>60</b> different from each of the previous blocks <b>85</b>F<b>1</b> and <b>85</b>F<b>2</b> is separately displayed at a display start timing of an object <b>60</b> corresponding to each of the previous blocks <b>85</b>F<b>1</b> and <b>85</b>F<b>2</b> which is positioned one block ahead in time series in the same region as each of the next blocks <b>85</b>R<b>1</b> and <b>85</b>R<b>2</b>. In other words, in the adjustment data <b>80</b><i>c</i>, an instruction is made such that two objects <b>60</b> of an object <b>60</b> corresponding to a previous block <b>85</b>F and an object <b>60</b> corresponding to a next block <b>85</b>R are displayed at a display start timing corresponding to the previous block <b>85</b>F, and the objects <b>60</b> arrive at the operation reference portions <b>55</b>A and <b>55</b>B corresponding to the blocks <b>85</b>F and <b>85</b>R at operation timings indicated by the blocks <b>85</b>F and <b>85</b>R, respectively. Incidentally, the operation timing corresponding to the next block <b>85</b>R corresponds to the next operation timing <b>28</b><i>cr </i>of the sequence data <b>28</b>, and the operation timing corresponding to the previous block <b>85</b>F corresponds to the previous operation timing <b>28</b><i>cf </i>of the sequence data <b>28</b>. Further, the operation timing corresponding to the previous block <b>85</b>F<b>1</b> of the next block <b>85</b>R<b>1</b> of the second area also functions as the certain operation timing <b>28</b><i>cs </i>corresponding to the next block <b>85</b>R<b>1</b> of the first area. Similarly, the operation timing corresponding to the next block <b>85</b>R<b>1</b> of the first area functions as the certain operation timing <b>28</b><i>cs </i>corresponding to the next block <b>85</b>R<b>1</b> of the second area, the operation timing corresponding to the previous block <b>85</b>F<b>2</b> of the next block <b>85</b>R<b>2</b> of the first area functions as the certain operation timing <b>28</b><i>cs </i>corresponding to the next block <b>85</b>R<b>2</b> of the second area, and the operation timing corresponding to the next block <b>85</b>R<b>2</b> of the second area functions as the certain operation timing <b>28</b><i>cs </i>corresponding to the next block <b>85</b>R<b>2</b> of the first area, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0094">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, in step S<b>45</b>, the display start timing data <b>80</b><i>b </i>or the adjustment data <b>80</b><i>c </i>is generated as the additional sequence data based on the result of step S<b>43</b> and the result of step S<b>47</b>, and then the current routine ends. Incidentally, in the above-described example, the additional sequence data is generated for each display range, but the data generating process routine may be executed on the entire basic sequence data <b>80</b> by a single process.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0095">The above-described embodiments have been described in connection with the embodiment in which the control unit <b>10</b> functions as the data generating device, but the present invention is not limited to this embodiment.

<p id="p-0095" num="0096">In the above-described embodiments, the sequence data <b>28</b> in which the display start timing, the operation timing, and the information indicating each of the operation reference portions <b>55</b>A and <b>55</b>B are described by a numerical value or a letter for each object <b>60</b> is stored in the external storage device <b>20</b>, but the sequence data stored in the external storage device <b>20</b> is not limited to this embodiment. For example, as a first modified example of the sequence data, the above-described separately generated adjustment data <b>80</b><i>c </i>may be stored in the external storage device <b>20</b>.

<p id="p-0096" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a diagram schematically illustrating the second modified example of the sequence data. In sequence data <b>90</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, a vertical axis <b>91</b> represents an elapsed time (the progress of music), and a central thick line <b>93</b> represents the boundary between indications of each of the operation reference portions <b>55</b>A and <b>55</b>B, respectively. As the vertical axis <b>91</b> proceeds upward, an elapsed time increases. And, the left side of the thick line <b>93</b> is used as a region representing the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A, and the right side thereof is used as a region representing the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B, respectively. Further, the vertical axis <b>91</b> is provided with a plurality of horizontal lines <b>95</b> set at predetermined time intervals. The sequence data <b>90</b> includes a plurality of blocks <b>97</b> each indicating an operation timing. Each block <b>97</b> is arranged at an appropriate timing of a region of each operation indicating unit in tune with the progress of music. Further, the blocks <b>97</b> are connected with each other by a connecting line <b>98</b>. The connecting line <b>98</b> represents a correspondence relation between the objects <b>60</b> each indicating an operation timing. Specifically, when one connecting line <b>98</b> extends from a certain block <b>97</b> to a next block <b>97</b>, made is an instruction to display one object <b>60</b> for movement from the operation reference portion <b>55</b>A or <b>55</b>B corresponding to the certain block <b>97</b> to the operation reference portion <b>55</b>A or <b>55</b>B corresponding to the next block <b>97</b>.

Further, the connecting line <b>98</b> represents continuity of an object <b>60</b> corresponding to each object <b>60</b>. In other words, the connecting line <b>98</b> represents a relation in which the arrival position of the object <b>60</b> corresponding to the block <b>97</b> serving as the starting point of the connecting line <b>98</b> in time series functions as a starting position of movement of the object <b>60</b> corresponding to the block <b>97</b> serving as the ending point of the connecting line <b>98</b>. For this reason, the object <b>60</b> corresponding to the block <b>97</b> that does not serve as the starting point of the connecting line <b>98</b> disappears from the game screen with the advent of an operation timing. In this modified example, the starting point of the connecting line <b>98</b> functions as information indicating the display start timing. Further, of ending points of the two connecting lines <b>98</b> extending from one block <b>97</b>, one block <b>97</b>F whose operation timing comes first corresponds to the previous operation timing <b>28</b><i>cf </i>in the sequence data <b>28</b>, and the other block <b>97</b>R whose operation timing comes late corresponds to the next operation timing <b>28</b><i>cr</i>. The display start timings of the two blocks <b>97</b>F and <b>97</b>R, that is, the starting points of the connecting lines <b>98</b> are the same. And, a specific block <b>97</b>S arranged to indicate an operation timing between the blocks <b>97</b>F and <b>97</b>R while interposing the thick line <b>93</b> at the center between the one block <b>97</b>F and the other block <b>97</b>R corresponds to the certain operation timing <b>28</b><i>cs</i>. Incidentally, the number of the connecting lines <b>98</b> extending from the certain block <b>97</b> is not limited to one or two, and three or four connecting lines <b>98</b> may be provided as necessary. The present invention can be actualized by this modified example.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0098">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the three connecting line <b>98</b> extending from the certain block <b>97</b> are surrounded by a thick line <b>100</b>. The example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> in which the connecting lines <b>98</b> are surrounded by the thick line <b>100</b> represents that both the previous block <b>97</b>FB prior to the specific block <b>97</b>SB representing the certain operation timing and the next block <b>97</b>R subsequent to the specific block <b>97</b>S are shorter than the predetermined value. And, in this example, the connecting lines <b>98</b> are provided such that the objects <b>60</b> respectively corresponding to the three blocks <b>97</b>RB, <b>97</b>SB, and <b>97</b>FB are the same in display start timing as the previous block <b>97</b>FB. Thus, in the data of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, at the display start timing of the object <b>60</b> corresponding to the previous block <b>97</b>FB, the two objects <b>60</b> respectively corresponding to the certain block <b>97</b>SB and the next block <b>97</b>RB are also displayed in addition to the object <b>60</b> at the position at which the object <b>60</b> starts to be displayed. In other words, an instruction is made such that the three objects <b>60</b> are simultaneously displayed at the same place, and a movement display is performed to indicate operation timings respectively corresponding to the next block <b>97</b>RB, the specific block <b>97</b>SB, and the previous block <b>97</b>FB. As described above, as far as a display start timing of an operation indication mark corresponding to each operation timing can be extended so that a time interval between operation timings does not become less than the predetermined value, the number of objects <b>60</b> to be displayed and a display start timing of each object <b>60</b> are not limited to the above-described embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0099">The above-described embodiment has been described in connection with the embodiment in which five paths W extend from one rebounding point R<b>1</b> or R<b>2</b>. However, the number of paths extending each rebounding point is not limited. Thus, it is possible to set a number of paths omnidirectionally extending from each rebounding point. Further, it is possible to set a number of rebounding points R<b>1</b> or R<b>2</b> included in the operation reference portion <b>55</b>A or <b>55</b>B. In other words, a plurality of paths may be set such that the operation indication mark is omnidirectionally movable between the operation reference portions at all positions. Furthermore, a number of rebound points with both side walls <b>52</b>R and <b>52</b>L of the game region <b>52</b> and a number of paths starting from the rebound point may be set. Through this operation, a number of paths up to the rebound point and a number of paths after rebounding can be set. Further, the above-described embodiment has been described in connection with the embodiment in which the object <b>60</b> is divided into four regions, the moving path is decided by comparing the position of the touch operation with the four regions of the object <b>60</b>. However, the present invention is not limited to this embodiment. The operation indication mark may be divided into a number of regions according to a number of paths set to a game region. Thus, it is possible to cause the operation indication mark to move along a free path between the operation reference portions through the touch operation. Further, the present invention is not limited to the embodiment in which the operation indication mark is divided into a plurality of regions. For example, the moving path of the operation indication mark may be decided by comparing a fixed position such as the center position of the operation indication mark with the position of the touch operation. Further, when a number of paths are set as a moving path of an operation indication mark, so that the moving velocity of the operation indication mark does not become too fast to be appropriate for an operation indication, a limiting device that limits a change of a moving path according to a touch operation to a path in which the moving velocity of the operation indication mark falls within the predetermined range may be further provided. In this case, the control unit <b>10</b> may be configured to function as the limiting device. When the control unit <b>10</b> is configured so as to function as the limiting device, for example, in step S<b>18</b> of the path decision process routine illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, selection of a path is preferably limited to a predetermined path in which the moving velocity is within the predetermined range based on a relation between an operation timing and a moving distance. Further, separately, the control unit <b>10</b> may be configured so as to execute a path correcting process routine of correcting a path decided by path deciding process.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a path correcting process routine executed by the control unit <b>10</b> when the control unit <b>10</b> functions as the limiting device.

When the routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> starts, in step S<b>51</b>, the control unit <b>10</b> first acquires the decided path and an operation timing to be indicated by a target object <b>60</b>, and calculates the moving velocity of the object <b>60</b> based on the distance of the acquired path and the operation timing. Next, in step S<b>52</b>, it is determined whether or not the moving velocity calculated in step S<b>51</b> is within the predetermined range. When a positive determination is made in step S<b>52</b>, the subsequent process is skipped, and then the current routine ends. In contrast, when a negative determination is made in step S<b>52</b>, the process proceeds to step S<b>53</b>. In step S<b>53</b>, the decided path is corrected to a path in which the moving velocity of the object <b>60</b> falls within the predetermined range, and then the current routine ends. Further, when the path is corrected by the path correcting process, in the process of step S<b>4</b> and subsequent steps of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the path corrected by the path correcting process is preferably used in the routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0101">In the above-described embodiments, a moving path along which an object <b>60</b> moves toward a next operation reference portion is decided according to the positional relation between the position of a touch operation and the position of the object <b>60</b>, but decision of the moving path is not limited to the embodiment according to the positional relation. For example, the moving path may be decided according to an operation designating a direction such as an operation in which the position of a touch operation continuously changes, and the moving velocity may be decided according to a change velocity of the continuous change. Further, when a specific operation designating a predetermined moving direction and a predetermined velocity is executed on an object together with a touch operation on an operation reference portion, a specific moving path according to the specific operation may be set as the moving path of the object <b>60</b>, and the object may move along the specific moving path. A configuration in which the object <b>60</b> moves along the specific path when the specific operation is executed can be actualized, for example, by executing the routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> through the sequence processing unit <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a flowchart of a specific path correcting routine. Preferably, the routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is executed, for example, between steps S<b>3</b> and S<b>4</b> of the sequence process routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, that is, after a path is decided by the path deciding process of step S<b>3</b>. When the routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> starts, in step S<b>61</b>, the sequence processing unit <b>15</b> determines whether or not the specific operation has been executed. For example, this determination is performed as follows. First, a continuous change in the position of a touch operation is determined with reference to a signal from the touch panel <b>5</b>. When the position of the touch operation does not continuously change, it is determined that the specific operation has not been executed. In contrast, when the position of the touch operation continuously changes, the direction and the velocity of the continuous change are calculated. Then, by comparing the calculated change direction with a predetermined direction and the calculated velocity with a predetermined velocity, respectively, it is determined whether or not the specific operation has been executed. When it is determined in step S<b>61</b> that the specific operation has not been executed, the sequence processing unit <b>15</b> skips the subsequent process and then ends the current routine.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0103">In contrast, when it is determined in step S<b>61</b> that the specific operation has been executed, the sequence processing unit <b>15</b> proceeds to step S<b>62</b>. In step S<b>62</b>, the sequence processing unit <b>15</b> corrects the path decided in step S<b>3</b> to a specific path, and then ends the current routine. In the process of step S<b>4</b> and subsequent steps of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the object <b>60</b> can move along the specific path by using the processing result of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> when the specific operation has been executed.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0104">Alternatively, as a configuration to cause the object <b>60</b> to move along the specific path when the specific operation has been executed, for example, a routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> may be executed instead of the routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a path decision process routine when the presence or absence of the specific operation is determined. Comparing the routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> with the routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, in the routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the process of step S<b>23</b> is performed before step S<b>14</b> in addition to the routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. When the routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is executed, after step S<b>13</b>, the sequence processing unit <b>15</b> proceeds to step S<b>23</b>. In step S<b>23</b>, it is determined whether or not the specific operation has been executed. This determination may be performed in a similar manner to step S<b>61</b> of the routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0105">When a negative determination is made in step S<b>23</b>, the sequence processing unit <b>15</b> proceeds to step S<b>14</b>. The subsequent process may be performed similarly to the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In contrast, when a positive determination is made in step S<b>23</b>, the sequence processing unit <b>15</b> proceeds to step S<b>24</b>. In step S<b>24</b>, the sequence processing unit <b>15</b> selects a specific path as the moving path of the object <b>60</b> and then proceeds to step S<b>19</b>. Next, the process of step S<b>19</b> may be configured similarly to the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In this case, the specific path can be decided as the moving path of the object <b>60</b> according to the specific operation.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0106">Incidentally, as the specific operation designating a predetermined moving direction and a predetermined velocity on an object, there may be employed various embodiments. For example, there may be employed an operation of touching an object <b>60</b> moving toward an operation reference portion on the operation reference portion (the object <b>60</b> instantaneously becomes a hold state) and then pushing the object <b>60</b> in this state to move in a predetermined direction (continuously changing the position of the touch operation in the touched state). Further, as the specific operation, there may be employed a smash operation of touching the front side of the operation reference portion and causing the position of the touch operation to slide from the touched position toward the object <b>60</b> of the operation reference portion in the touched state such that the position of the touch operation overlaps a ball at a timing at which the operation reference portion matches with the object <b>60</b>. Further, alternatively, a time between the start and the end of a touch operation (between contact of the player's finger or the like and the end of the contact) is calculated on the touch operation on the operation reference portion <b>55</b>A or <b>55</b>B, as the specific operation, there may be used a positional relation as information indicating a predetermined direction (for example, a touched region among the four regions S, L, R, and O) between the position of the touch operation and the position of the object <b>60</b>, and a time of the calculated touch operation as information indicating a predetermined velocity. In this case, for example, it can be determined whether or not the predetermined velocity has been designated by determining whether or not the time of the touch operation is shorter than the predetermined value under the assumption that as the shorter the time of the touch operation is, the higher the designated velocity is. Even in any of the above examples, it is possible to determine an indication of a direction and a velocity on the object <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0107">Further, for example, a path of a predetermined distance or more in which the moving velocity of the object <b>60</b> is the predetermined value or more may be used as the above-described specific path. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a diagram schematically illustrating an example of the specific path when the specific operation is performed. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, an arrow A represents an operation direction. The example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> illustrates a case that an arrival position of the object <b>60</b> is touched in tune with an arrival of the object <b>60</b> at the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A, and an operation position is changed in an arrow A direction at a predetermined velocity in the touched state. In this case, it is determined that the specific operation designating the velocity has been executed in the predetermined direction, and thus the object <b>60</b> moves along the path WS of the predetermined distance or more as the specific path toward the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B at the opposite side while rebounding from both side walls <b>52</b>L and <b>52</b>R extending in the longitudinal direction of the game region <b>52</b> twice or more. As a result, for example, the smash operation of pushing the object <b>60</b> at a high speed is determined, and thus it is possible to increase the moving velocity of the object <b>60</b> to be a predetermined value or more according to the operation. In this case, since an option of intentionally moving an object toward an opponent player at a high speed can be prepared, options of the game can be widened, and amusement of the game can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0108">Further, in the above-described embodiments, the moving path of the object <b>60</b> changes according to the touch operation, but the present invention is not limited to the configuration in which the moving path changes according to the player's operation. For example, the moving path may change according to the development or rendition of a game. In other words, the moving path of the object may change by a predetermined condition such as an operation on the operating unit, or the development or rendition of a game. For the rendition of a game, as an example in which the moving path of the object <b>60</b> changes, the moving path of the object <b>60</b> may be decided according to a time interval between a certain operation timing and a next operation timing. In this case, instead of the determination on the presence or absence of the above-described specific operation, it may be determined whether or not a time interval between a certain operation timing and a next operation timing is a predetermined value or more, and instead of the specific path selected when the specific operation is performed, a path in which the moving distance is a certain distance or more may be selected as the moving path. For example, by applying a predetermined value in which a time interval between a certain operation timing and a next operation timing gives a monotonous impression as the predetermined value or more, it is possibly to move the object <b>60</b> at the velocity of a predetermined value or more at the time interval. As a result, the operation interval is increased, and thus the development of the game can be prevented from being monotonous.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0109">Furthermore, a path in which a moving direction changes at predetermined intervals may be used as the path having a certain distance or more. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is a diagram schematically illustrating an example of a path in which a moving distance of an object <b>60</b> is the certain distance or more. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, a path WR along which an object moves toward the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B at the opposite side while rebounding from both side walls <b>52</b>L and <b>52</b>R extending in the longitudinal direction of the game region <b>52</b> at a timing according to a rhythm of music is used as the path having the certain distance or more. Further, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, a beat of the music is used as the rhythm of the music, and an object rebounds from the right side wall <b>52</b>R of the game region <b>52</b> at a second beat and a fourth beat, rebounds from the left side wall <b>52</b>L at a third beat, and then arrives at the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B. Rebound points of both side walls <b>52</b>L and <b>52</b>R of the game region <b>52</b> are decided such that the number of rebounding times is calculated based on the beat number present between a certain operation timing and a next operation timing, and points at which rebounding can be performed by the calculated number of times while securing a certain distance or more are calculated. And, a path connecting the calculated rebound points is selected as the path having the certain distance or more. As a result, movement can be performed at the velocity of the predetermined value or more, and rebounding can be rendered in tune with the beat of the music. Thus, it is possible to further prevent the monotonous development of the game. Incidentally, in a case that the moving velocity becomes excessively fast if rebounding according to a beat is set according to an interval between previous and subsequent operation timings and music, a rendition of rebounding according to the beat may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0110">In the above-described embodiments, the path along which the operation indication mark moves is provided between the operation reference portions. However, the present invention is not limited to this embodiment. For example, each path may extend up to both ends of the game region beyond each operation reference portion. In this case, for example, each operation indication mark moves to arrive at each operation reference portion at an operation timing described in the sequence data, and in the case in which an appropriate operation is not made on the operating unit when each operation indication mark arrives at the operation reference portion, the operation indication mark can be caused to move beyond the operation reference portion and collide with an end portion of the game region. In this case, preferably, a rebounding point is provided even on the end portion of the game region, and the position of the end portion of the game region at which the operation indication mark arrives serves as an appearance position of movement of a next operation indication mark. Further, in the above-described embodiments, the object <b>60</b> disappears at the arrival position when arrived, the arrival position serves as the appearance position of the object <b>60</b> corresponding to the operation timing indicated by the common object <b>60</b>, and thus the object <b>60</b> moves as if the object <b>60</b> rebounds between the operation reference portions <b>55</b>A and <b>55</b>B. However, the movement of the object <b>60</b> is not limited to this embodiment. For example, the operation indication mark may not disappear each time when arrived at the rebounding point at the arrival position, and the operation indication mark may actually rebound from the rebounding point using the common object <b>60</b> as is. In this case, for example, after rebounding from the rebounding point, a color of the operation indication mark may be changed to a color corresponding to the operation reference portion to arrive next. Thus, information about the operation reference portion toward which the operation indication mark moves can be given.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0111">In the above-described embodiments, a rectangular region is used as the game region <b>52</b>, but the game region <b>52</b> is not limited to this embodiment. Regions of various shapes such as a polygonal shape and a circular shape may be used as the game region. Further, in the above-described embodiments, the two operation reference portions <b>55</b>A and <b>55</b>B respectively corresponding to both ends of the game region <b>52</b> in the longitudinal direction are provided, but the number of the operation reference portions is not limited to two (2). For example, a region in which three or more operation reference portions are set on the periphery thereof so that three or more players can play the game may be used as the game region.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0112">In the above-described embodiments, the control unit <b>10</b> serving as the evaluating device performs an evaluation by comparing an operation timing of a touch operation with an operation timing described in sequence data, but may not have a function as the evaluating device. In this case, a game machine of a match-up type in which an operation is made in tune with a rhythm of music while inducing an opponent player to make a mistake can be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0113">In the above-described embodiments, the touch panel is used as the input device, but the input device is not limited to this embodiment. For example, as far as a plurality of operating units are provided, there may be used input devices having various configurations such as a controller including a plurality of push buttons as the operating unit or a plurality of controllers each including one button as the operating unit. For example, when an input device including a direction selection button and an operation decision button is used as the input device, the operation decision button may be set so as to correspond to the operation reference portion, and a moving path of an operation indication mark used for movement to a next operation reference portion may be selected by the direction selection button.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0114">In the above-described embodiments, the next operation timing <b>28</b><i>cr </i>is associated with information of a display start timing matching the previous operation timing <b>28</b><i>cf</i>, but the present invention is not limited to this embodiment. A timing earlier than the certain operation timing <b>28</b><i>cs </i>may be set to the next operation timing <b>28</b><i>cr </i>as a display start timing. As a result, it is possible to extend a display period of an operation indication mark indicating the next operation timing <b>28</b><i>cr </i>in which an interval between operation timings is short.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0115">Further, in the above-described embodiments, an operation timing is described as a timing described in the sequence data, but a display duration time may be described instead of an operation timing. In this case, an operation timing can be indicated by moving the object <b>60</b> so as to arrive at any operation reference portion at a timing in which a display duration time elapses from a display start timing.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0116">In the above-described embodiments, only one game machine <b>1</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, but a plurality of game machines <b>1</b> may be connected so as to share game content with each other. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a state in which two game machines <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B are connected so as to share game content. The example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> illustrates a case in which two game machines <b>1</b> each including a monitor <b>3</b> with a shallow slope are arranged side by side in a traverse direction. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, in a monitor <b>3</b>A used by one first player P<b>1</b>, a first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A is arranged at a first player P<b>1</b> side, whereas in a monitor <b>3</b>B used by the other second player P<b>2</b>, a second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B is arranged at a second player P<b>2</b> side. In other words, a game screen <b>50</b>A through which the first player P<b>1</b> plays the game and a game screen <b>50</b>B through which the second player P<b>2</b> plays the game are arranged such that an upper portion and a lower portion thereof are reversed. And, the first player P<b>1</b> uses the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A as the operating unit through a touch panel <b>5</b>A superimposed on the monitor <b>3</b>A, and the second player P<b>2</b> uses the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B as the operating unit through a touch panel <b>5</b>B superimposed on the monitor <b>3</b>B. In this case, each of the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A of the first game machine <b>1</b>A and the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B of the second game machine <b>1</b>B functions as each of a plurality of operating units, respectively. Further, as an example similar to the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, two game machines <b>1</b> may be arranged such that back sides are combined with each other, that is, two game machines <b>1</b> may be arranged back to back. In this case, the game is executed in a state in which the players are positioned to face each other, and thus each player's feeling that they are playing against each other can be further improved. Further, in the above-described embodiments, the monitor <b>3</b> is arranged so as to be inclined to the player P side, but the present invention is not limited to this embodiment. For example, the monitor may be arranged almost flatly. In this case, two players can use one monitor, and two players can use the first operation reference portion and the second operation reference portion as the plurality of operating units through the common monitor and the common touch panel.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0117">In the above-described embodiments, there are cases in which a plurality of operation indication marks is present on the game region. In this case, when the operation indication marks collide with each other, a display may be performed such that at least one of the moving direction and the moving velocity changes. In this case, for example, the moving direction of the operation indication mark can be naturally changed during movement. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a game screen including a display in which a moving direction of an object changes by a collision. In this example, a game screen through which a game is played by one player is used. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the second operation reference portion <b>55</b>B is not provided on the game region <b>52</b> of this example. For this reason, an object serving as the operation indication mark moves to arrive at the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A at an operation timing described in sequence data while rebounding from walls around the game region <b>52</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, two objects <b>60</b><i>a </i>and <b>60</b><i>b </i>are displayed on the game region <b>52</b>.

Meanwhile, the second object <b>60</b><i>b </i>moves along the expected path FP<b>2</b> from the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A toward a wall positioned to face the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A. And, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the two objects <b>60</b><i>a </i>and <b>60</b><i>b </i>collide with each other in front of the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A.

The path of the first object <b>60</b><i>a </i>is changed from the expected path FP<b>1</b> to the post-collision path CP<b>1</b> due to the collision, and thus the arrival position to the first operation reference portion <b>55</b>A is changed. Further, since the post-collision path CP<b>1</b> is longer in moving distance than the expected path FP<b>1</b>, the moving velocity is also changed. Similarly, the path of the second object <b>60</b><i>b </i>is changed from the expected path FP<b>2</b> to the post-collision path CP<b>2</b> due to the collision, and the moving distance is also changed. As described above, for example, the moving direction of the operation indication mark is changed during movement, and thus it is difficult to predict the moving path and the arrival position of the operation indication mark. Accordingly, a difficulty level of the game can be more variously changed.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0118">Further, in the above-described embodiments, a configuration in which a moving path along which the object <b>60</b> moves to a next operation reference portion changes according to a predetermined condition such as an operation on the operating unit is provided, but this configuration may not be provided. Specifically, step S<b>3</b> of the routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, and the like may not be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0119">In the above-described embodiments, the game machine <b>1</b> is configured as a music game machine in which music is reproduced, and the operation indication mark moves toward the operation reference portion based on a played time of the music. However, the invention is not limited to this embodiment. The game machine <b>1</b> can execute various kinds of games as far as an operation timing is indicated through a video. Furthermore, the game system of the invention may be actualized in appropriate embodiments such as a game machine for business use installed in commercial facility, a stationary game machine for home use, a portable game machine, or a game system actualized by using a network.</p>
