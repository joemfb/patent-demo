<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">A massively multiplayer online (MMO) game is capable of supporting thousands of players simultaneously. Typically, such games involve video. A social MMO game is a MMO that leverages an online social graph (or network) to make a MMO game more interesting to its players. Often social graphs are maintained by social networking websites such as Facebook or social media websites such as MySpace. But one might think of a contact or buddy list as a primitive social graph.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">One tactic to make MMO games (including social MMO games) more engaging is to create a game task that is a social (or team) task, e.g., a task that requires assistance from a player's friends (e.g., on a social networking website) to accomplish.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, if, for example, a player has relatively few friends or if the player's friends play the game relatively infrequently, such a social game task can lead to disappointment in the player and, in the worst case, the player's withdrawal from the game. In turn, player disappointment/withdrawal can result in a reduction in the game's revenue potential (e.g., from the purchase of virtual goods or from third-party advertisements).</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In an example embodiment, a processor-executed method is described for engaging players in a MMO game. According to the method, the software at a MMO game website receives a request for assistance with a game task from a first player of a MMO game. The software transmits the request to a second player of the MMO game who is associated with the first player through a relationship recognized by the MMO game. The software determines whether the second player responds to the request within a time period. The time period depends on one or more factors related to game mechanics and to user data for the first player. Then if the second player does not respond within the time period and the game task is a game task whose completion can be assigned without the assistance of another player, the software assigns completion of the game task to the first player; and (2) transmits an automated apparent response to the first player.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another example embodiment, an apparatus is described, namely, a computer-readable storage medium that persistently stores a program for engaging players in a MMO game. The program might be part of the software at a MMO game website. The program receives a request for assistance with a game task from a first player of a MMO game. The program transmits the request to a second player of the MMO game who is associated with the first player through a relationship recognized by the MMO game. The program determines whether the second player responds to the request within a time period. The time period depends on one or more factors related to game mechanics and to user data for the first player. Then if the second player does not respond within the time period and the game task is a game task whose completion can be assigned without the assistance of another player, the program assigns completion of the game task to the first player; and (2) transmits an automated apparent response to the first player.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another example embodiment also involves a processor-executed method for engaging players in a social MMO game. According to the method, software at social MMO game website receives a request for assistance with a game task from a first player of a social MMO game. The software transmits the request to a second player of the social MMO game who is associated with the first player through a relationship that allows the second player to access a profile or stream associated with the first player and allows the first player to access a profile or stream associated with second player. The software monitors whether the second player responds to the request within a time period. The time period depends on one or more factors including data received from the profile or stream associated with the first player. Then if the second player does not respond within the time period and the game task is a game task whose completion can be assigned without the assistance of another player, the software: (1) assigns completion of the game task to the first player; and (2) transmits an automated apparent response to the first player</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the exemplary embodiments. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the example embodiments may be practiced without some of these specific details. In other instances, process operations and implementation details have not been described in detail, if already well known.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a simplified diagram that illustrates a network for a social MMO game, in accordance with an example embodiment. As depicted in this figure, a personal computing device <b>102</b> is connected by a network <b>101</b> (e.g., a wide area network (WAN) including the Internet, which might be wireless in part or in whole) with a website <b>103</b> hosting a massively multiplayer online game (e.g., a website such as Zynga hosting FarmVille or Blizzard Entertainment hosting World of Warcraft) and a website <b>106</b> hosting a social network (e.g., a social networking website such as Facebook or a social media website such as MySpace). The personal computing device <b>102</b> might be a laptop or other personal computer or a mobile device such as a smartphone, e.g., an iPhone, Blackberry, Android, etc. In an example embodiment, each of the websites <b>103</b> and <b>106</b> might be composed of a number of webservers connected by a network (e.g., a local area network (LAN) or a WAN) to each other in a cluster or other distributed system which might execute cloud platform software as described in further detail below. The webservers in website <b>103</b> and <b>106</b> might also be connected (e.g., by a storage area network (SAN)) to persistent storage <b>105</b> and <b>107</b>-<b>108</b>, respectively. In an example embodiment, persistent storage <b>105</b> and <b>107</b>-<b>108</b> might include a redundant array of independent disks (RAID).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Persistent storage <b>105</b> (e.g., the persistent storage associated with game N) might be used to store algorithms and data related to a game and its players, including data about the players received by website <b>103</b> from website <b>106</b>, as described in further detail below. In an example embodiment, some of the data from persistent storage <b>105</b> might be cached in volatile memory in webservers on website <b>103</b> in order to improve performance, as also described in further detail below. Persistent storage <b>107</b> might be used to store profile and associated stream data regarding the user of personal computing device <b>102</b>. Similarly, persistent storage <b>108</b> might be used to store profile and associated stream data regarding persons (e.g., friends) associated with that user, e.g., through a social graph (or network). It will be appreciated that persistent storage <b>107</b> and persistent storage <b>108</b> might well be the same persistent storage. They have been depicted as separate here for purposes of illustration to emphasize that a user typically has greater access rights to his/her profile and stream data than to the profile and stream data of his/her friends.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an example embodiment, personal computing device <b>102</b> might be a laptop or other personal computer. In that event, personal computing device <b>102</b> and the webservers in website <b>103</b> and <b>106</b> might include (1) hardware consisting of one or more microprocessors (e.g., from the x86 family or the PowerPC family), volatile storage (e.g., RAM), and persistent storage (e.g., a hard disk or solid-state drive), and (2) an operating system (e.g., Windows, Mac OS, Linux, Windows Server, Mac OS Server, etc.) that runs directly or indirectly (e.g., through virtualization software) on the hardware. Or the operating system for the webservers might be replaced by a hypervisor or other virtualization software. In an alternative example embodiment personal computing device <b>102</b> might be a mobile device that includes (1) hardware consisting of one or more microprocessors (e.g., from the ARM family), volatile storage (e.g., RAM), and persistent storage (e.g., flash memory such as microSD) and (2) an operating system (e.g., Symbian OS, RIM BlackBerry OS, iPhone OS, Palm webOS, Windows Mobile, Android, Linux, etc.) that runs on the hardware.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Also in an example embodiment, personal computing device <b>102</b> might include a web browser as an application program or part of an operating system. Examples of web browsers that might execute on personal computing device <b>102</b> if it is a laptop or other personal computer include Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Google Chrome. Examples of browsers that might execute on personal computing device <b>102</b> if it is a mobile device include Safari, Mozilla Firefox, Android Browser, and Palm webOS Browser. It will be appreciated that users of personal computing device <b>102</b> might use browsers to communicate with software running on the webservers at website <b>103</b> and at website <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> are flowchart diagrams that illustrate processes for transmitting an automated apparent response to a request for assistance on a game task, in accordance with an example embodiment. In an example embodiment, one or more of the operations in these processes might be performed by software running on the webservers at website <b>103</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In an alternative example embodiment, one or more of the operations in these processes might be performed by client software or a web browser running on personal computing device <b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As used in this disclosure, the term &#x201c;software&#x201d; should be broadly interpreted to encompass firmware or any other programmable logic. Moreover, in an alternative example embodiment, these processes might be implemented in hardware, or a combination of hardware and software.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, software running on one or more webservers at website <b>103</b> (e.g., Zynga) receives a player's request for assistance with a game task in massively multiplayer online (MMO) game (e.g., raising a barn in FarmVille), in operation <b>201</b>. In operation <b>202</b>, the software broadcasts the player's request (e.g., through a game graphic and/or notification) for assistance to persons associated with the requesting player through a team roster, a contact or buddy list, or an online social graph (or network). In an example embodiment, the persons associated with the requesting player might be the player's Facebook friends who are players of the MMO game or, more generally, the player's Facebook friends. Also, in an example embodiment, the request might be broadcast using an application programming interface (API) exposed by software running on a social networking website or social media website depicted as website <b>106</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Examples of such APIs include Facebook (REST) API, Facebook Graph API, Twitter API, Bebo's Social Networking API (SNAPI), OpenSocial API, etc. It will be appreciated that the Facebook APIs allow authorized third parties (e.g., third parties with an access token and/or permissions) to access a user's Facebook profile (e.g., for transmitting a Facebook notification) and the stream or feed (e.g., News Feed) associated with that profile.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In operation <b>203</b>, the software determines whether the persons associated with the requesting player (e.g., the requesting player's Facebook friends who are players of the MMO) respond to the request for assistance (e.g., by clicking on the graphic representing the request) within a time period that is either pre-determined or dynamically determined, e.g., at runtime. In an example embodiment, the duration of the time period depends on factors such as: (1) the number of persons associated with the requesting player (e.g., the number of the requesting player's Facebook friends who are players of the MMO); (2) the requesting player's game status and game history; (3) the game mechanics including the criticality of the game task to progress in the game and the price (real or virtual) of the game task; and/or (4) social data about the requesting player or the persons associated with the requesting player who are also playing the MMO game (e.g., posts to the requesting player's Facebook profile and stream or posts to the profiles and streams of the requesting player's Facebook friends who are also playing the MMO game). For example, the requesting player might post a status update to his/her profile and/or stream indicating frustration with the lack of response to the request for assistance, resulting in a shortening of the time period used in operation <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Then in operation <b>204</b>, the software assigns completion of the game task to the requesting player and notifies the requesting player using an automated apparent response indicating the requested assistance was provided (e.g., by one or more of the persons associated with the requesting player) if: (1) all or enough of the persons associated with the requesting player (e.g., the requesting player's Facebook friends who are also playing the MMO game) do not respond or respond negatively within the time period; and (2) if assignment of completion of the task is otherwise permitted by the game mechanics.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As indicated above, the duration of the time period in operation <b>203</b> depends on a number of representative factors, one of which is the requesting player's game status and game history. The requesting player's game status might depend on, among other things, the game resources currently available to the requesting player (e.g., the amount of the requesting player's virtual currency, virtual goods, virtual services, virtual energy, etc.) and/or the game level of the requesting player, in an example embodiment. Also in an example embodiment, the requesting player's history might include the number of times the requesting player has made the same or a similar request, including the number of times the requesting player has made a similar request in another MMO game on the same website. In an alternative example embodiment, the duration of the time period in operation <b>203</b> might also depend on the game status and the game history of each person associated with the requesting person.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a flowchart diagram that illustrates another process for transmitting an automated apparent response to a request for assistance on a game task, in accordance with an example embodiment. Here again, in an example embodiment, one or more of the operations in this process might be performed by software running on the webservers at website <b>103</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In an alternative example embodiment, one or more of the operations in this process might be performed by client software or a browser running on personal computing device <b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, software running on one or more webservers receives a player's request for assistance with a game task in massively multiplayer online (MMO) game (e.g., raising a barn in FarmVille), in operation <b>201</b>. In operation <b>202</b>, the software broadcasts the player's request (e.g., through a game graphic and/or notification) for assistance to persons associated with player through a team roster, a contact or buddy list, or an online social graph (or network).

Also, in an example embodiment, the request might be broadcast using an application programming interface (API) exposed by software running on a social networking website or social media website depicted as website <b>106</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In operation <b>203</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the software determines whether the persons associated with the requesting player (e.g., the requesting player's Facebook friends who are players of the MMO) respond to the request for assistance (e.g., by clicking on the graphic representing the request) within a time period that is either pre-determined or dynamically determined, e.g., at runtime. In an example embodiment, the duration of the determined time period depends on factors related to user data for the requesting player and game mechanics, as described earlier with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. Then in operation <b>204</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the software assigns completion of the game task to the requesting player and notifies the requesting player using an automated apparent response indicating that the requesting player is being rewarded for his/her status or virtuous and/or admirable game play (e.g., generosity in assisting other players with their game tasks or other similar quality) if: (1) all or enough of the persons associated with the requesting player (e.g., the requesting player's Facebook friends who are also playing the MMO game) do not respond or respond negatively within the determined time period; and (2) if assignment of completion of the task is otherwise permitted by the game mechanics.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a simplified software diagram that illustrates the server software stack for a social MMO game, in accordance with an example embodiment. As depicted in this figure, a player is using a web browser <b>301</b> with support for HTML5 and the Adobe Flash platform on a personal computing device (e.g., a laptop or smartphone) to interact with a software stack <b>303</b> on a website hosting a social MMO game. In an example embodiment, such a software stack might be implemented using a public, private, or hybrid cloud platform, e.g., a hybrid cloud platform whose public cloud is Amazon Electric Compute Cloud (EC2) and whose private cloud is built using Cloud.com's CloudStack software. Of course, in an alternative example embodiment, the software stack might be implemented using other public clouds and/or other private clouds that provide similar functionality. Or, the software stack might be implemented without resort to third-party cloud platforms (e.g., using load balancing and virtualization software provided by Citrix, VMware, Microsoft, or Xen, Map-Reduce and/or Google Filesystem software such as Hadoop, memory management/caching software such as Memcached and Membase, structured storage software such as MySQL, NoSQL, etc.). Parenthetically, it will be appreciated that SQL is an acronym which stands for Structured Query Language.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the software stack <b>303</b> includes load balancers <b>304</b> (e.g., the load balancing and virtualization software provided by Citrix, VMware, Microsoft, or Xen) that balance the load between the webservers (e.g., Apache HTTP servers) in an elastic (or dynamic) array <b>305</b>. It will be appreciated that the array is elastic because its size can be increased to accommodate additional webservers and decreased to accommodate fewer webservers. As further depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the webservers in the elastic array <b>305</b> transmit HTTP requests to and from the web browser <b>301</b> and webservers on a social networking (or social media) website <b>302</b> such as Facebook. In an example embodiment, the webservers read data in a relatively &#x201c;hot&#x201d; state from and write data in a relatively &#x201c;hot&#x201d; state to memory caches <b>306</b> (e.g., memory caches created with Memcached and managed with MemBase), which in turn are backed by NoSQL databases <b>307</b>. It will be appreciated that performance latencies can be significantly reduced by such an arrangement, which exploits both locality of reference and an absence of database-query overhead. But to conserve cache resources and reduce the size (and therefore the search time) of NoSQL databases, among other reasons, the webservers also read and write data to sync queues <b>308</b> in memory, which in turn, might be connected to query-language databases (e.g., MySQL) <b>309</b>. It will be appreciated that this queued arrangement enables the deferred persistent storage of data which is not in a relatively &#x201c;hot&#x201d; state, e.g., a request for assistance with a game task as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a simplified diagram that illustrates a sequence of transmissions associated with a social MMO game accessed from a social networking website, in accordance with an example embodiment. As used here and elsewhere in this disclosure, the term &#x201c;social networking website&#x201d; is to be broadly interpreted to include, for example, any website that allows its users to selectively access (e.g., according to a contact list, buddy list, social graph, etc.) each other's profiles and/or streams or selectively communicate (e.g., according to a contact list, buddy list, social graph, etc.) with each other (e.g., using a messaging protocol such as email, instant messaging, short message service or SMS, etc.). As depicted in this diagram, a player has used a browser <b>401</b> on a client computer to log onto a social networking website, e.g., server software <b>402</b> (e.g., Facebook).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In operation <b>1</b>, the player clicks on a graphic for a social MMO game, causing browser <b>401</b> to transmit an HTTP request to server software <b>402</b> (e.g., Facebook) for the game's initial web page. In operation <b>2</b>, server software <b>402</b> (e.g., Facebook) returns an HTML5 and JavaScript (JS) web page consisting of an iFrame (e.g., Facebook &#x201c;chrome&#x201d;) and an iFrame HTML tag for the game's initial web page. In operation <b>3</b>, the browser uses the HTML tag to transmit a request to server software <b>403</b> (e.g., Zynga) for the game's initial web page to display inside the iFrame. The game's initial web page might be an application server page (e.g., PHP 5) or an HTML5 page. In operation <b>4</b>, the application server page executes on server software <b>403</b> (e.g., Zynga), resulting in requests to databases and other servers as needed to complete generation of the web page, including possibly an HTTP request (not shown) transmitted to an API exposed by server software <b>402</b> (e.g., Facebook). In operation <b>5</b>, the server software <b>403</b> (e.g. Zynga) returns the game's initial web page (e.g., HTML5 and JS) for the browser to display in the iFrame.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">At some point thereafter, in operation <b>6</b>, the player clicks on a graphic (e.g., representing a graphical user interface or GUI widget) on a game web page (e.g., HTML5 and JS), causing browser <b>401</b> to transmit an HTTP request to server software <b>403</b> (e.g., Zynga), requesting assistance on a game task. In operation <b>7</b>, the server software <b>403</b> (e.g. Zynga) returns a web page (e.g., HTML5 and JS) to the browser indicating that the request was received. In operation <b>8</b>, the server software <b>403</b> (e.g., Zynga) transmits an HTTP request to an API exposed by server software <b>402</b> (e.g., Facebook), posting a request for assistance to the profiles (e.g., through a Facebook notification) and/or streams of the requesting player's friends on the social network managed by server software <b>402</b> (e.g., Facebook). It will be appreciated that in order to access the friends' profiles and/or streams (e.g., using an access token), the server software <b>403</b> (e.g., Zynga) might have earlier obtained permission from the friends, e.g., when they joined the game. Then in operation <b>9</b>, server software <b>402</b> (e.g., Facebook) sends a response, e.g., in Java Script Object Notation (JSON), to server software <b>403</b> (e.g., Zynga) describing the success or failure of the posting to each profile and/or stream. In a subsequent session, server software <b>403</b> (e.g., Zynga) might use operations similar to operations <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> to transmit an automated apparent response to the player, as described earlier.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an alternative example embodiment, the game's initial web page (or some subsequent web page served up by the game) might have an Adobe Flash application (e.g., a Small Web Format or SWF file) embedded in it. In this alternative example embodiment, the user of browser <b>401</b> might thereafter interact with the Adobe Flash application (e.g., its GUI), causing it to interact with the server software <b>402</b> (e.g., Facebook) and the server software <b>403</b> (e.g., Zynga).</p>
