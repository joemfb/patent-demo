<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to communications and in particular to methods, devices and systems for closed subscriber group (CSG) roaming.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Radiocommunication networks were originally developed primarily to provide voice services over circuit-switched networks. The introduction of packet-switched bearers in, for example, the so-called 2.5 generation (G) and 3G networks enabled network operators to provide data services as well as voice services. Eventually, network architectures will likely evolve toward all Internet Protocol (IP) networks which provide both voice and data services. However, network operators have a substantial investment in existing infrastructures and would, therefore, typically prefer to migrate gradually to all IP network architectures in order to allow them to extract sufficient value from their investment in existing infrastructures. Also to provide the capabilities needed to support next generation radiocommunication applications, while at the same time using legacy infrastructure, network operators could deploy hybrid networks wherein a next generation radiocommunication system is overlaid onto an existing circuit-switched or packet-switched network as a first step in the transition to an all IP-based network. Alternatively, a radiocommunication system can evolve from one generation to the next while still providing backward compatibility for legacy equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Specification is ongoing in 3GPP for Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) that is the next generation of Radio Access Network (RAN). Another name for E-UTRAN, used in the present specification, is Long Term Evolution (LTE) RAN. The core network to which E-UTRAN is connected is called Evolved Packet Core (EPC), also known as System Architecture Evolution (SAE) network. Both the E-UTRAN and the EPC (and possibly some other node(s), such as the Home Subscriber Server (HSS), depending on the definition of the EPC) comprise together the Evolved Packet System (EPS), which is also known as the SAE/LTE network. A base station in this concept is called an E-UTRAN NodeB (eNodeB or eNB). These ongoing studies also include the possibility to have an E-UTRAN base station which provides home or small area coverage for a limited number of users. This base station is, in 3GPP and in this document, called a Home E-UTRAN NodeB (HeNB) or home base station. Other names used for this type of base station are LTE Home Access Point (LTE HAP) and LTE Femto Access Point (LTE FAP). In 3G Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) the equivalent base station to an HeNB is referred to as a Home Node B (HNB). While HeNBs are used herein, similar concepts apply to the HNB of the 3G UMTS systems.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An HeNB typically provides regular service for the end users and can be connected to the mobile core network using an IP-based transmission link. The radio service coverage provided by an HeNB is called a femtocell in this application. Furthermore, a femtocell is normally a Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) cell, i.e., a cell in which only a limited but variable set of users is normally allowed to access the network. The HeNB would, in most cases, use the end user's already existing broadband connection (e.g. xDSL and Cable) to achieve connectivity to the operator's Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) and possibly to other eNBs/HeNBs. One of the main reasons for providing wireless local access using HeNBs and femtocells is to provide cheaper calls or transaction rates/charges when a device (e.g., a mobile phone) is connected via an HeNB as compared to when that device is connected via an eNB.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">More generally, an HeNB and similar devices can be considered to be a sort of &#x201c;home base station&#x201d;. As used herein, the term &#x201c;home&#x201d; is used to modify the phrase &#x201c;base station&#x201d; to distinguish such equipment from other conventional base stations based upon characteristics such as one or more of: (1) geographic radio coverage provided (i.e., home base station coverage area is normally less than &#x201c;regular&#x201d; base station coverage area), (2) subscriber access (i.e., the subscribers who can obtain service from the home base station may be limited whereas a &#x201c;regular&#x201d; base station will typically provide access to any subscribers (or at least to a larger group of subscribers than a home base station) who are within range), and (3) home base stations are normally installed by the end users themselves without any intervention from the operator's personnel, whereas regular base stations are typically installed by operator personnel. This latter quality of home base stations suggests that the installation will generally be highly automated and of a &#x201c;plug and play&#x201d; nature. Note, however, that home base stations need not literally be installed in personal residences, and may find applications in businesses, public areas, etc., wherein the qualities of a home base station are desirable to, e.g., supplement coverage provided by regular base stations. Home gateways, as the phrase is used herein, are gateways which interface home base stations with a node in the radiocommunication system, e.g., a core network node.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When a subscriber from one PLMN visits another PLMN this is referred to as &#x201c;roaming&#x201d;. Therefore, in the context of this document, when a subscriber is included in the CSG of another PLMN/operator than the subscriber's home operator, this is referred to as &#x201c;CSG roaming&#x201d; and the concerned subscriber is referred to as a &#x201c;foreign subscriber&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The problem that arises in conjunction with CSG roaming is related to the management of CSG data and CSG Whitelists, which are designed with a single PLMN in mind (to which both the HeNB and the CSG members are assumed to belong). The CSG data is managed by the Operation Maintenance Administration and Provisioning (OMA&#x26;P) system (sometimes also known as OAM&#x26;P system) of the PLMN to which the HeNB connects. The OMA&#x26;P system deals with, for example, configuration, supervision and tuning of the radiocommunication network, administration of subscriber related data and provisioning of data, features and services. The CSG Whitelist of a subscriber, which includes identities of the CSGs the subscriber is a member of and thus is allowed to access, is managed by the OMA&#x26;P system and the HSS of the subscriber's home PLMN and the subscriber's UE (e.g., its USIM). Finally, the CSG based access control is handled by a control plane core network node, e.g., an MME or SGSN (or possibly MSC or MSC server)) which the HeNB is connected to, i.e., a core network node of the PLMN of the HeNB and associated CSG. Hence, if the HeNB and a subscriber included in the CSG belong to different PLMNs, cooperation between the involved entities of the two different PLMNs is required to manage the CSG data and the CSG Whitelist, as well as the CSG based access control. This cooperation and information transfer that is needed is not possible to achieve with the currently assumed architecture and functionality, due to lack of the required inter-PLMN interfaces and procedures. Specifically, the OMA&#x26;P systems of two different PLMNs cannot communicate this type of CSG information directly to update each other.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, data generally cannot be exchanged between the OMA&#x26;P system of one PLMN and the HSS of another PLMN and the OMA&#x26;P system of one PLMN cannot transfer data (e.g., using Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) device management (DM) or over-the-air (OTA) technology) to the UE of a subscriber of another PLMN. OMA DM is a protocol designed for configuration and management of mobile devices which runs on top of IP and is thus basically network independent. OTA technology comprises techniques for configuring data, installing features, etc. in mobile terminals, including SIM/USIM applications, over the radio interface (also known as the air interface, hence the name OTA) while the mobile terminal is being used in regular operation, e.g., by a user to make calls. A typical OTA technology is based on the Short Message Service (SMS).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As an example illustrating the problem, assume an owner of an HeNB adds a foreign subscriber to the CSG of the HeNB. The foreign subscriber is thus added to the CSG data in an OMA&#x26;P system of the network operator that serves the network to which the HeNB connects. The OMA&#x26;P system would then normally inform the network operator's HSS so that the HSS can update the CSG Whitelist in the data record of the concerned subscriber, but the OMA&#x26;P system cannot generally communicate with the foreign subscriber's HSS due to a lack of interfaces and/or interface standardization between these nodes. If OMA DM or OTA technology is used for configuring the CSG Whitelist in the UE, the OMA&#x26;P system would normally also perform this task, but the OMA&#x26;P system is not authorized to configure data in the UE of a foreign subscriber (e.g., it lacks the appropriate security related data and possibly other required data/information). Consequently the UE based CSG Whitelist will not be updated accordingly, so the UE will not become aware that it is included in a new CSG. If the UE should still attempt to access the HeNB, e.g., after a manual override attempt of the UE based CSG Whitelist, a consequence is that the core network node performing the CSG based access control (the core network node serving the UE) will receive a CSG Whitelist from the HSS of the foreign subscriber, which does not include the CSG ID of the concerned CSG and hence the CSG based access control will fail and the UE will be rejected for gaining access to that HeNB.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, it would be desirable to have methods and systems which address the afore-described issues associated with CSG roaming.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The following detailed description of the exemplary embodiments refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings identify the same or similar elements. Also, the following detailed description does not limit the invention. Instead, the scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Prior to discussing aspects of the exemplary embodiments below, a purely illustrative overview of a system in which closed subscriber group (CSG) roaming as well as CSG Whitelist information exchange can occur, will now be described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> to provide some context for this discussion. According to exemplary embodiments, a communication system in which signaling connections can be established is shown generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and includes various user equipments (UEs) <b>108</b>, e.g., mobile phones, laptop computers and personal digital assistants (PDAs), which communicate over a wireless interface with an Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) <b>106</b>. The E-UTRAN <b>106</b> communicates with nodes in the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) <b>104</b> over S1 interface(s). The EPC <b>104</b> can then route calls/requests from the UEs <b>108</b> to various separate networks and services as shown generally by the Internet/Operator Service <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to exemplary embodiments, a long term evolution (LTE) radio access network (RAN)/system architecture evolution (SAE) network can include various control functions and nodes for radio resource management. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a simplified version of an Operator Network <b>202</b> which includes an Operation Maintenance Administration and Provisioning (OMA&#x26;P) system <b>204</b>, a Home Subscriber Server (HSS) <b>210</b> and an Evolved Packet Core (EPC) <b>206</b>. An OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> is generally a focal point from which an operator can control the network <b>202</b> and perform functions such as configuration of network components and other operations/maintenance support functions. The EPC <b>206</b> includes a mobility management entity (MME) <b>208</b> which can perform (and/or support) various functions of the network such as, bearer management functions, authentication and gateway selection (e.g. selection of the Serving GW (SGW)). The home subscriber server (HSS) <b>210</b> is a database containing subscriber information which supports authentication/authorization issues associated with UEs <b>214</b>, <b>222</b> (and other nodes) as well as subscription related data for all subscribers in the network. Note that the HSS <b>210</b> may sometimes, depending on the EPC definition, be considered to be a part of the EPC <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The EPC <b>206</b> also includes a Serving Gateway (SGW)/Packet Data Network Gateway (PDN GW) <b>212</b>. The SGW function performs a variety of tasks, such as packet routing and forwarding, mobility anchoring for inter-3GPP mobility, i.e. mobility between different cellular networks using 3GPP technology, as well as being the gateway which terminates the S1-U interface towards the E-UTRAN <b>216</b>. The PDN GW (PGW) function also performs a variety of tasks, such as IP address allocation for UEs <b>214</b>, <b>222</b>, and is a link to other networks, e.g., the Internet, as well as being an anchor point for mobility between 3GPP networks and non-3GPP networks. While shown as a single entity, the SGW/PDN GW <b>212</b> can be implemented as separate entities within the EPC <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The E-UTRAN <b>216</b> includes a number of eNodeBs (eNB) <b>218</b>, <b>220</b> which communicate with the EPC <b>206</b> over versions of the S1 interface, e.g., S1-MME towards the MME(s) and S1-U towards the SGW(s). Additionally, the eNBs <b>218</b>, <b>220</b> can communicate wirelessly with various UEs <b>214</b>, <b>222</b> over a wireless interface denoted by &#x201c;LTE-Uu&#x201d;. The connection between the eNB <b>220</b> and an MME (which may be the same as or different from MME <b>208</b>) is omitted to simplify the figure. Other connections have also been omitted to simplify the figure, e.g., the OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> can be connected to all of the other nodes in the network in addition to the HSS <b>210</b>. Additionally, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, and as described in more detail below, that an eNB can be connected to a plurality of MMEs. Moreover, the eNBs <b>218</b> and <b>220</b> may also be considered to be part of the operator network <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">System architectures according to exemplary embodiments will also include HeNBs (or more generally &#x201c;home base stations&#x201d;) in addition to, potentially, those nodes illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows aspects of an exemplary LTE RAN architecture and relevant interfaces with, for example, eNBs <b>300</b> serving macrocells <b>302</b> and HeNBs <b>304</b> serving femtocells or microcells <b>306</b>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;home&#x201d; as it is used to modify the phrase &#x201c;base station&#x201d; is intended to distinguish such equipment from other conventional base stations based upon characteristics such as one or more of the three characteristics described above in the Background section of this application. Additionally, an HeNB <b>304</b> will typically have only one S1 connection toward the network, i.e., its connection to the HeNB GW <b>308</b>, whereas an eNB <b>300</b> will typically have multiple &#x201c;S1-flex&#x201d; connections toward various nodes in the network. Although the word &#x201c;home&#x201d; is used to distinguish these different types of equipment, it should be noted that home base stations are not limited to base stations which are literally disposed within a home nor are home base stations limited to base stations which provide radiocommunication service to only one home. For example, a home base station can be used to supplement coverage of a &#x201c;regular&#x201d; base station in congested public areas or the home base station can be owned by a business enterprise and located in various facilities owned by the enterprise. Similarly, a home gateway is a gateway or concentrator node which connects one or more home base stations to one or more nodes in a core network <b>310</b>, e.g., an SGW/PDN GW <b>212</b> and/or an MME <b>208</b>, but is not itself typically located within a home. The HeNB Concentrator Node <b>308</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is also referred to herein as an HeNB Gateway (HeNB GW) or, more generally, a &#x201c;home gateway&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">However, the home gateway node <b>308</b> may also provide some of the functionality which would otherwise be provided by the home base stations <b>304</b> so that these home base stations <b>304</b> can be kept relatively simple and cheap. One example of such functionality is the RAN part of the CN Pool (e.g., MME Pool) functionality (sometimes also denoted &#x201c;S1-flex&#x201d; as mentioned above), e.g., selection of the MME Pool member, an MME <b>208</b>, for a particular UE <b>108</b>, that can be implemented in the home gateway node <b>308</b>. The home gateway <b>308</b> may also hide the signaling load related to turning on and off the home base stations <b>304</b> from the core network <b>310</b>. For example, when an HeNB <b>304</b> is powered on and off and then on again then only the S1 interface between the HeNB <b>304</b> and the HeNB GW <b>308</b> is affected (e.g. established, torn down, re-established, etc.) without the involvement of the MME(s) <b>208</b>. UEs <b>108</b> which are located within a femtocell <b>306</b> may obtain radiocommunication service from either that femtocell or the overlapping macrocell <b>302</b> (if one is present), according to rules established for this particular network.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As described above, a femtocell <b>306</b> (i.e., a coverage area of an HeNB <b>304</b>) may be a closed subscriber group (CSG) cell. This means that, normally, only a selected group of subscribers are allowed to access the network through that cell. Accordingly, the HeNB <b>304</b> broadcasts information to inform UEs <b>108</b> that a cell is a CSG cell. In addition, a CSG cell is identified by a CSG identifier (ID), which is also broadcast in the cell by the HeNB <b>304</b> as a part of the system information. Typically, each CSG cell has its own unique CSG ID, but it may also be possible to define the same CSG ID for multiple cells, thereby forming a CSG zone, in which the same selected group of subscribers is allowed access.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Hence, not all subscribers may be allowed to access a certain HeNB <b>304</b> and a certain subscriber may not be allowed to access all HeNBs <b>304</b>. Typically, a CSG administrator (typically the owner of a HeNB <b>304</b>&#x2014;henceforth CSG administrator and HeNB owner are used interchangeably) defines which subscribers are allowed to access a femtocell <b>306</b> (CSG cell) of the HeNB <b>304</b>, i.e., defines which subscribers that are included in the CSG of the femtocell <b>306</b>). Therefore, the HeNB <b>304</b> can be considered to be associated with or as serving the CSG which is accessed through the HeNB <b>304</b>. The information that identifies the subscribers who are allowed to access a particular CSG cell is herein referred to as &#x201c;CSG data&#x201d;, &#x201c;CSG status&#x201d;, &#x201c;CSG definition&#x201d;, &#x201c;CSG subscriber list&#x201d;, &#x201c;CSG Whitelist&#x201d; or &#x201c;HeNB access list&#x201d; (which is an equivalent term assuming that the HeNB <b>304</b> only serves one CSG which is often expected to be the case).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to exemplary embodiments, two (or more) PLMNs can communicate with each other regarding CSG roaming, and a UE <b>108</b> based in one PLMN can obtain access to a CSG associated with a second PLMN. In order to facilitate this exemplary information exchange, interfaces are described below which allow information to be transmitted, in both directions, between an Operation Maintenance Administration and Provisioning (OMA&#x26;P) system to an MME (or MME pool) both of which are located in the same PLMN and for information to be transmitted, in both directions, between an MME in one PLMN to an HSS located in a separate PLMN. The exemplary information flows described below can occur over currently existing interfaces which, while not traditionally used for these information flows, can be adapted for such usage to provide improved CSG roaming implementations without requiring the design and standardization of wholly new interfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">An exemplary architecture which, in combination with that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, can be used to transmit CSG Whitelist information and support CSG roaming according to exemplary embodiments is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. HeNB <b>304</b>, e.g., owned by a subscriber to a (home) PLMN <b>202</b>, is an access point to femtocell <b>306</b> and has a CSG associated therewith controlled by the owner/subscriber. PLMN <b>202</b> includes an OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b>, HSS <b>412</b> and MME <b>208</b>. Communications can flow between the PLMN <b>202</b> and a &#x201c;foreign&#x201d; PLMN <b>408</b> through, for example, the S6a interface <b>410</b>, which connects the MME <b>208</b> and the foreign HSS <b>402</b>. The foreign PLMN <b>408</b> includes a foreign HSS <b>402</b>, a foreign MME <b>406</b> and a foreign OMA&#x26;P system <b>404</b>. UE <b>414</b> is associated with a subscriber of the foreign PLMN <b>408</b> whose access to a CSG associated with the PLMN <b>202</b> has changed, e.g., the UE <b>414</b> has had access granted or removed to the CSG associated with HeNB <b>304</b>. Additionally, UE <b>414</b> can have communications, in some cases, with entities in both the PLMN <b>202</b> (i.e. the home PLMN of the HeNB <b>304</b> and its owner) and the foreign PLMN <b>408</b> (which is the home PLMN of the user associated with the UE <b>414</b>). As used herein &#x201c;foreign&#x201d; describes and differentiates entities associated with anything other than the PLMN <b>202</b> of the HeNB <b>304</b> and its owner.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to exemplary embodiments, CSG data may be created and/or modified, e.g., to add or remove subscribers from the CSG. The CSG data may be created via a web interface (or other interface between the HeNB <b>304</b> owner and the network operator of PLMN <b>202</b>), for example, the CSG data may be entered by a subscriber associated with the HeNB <b>304</b>, via a web interface to the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b>. The CSG data is stored in a database in the home operator's network <b>202</b>, which may be part of the operator's OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b>. Note that the entities interacting with the HeNB <b>304</b>'s owner for CSG data manipulation purposes may be entities devoted to subscriber administration/provisioning and as such regarded as part of the OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A subscriber, from a foreign PLMN <b>408</b> or the home PLMN <b>202</b>, may be included in a CSG subscriber list indefinitely, e.g., until explicitly removed, or on a time limited basis, e.g., one week, which is often referred to as a &#x201c;guest&#x201d;. Typically, the HeNB <b>304</b> owner identifies the subscribers, both home and foreign, who should be included in the CSG data by providing to the network operator the ISDN numbers (MSISDN), IMSIs or other identifiers of the concerned subscribers.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The CSG data is reflected in so-called CSG Whitelists associated with the concerned UEs <b>414</b>. Each UE <b>414</b> has a CSG Whitelist, which includes the CSG ID of each CSG that the UE <b>414</b> (or more precisely the subscriber using the UE <b>414</b>) is included in, i.e., the CSG Whitelist includes the CSG ID of each femtocell <b>306</b> that the UE/subscriber <b>414</b> is allowed to access. A CSG is more directly associated with a group of subscribers rather than a group of UEs <b>414</b>, but for simplicity UEs <b>414</b> will often be identified herein as the elements of which a CSG is formed. Similarly, a CSG Whitelist is more directly associated with a subscriber&#x2014;not a UE <b>414</b>, but herein the UE <b>414</b> shall be used as a proxy for the subscriber using the UE <b>414</b>, such that a CSG Whitelist may be referred to as belonging to the UE <b>414</b> and the UE <b>414</b> may be said to be allowed or not allowed access to a CSG cell.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The CSG Whitelist of a subscriber can be stored in the home HSS <b>412</b> of the subscriber's home PLMN <b>202</b> together with other subscriber data. The CSG Whitelist may be transferred from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> to the home HSS <b>412</b>, where it is distributed to appropriate subscriber records. This applies to both creation and updates, i.e., additions or exclusions of subscribers, of the CSG data. It is also possible for the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> to maintain its own copies of the CSG Whitelists or to assemble them from the CSG data when needed. The CSG Whitelist of a subscriber is also stored in the UE <b>414</b> (on, for example, a data storage card in the UE <b>414</b>, such as a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card or a Universal SIM (USIM) card) of the subscriber, so that the UE <b>414</b> itself can determine whether it is allowed to access a certain CSG cell or not in order to avoid useless access attempts. The CSG Whitelist may be transferred from the network to the UE <b>414</b> via open mobile alliance (OMA) device management (DM), NAS signaling, Over-The-Air (OTA) USIM configuration technology, Short Message Service (SMS), or some other technology.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Furthermore according to exemplary embodiments, in EPS the CSG Whitelist of a UE <b>414</b> is downloaded from the foreign HSS <b>402</b> to the MME serving the UE <b>414</b>, e.g., the MME <b>208</b> also known as the serving MME <b>208</b> in this case. Other information can also be transmitted at or near this time, e.g., other subscriber data which is relevant for the serving MME <b>208</b> and which includes both the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) and the Mobile Subscriber Integrated Service Digital Network Number (MSISDN) of the subscriber so that the MME <b>208</b> can perform CSG based access control of UEs <b>414</b> requesting network access via a CSG cell. This mechanism is likely to be similar in 3G, utilizing a node corresponding to the MME <b>208</b>, e.g., the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) and/or the Mobile Switching Center (MSC) server.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The search for allowed CSG cells is not governed by the network, but is left to the UE <b>414</b> to handle autonomously. To identify an allowed CSG cell, the UE <b>414</b> reads the CSG ID from the system information broadcast in the cell and compares it with the CSG ID(s) stored in its CSG Whitelist. When a match is found the UE <b>414</b> has discovered an allowed CSG cell, e.g. associated with a home base station. In the exemplary embodiments the identifier used to identify a subscriber in CSG data is the MSISDN of the subscriber. However, it should be understood that the IMSI of the subscriber may well be used as an alternative to the MSISDN, even though the exemplary embodiments typically only mention the MSISDN.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to exemplary embodiments, when a HeNB <b>304</b> owner includes (or removes) a foreign subscriber in (from) the CSG of an HeNB <b>304</b>, CSG data update information, e.g., information associating the subscriber's MSISDN with the CSG ID of the CSG, is stored in the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> of the home PLMN <b>202</b> to which the HeNB <b>304</b> owner belongs. The removal of a subscriber in a CSG Whitelist may be noticed in the CSG update information by a lack of a previous subscriber in the message instead of some form of positive confirmation of removal. The home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> transfers this CSG data update information to the MMEs in the MME pool to which the HeNB <b>304</b> is connected. When the concerned foreign subscriber registers with one of these MMEs, the MME <b>208</b> obtains the foreign subscriber's CSG Whitelist from the foreign subscriber's HSS <b>402</b> via, according to exemplary embodiments, the S6a interface between an MME <b>208</b> serving a visiting subscriber and the visiting (foreign) subscriber's HSS <b>402</b>. The serving MME <b>208</b> then compares the CSG data update information it received from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> with the CSG Whitelist received from the foreign HSS <b>402</b> to determine whether the CSG ID of the CSG needs to be added or removed from the CSG Whitelist. If the serving MME <b>208</b> determines that the CSG Whitelist needs to be updated, the serving MME <b>208</b> informs the foreign subscriber's HSS <b>402</b> that the Whitelist needs to be updated. In response, the foreign HSS <b>402</b> updates the CSG Whitelist that it maintains. The serving MME <b>208</b> may immediately inform the foreign subscriber's HSS <b>402</b> that the Whitelist needs to be updated in response to determining that the list needs to be updated or the serving MME <b>208</b> may inform the foreign HSS <b>402</b> at a later time, e.g., when the serving MME <b>208</b> has some message that it needs to send to the foreign HSS <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The serving MME <b>208</b> may also proactively update the CSG Whitelist stored in the foreign subscriber's UE <b>414</b>, e.g., via Network Access Stratum (NAS) signaling. Otherwise, the update of the CSG Whitelist in the foreign subscriber's HSS <b>402</b> triggers the foreign subscriber's PLMN <b>408</b> to initiate the regular mechanism for updating the CSG Whitelist in the UE <b>414</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Problems associated with updating CSG Whitelists, as well as the CSG based access control work for CSG roaming, typically stem from the lack of interfaces and procedures between the nodes in different PLMNs which are required to make the management of CSG data and CSG Whitelists as well as the CSG based access control work for CSG roaming. Exemplary embodiments described below are structured into different scenarios, which scenarios illustrate different cases of the location or state of a foreign subscriber's UE <b>414</b> and during which the foreign subscriber is added to (or removed from) a CSG. The flowcharts of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref> summarize the exemplary steps and information flows of the various exemplary embodiments used in CSG roaming.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">According to one exemplary embodiment, as shown in the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, UE <b>414</b> is to register with an MME <b>208</b> from the MME Pool (not shown) to which the HeNB <b>304</b> is connected (probably, but not necessarily, via a HeNB GW) at the time the UE <b>414</b> is added to the HeNB's <b>304</b> CSG. An MME Pool is a collection of MMEs in the core network of a PLMN <b>202</b>. In this exemplary embodiment, the foreign subscriber (FS) uses UE <b>414</b> to gain access, often via an associated macrocell (however if there is no macrocell the UE <b>414</b> may attempt to gain access via HeNB <b>304</b>), to the PLMN <b>202</b> of HeNB <b>304</b>. Thus UE <b>414</b> registers with an MME <b>208</b>, in step <b>502</b>, which is in an MME pool to which HeNB <b>304</b> is connected. The MME <b>208</b> with which UE <b>414</b> registers is called the serving MME <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Next, in step <b>504</b>, the serving MME <b>208</b> receives, from the foreign HSS <b>402</b> which is the HSS <b>402</b> associated with the foreign subscriber using UE <b>414</b>, data pertaining to the foreign subscriber and/or UE <b>414</b>, including a CSG Whitelist associated with the foreign subscriber and/or UE <b>414</b>. In step <b>506</b>, the owner of HeNB <b>304</b> adds (or removes) the foreign subscriber's MSISDN to (or from) HeNB's <b>304</b> CSG, e.g., the CSG for which HeNB <b>304</b> is the access point. The owner may, for example, do this using a web interface, as shown by dashed line <b>416</b> toward HeNB owner (or owner's computer) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, to an entity in the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b>. In step <b>508</b>, the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> transfers information related to HeNB's <b>304</b> CSG (e.g., the MSISDNs of each subscriber that is included in the CSG or other information that can be used by the MME <b>208</b> to determine that the foreign subscriber's MSISDN has been added to (or removed from) HeNB's <b>304</b> CSG) to the serving MME <b>208</b> (as well as to the other MMEs in the same MME pool as MME <b>208</b>) to which the HeNB <b>304</b> is connected. This way the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> ensures that the MME <b>208</b> has up-to-date CSG data for the CSGs belonging to the MME <b>208</b>. Additionally, while this exemplary embodiment (and other exemplary embodiments) refers to MME <b>208</b>, the information sent to MME <b>208</b> is typically also sent to the other MMEs in the same MME pool (not shown). This transfer may involve transfer of information between different entities in the OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> (e.g., between an entity receiving and/or storing CSG data and an entity responsible for management of MMEs). Also, regarding steps <b>502</b>-<b>508</b>, steps <b>502</b> and <b>504</b> may occur independently of steps <b>506</b> and <b>508</b> and as such steps <b>502</b> and <b>504</b> may occur before, after or in parallel with steps <b>506</b> and <b>508</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to exemplary embodiments, in step <b>510</b>, the serving MME <b>208</b>, which now serves the foreign subscriber's UE <b>414</b>, uses the information received from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> to determine whether the information related to HeNBs CSG received from the OMA&#x26;P includes the foreign subscriber's MSISDN. For example, the serving MME <b>208</b> identifies the MSISDN(s) in the received updated CSG data which is (are) affected by the update and discovers that there is a discrepancy between the received CSG Whitelist of the foreign subscriber and the received CSG data from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> and concludes that the CSG Whitelist of the foreign subscriber needs to be updated. Since the serving MME <b>208</b> is involved in CSG Whitelist updates in this manner only for foreign subscribers, the MME <b>208</b> according to this exemplary embodiment only needs to consider MSISDNs belonging to other PLMNs, e.g., foreign PLMN <b>408</b>, when checking for affected MSISDNs. After performing this determination in step <b>510</b>, the foreign HSS <b>402</b> is notified of the CSG Whitelist change in step <b>512</b> by the serving MME <b>208</b>. Next, in step <b>514</b>, the UE <b>414</b> is updated of the CSG Whitelist change. Steps <b>512</b> and <b>514</b> only need to be performed if a change in the CSG Whitelist occurs. According to exemplary embodiments, there are two options for accomplishing these updates to the foreign HSS <b>402</b> and the UE <b>414</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">According to exemplary embodiments, both options, for performing steps <b>512</b> and <b>514</b> have the serving MME <b>208</b> communicating with the foreign subscriber's HSS <b>402</b> utilizing an existing interface, e.g., the S6a interface <b>410</b>. In the first exemplary option, a new MME-HSS procedure (message pair) is introduced so that the serving MME <b>208</b> can relatively immediately inform the HSS <b>402</b> that the CSG Whitelist associated with UE <b>414</b> needs to be updated, thereby triggering the regular update mechanism for the UE <b>414</b> based CSG Whitelist. In the second exemplary option, MME <b>208</b> handles things locally by itself, including proactive updating of the UE <b>414</b> based CSG Whitelist and CSG based access control in accordance with the new information, until there is a message to be sent, for some other reason, to the foreign subscriber's HSS <b>402</b> in which the CSG information, i.e., the CSG Whitelist update, can be included. These two exemplary options are elaborated below.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the first exemplary option for performing steps <b>512</b> and <b>514</b>, as shown in the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, MME <b>208</b> updates the foreign HSS <b>402</b> relatively immediately using an exemplary S6a Procedure. In response to receiving the CSG data from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b>, the serving MME <b>208</b> relatively immediately updates the foreign subscriber's HSS <b>402</b>, in step <b>602</b>, using a exemplary MME-HSS procedure over the S6a interface. This new, exemplary procedure can consist of a request message, e.g., a CSG Whitelist update request message, from the serving MME <b>208</b>. According to exemplary embodiments, this request message can contain: a subscriber identity, e.g., the IMSI, of the concerned subscriber; the CSG ID of the concerned CSG; and optionally, an indication of whether the update concerns an inclusion or exclusion from the CSG. The subscriber identity may be implicit in the request message. For example, the request message may include information, e.g., a header parameter, that ties the message to a particular context in terms of subscriber or session. Furthermore, the inclusion/exclusion indication may be optional, since this information can be derived from the existing CSG Whitelist that is to be updated. If this CSG Whitelist already contains the concerned CSG ID, then the update is an exclusion, whereas if the CSG Whitelist does not contain the concerned CSG ID, then the update is an inclusion.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">According to exemplary embodiments, the request message from the serving MME <b>208</b> may also optionally contain the PLMN ID, e.g., consisting of the mobile country code (MCC) and mobile network code (MNC), of the visiting (V) PLMN, i.e., the PLMN <b>202</b> of the serving MME <b>208</b>. However, the foreign HSS <b>402</b> typically inherently knows which PLMN <b>202</b> the message is received from. Upon reception of the request message, the foreign HSS <b>402</b> updates the subscriber's CSG Whitelist accordingly in step <b>604</b>, may also notify the foreign OMA&#x26;P system <b>404</b> in step <b>606</b> and returns a response/acknowledgement message to the serving MME <b>208</b> in step <b>608</b>. When including a CSG ID from another PLMN <b>202</b> in a CSG Whitelist of a subscriber, the HSS <b>402</b> stores the PLMN ID (MCC and MNC) of the concerned PLMN <b>202</b>, i.e., the PLMN <b>202</b> to which HeNB <b>304</b> connects, together with the HeNB's <b>304</b> CSG ID. This storage of multiple types of identification information is performed because the CSG ID is unique only within a single PLMN <b>202</b>, so the PLMN ID is typically needed to uniquely identify the CSG. The usage of the PLMN ID to make a CSG ID globally unique, and thus stored together with a CSG ID in the CSG Whitelist, is typical for exemplary embodiments (although the PLMN ID may be omitted for CSG IDs of the same PLMN as the HSS and the subscriber belongs to). Note, however that for simplicity of the description the PLMN ID is not explicitly mentioned every time a CSG ID in a CSG Whitelist appears in the descriptions of exemplary embodiments herein.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Returning to the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the foreign subscriber's PLMN <b>404</b> then updates the CSG Whitelist in the foreign subscriber's UE <b>414</b> in step <b>610</b>. Also the CSG Whitelist in the UE <b>414</b> has to include the PLMN ID of PLMN <b>202</b> together with any foreign CSG ID. Optionally, the PLMN ID of the PLMN <b>402</b> (i.e. the home PLMN of the subscriber associated with the UE) may be omitted for CSG IDs of the PLMN <b>402</b> in the CSG Whitelist, since the PLMN ID of the PLMN <b>402</b> may be the default PLMN ID.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to exemplary embodiments, for step <b>610</b>, if NAS signaling is used for conveying CSG Whitelist updates to the UE <b>414</b>, or the USIM of the UE <b>414</b> denoted herein by &#x201c;UE/USIM <b>414</b>&#x201d;, the foreign HSS <b>402</b> requests the serving MME <b>208</b> to update the concerned UE/USIM <b>414</b>. This can be performed by, for example, using the Insert Subscriber Data request message to update the serving MME <b>208</b> when subscriber data is changed in the foreign HSS <b>402</b>. The serving MME <b>208</b> then can update the CSG Whitelist in the UE/USIM <b>414</b> using NAS signaling, e.g., the globally unit temporary identity (GUTI) reallocation procedure or a new NAS procedure optionally preceded by a paging procedure. If a new NAS procedure is to be used, it should consist of a new pair of request-response messages. According to an alternative exemplary embodiment, the serving MME <b>208</b> may perform this procedure proactively without waiting for a request from the foreign HSS <b>402</b>, in which case the request from the foreign HSS <b>402</b> can be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to another alternative exemplary embodiment, if OMA DM or OTA technology is used to update the CSG Whitelist in the UE/USIM <b>414</b>, the foreign HSS <b>402</b> notifies the OMA&#x26;P system <b>404</b> of the foreign subscriber's PLMN <b>408</b> of the updated CSG Whitelist and the foreign OMA&#x26;P system <b>404</b> then updates the CSG Whitelist in the UE/USIM <b>414</b> using the regular procedure. According to exemplary embodiments, both OMA DM and OTA technology can be used when the concerned UE <b>414</b> is attached to another PLMN. At this stage all necessary updates are concluded and then communications service provision can continue according to regular procedures for HeNB <b>304</b> access and CSG based access control.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to another exemplary embodiment for performing steps <b>512</b> and <b>514</b>, as shown in the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the serving MME <b>208</b> handles processing locally until there is a message to be transmitted to the foreign HSS <b>402</b>. In this exemplary option, the serving MME <b>208</b> does not inform the foreign HSS <b>402</b> immediately. Instead the serving MME <b>208</b> does proactively, i.e., without waiting for a request from the foreign HSS <b>402</b>, update the CSG Whitelist in the UE/USIM <b>414</b> in step <b>702</b> by, e.g., through NAS signaling as described above. This update may be done using a regular procedure, e.g., using the GUTI reallocation procedure, or a new NAS procedure which is optionally preceded by a paging procedure. When the serving MME <b>208</b> has a message to send to the foreign subscriber's HSS <b>402</b> concerning some other aspect of the foreign subscriber's service, e.g., a Cancel Location Answer message which is sent in response to a Cancel Location Request message which the foreign HSS <b>402</b> sends when the UE <b>414</b> has registered in another MME, the serving MME <b>208</b> includes in the message information about the CSG Whitelist update, e.g., the concerned CSG ID and optionally an indication of inclusion or exclusion in a CSG. Optionally, the serving MME <b>208</b> may also include in the message the IMSI of the foreign subscriber and/or the PLMN ID of the VPLMN, i.e., the PLMN <b>202</b> of the serving MME <b>208</b>. However, both these parameters are implicitly known by the foreign HSS <b>402</b>, since the foreign HSS <b>402</b> knows which PLMN <b>202</b> the message is sent from and it can derive the IMSI of the subscriber from the transaction context. Optionally, the serving MME <b>208</b> may also include in the message an indication of whether the CSG Whitelist in the UE/USIM <b>414</b> has already been successfully updated. The serving MME <b>208</b> may be allowed to include the CSG Whitelist update information in any MME-to-HSS message or possibly only in the Cancel Location Answer message. Upon delayed reception of the CSG Whitelist update information from the MME <b>208</b> (i.e. the MME serving the foreign subscriber in the PLMN he/she is visiting), the foreign HSS <b>402</b> updates the CSG Whitelist in the subscriber records of the concerned subscriber accordingly in step <b>704</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to exemplary embodiments, before the foreign HSS <b>402</b> is updated, the serving MME <b>208</b> typically needs to address a synchronization problem, because the foreign HSS <b>402</b> may send CSG Whitelist updates to the serving MME <b>208</b> to be conveyed to the UE <b>414</b>. These CSG Whitelist updates from the foreign HSS <b>402</b> may be triggered by other CSG data changes from, for example, a CSG belonging to the foreign subscriber's PLMN <b>408</b>. If such a CSG Whitelist update request from the foreign HSS <b>402</b> consists of a complete CSG Whitelist, rather than just indicating the changes to the CSG Whitelist, then this complete CSG Whitelist will not include the most recent update (i.e., the update that the serving MME <b>208</b> has not yet indicated to the foreign HSS <b>402</b>). If the serving MME <b>208</b> were to merely forward this CSG Whitelist to the UE <b>414</b> to replace the existing UE/USIM <b>414</b> based CSG Whitelist, then the CSG Whitelist update that the serving MME <b>208</b> previously proactively conveyed to the UE <b>414</b> would be erased. Therefore the serving MME <b>208</b> should preferably add or remove, in accordance with the concerned CSG data update, the concerned CSG ID to/from any CSG Whitelist that it forwards from the foreign HSS <b>402</b> to the UE <b>414</b>, until the foreign HSS <b>402</b> has been updated in step <b>706</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to exemplary embodiments, since the foreign HSS <b>402</b> knows that the serving MME <b>208</b> proactively updates the CSG Whitelist in the UE/USIM <b>414</b>, the foreign HSS <b>402</b> does not have to take any action to update the UE/USIM <b>414</b> based CSG Whitelist in response to the CSG Whitelist update information received from the serving MME <b>208</b>. However, if the above mentioned indication of successful/unsuccessful update of the UE/USIM <b>414</b> based CSG Whitelist is used and this indication indicates &#x2018;unsuccessful&#x2019;, then the foreign HSS <b>402</b> uses regular procedures to trigger such an update. That is, the foreign HSS <b>402</b> may request the serving MME <b>208</b> to update the UE/USIM <b>414</b> based CSG Whitelist in step <b>708</b>. However, if this request fails again, e.g., because the UE <b>414</b> has left the coverage area of the serving MME <b>208</b>, the foreign HSS <b>402</b> can try again to perform this update when the UE <b>414</b> subsequently registers in another MME (or re-registers in the same MME).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">This exemplary embodiment may, in some cases, be less suitable when OMA DM or OTA technology, instead of NAS signaling, is used for updating of the CSG Whitelist stored in UE <b>414</b>. In such cases, the serving MME <b>208</b> cannot proactively update the CSG Whitelist in the UE/USIM <b>414</b>. Furthermore, upon reception of the CSG Whitelist update information from the serving MME <b>208</b>, the foreign HSS <b>402</b> should notify the OMA&#x26;P system <b>404</b> in the foreign subscriber's PLMN <b>402</b>, so that the foreign OMA&#x26;P system <b>404</b> can update the UE/USIM <b>414</b> based CSG Whitelist. Since the UE/USIM <b>414</b> based CSG Whitelist is not proactively updated, there may be a significant delay between a modification to HeNB's <b>304</b> CSG and the reflection of this change in the UE/USIM <b>414</b> based CSG Whitelist. In the meantime, if the CSG data update was an inclusion of the concerned foreign subscriber, the foreign subscriber has to use manual override of the UE/USIM <b>414</b> based CSG Whitelist in order to access the concerned HeNB <b>304</b>. The CSG based access control will, however work, because the MMEs in the MME pool to which the HeNB <b>304</b> is connected (as previously described above) have received up-to-date CSG data from their home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to some exemplary embodiments, the information that is transferred from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b>, e.g., the information transferred as shown in step <b>508</b>, may include only identifiers, e.g., MSISDNs, associated with foreign subscribers that are included in the HeNB's <b>304</b> CSG. According to an alternative exemplary embodiment, which is described in more detail below, the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> only transfers information indicating new CSG data updates concerning foreign subscribers, i.e., inclusions or removals of foreign subscribers. Since the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> selects the MME pool that the HeNB <b>204</b> connects to during the installation of the HeNB <b>304</b>, the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> knows to which MME <b>208</b> and/or to which MME pool to transfer the CSG data associated with a certain HeNB <b>304</b>. This exemplary embodiment assumes that the foreign subscriber's UE <b>414</b> is currently registered in one of the MMEs in the MME pool to which the HeNB <b>304</b> is connected, which means that the UE <b>414</b>'s serving MME <b>208</b> is one of the MMEs that receive the updated CSG definition from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">According to other exemplary embodiments, the UE <b>414</b> is not currently registered with any MME from the MME Pool to which the HeNB <b>304</b> is connected at the time the UE <b>414</b> is added to the HeNB's <b>304</b> CSG. Initially, as shown in the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the owner of the HeNB <b>304</b> adds to (or removes from) HeNB's <b>304</b> CSG access list the foreign subscriber's MSISDN in step <b>802</b>. The owner does this, for example, in an OMA&#x26;P entity in the HeNB's operator's OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b>, e.g., via a web interface shown as dashed line <b>416</b>. Next, in step <b>804</b>, the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> transfers to the MMEs in the MME pool, to which the HeNB <b>304</b> is connected, information related to HeNB's <b>304</b> CSG, e.g., the MSISDNs of each subscriber that is included in the CSG, i.e., the CSG access list, or other information that can be used by the MMEs in the MME pool, to determine that the foreign subscriber's MSISDN has been added to (or removed from) HeNB's <b>304</b> CSG. This way the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> can ensure that the MMEs in an MME pool, e.g., MME <b>208</b>, always have up-to-date CSG data for the CSGs belonging to the MME pool. This transfer may involve transfer of information between different entities in the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b>, e.g., between an entity receiving and/or storing CSG data and an entity responsible for management of MMEs.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">According to exemplary embodiments, an MME <b>208</b> may maintain an up-to-date set of CSG data for every CSG of every HeNB <b>304</b> that connects to the MME's MME pool, but it may alternatively only maintain the CSG data subset that pertains to foreign subscribers. The CSG data will be kept up-to-date by the home OMA&#x26;P system and the MME <b>208</b> can use it to check whether the CSG Whitelist of a future visiting foreign subscriber has to be updated. To simplify identification of future visiting foreign subscribers whose CSG Whitelists need to be updated, each MME <b>208</b> receiving the updated CSG data preferably checks the received CSG data updates and identifies any MSISDNs of foreign subscribers that are affected by the CSG data update and includes these MSISDNs in a list of foreign subscribers whose CSG Whitelists need to be updated. For each MSISDN in this list, the MME <b>208</b> also notes the concerned CSG ID and the type of update. If the MME <b>208</b> uses such a list of foreign subscribers whose CSG Whitelists need to be updated, it need not maintain the complete list of CSG data for foreign subscribers.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">At some later point in time, the concerned foreign subscriber roams into the service area of the concerned MME pool associated with HeNB <b>304</b>. The foreign subscriber's UE <b>414</b> may do this with the intention of accessing the concerned HeNB <b>304</b> (which is located within the service area of the MME pool), but the UE <b>414</b> will in any case first be registered with the MME <b>208</b> via a macro cell (because the CSG Whitelist in the UE <b>414</b> is not updated). When the UE <b>414</b> registers with one of the MMEs in the MME pool in step <b>806</b>, his/her subscriber data (including the CSG Whitelist and the MSISDN) is downloaded from the foreign HSS <b>402</b> to the serving MME <b>208</b> in step <b>808</b> via a message, e.g., in an Insert Subscriber Data Request message (or other corresponding message). The serving MME <b>208</b> then determines whether the CSG Whitelist of the foreign subscriber needs to be updated in step <b>810</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">According to exemplary embodiments, if the serving MME <b>208</b> relies on using complete lists of foreign subscribers for its CSGs, the serving MME <b>208</b> performs two checks. First, the serving MME <b>208</b> checks whether the MSISDN of the foreign subscriber is included in any received complete list of foreign subscribers for any of the CSGs belonging to the MME's <b>208</b> MME pool. If the foreign subscriber's MSISDN is found in such a list, the serving MME <b>208</b> checks whether the CSG ID associated with the list is included in the foreign subscriber's CSG Whitelist with the correct PLMN ID indication. If this is not the case, the MME <b>208</b> determines that the foreign subscriber's CSG Whitelist needs to be updated and that the concerned CSG ID should be included in the CSG Whitelist. Second, the MME <b>208</b> checks whether the CSG ID of any of the MME pool's CSGs is included in the foreign subscriber's CSG Whitelist. If this is the case, the MME <b>208</b> checks whether the MSISDN of the foreign subscriber is indeed included in the list of foreign subscribers for the concerned CSG. If this is not the case, the MME <b>208</b> determines that the foreign subscriber's CSG Whitelist needs to be updated and that the concerned CSG ID (and associated PLMN ID) should be removed from the CSG Whitelist.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">If according to exemplary embodiments, the MME <b>208</b> instead relies on a list of foreign subscribers whose CSG Whitelists need to be updated, the MME <b>208</b> checks if the MSISDN of the visiting foreign subscriber is included in this list. If this is the case, the MME <b>208</b> further checks whether the foreign subscriber's CSG Whitelist still needs to be updated according to the data, for example the CSG ID and update type, in the list. If the MME <b>208</b> (aided, as described above, either by the complete lists of foreign subscribers for CSGs or by a list of foreign subscribers whose CSG Whitelists need to be updated) has determined that the CSG Whitelist of a visiting foreign subscriber needs to be updated, the serving MME <b>208</b> includes information about the CSG Whitelist update in the response message, e.g., an Insert Subscriber Data Answer message, to the foreign HSS <b>402</b> in step <b>812</b>. The CSG Whitelist update information may contain the CSG ID of the concerned CSG and optionally an indication of the type of update. The identity, e.g., the IMSI, of the concerned subscriber does not have to be included, since this is known from the transaction context. The type of update can be optional, because the foreign HSS <b>402</b> can derive this update from the contents of its stored version of the CSG Whitelist. If the stored CSG Whitelist already includes the indicated CSG ID, then the update is a removal of a foreign subscriber, whereas if the CSG ID is not included in the stored CSG Whitelist, the update is an inclusion of a foreign subscriber.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">After informing the foreign HSS <b>402</b>, the serving MME removes the foreign subscriber's MSISDN (and the associated data) from the list of foreign subscribers whose CSG Whitelists need to be updated in step <b>814</b>. Additionally, the UE <b>414</b> can be updated with the CSG Whitelist change as needed in step <b>816</b>. In order to make the other MMEs in the MME pool remove their corresponding (now redundant) data, the serving MME <b>208</b> may inform the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> that the foreign HSS <b>402</b> has been updated and the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> may in turn inform the other MMEs in the MME pool, so that they can remove the redundant data. According to an alternative exemplary embodiment, a (generic) data synchronization mechanism among the MMEs in the MME pool may be used. However, if none of these methods for removal of the redundant data is used, another MME in the MME pool will remove its redundant data if the concerned foreign subscriber later registers in the MME and the MME concludes that the CSG Whitelist of the foreign subscriber has already been updated.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Upon reception of the CSG Whitelist information, the foreign HSS <b>402</b> takes appropriate actions as previously described. That is, it updates the stored CSG Whitelist in the subscriber data accordingly and, if OMA DM or OTA technology is used for conveying CSG Whitelist updates to the UE/USIM <b>414</b>, the foreign HSS <b>402</b> notifies the foreign OMA&#x26;P system <b>404</b> of the update. If NAS signaling is used for conveying CSG Whitelist updates to the UE/USIM <b>414</b>, the foreign HSS <b>402</b> may request the serving MME <b>208</b> to transfer the CSG Whitelist update the UE/USIM <b>414</b>, but there is also an option to let the serving MME <b>208</b> do this proactively (without explicit request from the foreign HSS <b>402</b>), in which case the foreign HSS <b>402</b> does not have to request the serving MME <b>208</b> to do it. If the serving MME <b>208</b> uses the option to proactively update the UE/USIM <b>414</b>, it may also include an indication of whether the UE/USIM <b>414</b> has been successfully updated in the CSG Whitelist update information sent to the foreign HSS <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">If the serving MME <b>208</b> relies on a list of foreign subscribers whose CSG Whitelists need to be updated and, when comparing the foreign subscriber's CSG Whitelist with the data in the list of foreign subscribers whose CSG Whitelists need to be updated finds, that the CSG Whitelist has already been updated (presumably by another MME in the same MME pool), then the serving MME <b>208</b> removes the foreign subscriber's MSISDN (and the associated data) from the list of foreign subscribers whose CSG Whitelists need to be updated and continues with regular procedures. According to a purely illustrative example, an exemplary data structure <b>900</b> for tracking the list of foreign subscribers whose CSG Whitelists need to be updated is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The exemplary data structure can track each update uniquely by the subscriber's MSISDN <b>902</b>, the CSG ID <b>904</b> to be changed, the update type <b>906</b>, e.g., an inclusion or a removal from the identified CSG for the subscriber, and a lifetime <b>908</b> which can be time period used for inclusion into a CSG.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">According to another exemplary embodiment, CSG Whitelist information can be changed by the HeNB <b>304</b> owner when the HeNB <b>304</b> is disconnected e.g., when the owner goes away on vacation or even every night (if the owner is conscious about the consumed power). In this exemplary case, when the HeNB <b>304</b> is disconnected from the PLMN <b>202</b>, there is no defined MME pool associated with HeNB <b>304</b>. However, since the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> selects the MME pool to which the HeNB <b>304</b> should connect, the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> may store this configuration information. This allows the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> to ensure that the HeNB <b>304</b> connects to the desired MME pool when the HeNB <b>304</b> reconnects to the core network (which the HeNB <b>304</b> should do as long as the HeNB <b>304</b> has not been moved out of the service area of the MME pool that it was previously connected to). Hence, the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> may transfer CSG data updates to the MMEs of the MME pool to which the HeNB <b>304</b> was previously connected. Note also that a previous serving MME <b>208</b> may also keep the CSG data updates, e.g., a list of foreign subscribers whose CSG Whitelists need to be updated that it has received from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b>, even if the concerned HeNB <b>304</b> has been disconnected. If a concentrator node, e.g., HeNB GW <b>308</b>, is used between the HeNBs and the MME pool, the MMEs will not necessarily even know when an HeNB <b>304</b> is disconnected.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">However, according to other exemplary embodiments, an HeNB <b>304</b> may be moved while disconnected. Since these home base stations are smaller, more portable and designed to enable users to set them up, is anticipated that some home base stations could be relocated somewhat frequently. After being turned on in a new location, the HeNB <b>304</b> will inform the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> of its new location, which the HeNB <b>304</b> detects by scanning broadcasts from the macro layer cells, so that the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> can assign a suitable MME pool to the HeNB <b>304</b>. When the HeNB <b>304</b> is assigned to a new MME pool, the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> cannot rely on transferring only the changed parts of the CSG data to the MMEs, because there may be previous changes pending to be reflected in CSG Whitelists of foreign subscribers which would then be lost. Therefore, when assigning an HeNB <b>304</b> to a new MME pool, the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> according to this exemplary embodiment provides information to the MMEs in the pool for use to track all pending updates to be reflected in CSG Whitelists of foreign subscribers. This information can be different depending on whether the receiving MMEs rely on complete lists of foreign subscribers for the MME pool's CSGs on a list of foreign subscribers whose CSG Whitelists need to be updated.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">According to exemplary embodiments, if an MME <b>208</b> relies on complete lists of foreign subscribers for the MME pool's CSGs, the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> transfers the complete CSG definition, or preferably only the subset of the CSG data consisting of foreign subscribers, i.e., the MSISDN of each foreign subscriber in the CSG, to the serving MME <b>208</b>. The serving MME <b>208</b> can immediately start using the received data as a list of foreign subscribers for the new CSG in the manner described above with respect to the exemplary embodiments associated with having the serving MME <b>208</b> delay informing the foreign HSS <b>402</b> until a follow on message is to be sent. If an MME <b>208</b> relies on a list of foreign subscribers whose CSG Whitelists need to be updated, the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> instead transfers explicit information about all pending CSG Whitelist updates involving the concerned CSG, for example, updates in the CSG data which have not yet been reflected in the affected foreign subscribers' CSG Whitelists. However, since the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> does not handle these CSG Whitelist updates itself, but relies on the MMEs to perform them, the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> does not know which updates are still pending.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">According to exemplary embodiments, in order to determine which updates are still pending the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> has to check with the MMEs of the old MME pool which was previously assigned to the HeNB <b>304</b>. Note that the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> typically has to check with all the MMEs of the old MME pool but that only the CSG Whitelist updates that are both related to the concerned CSG, and that are still pending in all these MMEs, should be regarded as still pending. If an update for instance is pending in all but one of the MMEs in the MME pool, but has been removed from the list of foreign subscribers whose CSG Whitelists need to be updated and in the last MME, this means that the last MME has already performed the update and that the update consequently no longer is pending in this context. When the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> has retrieved information about all of the pending CSG Whitelist updates related to the concerned CSG from the old MME pool, the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> transfers this information to the new MME(s) for inclusion in each MME's respective list of foreign subscribers whose CSG Whitelists need to be updated. The MMEs in the old MME pool may then remove this no longer needed information. According to exemplary embodiments, various methods can be used to efficiently manage various MMEs which are relying on lists of foreign subscribers whose CSG Whitelists need to be updated. For example, according to one exemplary embodiment, a garbage collection principle with a mandatory lifetime for foreign subscribers' CSG memberships can be used as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">According to another exemplary embodiment, the home OMA&#x26;P <b>204</b> system may, instead of obtaining information about pending updates, transfer a temporary complete list of foreign subscribers in the concerned CSG to a new MME (or MME pool) which relieves the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> from the task of collecting pending CSG Whitelist updates from the old MME pool. When this exemplary option is used, an MME <b>208</b> that receives a list of foreign subscribers for a new CSG starts a timer which expires when a time period equal to the longest allowed lifetime for a foreign subscriber's membership in a CSG has elapsed. In the meantime, the MME <b>208</b> uses the received temporary list in the manner described above for exemplary embodiments associated with an MME <b>208</b> which relies on complete lists of foreign subscribers for the MME pool's CSG, with the difference that the MME <b>208</b> may remove from the temporary list of foreign subscribers in the CSG any foreign subscriber, i.e., the MSISDN of the foreign subscriber, whose membership lifetime expires or whose CSG Whitelist has been confirmed to be updated.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">According to exemplary embodiments, when the timer expires, the MME <b>208</b> knows that there are no more pending exclusions related to the new CSG and can switch to its regular behavior, according to exemplary embodiments described above, for the new CSG, i.e., relying on its list of foreign subscribers whose CSG Whitelists need to be updated. When doing this, the serving MME <b>208</b> should transfer any remaining foreign subscribers in the temporary list of foreign subscribers for the new CSG to the list of foreign subscribers whose CSG Whitelists need to be updated and indicate them as inclusion type updates. While the timer is still running, the MME may receive inclusion updates, concerning the new CSG, from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b>, including inclusion updates whose purpose is to refresh the CSG membership of a subscriber. Additionally, the foreign subscribers that these inclusions concern are typically included in the temporary list of foreign subscribers for the new CSG. Therefore there may be remaining foreign subscribers in the temporary list even when the timer, which was set equal to the longest allowed CSG membership lifetime for a foreign subscriber, has elapsed. According to exemplary embodiments, an alternative procedure, which does not require different actions depending on whether the HeNB reconnects to the expected MME pool or a new one, would be that the OMA&#x26;P system keeps a note of the CSG data to be sent, awaiting the HeNB's reconnection to the core network and can then, when the HeNB has again connected to an MME pool, send the CSG data to the MMEs of this MME pool.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">According to an exemplary embodiment, one method for reducing or controlling the amount of information to be stored and transmitted is to transmit only minimal CSG data from the home OMA&#x26;P System <b>204</b> to the MME <b>208</b> and the associated MME pool. In order to minimize the amount of data transferred from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> to the serving MME <b>208</b>, the serving MME <b>208</b> can maintain a list of foreign subscribers whose CSG Whitelists need to be updated and the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b>, based on this list, may only send the data that is needed for the MME <b>208</b> to the MME <b>208</b>. That is, in some exemplary embodiments, the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> typically only transfers information about updates concerning foreign subscribers, e.g., inclusions of foreign subscribers in CSG data or removals of foreign subscribers from CSG data, to the serving MME <b>208</b>. For the exemplary case of connection to a new MME pool, the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> will typically transfer either a complete list of foreign subscribers for the concerned CSG or the accumulated pending updates concerning foreign subscribers for the concerned CSG to the MME pool.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">According to another exemplary embodiment, manual override of the UE <b>414</b> based CSG Whitelist can be performed. For example, manual override of the UE <b>414</b> based CSG Whitelist for attempting to access an HeNB <b>304</b> whose CSG ID should be included in the CSG Whitelist but with which the UE <b>414</b> based CSG Whitelist has not yet been updated, should be seen as a last resort use. However, there are at least three exemplary cases when this last resort typically may be useful. According to one exemplary embodiment, manual override may occur when there is no other way for the foreign UE <b>414</b> to connect to the network <b>202</b> other than via the concerned CSG cell associated with the HeNB <b>304</b> which can occur when there is no macro layer coverage.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">According to another exemplary embodiment, manual override may occur when the HeNB <b>304</b> is located at the border between two MME pools and the foreign UE <b>414</b>, whose CSG Whitelist needs to be updated in order to avoid manual override, is located in the part of the HeNB <b>304</b> coverage area which is covered by a macrocell belonging to another MME pool than the one the HeNB <b>304</b> is connected to. In this situation the UE's <b>414</b> serving MME <b>208</b> has not received the data from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> that is needed to enable the update and manual override may be acceptable.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">According to another exemplary embodiment, manual override may occur when the CSG Whitelists of the UE <b>414</b> and the foreign HSS <b>402</b> for some reason are erroneously out of synchronization and the entity/entities responsible for updating the UE <b>414</b> based CSG Whitelist is/are not aware of it and therefore does/do not attempt to update the UE <b>414</b>. This can result in the foreign subscriber having been added to the CSG definition, which is reflected in the subscriber's CSG Whitelist in the foreign HSS <b>402</b>. However this update to the CSG definition is not reflected in the CSG Whitelist stored in the UE <b>414</b>. Without manual override this situation may lead to the UE <b>414</b> being unable to access the home PLMN <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">According to exemplary embodiments, another method for improving efficiency in the network(s) is to control the potential for accumulated updates for the same foreign subscriber. For example, if the UE <b>414</b> of the foreign subscriber is not registered in the MME pool covering the concerned HeNB <b>304</b> when the CSG definition is updated, several updates related to the foreign subscriber may occur and &#x201c;accumulate&#x201d; before the CSG Whitelist of the foreign subscriber is updated. This may include updates in the same CSG, different CSGs in the same MME pool and/or updates in CSGs belonging to different MME pools. Updates related to CSGs in different MME pools do not affect each other, but updates related to CSGs in the same MME pool do, in particular updates related to the same CSG. If the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> transfers to the MME pool upon every update the complete CSG data, or the subset of the CSG data which only identifies the foreign subscribers that are included in the CSG, then each received set of CSG data simply replaces the previous set for the same CSG in the MME <b>208</b>. The newest CSG data will contain all accumulated updates. However, if the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> only transfers the MSISDN of the concerned foreign subscriber and an indication of the type of update (inclusion or removal), the situation can become slightly more complex.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">According to exemplary embodiments, if the updates relate to different CSGs (in the same MME pool), the MME <b>208</b> simply stores each update separately in its list of foreign subscribers whose CSG Whitelists need to be updated. Optionally, the MME <b>208</b> may compress the list somewhat by storing only a single entry for each foreign subscriber, keyed by, for example, the MSISDN, in which all accumulated updates related to the same or different CSGs are recorded. If the accumulated updates are related to the same CSG, the MME <b>208</b> has two alternative exemplary options for how to process the accumulated updates. In a first exemplary option, the MME <b>208</b> chooses to treat the accumulated updates in the same manner as updates related to different CSGs in the same MME pool. In this case, the MME <b>208</b> ensures that the chronological order of the accumulated updates is recorded, so that the net result of applying them becomes correct. In a secondary exemplary alternative option the MME <b>208</b> lets inclusions and removals concerning the same foreign subscriber and the same CSG cancel out each other. That is, if the MME <b>208</b> has a an inclusion update stored in the list and a removal update concerning the same foreign subscriber and CSG is received from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b>, then the removal cancels the inclusion. Hence the old update can be removed from the list without replacing it with the removal, i.e., after clearing the list from these items the MME <b>208</b> can simply forget about both updates. Similarly, if the MME <b>208</b> has a removal stored in the list and an inclusion concerning the same foreign subscriber and CSG is received from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b>, then the MME <b>208</b> can delete the removal from the list without including the inclusion in the list and then forget about both updates.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As described above, it is possible that the CSG Whitelists in the foreign HSS <b>402</b> and the foreign UEs <b>414</b> keep growing. For example, if a visiting subscriber is added to a CSG in a VPLMN then later leaves the VPLMN and never returns to the VPLMN, the CSG ID of the foreign CSG could remain indefinitely in the foreign HSS <b>402</b>, even if the CSG owner removes the foreign subscriber from the CSG data. Similarly, CSG data update information may remain indefinitely in the MMEs <b>208</b>. Even though it is unlikely that a harmful amount of data will accumulate this way, it can be useful to have a so called &#x201c;garbage collection&#x201d; mechanism which removes outdated CSG related data from the MMEs <b>208</b> and from the CSG Whitelists in the foreign HSS <b>402</b> and the UEs <b>414</b>. According to exemplary embodiments a lifetime, expressed either as an absolute or a relative time, can be associated with a CSG ID from a foreign CSG when it is included in a CSG Whitelist. If the HeNB <b>304</b> owner specifies a lifetime, then this lifetime should be used, otherwise a default lifetime should be used. The default lifetime should preferably be standardized, but it could also be set by the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> receiving the lifetime-less foreign MSISDN from the HeNB <b>304</b> owner. This lifetime can be included in the CSG Whitelist in the foreign HSS <b>402</b> and in the UE <b>414</b> as well as in the CSG data update information sent from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> to the MME <b>208</b> (and the other MMEs in the same MME pool). When the lifetime expires, the associated data is removed from the CSG Whitelist both in the foreign HSS <b>402</b> and in the UE <b>414</b>. Additionally any remaining CSG data update information in MMEs <b>208</b> is also removed as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">According to exemplary embodiments, the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> is also aware of the lifetime and when this lifetime expires, assuming the HeNB <b>304</b> owner has not previously removed the foreign subscriber from the CSG data, the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> has two different courses of action. If the lifetime was specified by the HeNB <b>304</b> owner, the concerned foreign subscriber is simply removed from the CSG data, i.e., the concerned foreign subscriber is removed from the CSG subscriber list. If a default lifetime was used in absence of a lifetime specified by the HeNB <b>304</b> owner the home OMA&#x26;P <b>204</b> system reinserts the foreign subscriber into the CSG data with a restarted default lifetime, i.e., in essence the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> &#x201c;refreshes&#x201d; the foreign subscriber's membership in the CSG, and sends this CSG data update information to the MMEs in the MME pool owning the CSG. The CSG Whitelists in the foreign HSS <b>402</b> and the UE <b>414</b> of the foreign subscriber will then subsequently be updated as described in the exemplary embodiments above.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">This exemplary approach may cause another potential synchronization issue to be dealt with. For example, if an MME <b>208</b> receives the CSG data update information concerning the reinserted/refreshed foreign subscriber slightly before the concerned CSG ID is removed from the foreign subscriber's CSG Whitelist and the foreign subscriber is registered in the MME <b>208</b> when the MME <b>208</b> receives the information, then the MME <b>208</b> may conclude that the foreign subscriber's CSG Whitelist does not need to be updated. The MME <b>208</b> may come to this conclusion because the concerned CSG ID is already present in the CSG Whitelist and may consequently delete the CSG data update information. Soon thereafter, possibly very soon thereafter, the CSG Whitelist of the foreign subscriber is updated with the removal of the concerned CSG ID due to, for example, the expiration of the lifetime, and thereby synchronization of the data in the CSG data and in the foreign subscriber's CSG Whitelist has failed. According to exemplary embodiments this problem can be eliminated by including the lifetime both in the CSG Whitelist sent from the foreign HSS <b>402</b> to the serving MME <b>208</b> and in the CSG data update information sent from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> to the serving MME <b>208</b>. The serving MME <b>208</b> would then not only check the presence or absence of the concerned CSG ID in the CSG Whitelist, but the serving MME <b>208</b> can also check whether the lifetimes match. If the lifetimes do not match, which they will not do if the foreign subscriber has been reinserted/refreshed, the serving MME <b>208</b> concludes that the CSG Whitelist has to be updated, although only with a new lifetime for the concerned CSG ID in this exemplary case.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">However, according to exemplary embodiments, if the timing mismatch is instead the other way around, i.e., if the CSG Whitelist of the foreign subscriber visiting the serving MME <b>208</b> is updated with the removal of the concerned CSG ID due to lifetime expiration before the serving MME <b>208</b> receives the CSG data update information from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b>, then the serving MME <b>208</b> will not allow the foreign subscriber's UE <b>414</b> to access the concerned HeNB <b>304</b>, not even after manual override of the CSG Whitelist in the UE <b>414</b>. This denial of access lasts until the serving MME <b>208</b> receives the CSG data update information from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b>, so that the foreign subscriber's CSG Whitelist can be updated. Even though this denial of access situation is likely to persist for only a very short time, since the timing mismatch causing it is likely to be small, it would be desirable to avoid the timing mismatch completely.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">According to exemplary embodiments, a solution which serves to avoid both of the above described timing misalignment problems is that the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> sends the CSG data update information to the MMEs <b>208</b> in the concerned MME pool slightly before the default lifetime expires. This CSG data update information is sent with (explicit or implicit) instructions to keep the information for a minimum time, even if the CSG Whitelist of the concerned foreign subscriber does not seem to need updating. This allows for the CSG data update information to be kept until after the default lifetime has expired and the concerned CSG ID has been removed from the CSG Whitelist due to the expiration of the lifetime. The desired result is that if the foreign subscriber registers in one of the MMEs <b>208</b> in the concerned MME pool before the concerned CSG ID has been removed from the CSG Whitelist, due to the lifetime expiration, and the MME <b>208</b> concludes that the CSG Whitelist need not be updated, e.g., assuming that the above described exemplary lifetime-only-update method is not used, then the MME <b>208</b> does not delete the CSG data update information. Instead the MME <b>208</b> keeps the CSG data update information in accordance with the instructions from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">When the concerned CSG ID soon afterwards is removed from the CSG Whitelist due to, for example, the lifetime expiration, the MME <b>208</b> concludes that the CSG Whitelist needs to be updated in accordance with the retained CSG data update information. Therefore, the MME <b>208</b> ensures that the CSG Whitelist is updated in the previously described manner. After updating the CSG Whitelist, the MME <b>208</b> deletes the CSG data update information. However, if the minimum time that the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> has instructed the serving MME <b>208</b> to keep the CSG data update information expires and the serving MME <b>208</b> has not updated the CSG Whitelist during this time because, for example, the foreign subscriber has not been registered in the MME <b>208</b> during this time, the MME <b>208</b> can keep the CSG data update information and treat the information in the exemplary methods described above for other CSG data update information.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">According to another exemplary embodiment, a CSG may potentially be served by multiple CSG cells belonging to more than one MME pool, e.g., an enterprise CSG or a CSG for Starbuck's or McDonald's customers. The above described exemplary embodiments are however, in principle, not affected by this. The home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> still knows which MME pools that the concerned CSG belongs to and can transfer the CSG data, or CSG data update information, to the MMEs in all these MME pools. A consideration is that an MME pool internal data synchronization mechanism, for removing redundant CSG data update information, which is described herein as an optional alternative exemplary embodiment, typically cannot be used in cases where the synchronization mechanism would not span across multiple MME pools.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">According to another exemplary embodiment, the MME <b>208</b> serving a foreign subscriber can request the CSG data from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> when needed, instead of having the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> pushing CSG data to the MMEs of the concerned MME pool. For example, when a foreign subscriber registers through UE <b>414</b> with an MME <b>208</b> in a VPLMN, i.e., a PLMN <b>202</b> which is not the foreign subscriber's home PLMN, the MME <b>208</b> requests CSG subscriber list data related to the foreign subscriber from the OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> of the MME's PLMN <b>202</b>, i.e., the VPLMN. The CSG subscriber list data the serving MME <b>208</b> retrieves from the OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> may be different from the data transferred (pushed) from the OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> in the exemplary embodiments described above. Instead of being data associated with a certain CSG in the MME pool, the retrieved data may consist of the CSG IDs of all the CSGs in the PLMN <b>202</b>, i.e., the VPLMN from the foreign subscriber's point of view, in which the foreign subscriber's MSISDN (or possibly IMSI) is included. To support such requests from MMEs, the OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> would, conceptually, although the actual implementation may vary as would be understood by one skilled in the art, maintain a database of CSG data for foreign subscribers, keyed by the MSISDN (or possibly IMSI) of the foreign subscribers. That is, when the MME <b>208</b> requests data, it includes the MSISDN (or possibly IMSI) of the foreign subscriber, the OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> retrieves from a database and returns to the MME <b>208</b> the CSG IDs of all the CSGs in the PLMN in which the foreign subscriber is a member. That is, the OMA&#x26;P system in essence returns a VPLMN-CSG Whitelist, i.e. a CSG Whitelist containing only CSG IDs belonging to the concerned PLMN, associated with the foreign subscriber.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The CSG data that the serving MME <b>208</b> transfers to the foreign subscriber's HSS <b>402</b> and (in some variants) to the foreign subscriber's UE <b>414</b> in order to update the CSG Whitelist is also different in this exemplary embodiment than in other exemplary embodiments described herein. In this exemplary embodiment, the MME <b>208</b> transfers the complete set of CSG IDs received from the OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> (optionally accompanied by the PLMN ID of the MME <b>208</b> although this is known by the foreign HSS <b>402</b> and the UE <b>414</b>) to the foreign HSS <b>402</b> and/or the UE <b>414</b> in which the foreign subscriber is a member. The receiver of this CSG data, the foreign HSS <b>402</b> and/or the UE <b>414</b>, may thus replace the set of CSG IDs of the concerned VPLMN which was previously stored in the CSG Whitelist with the received set of CSG IDs. This replacement takes care of both inclusion and removal type of updates.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">According to exemplary embodiments, the serving MME <b>208</b> stores the retrieved CSG data in the foreign subscriber's context, i.e., the data related to the foreign subscriber, in the MME <b>208</b> and keeps it as long as the foreign subscriber remains registered in the serving MME <b>208</b>. The CSG data is not only used for CSG Whitelist updating, but the serving MME <b>204</b> also uses it for CSG based access control when the foreign subscriber accesses the network through a CSG cell.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">According to another exemplary embodiment, an alternative trigger of the MME's <b>208</b> CSG data retrieval from the OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> is that a foreign subscriber uses manual override of its CSG Whitelist to force an access attempt in a CSG cell whose broadcast CSG ID is not included in the foreign UE's <b>414</b> CSG Whitelist. This access attempt can trigger the above described behavior in the serving MME <b>208</b>. In this case the serving MME <b>208</b> would fetch the CSG data related to the foreign subscriber from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> (i.e. the OMA&#x26;P system of the MME's PLMN), update the CSG Whitelist in the foreign HSS <b>402</b> and (in some variants) in the foreign UE <b>414</b>. If the retrieved CSG data indicates that the foreign subscriber is indeed a member of the CSG of the CSG cell, the serving MME <b>208</b> would also accept the foreign UE's <b>414</b> access attempt.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In order to capture changes of the relevant CSG data done in the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> while the foreign subscriber remains registered in the serving MME <b>208</b>, the serving MME <b>208</b> could periodically, or when triggered by UE <b>414</b> events such as a tracking area update (TAU), retrieve new CSG data from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b>. If the UE <b>414</b> registers in a new MME in the same VPLMN, this would also trigger the new MME to start the above described behavior, which would result in a new, possibly redundant, update of the foreign subscriber's CSG Whitelist. However, this does not cause any harm since two equivalent sets of CSG IDs would simply replace each other in the CSG Whitelist. When the foreign subscriber's UE <b>414</b> leaves the VPLMN, or when it registers in another PLMN, the HSS <b>402</b> and the UE <b>414</b> may optionally delete the CSG IDs of the VPLMN from the CSG Whitelist. This is possible, since the CSG Whitelist is updated with the complete list of CSG IDs of allowed CSGs in the VPLMN whenever the foreign subscriber registers in the VPLMN again.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">According to the above described exemplary embodiments the above described problems in conjunction with CSG roaming related to the lack of inter-PLMN interfaces for support of management of CSG subscriber lists and CSG Whitelists can be overcome. Thereby, the exemplary embodiments allow subscribers from other PLMNs to be temporary or permanent members of a CSG in another network. Exemplary scenarios include, but are not limited to, e.g., that a HeNB <b>304</b> owner temporarily allows a visitor from abroad access to his/her HeNB <b>304</b> or that the users such as, for example, family members, regularly using the HeNB <b>304</b> can have their respective subscriptions with different PLMN operators, assuming that national roaming is supported as in the United States. For example, another exemplary enabled scenario describes that an international enterprise may define CSGs in all its subsidiaries, served by different operators (in different nations), but still include all employees (worldwide) in all the different CSGs, so that all employees can access the company's HeNBs <b>304</b> irrespective of branch or country.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Two Whitelists</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">According to exemplary embodiments, CSG roaming can be performed without inter-PLMN interworking and cooperation between PLMNs. In these exemplary embodiments, each UE <b>414</b> has two CSG Whitelists, one related to its Home PLMN (HPLMN) and one related to Visited PLMN(s) (VPLMN(s)). The HPLMN CSG Whitelist is maintained as described above, e.g., stored in the home HSS per subscriber, for example, by IMSI, and sent to the subscriber's UE <b>414</b> for storage when modified. The serving MME <b>208</b> receives the CSG Whitelist from the home HSS <b>412</b> and can then perform access control when UE <b>414</b> performs an access in a CSG cell in the HPLMN <b>202</b>. The VPLMN CSG Whitelist is not stored in this HSS <b>412</b>. Rather, MMEs receive information about visiting subscribers/UEs and their allowed CSGs from an OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> that is operated by the same network operator <b>202</b> that operates the MMEs, e.g., when a visiting UE <b>414</b> accesses the network from a CSG cell, the serving MME <b>208</b> performs access control based on information received from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> about which visiting subscriber/UE <b>414</b> that has access right in the particular CSG cell.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">According to exemplary embodiments as described above, an HeNB <b>304</b> owner may add to (or remove from) a CSG subscriber list a foreign subscriber's MSISDN. The owner may do this using an OMA&#x26;P entity in the HeNB operator's OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b>, e.g., via a web interface. How this CSG subscriber list data is handled for foreign subscribers is described in the exemplary embodiments below. This handling may involve transfer of information between different entities in the OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b>, e.g., between an entity receiving and/or storing CSG subscriber list data and an entity responsible for management of MMEs.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">According to another exemplary embodiment, the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> can push CSG subscriber list data concerning foreign subscribers to MMEs in the HPLMN <b>202</b>. The home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> provides, to the MMEs in the MME pool to which the HeNB <b>304</b> is connected, the updated CSG subscriber list, or possibly only changes to the subscriber list and, potentially, information identifying access time limitations. As described above, because the exemplary embodiments relate primarily to foreign subscribers, the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> typically restricts the transferred CSG subscriber list data to the subset of the CSG subscriber list data concerning foreign subscribers and possibly only transferring the specific updates of this data subset. Since the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> selects the MME pool the HeNB <b>304</b> connects to during the installation of the HeNB <b>304</b>, the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> knows to which MMEs, i.e., to which MME pool, to transfer the CSG data associated with a certain HeNB <b>304</b>. Exemplary methods for sending this CSG related information from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> to the MMEs, e.g., serving MME <b>208</b>, and exemplary methods for managing this information in the MMEs are described above.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">According to exemplary embodiments, when a foreign UE <b>414</b> accesses one of the MMEs in the concerned MME pool in the VPLMN, from a non CSG cell, the MME <b>208</b> handling the access would recognize that this is a foreign UE <b>414</b> and checks the CSG subscriber list data the MME <b>208</b> received from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b>. If the UE <b>414</b> is found to be allowed on a CSG, e.g., an identifier associated with the UE <b>414</b> is included in a CSG subscriber list received from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b>, the serving MME <b>208</b> would send an update to the UE <b>414</b> in order to update the VPLMN CSG Whitelist in the UE <b>414</b>, i.e., the serving MME <b>208</b> would send the CSG ID of the concerned VPLMN CSG to the UE <b>414</b> via, for example, NAS signaling. The UE <b>414</b> can then store the CSG ID and the PLMN ID, which consists of the MCC and the MNC, in its VPLMN CSG Whitelist. The MME <b>208</b> then performs ongoing regular procedures, e.g., the serving MME <b>208</b> accepts the Tracking Area Update (TAU) if that was the procedure that was in progress. While the above exemplary embodiments take care of inclusions of VPLMN CSG IDs in the VPLMN CSG Whitelist, other exemplary mechanisms are described below for exclusions to the VPLMN CSG Whitelist.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">According to exemplary embodiments, when a foreign subscriber is removed from a VPLMN CSG, the MMEs in the MME pool to which the CSG belongs to will be informed of the update from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b>. An MME <b>208</b> may store this removal/exclusion information at least until the concerned foreign subscriber's UE <b>414</b> registers in the MME <b>208</b>. When the UE <b>414</b> registers in the MME <b>208</b>, the MME <b>208</b> will search its database of stored CSG data to determine whether the MME <b>208</b> needs to send an update to the UE <b>414</b>. If stored CSG data indicates that the UE <b>414</b> has been removed from a VPLMN CSG, the MME <b>208</b> may update the VPLMN CSG Whitelist stored in the UE <b>414</b> by sending to the UE <b>414</b> an indication of the removal and the CSG ID of the concerned VPLMN CSG so that the UE <b>414</b> can update its VPLMN CSG Whitelist.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">According to an alternative exemplary embodiment, another way to handle removals is that the VPLMN CSG ID is not removed from the VPLMN CSG Whitelist until the UE <b>414</b> attempts to access the concerned HeNB <b>304</b> and is rejected. This can trigger the UE <b>414</b> to remove the CSG ID from the VPLMN CSG Whitelist. In some cases the UE <b>414</b> may be connected to another MME pool in the VPLMN or not at all attached to the VPLMN when it is added as an allowed subscriber to a CSG in the VPLMN. When this is the case, the UE's CSG Whitelist for this VPLMN would not be updated instantly as there are no mechanisms for the VPLMN to update the UE's CSG Whitelist while the UE <b>414</b> is connected to another PLMN. This is, however, not seen as a problem as it is assumed that the macro network covering the HeNB <b>304</b> serving the relevant CSG cell is also served by the same MME pool. Therefore, according to exemplary embodiments, once the UE <b>414</b> gets connected to the macro network, the selected MME <b>208</b> can update the UE's CSG Whitelist. This also means that if the UE <b>414</b> would be connected to a totally different MME Pool in the VPLMN, then the UE's CSG Whitelist would be first updated when it moves in the macro network to the same MME pool as where the relevant HeNB <b>304</b> is connected to. This exemplary embodiment works when it is not necessary to update the UE's CSG Whitelist until the UE <b>414</b> is in a location where it is likely that it may be able to connect to the HeNB <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">According to another exemplary embodiment, it is also possible that the HeNB <b>304</b> is located in a place without macro network coverage. If the UE <b>414</b> is, in this case, also located in the same place then the method to trigger the updating of the UE's CSG Whitelist is manual access attempt as also described in other exemplary embodiments herein. A foreign subscriber's membership in a VPLMN CSG may be associated with a lifetime. If so, the lifetime information is transferred in the CSG data from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> to the MMEs and from the serving MME <b>208</b> to the UE <b>414</b> when the serving MME <b>208</b> indicates the VPLMN CSG Whitelist update to the UE <b>414</b>. When this lifetime expires, the UE <b>414</b> should remove the concerned CSG ID from the VPLMN CSG Whitelist. The lifetime expiration would also be noted by the MMEs and when the UE <b>414</b> attempts an access the MME would reject the access attempt. If the UE <b>414</b> registers in another MME in the visited PLMN, this may trigger the new MME to start the above described procedure, which may result in a new, possibly redundant update of the UE VPLMN CSG Whitelist.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">According to another exemplary embodiment, the serving MME <b>208</b> retrieves CSG Data from the home OMA&#x26;P System <b>204</b> when needed. In this exemplary embodiment, CSG data is not pushed to the MMEs from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> in response to modification to CSG data stored in the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b>, instead MMEs are configured to fetch CSG data from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> when a foreign UE <b>414</b> registers with the MME <b>208</b>. In this manner, not all MMEs are provided with CSG data, only the serving MME <b>208</b> with which the UE <b>414</b> registers. After retrieving the CSG data from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> the serving MME <b>208</b> would update the VPLMN CSG Whitelist in the UE <b>414</b> via, for example, NAS signaling.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">According to other exemplary embodiments, the UE <b>414</b> may already be attached to an MME <b>208</b> in the VPLMN. In this exemplary embodiment, the CSG data that the MME <b>208</b> retrieves from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> is different from the data pushed from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> described above. Instead of being data associated with a certain CSG subscriber in the MME pool, the retrieved data consists of the CSG IDs of all the CSGs in the PLMN, i.e., the VPLMN from the UE's <b>414</b> point of view, in which the foreign subscriber is included. To support such requests from MMEs, the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> can, conceptually (although the actual implementation may vary), maintain a database of CSG data for foreign subscribers, keyed by the MSISDN (or possibly IMSI) of the foreign subscribers. That is, when the MME <b>208</b> requests data, it includes the foreign subscriber's MSISDN (or possibly IMSI) of the foreign subscriber and the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> retrieves from the database and returns to the MME <b>208</b> the CSG IDs of all the CSGs in the PLMN in which the foreign subscriber is a member.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In this exemplary embodiment, the MME <b>208</b> transfers the complete set of CSG IDs received from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b>, e.g., the CSG IDs of all the CSGs in the VPLMN in which the foreign subscriber is a member, to the UE <b>414</b>. Since the UE <b>414</b> in this way receives the complete list of CSG IDs of allowed CSGs in the VPLMN whenever the UE <b>414</b> registers in the VPLMN, it need not maintain this data when it leaves the VPLMN. Hence, the VPLMN CSG Whitelist may be a temporary list, which pertains to a single VPLMN and includes only CSG IDs of CSGs in this particular VPLMN which is deleted when the visiting UE <b>414</b> leaves the concerned VPLMN.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">According to alternative embodiments, an alternative trigger of the MME's CSG data retrieval from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> can occur from a UE <b>414</b> when the UE <b>414</b> makes a manual access at a CSG, e.g., the UE <b>414</b> overrides the contents of its VPLMN CSG Whitelist in order to force an access attempt in a CSG cell whose broadcast CSG ID is not included in the VPLMN CSG Whitelist. This access in the MME <b>208</b> can trigger the above described behavior, i.e., cause the serving MME <b>208</b> to fetch data from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b>, update the UE VPLMN CSG Whitelist, etc. Since an MME pool normally would cover a large area, the user may stay registered in the same MME <b>208</b> for most of the stay in the VPLMN. If the UE <b>414</b> for some reason is allocated a new MME in the visited PLMN, the data stored in the previous MME <b>208</b>, for example, the information about the allowed CSG cells, is deleted as well as other data stored for the visiting UE <b>414</b>. When the UE <b>414</b> registers in a new MME in the VPLMN this would also trigger the new MME <b>208</b> to start the above described exemplary process, which would result in a new, possibly redundant update of the UE VPLMN CSG Whitelist. This update should not be any problem, since the UE <b>414</b> can choose to replace the list or just take care of the differences between the stored list and the received list. Additionally, in order to capture changes of the relevant CSG data done in the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b>, the MME <b>208</b> where the visiting UE <b>414</b> is registered could periodically, or as triggered by UE <b>414</b> events such as a TAU request, fetch CSG data from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">According to exemplary embodiments, removals can be captured whenever the MME <b>208</b> retrieves CSG data from the home OMA&#x26;P system <b>204</b> and the MME <b>208</b> conveys the retrieved list/data to the foreign UE <b>414</b>. A CSG ID which has been removed from this data, because the foreign subscriber has been excluded from the CSG associated with the removed CSG ID, would then be removed from the VPLMN CSG Whitelist in the UE <b>414</b>, since the UE <b>414</b> either replaces the old list or modifies the old list in order to make it equal to the received list.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The exemplary embodiments described above provide methods and systems for core network node selection. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, communications node <b>1000</b> (which can generically represent, e.g., an HeNB <b>304</b>, a UE <b>414</b>, a node in an OMA&#x26;P system and/an MME <b>208</b>) can contain a processor <b>1002</b> (or multiple processor cores), memory <b>1004</b>, one or more secondary storage devices <b>1006</b> and one or more communications interfaces <b>1008</b>. As described above, for example, when representing an MME <b>208</b>, the communications interfaces <b>1008</b> can include both an OMA&#x26;P-MME interface and an interface between the MME of one PLMN and the HSS of another PLMN. The processor <b>1002</b> in conjunction with information, e.g., instructions and CSG Whitelist information, stored in memory <b>1004</b> can perform the tasks described in the exemplary embodiments above for the various communication nodes used herein.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Utilizing the above-described exemplary systems according to exemplary embodiments, a method for mobility management is shown in the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Therein, at step <b>1102</b>, a message is received, from a network's Operation Maintenance Administration and Provisioning, OMA&#x26;P, system, at a mobility management node, wherein the message includes information associated with authorization for a roaming subscriber to access the at least one home base station which serves the CSG. At step <b>1104</b>, CSG information is communicated over an interface toward a home subscriber server (HSS) wherein the step of communicating comprises at least one of: (1) transmitting at least a part of the information associated with authorization for a roaming subscriber to access the at least one home base station which serves the CSG towards the HSS of the roaming subscriber and (2) receiving information from the HSS associated with CSG authorizations for the roaming subscriber.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">According to another exemplary embodiment, a method for mobility management in a communication system having a closed subscriber group, CSG, associated with at least one home base station is illustrated in the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Therein, at step <b>1200</b>, CSG information is communicated over an interface toward a home subscriber server (HSS) wherein said step of communicating comprises at least one of (1) receiving information at the HSS from a mobility management node in another public land mobile network (PLMN), wherein the information is associated with authorization for a subscriber that is roaming to access the at least one home base station which serves the CSG and (2) transmitting a message towards a mobility management node in the another PLMN from the HSS, wherein the message includes information associated with CSG authorizations for the subscriber that is roaming.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">According to another exemplary embodiment, a method for mobility management in a communication system having two separate networks includes the steps shown in the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. Therein, at step <b>1300</b>, a home closed subscriber group (CSG) Whitelist associated with a subscriber in a first network is created. This home CSG Whitelist is then stored, at step <b>1302</b>, in the HSS of the first network. A visiting CSG Whitelist associated with the subscriber is created in a second network at step <b>1304</b>. The visiting CSG Whitelist is then stored in an OMA&#x26;P system in the second network at step <b>1306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The foregoing exemplary embodiments propose, among other things, to use existing interfaces for new purposes to facilitate roaming in systems employing CSGs. For completeness, some of the current uses of those interfaces will also be described, which uses can be performed in addition to those described above according to exemplary embodiments. Specifically, the OMA&#x26;P-MME interface is currently, for example, used for operation and maintenance tasks, including:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0111">the (O&#x26;M part of the) OMA&#x26;P system configures parameters in the MME;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0112">the (O&#x26;M part of the) OMA&#x26;P system retrieves data from readable parameters (such as counters) in the MME in order to monitor the performance of the MME; and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0113">the MME sends alarms to the (O&#x26;M part of the) OMA&#x26;P system (e.g. when a fault occur or a threshold for a critical parameter is exceeded);
<br/>
Likewise, the interface between the MME of one PLMN and the HSS of another PLMN is currently used for:
</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0114">the MME to register a user location, i.e. the MME informs the HSS that the MME is now serving a user belonging to the HSS;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0115">the HSS to assist the MME in the authentication of the user, by providing the MME with authentication credentials;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0116">the HSS to provide the MME with subscriber data of a user that the MME has registered as being served by the MME, wherein the subscriber data includes information associated with the subscription, such as any particular restrictions or priviliges in the service to be given to the user, possibly information about which PDN GW to use, etc;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0117">the HSS also informs the MME when a user, which was previously registered as being served by the MME has been registered by another MME as being served by that other MME (i.e. the user has moved to a new location served by another MME (pool)).</li>
