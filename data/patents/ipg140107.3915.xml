<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">If a request of handle information to identify data existing in a recording medium is made to a digital camera by a PC, the digital camera collects the data existing in the recording medium by accessing a file system, generates unique handle information independent of the file system on the basis of a file path of the file system, and transmits it to the PC. When the request accompanied by the handle information is received from the PC, the digital camera executes a file path restoring process to the handle information, thereby restoring the file path which depends on the file system in the digital camera, retrieves the requested file by using the obtained file path, and transmits the data to the PC. According to this arrangement, installation costs can be suppressed by making an identification information management table unnecessary even while identification information which is independent of a logical data management system is used.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates to a digital information input apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A system such that image data of an object photographed by an information generating apparatus, such as a digital camera, video camera, or the like, is recorded in a recording mediun existing in the information generating apparatus and transferred to an information processing apparatus, such as a personal computer (PC) or the like, has been realized as a product.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In such a system, in order to identify and operate the data recorded in the recording medium in the information generating apparatus, logical identification information of data storage (for example, a file name in the case where the data has been recorded as a file) is used or unique identification information (a handle, an ID, etc.) which can specify the data is used.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the above technique, for example, in the case of operating the data with an external information processing apparatus by using the logical identification information such as a file name or the like, recorded in the recording medium in the information generating apparatus, knowledge of the logical identification information recorded in the recording medium in the information generating apparatus has to be understood in the external information processing apparatus and a file system or the like in the information generating apparatus has to be directly operated. In this case, if a logical data management system such as a file system or the like in the information generating apparatus is changed, it is also necessary to change processes in the external information processing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the case of supporting a plurality of kinds of information generating apparatuses having different file systems, the external information processing apparatus has to support logical data management systems such as different kinds of file systems or the like, resulting in an increase in installation costs.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As mentioned above, in the case of using the unique identification information (the handle, ID, etc.) which is independent of the logical data management systems such as file systems or the like of the information generating apparatus, the identification information which is independent of the logical data management system of the recording medium in the information generating apparatus is used. Therefore, even in the case of supporting a plurality of information generating apparatuses having different logical data management systems, since they can be equivalently handled by the external information processing apparatus, the installation costs are reduced. However, on the contrary, in the information generating apparatus, the unique identification information which is independent of the logical data management systems such as file systems or the like in the information generating apparatuses has to be generated and an identification information correspondence table for making the identification information of the logical data management systems such as file names or the like correspond to the generated unique identification information has to be held.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Generally, the identification information management table is stored in a work area such as a RAM or the like in the information generating apparatus and held while the information generating apparatus and the external information processing apparatus are communicating with each other. However, if a large amount of data objects exist in a storage medium existing in the information generating apparatus, a capacity of the work area such as a RAM which is necessary to construct the identification information management table increases, so that the installation costs of the information generating apparatus are increased.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention is made in consideration of the problems as mentioned above and it is an object of the invention to make an identification information management table unnecessary while using identification information which is independent of a logical data management system, thereby enabling installation costs to be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">To accomplish the above object, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention, there is disclosed a digital information input system including an information generating apparatus for digitizing information and an information processing apparatus for collecting information and processing, storing, or managing the information, comprising: identification information generating means for generating second data identification information which is independent of a logical data management system existing in the information generating apparatus, in accordance with a predetermined rule on the basis of first data identification information which depends on the logical data management system existing in the information generating apparatus; and identification information restoring means for restoring the first data identification information in accordance with a predetermined rule on the basis of the second data identification information.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to another preferred embodiment of the invention, there is disclosed an information generating apparatus for digitizing information and enabling the information to be transferred to an outside, comprising: identification information generating means for generating second data identification information which is independent of a logical data management system, in accordance with a predetermined rule on the basis of first data identification information which depends on the logical data management system existing in the information generating apparatus; and identification information restoring means for restoring the first data identification information in accordance with a predetermined rule on the basis of the second data identification information.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">An information managing method and a processing program of the digital information input system arranged between the information generating apparatus and the information processing apparatus and a recording medium in which such a program has been stored are disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters designate the same or similar parts throughout the figures thereof.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Embodiments of a digital information input system, an information generating apparatus, an information managing method, a program, and a computer-readable storage medium of the invention will be described hereinbelow with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing a digital information input system (digital camera system) according to an embodiment of the invention. In the embodiment, the digital information input system is mainly divided into: an information generating apparatus (hereinafter, referred to as a digital camera) <b>100</b> such as digital camera, digital video camera, or the like; and an information processing apparatus (hereinafter, referred to as a PC) <b>101</b> such as a personal computer or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The digital camera <b>100</b> comprises: an optical unit <b>105</b> including a lens, a CCD, a driving circuit, and the like; a signal processing circuit <b>104</b> for processing image data or the like; an operation apparatus <b>103</b> such as a CPU or the like; a primary storage device <b>106</b> such as a DRAM or the like; a secondary storage device <b>107</b> such as a built-in flash ROM or the like; an operation member <b>108</b>; a display apparatus <b>109</b> such as an LCD or the like; a read only memory <b>110</b> such as a ROM or the like which is used to store a program or the like; a detachable recording medium <b>111</b> such as a compact flash (registered trademark) memory card or the like; and a communication control apparatus <b>102</b> for managing a connection to the personal computer PC.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The digital camera can have only the detachable recording medium <b>111</b> in dependence on a kind of digital camera or only the undetachable secondary storage device <b>107</b> such as a built-in flash ROM or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Although a cable connection such as a USB (Universal Serial Bus) or the like can be mentioned with respect to the communication control apparatus <b>102</b> for managing the connection to the PC <b>101</b>, for example, another connection such as a wireless logical connection can be made.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">An image data obtaining method which is used in the embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. First, if it is intended to operate and refer to image data or the like recorded in the recording medium <b>111</b> in the digital camera <b>100</b>, the PC <b>101</b> issues a Get Object Handle Array request to the digital camera <b>100</b> in order to request handle information for identifying the data existing in the recording medium <b>111</b> (step S<b>201</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In response to such a request, the digital camera <b>100</b> collects the data existing in the recording medium <b>111</b> by accessing a file system, generates the handle information on the basis of a file path of the file system, and transmits it to the PC <b>101</b> (step S<b>202</b>). Details of the generation of the handle information will be described hereinlater. Thus, the handle information can be generated as unique information which is independent of the file system in the digital camera <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The PC <b>101</b> holds the received handle information therein (step S<b>203</b>). The PC <b>101</b> uses handle information of the data which the PC <b>101</b> wants to get, among the held handle information, as a parameter of a Get Object request to issue it to the digital camera <b>100</b> (step S<b>204</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In response to such a request, the digital camera <b>100</b> executes a file path restoring process on the obtained handle information as will be explained hereinlater, thereby restoring the file path which depends on the file system in the digital camera <b>100</b> (step S<b>205</b>), retrieves the requested file by using the obtained file path, and transmits the data to the PC <b>101</b> (step S<b>206</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">By receiving the data, the PC <b>101</b> can get the designated data (step S<b>207</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The generation of the handle information according to the embodiment will be described hereinbelow with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a conceptual diagram. As shown in the diagram, in the embodiment, it is assumed as a prerequisite that the file system of the digital camera <b>100</b> is an FAT file system according to a DCF (Design Rule for Camera File System).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Fundamentally, the data which is handled by the digital camera <b>100</b> in the embodiment is data specified in the DCF and it is further assumed that an added data file which has newly been defined is also included. In other words, the embodiment is characterized in that all arbitrary data files existing in the recording medium <b>111</b> are not handled. It is because the more simplified handles can be realized by adding such a limitation, when the handle information is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in the embodiment, a file path name is converted into handle information of 4 bytes. Bits constructing the handle information of 4 bytes are separated as shown by a, b, c, and d in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and determined as follows: (a) a kind of file; (b) a file number; (c) a kind of folder; and (d) a folder number, respectively. The file path in the embodiment corresponds to first identification information in the invention and the handle information corresponds to second identification information in the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As kinds of files, 1. ImageFile(jpg), 2. SoundFile(wav), and 3. MovieFile(avi) have previously been defined. As kinds of folders, 1. DCF-standard folder and 2. CanonMisc folder have previously been defined.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">An explanation will be specifically made on the basis of examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> show two examples. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, image data obtained by photographing an object by a general DCF-based digital camera called &#x201c;DCIM&#xa5;100Canon&#xa5;IMG<sub>&#x2014;</sub>0001.jpg&#x201d; is handled. In this case, first, although a folder &#x201c;DCIM&#x201d; exists in a root of the recording medium, since only the files existing under DCIM are handled in the present embodiment as mentioned above, such information can be omitted when the handle is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Therefore, the kind of folder and the folder number are determined on the basis of the folder name &#x201c;100Canon&#x201d;. The folder number is set to 100 and the kind of folder is set to 1 because it indicates the DCF folder. A portion &#x201c;Canon&#x201d; added to the folder name is omitted when the handle is generated. It is because, since folders whose folder numbers are the same and subsequent portions of 5 characters are different are inhibited in the DCIM according to the DCF standard, even if the portion &#x201c;Canon&#x201d; does not exist, the folder can be unconditionally specified only by the folder number.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Such a folder number can be expressed by &#x201c;00000064h&#x201d; as a hexadecimal number and the kind of folder can be expressed by &#x201c;00001000h&#x201d; as a hexadecimal number.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Subsequently, with respect to the file, since the file number is equal to &#x201c;0001&#x201d; and the kind of file is equal to &#x201c;ImageFile&#x201d; in a manner similar to the above, the file number is expressed by bits &#x201c;0001000h&#x201d; as a hexadecimal number and the kind of file is expressed by bits &#x201c;10000000h&#x201d; as a hexadecimal number.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">When the OR of that bit information is calculated, the handle information which is generated is expressed by &#x201c;0x10011064&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Subsequently, the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In this example, audio data &#x201c;DCIM&#xa5;101TestA&#xa5;Snd<sub>&#x2014;</sub>0003.wav&#x201d; is handled. Also in this case, first, although the folder &#x201c;DCIM&#x201d; exists in the root of the recording medium, since only the files existing under DCIM are handled in the present embodiment as mentioned above, such information can be omitted when the handle is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Therefore, the folder number can be expressed by &#x201c;00000065h&#x201d; as a hexadecimal number and the kind of folder can be expressed by &#x201c;00001000h&#x201d; as a hexadecimal number.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Subsequently, with respect to the file, since the file number is equal to &#x201c;0003&#x201d; and the kind of file is equal to &#x201c;SoundFile&#x201d; in a manner similar to the above, the file number is expressed by bits &#x201c;00030000h&#x201d; as a hexadecimal number and the kind of file is expressed by bits &#x201c;20000000h&#x201d; as a hexadecimal number.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">When the OR of those bit information is calculated, &#x201c;Handle&#x201d; which is generated is expressed by &#x201c;0x20031065&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Subsequently, restoration of a file path which is used in the present embodiment will be described. When the generated handle information is received from the PC <b>101</b>, the digital camera <b>100</b> needs to restore the file path by which its own file system can be referred to.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The restoring method is executed in accordance with a flow opposite to that of the handle information generating method. First, the data of 4 bytes of the handle information is divided into the bit groups shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and the kind of file, the file number, the kind of folder, and the folder number are extracted from each bit group.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">First, when the kind of folder indicates a DCF folder, the inside of the DCIM folder is retrieved by using the folder number and a folder in which the same symbols are provided in first three characters of the folder name is retrieved.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Subsequently, a file is specified by executing retrieval in the retrieved folder by using the file number and the kind of file.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">By using the above method, the digital camera <b>100</b> can dynamically retrieve a predetermined file from its own file system by using the handle information received from the PC <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Other Embodiments</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The invention also incorporates a case where in order to make various devices operative so as to realize the functions of the embodiments mentioned above, program codes of software to realize the functions of the embodiments are supplied to a computer in an apparatus or a system connected to the various devices and the various devices are made operative in accordance with a program stored in a computer (or a CPU or an MPU) of the system or the apparatus, thereby embodying the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In this case, the program codes themselves of the above software realize the functions of the embodiments mentioned above and the program codes themselves construct the invention. As a transferring medium of the program codes, it is possible to use a communication medium (a wired line such as an optical fiber or the like, a wireless line, or the like) in a computer network (LAN, WAN such as an Internet or the like, a wireless communication network, etc.) system for supplying the program codes by transmitting program information as a carrier wave.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Further, means for supplying the program codes to the computer, for example, a recording medium in which the program codes have been stored, can realize the invention. As a recording medium for storing the program codes, for example, a flexible disk, a hard disk, an optical disk, a magneto-optic disk, a CD-ROM, a magnetic tape, a non-volatile memory card, a ROM, or the like, can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Naturally, the invention incorporates not only a case where a computer executes the supplied program codes, so that the functions of the embodiments mentioned above are realized but also a case where the program codes operate together with an OS (Operating System) which is operating in the computer or another application software or the like and the functions of the embodiments mentioned above are realized. In this case, the program codes are also naturally incorporated in the embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Further, naturally, the invention incorporates a case where the supplied program codes are stored into a memory provided for a function expanding board of a computer or a function expanding unit connected to a computer, thereafter, a CPU or the like provided for the function expanding board or the function expanding unit executes a part or all of actual processes on the basis of instructions of the program codes, and the functions of the embodiments mentioned above are realized by those processes.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The shape and structure of each portion shown in the embodiments are merely shown as examples at the time of embodying the invention and the technical purview of the invention should not be limitedly interpreted by them. That is, many modifications and variations are possible within the spirit and scope of the appended claims of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As mentioned above, the data recorded in the recording medium in the information generating apparatus can be operated by the external information processing apparatus by using the identification information which is independent of the logical data management system existing in the information generating apparatus. Moreover, the identification information correspondence table for making the identification information of the logical data management systems, such as file names or the like, correspond to the generated unique identification information does not need to be held in the information generating apparatus. The unique identification information can be converted into the identification information which depends on the logical data management system. Therefore, even if a large amount of data exists in the recording medium in the information generating apparatus, the information generating apparatus can be installed without consuming a large amount of resources, such as RAM and the like.</p>
