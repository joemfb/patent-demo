<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to electronic memories. More specifically, ALD processing techniques for forming non-volatile resistive-switching memories are described.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Nonvolatile memories are semiconductor type memories that retain their contents when unpowered. Nonvolatile memories are used for storage in electronic devices such as digital cameras, cellular telephones, and music players, as well as in general computer systems, embedded systems and other electronic devices that require persistent storage. Nonvolatile semiconductor memories can take the form of removable and easily transportable memory cards or other memory modules, can be integrated into other types of circuits or devices, or can take any other desired form. Nonvolatile semiconductor memories are becoming more prevalent because of their advantages of being small and persistent, having no moving parts, and requiring little power to operate.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Flash memory is a common type of nonvolatile memory used in a variety of devices. Flash memory is a transistor-based memory device that uses multiple gates per transistor and quantum tunneling to store the contents of a memory cell. Flash memory uses a block-access architecture that can result in long access, erase, and writing times.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The speeds of electronic devices and the storage demands of users are rapidly increasing. Flash memory is proving to be inadequate for nonvolatile memory needs. Additionally, volatile memories (such as random access memory (RAM)) can potentially be replaced by nonvolatile memories if the speeds of nonvolatile memories are increased to meet the requirements for RAM and other currently volatile memories.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, what is needed is a new type of nonvolatile memory. Memories that include elements which exhibit changes in resistive states in response to the application of voltages have been described. These memories typically have operational and durability limitations. Therefore, a resistive-switching memory with improved operational and durability characteristics is desired.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A detailed description of one or more embodiments is provided below along with accompanying figures. The detailed description is provided in connection with such embodiments, but is not limited to any particular example. The scope is limited only by the claims and numerous alternatives, modifications, and equivalents are encompassed. Numerous specific details are set forth in the following description in order to provide a thorough understanding. These details are provided for the purpose of example and the described techniques may be practiced according to the claims without some or all of these specific details. For the purpose of clarity, technical material that is known in the technical fields related to the embodiments has not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the description.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to various embodiments, resistive-switching memory elements can be formed that use resistive-switching metal oxide layers. According to some of these embodiments, a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) memory element can be formed from two electrodes and one or more layers of one or more metal oxides disposed therebetween. In some embodiments, metal oxide layers can be formed using atomic layer deposition (ALD). Certain ALD process parameters can be optimized to reduce the forming voltage and increase the site yield of memory elements described herein. For example, the purge duration and the substrate temperature of the deposition process can be optimized.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">I. Memory Structure</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a memory array <b>100</b> of resistive switching memory elements <b>102</b>. Memory array <b>100</b> may be part of a memory device or other integrated circuit. Read and write circuitry may be connected to memory elements <b>102</b> using signal lines <b>104</b> and orthogonal signal lines <b>106</b>. Signal lines such as signal lines <b>104</b> and signal lines <b>106</b> are sometimes referred to as word lines and bit lines and are used to read and write data into the elements <b>102</b> of array <b>100</b>. Individual memory elements <b>102</b> or groups of memory elements <b>102</b> can be addressed using appropriate sets of signal lines <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>. Memory element <b>102</b> may be formed from one or more layers <b>108</b> of materials, as is described in further detail below. In addition, the memory arrays shown can be stacked in a vertical fashion to make multi-layer 3-D memory arrays.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Any suitable read and write circuitry and array layout scheme may be used to construct a nonvolatile memory device from resistive switching memory elements such as element <b>102</b>. For example, horizontal and vertical lines <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> may be connected directly to the terminals of resistive switching memory elements <b>102</b>. This is merely illustrative.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">If desired, other electrical devices may be associated (i.e., be one or more of the layers <b>108</b>) with each memory element <b>102</b> (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). These devices, which are sometimes referred to as current steering elements, may include, for example, diodes, p-i-n diodes, silicon diodes, silicon p-i-n diodes, transistors, etc. Current steering elements may be connected in series in any suitable locations in memory element <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">II. Memory Operation</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">During a read operation, the state of a memory element <b>102</b> can be sensed by applying a sensing voltage (i.e., a &#x201c;read&#x201d; voltage) to an appropriate set of signal lines <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>. Depending on its history, a memory element that is addressed in this way may be in either a high resistance state or a low resistance state. The resistance of the memory element therefore determines what digital data is being stored by the memory element. If the memory element has a high resistance, for example, the memory element may be said to contain a logic one (i.e., a &#x201c;1&#x201d; bit). If, on the other hand, the memory element has a low resistance, the memory element may be said to contain a logic zero (i.e., a &#x201c;0&#x201d; bit). During a write operation, the state of a memory element can be changed by application of suitable write signals to an appropriate set of signal lines <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a logarithm of current (I) versus voltage (V) plot <b>200</b> for a memory element <b>102</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates the set and reset operations to change the contents of the memory element <b>102</b>. Initially, memory element <b>102</b> may be in a high resistance state (&#x201c;HRS&#x201d;, e.g., storing a logic zero). In this state, the current versus voltage characteristic of memory element <b>102</b> is represented by solid line HRS <b>202</b>. The high resistance state of memory element <b>102</b> can be sensed by read and write circuitry using signal lines <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>. For example, read and write circuitry may apply a read voltage V<sub>READ </sub>to memory element <b>102</b> and can sense the resulting &#x201c;off&#x201d; current I<sub>OFF </sub>that flows through memory element <b>102</b>. When it is desired to store a logic one in memory element <b>102</b>, memory element <b>102</b> can be placed into its low-resistance state. This may be accomplished by using read and write circuitry to apply a set voltage V<sub>SET </sub>across signal lines <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>. Applying V<sub>SET </sub>to memory element <b>102</b> causes memory element <b>102</b> to switch to its low resistance state, as indicated by dashed line <b>206</b>. In this region, the memory element <b>102</b> is changed so that, following removal of the set voltage VSET, memory element <b>102</b> is characterized by low resistance curve LRS <b>204</b>. As is described further below, the change in the resistive state of memory element <b>102</b> may be because of the filling of traps (i.e., a may be &#x201c;trap-mediated&#x201d;) in a metal oxide material.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The low resistance state of memory element <b>102</b> can be sensed using read and write circuitry. When a read voltage V<sub>READ </sub>is applied to resistive switching memory element <b>102</b>, read and write circuitry will sense the relatively high &#x201c;on&#x201d; current value I<sub>ON</sub>, indicating that memory element <b>102</b> is in its low resistance state. When it is desired to store a logic zero in memory element <b>102</b>, the memory element can once again be placed in its high resistance state by applying a reset voltage V<sub>RESET </sub>to memory element <b>102</b>. When read and write circuitry applies V<sub>RESET </sub>to memory element <b>102</b>, memory element <b>102</b> enters its high resistance state HRS, as indicated by dashed line <b>208</b>. When the reset voltage V<sub>RESET </sub>is removed from memory element <b>102</b>, memory element <b>102</b> will once again be characterized by high resistance line HRS <b>204</b>. Voltage pulses (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) can be used in the programming of the memory element <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A forming voltage V<sub>FORM </sub>is a voltage applied to the memory element <b>102</b> to ready the memory element <b>102</b> for use. Some memory elements described herein may need a forming event that includes the application of a voltage greater than or equal to the set voltage or reset voltage. Once the memory element <b>102</b> initially switches, the set and reset voltages can be used to change the resistance state of the memory element <b>102</b>. A lower forming voltage may be desirable (e.g. less than 5 volts) to reduce the likelihood of damage to the memory element. As is described herein, certain process techniques can be used to form memory elements that have lower forming voltages.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The bistable resistance of resistive switching memory element <b>102</b> makes memory element <b>102</b> suitable for storing digital data. Because no changes take place in the stored data in the absence of application of the voltages V<sub>SET </sub>and V<sub>RESET</sub>, memory formed from elements such as element <b>102</b> is nonvolatile. As can be appreciated, it is desirable for memory element <b>102</b> to have a large difference between off current and on current (i.e., a high I<sub>ON</sub>/I<sub>OFF </sub>ratio), which causes the on and off states of the memory element to be more discrete and easily detectable.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">III. Switching Mechanisms</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">A. Bulk-Mediated Switching</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In its most basic form, the layers <b>108</b> of the memory element <b>102</b> include two electrodes (each having one or more materials and/or layers) and one or more layers of one or more metal oxides disposed in between. The memory element <b>102</b> generally has a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor structure, although other structures such as metal-insulator-insulator-metal (MIIM) and metal-insulator-insulator-insulator-metal (MIIIM) can be used as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Without being bound by theory, in some embodiments the memory element <b>102</b> may use a switching mechanism that is mediated in the bulk of the metal oxide. Generally, defects are formed in, already exist in the deposited metal oxide, and existing defects can be enhanced by additional processes. Defects may take the form of variances in charge in the structure of the metal oxide. For example, some charge carriers may be absent from the structure (i.e., vacancies) or additional charge carriers may be present (i.e., interstitials). Therefore, by applying a voltage to the memory element <b>102</b>, the defects, such as traps, can either be filled or emptied to alter the resistivity of a metal oxide and resistive switching memory elements can be formed using these principles.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, and for some materials, the set voltage is dependent on the thickness of the metal oxide layer (see discussion regarding <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref>) which indicates a bulk-mediated switching mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The metal oxides may be of any phase, including crystalline and amorphous. The deposited metal oxides can have impurities (i.e., substitional defects) such as an aluminum atom where a hafnium atom should be, vacancies (missing atoms), and interstitials (extra atoms). Amorphous-phase metal oxides may have increased resistivity, which in some embodiments can lower the operational currents of the device to reduce potential damage to the memory element <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a current (I) versus voltage (V) plot <b>220</b> for a memory element <b>102</b> that demonstrates a resistance state change. The plot <b>220</b> shows a voltage ramp applied to the memory element <b>102</b> along the x-axis and the resulting current along a y-axis. The line <b>222</b> represents the response of an Ohmic material when the ramped voltage is applied. An Ohmic response is undesirable, since there is no discrete voltage at which the set or reset occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Generally, a more abrupt graph like graph <b>224</b> is desired. The graph <b>224</b> begins with an Ohmic response <b>224</b><i>a</i>, and then curves sharply upward <b>224</b><i>b</i>. The graph <b>224</b> may represent a set operation, where the memory element <b>102</b> switches from the HRS <b>202</b> to the LRS <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Without being bound by theory, non-metallic percolation paths are formed during a set operation and broken during a reset operation. For example, during a set operation, the memory element <b>102</b> switches to a low resistance state. The percolation paths that are formed by filling traps increase the conductivity of the metal oxide, thereby reducing (i.e., changing) the resistivity. The voltage represented by <b>224</b><i>b </i>is the set voltage. At the set voltage, the traps are filled and there is a large jump in current as the resistivity of the metal oxide decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The set voltage shown here is very discrete (i.e., vertical), which is desirable to ensure the switching of the memory element occurs at a repeatable voltage. Additionally, a high ratio of on current to off current (i.e., a high I<sub>ON</sub>/I<sub>OFF </sub>ratio), for example 10 or greater, is desirable because it indicates a large difference in the resistivity of the metal oxide when in the HRS and LRS, making the state of the memory element easier to determine. Finally, it is desirable to have low set, reset, and forming voltages in order to avoid damage to the memory elements and to be compatible with complementary device elements (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) such as diodes and/or transistors in series with the memory element <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">B. Defects</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The metal oxide includes electrically active defects (also known as traps) in the bulk. It is believed that the traps can be filled by the application of the set voltage, and emptied by applying the reset voltage. Traps can be inherent in the metal oxide (i.e., existing from formation of the metal oxide) or created by doping, and enhanced by doping and other processes. For example, a hafnium oxide layer may include oxygen or hafnium vacancies or oxygen or hafnium interstitials that may form traps which can be used to create percolation paths and alter the conductivity of the hafnium oxide layer.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A metal oxide may include defects that are the result of the process used to form the metal oxide. In other words, the defects may be inherent in the metal oxide. For example, atomic layer deposition (ALD) processes deposit layers that will always have some imperfections or flaws. These imperfections can generally be referred to as defects in the structure of the metal oxide. The defects can be used to create localized charge variances that can be filled and emptied by applying voltage pulses to the metal oxides. Defects can be created by doping, which is explained in more detail below.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">C. Scaling and Bandgap</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref> are graphs showing the relationship between thicknesses of a metal oxide layer and resulting set voltages, reset voltages, and on/off current ratios for several materials systems used in memory elements described herein. These graphs describe a system that includes two electrodes and a single layer of metal oxide disposed in between. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, for hafnium oxide <b>302</b>, aluminum oxide <b>304</b>, and tantalum oxide <b>306</b>, set voltage increases with (i.e., is dependent on) thickness, and in some embodiments and for these materials the set voltage is at least one volt (V) per one hundred angstroms (&#x212b;) of the thickness of a metal oxide layer in the memory element. In some embodiments, an increase in the thickness of the metal oxide layer of 100 &#x212b; increases the set voltage by at least 1V. Similarly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, reset voltage for hafnium oxide <b>322</b>, aluminum oxide <b>324</b>, and tantalum oxide <b>326</b> also depends on thickness. These data therefore support a bulk-controlled set/reset mechanism for these materials, since a linear relationship indicates the formation of percolation paths throughout the bulk of the metal oxide. In other words, for a thicker material, more voltage is needed to fill the traps.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Hafnium oxide (5.7 electron volts (eV)), aluminum oxide (8.4 eV) and tantalum oxide (4.6 eV) all have a bandgap greater than 4 eV, while titanium oxide (3.0 eV) and niobium oxide (3.4 eV) have bandgaps less than 4 eV. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, set voltages for titanium oxide <b>308</b> and niobium oxide <b>310</b> and reset voltages for titanium oxide <b>328</b> and niobium oxide <b>330</b> do not increase with thickness. Therefore, a higher bandgap (i.e., bandgap greater than 4 eV) metal oxide exhibits bulk mediated switching and scalable set and reset voltages. In other words, set and reset voltages can be reduced by reducing the thickness of the high bandgap metal oxides such as hafnium oxide. Therefore, for smaller devices, set and reset voltages can be lowered. However, other materials, including lower bandgap materials (i.e. having a bandgap less than 4 eV) have also shown switching properties, and may be used with embodiments described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> shows a relationship between the I<sub>ON</sub>/I<sub>OFF </sub>ratio and the thickness of a metal oxide layer. Metal oxides that have bandgaps greater than 4 eV (i.e., hafnium oxide <b>342</b>, aluminum oxide <b>344</b>, and tantalum oxide <b>346</b>, as well as other higher-bandgap materials such as zirconium oxide and yttrium oxide) show a scaling relationship between I<sub>ON</sub>/I<sub>OFF </sub>ratio and thickness. Additionally, for increasing bandgap, the I<sub>ON</sub>/I<sub>OFF </sub>ratio increases. Conversely, materials having a bandgap less than 4 eV (i.e., titanium oxide <b>348</b> and niobium oxide <b>350</b>) exhibit an I<sub>ON</sub>/I<sub>OFF </sub>ratio that is independent of oxide thickness. Additionally, the higher bandgap materials generally have higher I<sub>ON</sub>/I<sub>OFF </sub>ratios, which improve the ability to distinguish between the off state and the on state of the memory element.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> is a graph <b>360</b> that illustrates a non-metallic nature of metal oxides used for the memory elements described herein. The graph <b>360</b> shows increasing resistivity for a high-bandgap (i.e., greater than 4 eV) oxide layer with decreasing temperatures, which is a characteristic of a non-metallic material. The graph <b>360</b> shows a sweep in voltage on the x-axis versus current on the y-axis. As can be seen the measurements <b>362</b> taken at 300 Kelvin (K) show the greatest current output, and thus lowest resistivity. The measurements <b>364</b> taken at 250K, <b>366</b> taken at 150K, <b>368</b> taken at 100K, <b>370</b> taken at 60K, <b>372</b> taken at 50K, and <b>374</b> taken at 10K show increasing resistivity (i.e., lower current) as the temperature decreases. This is a characteristic of non-metallic materials; some embodiments described herein include metal oxides that exhibit non-metallic switching mechanisms.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">IV. Memory Element Structures</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">A. Design Considerations</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As described above, a desirable resistive-switching memory element in some embodiments has low set and reset voltages and a high I<sub>ON</sub>/I<sub>OFF </sub>ratio. A materials system for achieving these goals includes a metal oxide that exhibits bulk-mediated switching and includes a base metal oxide that has a bandgap of greater than 4 electron volts (eV), although resistive-switching metal oxides can be made from other materials (e.g. titanium oxide) if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Other design considerations may include using more than one metal oxide in a single layer (co-deposition) or multiple layers (stacked), using electrodes that have different work functions, using at least one noble metal electrode, using different metal oxides having different bandgaps, and using low leakage materials. The off current is related to the leakage of the material and the size of the device. Generally, the leakage should be low enough that the off current remains low enough to provide adequate separation between the on and off currents (i.e., a sufficiently high I<sub>ON</sub>/I<sub>OFF </sub>ratio). Leakage is related to I<sub>OFF</sub>, and the 40 A/cm<sup>2 </sup>measured at 0.5 V per 20 &#x212b; of oxide thickness in an off state of the memory element described herein gives an off current that is low enough to give a reliably high I<sub>ON</sub>/I<sub>OFF </sub>ratio.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">B. Materials</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">1. Metal Oxides</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Specific metal oxides that use bulk-mediated switching mechanisms according to embodiments of the invention include hafnium oxide, aluminum oxide, tantalum oxide, zirconium oxide, and yttrium oxide. These metal oxides have a bandgap that is greater than 4 eV, indicating that they are more insulating and therefore have a higher resistivity. As is explained regarding <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref>, higher bandgap (i.e., greater than 4 eV) metal oxides also allow for scaling of set voltage as related to metal oxide thickness. However, other materials have been shown to have switching properties and may also be used with the embodiments described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">These oxides can be doped with each other and additionally, for example, scandium oxide, yttrium oxide, and nickel oxide. Other dopants may include rare earth metals such as lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, gadolinium, erbium, ytterbium, and lutetium and their oxides. Additional dopants may include hafnium, hafnium oxide, oxygen, silicon, silicon oxide, nitrogen, fluorine, chromium, and chromium oxide.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Another criterion for selecting a metal oxide can be to have a metal nitride electrode and a metal oxide adjacent to the metal nitride electrode. The metal to form the metal oxide and the metal nitride are the same. For example, a memory element can be formed having a titanium nitride electrode and a titanium oxide layer adjacent to the titanium nitride electrode. This serves to stabilize the interface, for example. The memory element can also include other metal oxides (e.g., aluminum oxide or hafnium oxide) in a stacked or co-deposited manner.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In another embodiment, two metal oxides can be stacked in layers to adjust the effective on current of the memory element <b>102</b>. The first metal oxide can have a smaller on current than the second metal oxide material and the second metal oxide material can have a lower off current than the first metal oxide material. In these embodiments, the memory element <b>102</b> can have the lower off current of the second metal oxide material and the lower on current of the first metal oxide material to make the memory element <b>102</b> compatible with other device elements, for example a diode or transistor in series with the memory elements.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">2. Electrodes</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Electrode materials may include silicon, silicides, doped silicon (e.g. n-type or p-type polysilicon), titanium nitride (TiN), platinum, iridium, iridium oxide, ruthenium and ruthenium oxide. According to some embodiments, one electrode may be a higher work function material, and the other electrode may be a lower work function material. For example, in one embodiment, at least one electrode is a high work function material such as a noble or near noble metal (i.e., a metal with a low absolute value (i.e., negative or positive) free energy change (|&#x394;G|) of oxide formation). Noble or near noble metals include iridium, iridium oxide, platinum, ruthenium, and ruthenium oxide. The other electrode may be a lower work function material such as titanium nitride, or may also be a noble or near noble material. In some embodiments, the reset pulse at the electrode having the higher work function is a positive pulse (i.e., the higher work function electrode is the anode of the memory element).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In other embodiments, the electrodes can be multi-layer electrodes that can include one or more different materials. For example, an electrode can include a layer of ruthenium and ruthenium oxide, or a layer of iridium, iridium oxide, or platinum with a capping layer of tungsten, tungsten carbonitride, or tungsten carbon. The multi-layer electrodes can be used to improve adhesion properties and performance of memory elements in some configurations and embodiments.</p>

<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an exemplary memory element <b>102</b>-<b>4</b> according to various embodiments. As is described below, various different configurations of memory element <b>102</b> are possible; the memory element <b>102</b>-<b>4</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is one example of a memory element <b>102</b> that can be used with memory array <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The memory element <b>102</b>-<b>4</b> includes two electrodes <b>402</b> and <b>404</b>. The electrodes <b>402</b> and <b>404</b> can be formed using any appropriate process, such as PVD, CVD, ALD, etc., and can have any appropriate thickness, for example 10-2000 &#x212b;.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A bottom electrode <b>402</b> is, in some embodiments, nearer a substrate on which the memory element <b>102</b>-<b>4</b> is formed. A top electrode <b>404</b> is further from the substrate. Although &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; and &#x201c;top&#x201d; are used to describe the electrodes for some systems, it is understood that the memory element <b>102</b>-<b>4</b> may have any orientation relative to the substrate, signal lines, word lines and bit lines, or other components of the memory array <b>100</b>, and that the memory element <b>102</b>-<b>4</b> may be formed in reverse order from what is shown.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The electrodes <b>402</b> and <b>404</b> may be adjacent to or otherwise in electrical communication with signal lines <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>. The signal lines <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> can be any conductor such as tungsten, aluminum, or copper.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A metal oxide <b>406</b> is between the electrodes <b>402</b> and <b>404</b>. The memory element <b>102</b>-<b>4</b> may be described as an MIM stack. The metal oxide <b>406</b> may in some embodiments be described as a transition metal oxide, and may be a binary metal oxide, ternary metal oxide, or some other combination of the materials described above. The metal oxide is, in some embodiments, formed using atomic layer deposition (ALD). If the metal oxide is a binary or ternary metal oxide, the metal oxide <b>406</b> may be co-deposited (e.g. co-injected of formed as a nanolaminate). The electrodes <b>402</b> and <b>404</b> and the metal oxide <b>406</b> are layers <b>108</b> of the memory element <b>102</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">1. Set and Reset Pulses</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, the metal oxide <b>406</b> uses a bulk-mediated switching mechanism as described above. Various techniques for switching the memory element are described below. In one embodiment, the electrode <b>404</b> is grounded and voltage pulses are applied to the electrode <b>402</b>. In a unipolar embodiment, for example, the set pulse <b>408</b> and reset pulse <b>410</b> are both negative. In a bipolar embodiment, the set pulse <b>412</b> is positive while the reset pulse <b>414</b> is negative. Alternatively, the electrode <b>402</b> is grounded and pulses are applied to the electrode <b>404</b>. In the alternative embodiment, for unipolar switching, both the set and reset voltage pulses applied to the electrode <b>404</b> are positive. In the bipolar embodiment, the set voltage is negative and the reset voltage is positive.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The electrode that is positive for the reset voltage pulse is described herein as the anode. The anode is positive for reset, and may be either positive for the set (for unipolar embodiments) or negative for the set (for bipolar embodiments). Generally, the set and reset voltages may either have a same relative polarity (unipolar) or a different relative polarity (bipolar).</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">2. Percolation Paths</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to one embodiment, percolation paths <b>416</b> are believed to originate from electrode <b>402</b> and spread toward electrode <b>404</b>. With the memory elements <b>102</b>, the anode is the electrode at which the reset pulse is positive (i.e., the electrode <b>404</b>). In the memory elements <b>102</b>, the percolation paths <b>416</b> originate from the cathode and, as traps are filled, migrate toward the anode in the presence of the set voltage pulse <b>408</b> or <b>412</b>. The reset pulse <b>410</b> subsequently destroys the percolation paths <b>416</b>. In some embodiments, oxygen (O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup>) defects may be the mobile species that lead to the formation of the percolation paths. Although percolation paths are described here, it is understood that other mechanisms can be used to explain the switching mechanism of the memory element.</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">3. Current Steering Element</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The memory element <b>102</b>-<b>4</b> (as well as other memory elements <b>102</b> described herein) can include an optional complementary device such as a current steering element <b>418</b>. The current steering element <b>418</b> is in series with the memory element <b>102</b>, and may be, for example, a diode or transistor. The current steering element <b>418</b> can be located anywhere with respect to memory element <b>102</b> (e.g., between the metal oxide <b>406</b> and the electrode <b>404</b>).</p>
<p id="h-0021" num="0000">V. Memory Element Formation</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart describing a process <b>500</b> for forming a memory element. The process <b>500</b> is a general description of techniques used to form the memory elements described above. The process <b>500</b> describes techniques for forming a memory element <b>102</b> generally including two electrodes and at least one layer of metal oxide disposed therebetween. Although certain processing techniques and specifications are described, it is understood that various other techniques and modifications of the techniques described herein may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In operation <b>502</b>, a first electrode is formed. The first electrode can be formed on a substrate, for example, a silicon substrate that may include one or more layers already formed thereon. The first electrode may be formed over a signal line such as a bit line or a word line. The first electrode can be silicon, a silicide, titanium nitride, or other appropriate materials such as those described above. In one example, a titanium nitride electrode is formed using PVD or another process described above. For example, the first electrode can be sputtered by bombarding a metal target at 150-500 W with a pressure of 2-10 mTorr for a deposition rate of approximately 0.5-5 &#x212b;/s. These specifications are given as examples; the specifications can vary greatly depending on the material to be deposited, the tool used to deposit the material, and the desired speed of deposition. The duration of the bombardment can determine the thickness of the electrode. Other processing techniques, such as ALD, PLD, CVD, evaporation, etc. can also be used to deposit the first electrode. In some embodiments, the first electrode is in contact with one of the signal lines <b>104</b> or <b>106</b>. The first electrode may have any thickness, for example 10 &#x212b;-2000 &#x212b;.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In operation <b>504</b>, the substrate is heated, for example by heating a pedestal on which the substrate is mounted in an ALD chamber. In this way, a pedestal temperature is maintained for an ALD deposition process so that the metal oxide layer(s) can be deposited. As is described further below, the pedestal temperature can be reduced below a pedestal temperature typically used for ALD processes (which may be, for example, 250&#xb0; C.) to reduce the forming voltage of the resulting memory element. For example, the pedestal on which the substrate is mounted can be heated to and maintained at a temperature of less than 100&#xb0; C. In one embodiment, the pedestal temperature is maintained throughout the formation of a metal oxide layer using ALD, for example throughout operation <b>506</b> (i.e. operations <b>508</b>-<b>516</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In operation <b>506</b>, at least one metal oxide layer is formed using ALD. The metal oxide layer can be a resistive-switching metal oxide layer, such as a high bandgap (i.e. greater than 4 eV) material including hafnium oxide, aluminum oxide, yttrium oxide, or tantalum oxide, or can be another resistive-switching material such as titanium oxide. As mentioned above, ALD is a multi-step process used to deposit semiconductor layers. The operation <b>504</b> is a single ALD cycle. An ALD-deposited layer typically includes multiple cycles to deposit a layer of a desired thickness, so the process <b>506</b> is repeated until the desired layer thickness has been deposited. The metal oxide layer can include single metal oxide (e.g. hafnium oxide or aluminum oxide), can use co-injection or nanolaminates to deposit a binary metal oxide, or can use multiple layers of metal oxides. For example, a hafnium oxide &#x201c;base&#x201d; layer can be deposited over a titanium oxide &#x201c;diffusion barrier&#x201d; layer. In other embodiments, three or more different layers of materials can be deposited.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In operation <b>508</b>, a first reagent is introduced to (e.g. flowed onto) a substrate (e.g. over the first electrode) by introducing the first reagent into an ALD chamber. The first reagent can be a metal-containing precursor that is used to form a metal oxide. For example, the first reagent can be trimethylaluminum (TMA) to deposit an aluminum oxide layer or a hafnium oxide layer can be deposited using hafnium precursors such as tetrakis(diethylamido)hafnium (TDEAHf), tetrakis(dimethylamido)hafnium (TDMAHf), tetrakis(ethylmethylamido)hafnium (TEMAHf) or hafnium chloride (HfCl<sub>4</sub>). Other precursors, for example tetrakis(ethylmethylamino)zirconium (TEMAZ) to deposit zirconium oxide or tris(methylcyclopentadienyl)-yttrium ((Cp)<sub>3</sub>)Y to deposit yttrium oxide. In other embodiments, lower bandgap (i.e. less than 4 eV) materials, such as titanium oxide, have been shown to exhibit switching properties. Precursors such as tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) can be used to deposit titanium oxide.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In operation <b>510</b>, the excess (unreacted portion) of the first reagent is purged, for example by purging the ALD chamber to remove excess precursor. The purge duration can be shorter than a typical purge duration for ALD, for example being between 5 and 20 seconds, 10 and 17 seconds, or 15 seconds, compared to a typical purge of 30 seconds. It is believed that the shortened purge duration can leave impurities in the film, creating defects and leading to a lower forming voltage. These impurities are desirable because they can create point defects in the deposited metal oxide layer.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In operation <b>512</b>, a second reagent is introduced to the substrate. The second reagent combines with the first reagent to form a metal oxide. The second reagent is an oxidizer, for example ozone, water vapor, or oxygen. The second reagent forms an oxide of the metal contained in the first reagent (the precursor). In operation <b>514</b>, the unreacted second reagent is purged. This purge duration can also be shortened (e.g. to 5-20 seconds or 15 seconds), although a longer purge can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In operation <b>516</b>, it is determined whether another ALD deposition cycle is to be performed. A typical ALD cycle may form a layer that is 0.5 &#x212b;, for example. To form a 50 &#x212b; metal oxide layer, 100 cycles would need to be performed. So, if in operation <b>516</b>, it is determined that the desired number of cycles has been performed or that the desired thickness has been reached, the process <b>500</b> continues to operation <b>518</b>. If more ALD cycles need to be completed, the process <b>500</b> returns to operation <b>508</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In operation <b>518</b>, a second electrode is deposited over the metal oxide layer. The second electrode may be, according to some embodiments, a noble or near-noble metal such as iridium, iridium oxide, platinum, ruthenium, or ruthenium oxide deposited using PVD, ALD, CVD, PLD, evaporation, or another suitable technique. A platinum PVD top electrode can be deposited using PVD by sputtering a metal target at 100-500 W with a pressure of 2-10 mTorr for a deposition rate of 0.5-10 &#x212b;/s. The duration of the sputtering determines the thickness of the electrode. In other embodiments, a non-noble electrode can be deposited. As mentioned above, it is understood that specifications for performing the deposition depend on the material to be deposited, the desired deposition rate, the tool being used, and other factors.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">After the memory element is formed, an initial voltage, the forming voltage, can be applied across the memory element to form the memory element. The forming voltage can be applied by increasing the voltage across the memory element until the memory element switches resistive states. The voltage at which it initially switches is the forming voltage. This forming voltage can be reduced (e.g. to less than 5.5V) as a result of the ALD processing techniques including the lower pedestal temperature and the shorter duration purge described herein.</p>
<p id="h-0022" num="0000">VI. ALD Processing Techniques</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As described above, the metal oxide layer(s) of a memory element <b>102</b> can be deposited using ALD. Several ALD processing parameters can be optimized to improve characteristics of memory elements formed using ALD. As described herein, the temperature of the ALD process can be optimized, and the duration of an ALD purge can be optimized. The optimization of these parameters can result in lower forming voltages and increased site yield as well as other advantageous results.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Although certain temperatures, temperature ranges, times, time ranges, materials, material systems, and memory element structures are discussed below, it is understood that the techniques described herein can be used with any memory element described herein as well as with any processing variables (e.g., any temperature or any purge duration).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In one embodiment, for example, a resistive-switching memory element can be made using a titanium nitride electrode, an aluminum oxide resistive-switching metal oxide, and a platinum electrode. In other examples, the memory element can use hafnium oxide as a metal oxide, or doped silicon (e.g. polysilicon) in place of the platinum electrode. In further embodiments, a multi-layered metal oxide stack can be used to form a titanium nitride/titanium oxide/hafnium oxide/platinum memory element. Although these specific examples are given, a memory element using any of the materials described herein or using any other materials can be formed using the techniques described herein.</p>
<p id="h-0023" num="0000">1. ALD Process Temperature</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">According to some embodiments, the temperature at which the ALD process is performed can be optimized to lower forming voltage and increase site yield. The optimal temperature can depend on several variables including the metal oxide material(s), electrode materials, memory element structure, memory element thickness, etc. For some embodiments, the optimal temperature may be lower than a standard processing temperature.</p>
<p id="h-0024" num="0000">i. Process Example</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As an example, a memory element (e.g. the memory element <b>102</b>-<b>4</b>) can be formed using an aluminum oxide layer <b>402</b>. A typical ALD deposition process may be performed using a pedestal temperature of 250&#xb0; C. For the deposition of aluminum oxide, the pedestal temperature can be lowered to, for example, approximately 80&#xb0; C. (or in the range of 50-100&#xb0; C., in the range of 70-90&#xb0; C., less than 200&#xb0; C., less than 100&#xb0; C., etc.). It is understood that any temperature can be used as appropriate. The pedestal can be heated to heat the substrate, as is described in operation <b>504</b> of the process <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Without being bound by theory, a metal oxide (e.g. aluminum oxide) deposited using a lower pedestal temperature may include more carbon and hydrogen impurities than aluminum oxide deposited using a higher pedestal temperature. The carbon and hydrogen atoms passivate traps in the metal oxide, which results in a reduction in the number of active traps to be filled. The fewer traps require a lower voltage to form the memory element, thereby reducing the forming voltage. The lower forming voltage is desirable to reduce potential damage to the memory element. The lower pedestal temperature should therefore reduce forming voltage regardless of the material being deposited or the precursor being used.</p>
<p id="h-0025" num="0000">ii. Experimental Data</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is a distribution plots <b>600</b> illustrating forming voltages for memory elements formed using varying ALD pedestal temperatures. The memory elements include an approximately 50 &#x212b; thick aluminum oxide layer between a titanium nitride electrode and a platinum electrode. The aluminum oxide layer was deposited using a trimethylaluminum precursor and ozone.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The ALD pedestal temperature for forming one set of memory elements <b>602</b> was 80&#xb0; C., and the pedestal temperature for another set of memory elements <b>604</b> was 250&#xb0; C. The memory elements <b>602</b> formed using the lower ALD pedestal temperature have a lower median forming voltage of 5.2V versus a median forming voltage of 7.2V for the memory elements <b>604</b>. Therefore, the median forming voltage can be reduced to less than 5.5V, for example. Accordingly, optimizing the ALD pedestal temperature can reduce the forming voltage of the resulting memory element.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6B and 6C</figref> are distribution plots <b>620</b> and <b>640</b> showing site yield of memory elements formed using ALD at different pedestal temperatures. The plot <b>620</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> shows the survival of an ALD aluminum oxide layer between a titanium nitride electrode and a platinum electrode, where the pedestal temperature was 80&#xb0; C. The plot <b>640</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> shows the survival of an ALD aluminum oxide layer between a titanium nitride electrode and a platinum electrode, where the pedestal temperature was 250&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The plots <b>620</b> and <b>640</b> show the number of memory elements that have failed (i.e. no longer switch) by a certain cycle number. The y-axis plots the percentage of memory elements that have failed, while the x-axis plots the cycle number. The plot <b>620</b> shows a set of memory elements <b>622</b> (represented by triangles) and a set of memory elements <b>624</b> (represented by circles) that were both deposited using a pedestal temperature of 80&#xb0; C. In the set of memory elements <b>624</b>, for example, more than 50% of the memory elements are still switching after 30 set and reset cycles, and in both sets <b>622</b> and <b>624</b>, at least half of the memory elements survive to 10 cycles.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The plot <b>640</b> includes a set of memory elements <b>642</b> (represented by circles) and a set of memory elements <b>644</b> (represented by squares) that were both deposited using a pedestal temperature of 250&#xb0; C. As can be seen, the memory elements <b>642</b> only last to two cycles and the memory elements <b>644</b> only last to three cycles.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The devices formed at the lower temperature (as shown in the plot <b>620</b>) survive many more switching cycles. As a result, the pedestal temperature is optimized by lowering the temperature, for example to beneath 100&#xb0; C., to between 70 and 90&#xb0; C., or to 80&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="h-0026" num="0000">2. ALD Purge Duration</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Some ALD processes use a cycle for depositing a monolayer. For example, the cycle can include four steps: 1) introduce a first reagent, 2) purge the excess of the first reagent, 3) introduce a second reagent, and 4) purge the excess of the second reagent. In some embodiments, optimizing the time of the purge portions of an ALD cycle can reduce forming voltage of resulting memory elements.</p>
<p id="h-0027" num="0000">i. Process Example</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As an example, a memory element of the type of the memory element <b>102</b>-<b>4</b> can be formed using an aluminum oxide layer <b>402</b>. A typical ALD deposition process may be performed using a purge time of 30 seconds. For the deposition of aluminum oxide, the purge time can be reduced to, for example, approximately 15 seconds (or less than 20 seconds, or in the range of 5-20 seconds, in the range of 10-17 seconds, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Without being bound by theory, and as described above, increased impurities can passivate traps in the deposited metal oxide. Shortening the purge duration can increase the number of impurities in the deposited film because less purge time results in fewer impurities being removed, thereby reducing the amount of voltage needed to form the memory elements. The shortened pulse duration should therefore reduce forming voltage regardless of the material being deposited or the precursor being used.</p>
<p id="h-0028" num="0000">ii. Experimental Data</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref> is a distribution plot <b>660</b> of memory elements formed from ALD processes using different purge durations. The memory elements include an aluminum oxide layer between a titanium nitride electrode and a platinum electrode. The aluminum oxide layer is approximately 50 &#x212b; and formed using ALD. The memory elements <b>662</b> (represented by triangles) were formed using a 15 second purge, while the memory elements <b>664</b> (represented by circles) were formed using a 30 second purge. The aluminum oxide layer was deposited using a trimethylaluminum precursor and ozone.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The median forming voltage of the memory elements <b>662</b> formed using the 15 second purge is 4.4V, while the median forming voltage of the memory elements <b>664</b> formed using the 30 second purge is 5.6V. Therefore, for these memory elements, forming voltage is reduced and the purge duration is optimized by shortening the purge duration. Therefore, by shortening the purge duration, the median forming voltage can be reduced to less than 5.5V or less than 5V.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Although certain operational mechanisms are described herein, it is understood that the various embodiments are not bound by the theories of these operational mechanisms. Further, although the foregoing examples have been described in some detail for purposes of clarity of understanding, the invention is not limited to the details provided. There are many alternative ways of implementing the invention. The disclosed examples are illustrative and not restrictive.</p>
