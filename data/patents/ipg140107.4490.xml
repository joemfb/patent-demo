<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In relation to a radio communication system including a radio base station unit (eNB) and a plurality of terminals each of which has a repeating function (hereinafter called simply &#x201c;repeaters&#x201d;), there has already been proposed cooperative relay called Coded Cooperation in order to yield a receiving diversity effect at the eNB. Coded cooperation is a relaying scheme by means of which information that respective repeaters desire to transmit are exchanged and by means of which information that a repeater of interest and another repeater desire to transmit is also transmitted to the eNB. The Coded Cooperation is hereinbelow referred to simply as &#x201c;cooperative relay.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows example operation (a successful example) of cooperative relay. Descriptions are provided while attention is paid to operation of Repeater <b>1</b> (hereinafter described as a &#x201c;repeater <b>1</b>&#x201d;) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The repeater <b>1</b> divides data into first transmission data S<b>1</b> including systematic bits and parity data P<b>1</b> including parity bits; transmits the first transmission data S<b>1</b> to Repeater <b>2</b> (hereinafter described as a &#x201c;repeater <b>2</b>&#x201d;); and receives first transmission data S<b>2</b> from the repeater <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The repeater <b>1</b> generates parity data P<b>2</b> from the received first transmission data S<b>2</b>. Subsequently, the repeater <b>1</b> transmits the first transmission data S<b>1</b> of itself to the eNB and subsequently transmits the generated parity data P<b>2</b> to the eNB.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Likewise, operation of the repeaters <b>2</b> is described. The repeater <b>2</b> divides data into the first transmission data S<b>2</b> including systematic bits and parity data P<b>2</b> including parity bits; transmits the first transmission data S<b>2</b> to the repeater <b>1</b>; and receives the first transmission data S<b>1</b> from the repeater <b>1</b>.</p>

Subsequently, the repeater <b>2</b> transmits first transmission data S<b>2</b> of itself to the eNB and subsequently transmits the generated parity data P<b>1</b> to the eNB.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In doing so, the eNB receives data, which are divided into two blocks, from each of the respective repeaters by way of respective different paths (cooperative relay is performed), so that a diversity effective can be yielded. Moreover, in a case where a level of one path remains low for a long period of time for reasons of fading of a long period (slow fading), it becomes possible to avoid occurrence of a situation in which receiving operation becomes impossible.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, as can be seen from (unsuccessful) example operation of cooperative relay shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, there has been a problem of, when one repeater or both repeaters are unsuccessful at exchanging data between the repeaters (occurrence of CRC NG, or the like), data to be transmitted after transmission of first transmission data from a repeater of interest becoming extinct.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">There are available the following two simple countermeasures against a case where exchange of data between repeaters is unsuccessful.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">(1) Transmit parity data of itself (see; for instance, Patent Document 1)</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">(2) Introduce an ACK signal and an NACK signal.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Problem that the Invention is to Solve</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">(1) A Case where Parity Data of Itself are Transmitted</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A repeater which has unsuccessfully exchanged data (received data exhibited CRC NG, or the like) transmits parity data of itself after transmission of its first transmission data.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Operation of cooperative relay is described by means of taking <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> by way of example. First, respective repeaters exchange their first transmission data. When the repeater <b>1</b> is unsuccessful in receipt of first transmission data S<b>2</b> and when the repeater <b>2</b> is successful in receipt of first transmission data S<b>1</b>, the respective repeaters transmit their first transmission data to an eNB. Subsequently, the repeater <b>1</b> transmits its parity data P<b>1</b> to the eNB, and the repeater <b>2</b> transmits the party's parity data P<b>1</b> to the eNB.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In doing so, even when exchange of data between the repeaters is unsuccessful, data to be transmitted are determined. However, if one of the repeaters has been unsuccessful in exchange of data, received data in the eNB become disproportionate. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, disproportionateness; namely, receipt of a larger volume of data from the repeater <b>1</b>, occurs in the eNB.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Four cases are conceivable according to whether or not exchange of data is successful. Respective processing flows are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Case <b>1</b> shows that both the repeater <b>1</b> and the repeater <b>2</b> are successful in receipt of data; Case <b>2</b> shows that the repeater <b>1</b> is successful in receipt of data but the repeater <b>2</b> is unsuccessful in receipt of data; Case <b>3</b> shows that the repeater <b>1</b> is unsuccessful in receipt of data but the repeater <b>2</b> is successful in receipt of data; and Case <b>4</b> shows that both the repeater <b>1</b> and the repeater <b>2</b> are unsuccessful in receipt of data.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">(2) A Case where an ACK Signal/a NACK Signal are Introduced</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">An ACK signal showing successful exchange of data and a NACK signal showing unsuccessful exchange of data are introduced. A repeater which has transmitted a NACK signal transmits its parity data after transmitted its first transmission data. Likewise, a repeater which has received a NACK signal transmits its parity data after transmitted its first transmission data.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Operation of cooperative relay is described by means of taking <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> by way of example. First, respective repeaters exchange their first transmission data. When the repeater <b>1</b> is unsuccessful in receipt of the first transmission data S<b>2</b> and when the repeater <b>2</b> is successful in receipt of the first transmission data S<b>1</b>, the repeater <b>1</b> transmits a NACK signal to the repeater <b>2</b>, and the repeater <b>2</b> transmits an ACK signal to the repeater <b>1</b>. The respective repeaters first transmit their first transmission data to the eNB and subsequently transmit their parity data to the eNB.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In doing so, even when exchange of data between the repeaters is unsuccessful, data to be transmitted is determined. On the contrary, even when one of the repeaters has been unsuccessful at exchanging data, disproportionateness in data received by the eNB is resolved. However, in this case, there arises a problem of both repeaters becoming unable to implement cooperative relay.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As mentioned above, even when consideration is given to a case where exchange of data between repeaters has become unsuccessful, the related art still encounters a problem of disproportionateness occurring in the data received by the eNB when one of the repeaters is unsuccessful at exchange data; namely, a problem of a diversity effect by cooperative relay being not yielded.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present invention has been conceived in light of the circumstance and aims at providing a communication device, a base station, a communication system, and a communication method that make it possible to yield a diversity effect by cooperative relay without involvement of occurrence of disproportionateness in the data received by the eNB even when one of communication devices is unsuccessful at exchanging data.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Means for Solving the Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A technical point of the present invention lies in that resources are shared between repeaters which perform cooperative relay and that a repeater which has unsuccessfully exchanged data, between the repeaters transmits its first data and subsequently opens its own resource to a party repeater (i.e., the unsuccessful repeater does not use its own resource and makes it possible for the partner repeater to use the resource). As a result, the eNB can yield a diversity effect by cooperative relay without involvement of disproportionateness in received data.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Specifically,</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">(1) The eNB provides repeaters which perform cooperative relay with a direction for allocating resources. On this occasion, the resources to be allocated are made sharable between the repeaters.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">(2) The repeaters exchange data with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">(3) The respective repeaters transmit data commensurate with a result of exchange of data to the eNB. The repeater which has unsuccessfully exchanged data opens its own resource to a party repeater at the next timing.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Namely, the present invention provides a communication device that shares resources allocated by a base station with another communication device, the communication device comprising: a transmission block for transmitting data; and a receiving block for receiving data, wherein according to whether or not the communication device has successfully received the data transmitted from the other communication device and whether or not the other communication device has successfully received the data from the communication device, data to be transmitted at next transmission timing by the communication device and which one of the resource allocated to the communication device and the resource allocated to the other communication device is used for transmission are determined.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to the configuration, when a communication device and another communication device perform cooperative relay by exchanging data with each other, transmission data and resources used for transmission are determined according to a result of exchange of data. Even when one of the communication devices has unsuccessfully exchanged data, the base station can yield a diversity effect by cooperative relay without involvement of disproportionateness in received data.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Further, the present invention provides the communication device, wherein there are performed dividing data of the communication device into data S<b>1</b> and data P<b>1</b>, transmitting the data S<b>1</b> to the other communication device and the base station by use of a first resource, and receiving data S<b>2</b> transmitted from the other communication device by use of a second resource, and the communication device further includes: an ACK/NACK signal generation block that is adapted to generate, according to a result of channel decoding of the data S<b>2</b>, an ACK signal when receipt of the data S<b>2</b> is successful and generates a NACK signal when receipt of the data S<b>2</b> is unsuccessful; a parity bit generation block that is adapted to generate data P<b>2</b> from the data S<b>2</b> when a result of channel decoding of the data S<b>2</b> shows successful receipt; and a transmission mode generation block that is adapted, when the ACK/NACK signal generation block has generated the NACK signal and when the ACK signal is received from the other communication device, to transmit the data S<b>1</b> by use of the first resource and performs control operation such that transmission of the first resource is not performed, from then on, before completion of cooperative relay of transmission data of one block.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">By means of the configuration, when the communication device has unsuccessfully received the data S<b>2</b>, the other communication device transmits the data P<b>2</b> to the base station by use of the first resource. Hence, even when one of the communication devices has unsuccessfully exchanged data the base station can yield a diversity effect by cooperative relay without involvement of disproportionateness in received data. The essential requirement for the relationship between the data S<b>1</b> and the data P<b>1</b> or the relationship between the data S<b>2</b> and the data P<b>2</b> is that two blocks of data can be decoded when they become equal to each other, like a relationship between; for instance, systematic bits and parity bits.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The present invention provides the communication device, wherein there are performed dividing data of the communication device into data S<b>1</b> and data P<b>1</b>, transmitting the data S<b>1</b> to the other communication device and the base station by use of a first resource, and receiving data S<b>2</b> transmitted from the other communication device by use of a second resource, and the communication device further includes: an ACK/NACK signal generation block that is adapted to generate, according to a result of channel decoding of the data S<b>2</b>, data P<b>2</b> from the data S<b>2</b> and an ACK signal when receipt of the data S<b>2</b> is successful and generates a NACK signal when receipt of the data S<b>2</b> is unsuccessful; and a transmission mode generation block that is adapted, when the ACK/NACK signal generation block has generated the ACK signal and when the NACK signal is received from the other communication device, to transmit the data S<b>1</b> and the data P<b>2</b> by use of the first resource and performs control operation such that the data P<b>1</b> are transmitted by means of the second resource.</p>

<heading id="h-0018" level="1">Advantages of the Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0103" num="0119">By means of the procedures set forth, even when one of the repeaters has become unsuccessful in receipt of data at the time of exchange of data, the eNB can yield a diversity effect by cooperative relay without involvement of occurrence of disproportionateness in received data.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0120">The above descriptions provide an example in which the repeater which has successfully received transmission data generates the parity bits P<b>1</b> or P<b>2</b> after transmission of the ACK signal in procedure <b>5</b> or <b>6</b> of Cases <b>1</b> through <b>3</b>. However, timing at which the parity bits P<b>1</b> or P<b>2</b> is generated is not limited to the example. All you have to do is to generate the parity bits P<b>1</b> or P<b>2</b> at arbitrary timing after transmission of the ACK signals to the repeaters <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> in procedure <b>5</b> or <b>6</b> and before the parity bits P<b>1</b> or P<b>2</b> is transmitted in procedures <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0121">Further, the data to be divided into two sub-blocks of data are not limited to the systematic bits and the parity bits that are described in connection with the present embodiment. For instance, the essential requirement for a relationship between the blocks of data is that one block of data should become redundant bits for the other block of data or data can equally be decoded when the blocks of data become equal to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0122">The number of sub-blocks into which data are to be divided is not limited to two. Further, the resource may be a time or a frequency. In the case of a time, transmission timings assigned to respective blocks of data come to be shared. In the case of a frequency, transmission frequencies assigned to respective blocks of data come to be shared.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0123">A block diagram of the repeater and that of the base station are now described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram of the repeater. There is now described in detail operation of the repeater <b>1</b> performed before transmission of data pertaining to one block is completed by means of cooperative relay. A timing at which data pertaining to one of two blocks into which data have been divided are first transmitted to the eNB, is hereinbelow called a first frame. A timing at which the remaining block of the data is transmitted to the eNB is hereinafter called a second frame.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0124">(Operation of the Repeater <b>1</b> for Transmitting the First Transmission Data S<b>1</b> Performed at the Time of Exchange of Data)</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0125">A timer <b>27</b> outputs a signal showing whether the present time is a time for exchanging data or a time for normal transmission. A transmission power control block <b>26</b> performs control operation so as to weaken transmission power at the time of exchange of data by means of an output from the timer <b>27</b>.

The repeater <b>1</b> reads the first transmission data from the transmission data memory <b>22</b> and stores the data in a buffer block <b>21</b>.

An ACK/NACK signal generation block <b>18</b> generates an ACK signal when receipt of the transmission signal is successful according to a result of channel decoding (CRC or the like) from the channel decoding block <b>16</b>. When receipt of the transmission signal is unsuccessful, the ACK/NACK signal generation block generates a NACK signal. The thus-generated ACK/NACK signal undergoes channel encoding in a channel encoding block <b>24</b> and modulation processing in a modulation block <b>23</b>, and a result of modulation is stored in &#x201c;memory for storing an ACK/NACK signal of the repeater <b>1</b>&#x201d; of the transmission data memory <b>22</b>.

<heading id="h-0026" level="1">Advantages of the Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0181" num="0197">Even when one of the repeaters has become unsuccessful in receipt of data at the time of exchange of data, the eNB can yield a diversity effect by cooperative relay without involvement of occurrence of disproportionateness in received data and can further reduce the number of ACK and NACK signals.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0198">All you have to do is to perform processing for generating the parity bits P<b>1</b> from the received first transmission data S<b>1</b> or the parity bits P<b>2</b> from the received first transmission data S<b>2</b>, at arbitrary timing after receipt of the first transmission data S<b>1</b> or S<b>2</b> and before transmission of the parity bits P<b>1</b> or P<b>2</b>. Further, a sequence of Procedure <b>3</b> and Procedure <b>4</b>, or the like, can also be interchanged.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0199">Further, the data to be divided into two sub-blocks of data are not limited to the systematic bits and the parity bits that are described in connection with the present embodiment. For instance, the essential requirement for a relationship between the blocks of data is that one block of data should become a redundant bit for the other block of data or data can equally be decoded when the blocks of data become equal to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0200">The number of sub-blocks into which data are to be divided is not limited to two. Further, the resource may be a time or a frequency. In the case of a time, transmission timings assigned to respective blocks of data come to be shared. In the case of a frequency, transmission frequencies assigned to respective blocks of data come to be shared.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0201">The present embodiment provides an example in which, when data are unsuccessfully received, transmission data including parity bits are first transmitted. However, the present invention is not limited to the example. For instance, transmission data including systematic bits can also be transmitted in inverse chronological order (in this case, data to be subsequently sent differ from that described in connection with the embodiment).</p>
