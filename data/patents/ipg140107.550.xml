<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a buckle device provided with a buckle main body which releasably receives a tongue plate connected to webbing.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventionally, there have been proposed various types of buckle devices provided with a detection mechanism to detect the insertion of a tongue plate into a buckle main body.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For instance, a conventional buckle device is provided with a cover which is approximately rectangular tube-shaped, and open-ended at both lengthwise ends. An attachment piece is inserted from one side thereof, and then the cover is mounted on the buckle main body. Then wing portions of a switch is bent outward to widen the space therebetween, and placed outside the attachment piece. While maintaining this state, the switch is inserted inside the cover through a predetermined clearance formed on the other side of the cover. Thereby, such a buckle device is configured to be able to detect the insertion of the tongue plate into the buckle main body (see, for instance, Japanese Laid-open Patent Application Publication No. 2000-4909).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, in the buckle device disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Application Publication No. 2000-4909, the switch is inserted after the buckle main body is housed inside the cover through the clearance between the cover and the attachment piece. Therefore, there is a problem that complicated operations are required in the buckle assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention has been made in view of the above-described problem and an object thereof is to provide a buckle device capable of reliably detecting the engagement and disengagement between a tongue plate and a latch member and at the same time capable of improving the efficiency of assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The buckle device of the present invention which achieves the above-described object comprises: a buckle device having a buckle main body configured to releasably receive a tongue plate connected to webbing, the buckle main body comprising: a frame member approximately U-shaped in side view, configured to house the tongue plate inserted therein; a slide button provided slidably on an outer surface on one side of the frame member; a base member approximately frame-shaped, fixedly provided on the frame member so as to be located above the slide button, the base member having an opening portion formed approximately in a center thereof; a latch member provided in the base member, movably in a direction perpendicular to the frame member, the latch member configured to be engaged with the tongue plate when the tongue plate is inserted, and to be disengaged with the tongue plate by slidingly moving the slide button; an ejector member provided in the frame member, movably in an insertion direction and a removal direction of the tongue plate, the ejector member configured to be moved when pushed by the tongue plate, and to be urged in the removal direction; a pair of long holes formed in parallel along a direction of movement of the ejector member, in the one side of the frame member facing the opening portion; a slider member approximately portal-shaped in front view, mounted on the ejector member through the pair of long holes, and configured to be moved within the opening portion integrally with the ejector member; a permanent magnet attached on one of two ends in a crosswise direction with respect to movement of the slider member; and a magnet position detection unit mounted on the base member, on an outer side of a magnet-side side wall which is located closer to the permanent magnet, the magnet position detection unit configured to detect a position of the permanent magnet in at least one of a state where the tongue plate and the latch member are engaged, and a state where the tongue plate is removed from the frame member.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In such a buckle device, the slider member with the permanent magnet attached thereon is mounted onto the ejector member which is moved inside the frame member when pressed by the tongue plate, through the pair of long holes. Accordingly, through detecting, by the magnet position detecting unit mounted on the outer side of the base member, a position of the permanent magnet attached on the slider member in at least one of a state where the tongue plate and the latch member are engaged and a state where the tongue plate is removed from the frame member, the disengagement between the tongue plate and the latch member can be reliably detected.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, the cover can be attached after mounting the magnet position detecting unit on the base member making up the buckle main body, on the outer side of the magnet-side side wall thereof facing the permanent magnet. Accordingly, the efficiency in assembly of the buckle device can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, in the buckle device according to the present invention, it is preferable that the magnet position detection unit comprises: a case formed in an approximately rectangular parallelepiped shape, approximately long-quadrangular in plan view, long in the direction of movement of the slider member; and first and second locking projections projecting from edge portions closer to the frame member on both lengthwise end faces of the case, respectively, to a predetermined height in the lengthwise direction of the case, wherein the base member comprises: a projection supporting frame approximately frame-shaped, erected outward to a predetermined height, in a position corresponding to the first locking projection on the magnet-side side wall, the projection supporting frame having a through hole formed therein into which the first locking projection is inserted and fitted; and an elastic engagement piece extended obliquely toward the second locking projection from an upper end portion of a wall face portion erected outward to a predetermined height across all width in a width direction of the magnet-side side wall, on a position corresponding to the second locking projection on the magnet-side side wall, the elastic engagement piece elastically deformable in an insertion direction of the magnet position detection unit, and wherein, the magnet position detection unit is mounted on the outer side of the magnet-side side wall through, while fitting the first locking projection into the projection supporting frame, pushing the second locking projection toward the elastic engagement piece so that the second locking projection is elastically engaged with the elastic engagement piece.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In such a buckle device, at the magnet position detection unit, while the first locking projection is fitted into the projection supporting frame provided on the base member, the second locking projection is pushed toward the elastic locking piece also provided on the base member, and thereby, the second locking projection is elastically locked with the elastic locking piece. As a result, the magnet position detection unit can be mounted onto the buckle main body with a single motion. Accordingly, the efficiency in assembly of the buckle device can be further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, in the buckle device according to the present invention, the buckle main body further comprises a slide switch configured to be mounted on a position adjacent to an outer side of a slide-switch-side side wall opposite to the magnet-side side wall, the slide switch configured to make/break contact by moving a slide brush provided to face the slide-switch-side side wall, wherein the base member further comprises: a horizontally long notch portion notched to a predetermined height along a lengthwise direction of the slide-switch-side side wall on an edge portion closer to the frame member of the slide-switch-side side wall, wherein the slider member comprises: an engagement rib approximately L-shaped in side view, extended outward from an edge portion closer to the frame member on other of the two ends in a crosswise direction with respect to the movement of the slider member, configured to be inserted into the horizontally long notch portion, and further extended approximately vertically along an outer wall face of the slide-switch-side side wall, wherein the slide brush comprises: a pair of projecting pieces projecting at a back side facing the slide-switch-side side wall, with a predetermined space therebetween along a slide direction of the slide brush, and wherein, when the slide switch is mounted adjacent to the outer side of the slide-switch-side side wall and the engagement rib is positioned between the pair of projecting pieces, the slide switch is configured to: make/break contact in accordance with the position of the slide brush configured to be slidingly moved along with the movement of the slider member as the engagement rib abuts on the pair of projecting pieces, and detect at least one of a state where the tongue plate and the latch member are engaged and a state where the tongue plate is removed from the frame member.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In such a buckle device, when the slide switch is mounted on a position in proximity to the outer side of the slide-switch-side side wall of the base member, the engagement rib provided for the slider member is positioned between the pair of projecting pieces projecting at the back side of the slide brush with a predetermined space therebetween. The slide switch makes or breaks contact in accordance with the position of the slide brush which is configured to be slidingly moved with the movement of the slider member as the engagement rib abuts on the pair of projecting pieces. Thereby, there can be detected at least one of the states where the tongue plate and the latch member are engaged and where the tongue plate is removed from the frame member.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Thereby, through detecting by the slide switch at least one of the state where the tongue plate and the latch member are engaged and the state where the tongue plate is removed from the frame member, the engagement and disengagement between the tongue plate and the latch member can be more reliably detected. In addition, even if either the magnet position detection unit or the slide switch malfunctions, the engagement and disengagement between the tongue plate and the latch member can be reliably detected. Accordingly, the reliability thereof can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further, a cover can be mounted after mounting the magnet position detection unit and the slide switch onto the base member making up the buckle main body. Accordingly, the efficiency in assembly of the buckle device can be improved.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Hereinafter, one embodiment of the buckle device according to the present invention will be described in detail while referring to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">[Schematic Configuration]</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">First, a schematic configuration of a buckle device <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment will be described based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of the buckle device <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment in a state where upper and lower covers <b>2</b> and <b>4</b> are disassembled. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a plan view of the buckle device <b>1</b> in a state where the upper cover <b>2</b> is removed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross sectional view along line X<b>1</b>-X<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the buckle device <b>1</b> is configured to have the upper cover <b>2</b> made of synthetic resin, a buckle main body <b>3</b>, and the lower cover <b>4</b> made of synthetic resin.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref>, the buckle main body <b>3</b> can be assembled onto the lower cover <b>4</b>, through fitting and pressing protruding portions <b>7</b>, which are protruding from both side-faces of a frame member <b>21</b>, into positioning grooves <b>8</b> of the lower cover <b>4</b> respectively. As a result, the buckle main body <b>3</b> is secured onto the lower cover <b>4</b>, as the both side-faces of the frame member <b>21</b> are locked with locking portions <b>9</b> respectively, each of which is approximately triangular-shaped in cross section, projecting inward in the width direction from each inner side-face of the lower cover <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Then, while a slide button <b>11</b> of the buckle main body <b>3</b> and projecting portions <b>12</b> of the lower cover <b>4</b> are inserted inside an opening <b>13</b> of the upper cover <b>2</b>, the lower cover <b>4</b> is pressed onto the lower side of the upper cover <b>2</b>. Each of the projecting portions <b>12</b> is L-shaped in front view formed at each corner of an end portion closer to the slide button <b>11</b>, on a side of the lower cover <b>4</b>. By the above operation, locking pawls <b>14</b> of the lower cover <b>4</b>, which are approximately triangular-shaped in cross section, are engaged inside the upper cover <b>2</b>, and thus the lower cover <b>4</b> is mounted onto the upper cover <b>2</b>. In addition, a slit hole <b>16</b> through which lead wires <b>15</b> are drawn out is formed in the other end portion in a lengthwise opposite direction with respect to the opening <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Further, a stepped portion <b>18</b> is formed in the opening <b>13</b> under the slide button <b>11</b>, to receive a tongue plate <b>17</b> therein. The stepped portion <b>18</b> is formed to be narrower as going deeper in a depth direction so that an insertion tip of the tongue plate <b>17</b> can be guided into approximately the width center with respect to the frame member <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Next, a schematic configuration of the buckle main body <b>3</b> will be described based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 12</figref>. First, members making up the buckle main body <b>3</b> are described based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an exploded perspective view of the buckle main body <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the buckle main body <b>3</b> is configured to have the frame member <b>21</b> made of metal such as steel, an ejector <b>22</b> made of synthetic resin, an ejector spring <b>23</b>, the slide button <b>11</b> made of synthetic resin, a slider member <b>24</b> made of synthetic resin, a permanent magnet <b>25</b>, a base member <b>26</b> made of synthetic resin, a stopper member <b>27</b> made of metal such as aluminum, a lever member <b>28</b> made of metal such as aluminum, a torsion spring <b>29</b>, a latch <b>30</b> made of metal such as steel, a latch spring <b>31</b>, a button spring <b>32</b>, a pair of rivets <b>33</b> for securing the base member <b>26</b> on the frame member <b>21</b> to be later described, a Hall IC switch <b>34</b> and a mechanical switch <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">[Frame Member]</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Next, the frame member <b>21</b> will be described based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 5</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an explanatory view depicting mounting of the ejector <b>22</b> onto the frame member <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 5</figref>, the frame member <b>21</b> is formed by bending a plate material such as a steel plate at the lengthwise center thereof into an approximately U-shape. At each widthwise end portion of the frame member <b>21</b>, a pair of flanged holes <b>38</b> is formed in a manner to protrude inside. A rivet <b>41</b> is inserted through and calked with each pair of flanged holes <b>38</b>. Thereby, between an upper plate <b>42</b> facing the upper cover <b>2</b> and a lower plate <b>43</b> facing the lower cover <b>4</b> is formed an insertion portion <b>45</b> which is twice as high as the height of a flanged hole <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The frame member <b>21</b> bent into the U-shape has an insertion hole <b>46</b>, which is slit-like, long along the widthwise direction with respect to the frame member <b>21</b>, and formed at the curve-bottom thereof, that is, at an end portion of the frame member <b>21</b> on a side closer to the opening <b>13</b>. The frame member <b>21</b> also has an opening <b>47</b> in an approximately quadrangular shape formed at the top ends of the curve thereof, that is, at an end portion of the frame member <b>21</b> on a side lengthwise opposite to the insertion hole <b>46</b>, in a manner passing through and linking the upper plate <b>42</b> and the lower plate <b>43</b>. One end of webbing or a wire is passed through and attached to the opening <b>47</b>. The other end of the webbing or the wire is secured to a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">[Ejector and Ejector Spring]</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Inside the frame member <b>21</b>, the ejector spring <b>23</b> is inserted from the lengthwise center position of the insertion hole <b>46</b>. The ejector spring <b>23</b> is inserted elastically between bulging portions <b>48</b>, which locate parallel with each other and are formed in the widthwise centers in the upper plate <b>42</b> and the lower plate <b>43</b>, respectively, to bulge, along a lengthwise direction, outward in an arc shape in cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The ejector <b>22</b> is also inserted from the insertion hole <b>46</b> along the lengthwise direction, inside the frame member <b>21</b> in a slidable manner. The ejector <b>22</b> has a main body portion <b>50</b> and a rod <b>51</b>. The rod <b>51</b> is formed in a standing manner at the center in the width direction of the main body portion <b>50</b>, and configured to be inserted into one end of the ejector spring <b>23</b> and be urged toward the insertion hole <b>46</b>. The ejector <b>22</b> also has a pair of elastic locking pieces <b>52</b> elastically-deformable inward, at both widthwise ends of the main body portion <b>50</b>. The pair of elastic locking pieces <b>52</b> is extended in parallel with the rod <b>51</b>, in other words, extended toward the slit hole <b>16</b> of the upper cover <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Each of the elastic locking pieces <b>52</b> has a length sufficient to reach the pair of flanged holes <b>38</b> when the main body portion <b>50</b> is inserted thoroughly from the insertion hole <b>46</b> into the insertion portion <b>45</b>. Each elastic locking piece <b>52</b> has a locking projection <b>53</b> in proximity to the tip thereof. The locking projection <b>53</b> is shaped right-triangular in plan view and projecting widthwise outward. Accordingly, through inserting the ejector <b>22</b> from the insertion hole <b>46</b> against the resilience of the ejector spring <b>23</b>, each locking projection <b>53</b> is caught by each pair of flanged holes <b>38</b>. Thereby, the ejector <b>22</b> and the ejector spring <b>23</b> are mounted inside the frame member <b>21</b>, making it possible to control the slide length of the ejector <b>22</b> within a certain range (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">[Slide Button]</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Next, the slide button <b>11</b> will be described based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 4</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an explanatory view depicting mounting of the slide button <b>11</b> onto the frame member <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the slide button <b>11</b> disposed on the upper plate <b>42</b> of the frame member <b>21</b> is provided with an operation portion <b>56</b>, which is in a horizontally-long quadrangular plate shape. A pressing surface of the operation portion <b>56</b> is facing the opening <b>13</b> and configured to be pressed so as to make the slide button <b>11</b> slidingly move toward the slit hole <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A pair of side plates <b>57</b> is extended in parallel with each other from both lengthwise ends of the back opposite to the pressing surface of the operation portion <b>56</b> (i.e., both ends in upper and lower directions in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The side plates <b>57</b> are each formed approximately quadrangular plate-shaped, whose thickness direction is defined along the widthwise direction with respect to the frame member <b>21</b>, and installed to hold the upper plate <b>42</b> therebetween, widthwise with respect to the frame member <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The side plates <b>57</b> have pawl pieces <b>58</b> formed protruding inward at corners facing the upper plate <b>42</b> respectively, at end portions in the direction of the extension of the side plates <b>57</b>. The pawl pieces <b>58</b> are provided in a manner engageable from outside the frame member <b>21</b> between the upper plate <b>42</b> and the lower plate <b>43</b> of the frame member <b>21</b>. In an engaged state, the pawl pieces <b>58</b> prevent the removal of the slide button <b>11</b> from the frame member <b>21</b>, and at the same time allow the slide button <b>11</b> to slide lengthwise with respect to the frame member <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Inside the side plates <b>57</b> is formed a latch supporting frame <b>61</b>, which is rectangular frame shaped in plan view, long in a direction of the slide of the slide button <b>11</b>. The latch supporting frame <b>61</b> has side walls <b>62</b> that are widthwise opposite to each other, with respect to the frame member <b>21</b>. The side walls <b>62</b> are extended in parallel with each other from the back portion on the flip side of the pressing surface of the operation portion <b>56</b>. The side walls <b>62</b> are each formed into a plate, whose thickness direction is defined along the width direction with respect to the frame member <b>21</b>, and are disposed with spacing at positions corresponding to a pair of long holes <b>63</b>, respectively. The pair of long holes <b>63</b> is formed in the upper plate <b>42</b> of the frame member <b>21</b>, in lengthwise parallel with each other, with the bulging portions <b>48</b> disposed therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">On the inner surface of each side wall <b>62</b> is formed a stopper <b>65</b>, in an end portion in a direction of extension of each side wall <b>62</b>. Further, each side wall <b>62</b> has, on the inner surface thereof, a button slope <b>66</b> formed at a position closer to the operation portion <b>56</b> than the stopper <b>65</b>. The button slope <b>66</b> is an inclined plane, at an angle and facing opposite to the operation portion <b>56</b>, i.e., facing opposite to the frame member <b>21</b> with respect to the opening <b>47</b>. The plane facing opposite to the frame member <b>21</b> is formed gradually away from the frame member <b>21</b> and closer to the operation portion <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, on the inner surface of each side wall <b>62</b> is also provided an abutment portion <b>67</b>, on a base end portion closer to the operation portion <b>56</b> at a corner closer to the frame member <b>21</b>. Each abutment portion <b>67</b> protrudes at a predetermined height from the back portion of the operation portion <b>56</b> toward the button slope <b>66</b>, and is square-shaped in cross section. As will be described later, each abutment portion <b>67</b> is configured to abut on the lever member <b>28</b> when the lever member <b>28</b>, which is pivotally supported in a rotatable manner at the base member <b>26</b>, is turned toward the frame member <b>21</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>), and also configured to move below the lever member <b>28</b> when the lever member <b>28</b> is turned away from the frame member <b>21</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the center portion between the side walls <b>62</b> is formed an elongated piece <b>68</b>, which is extended by a predetermined length from an end portion closer to the frame member <b>21</b> of the operation portion <b>56</b>. The elongated piece <b>68</b> is configured to be inserted inside the bulging portion <b>48</b> of the upper plate <b>42</b> from the insertion hole <b>46</b> of the frame member <b>21</b> so as to abut on an end portion closer to the upper plate <b>42</b> of the ejector <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 6</figref>, a side wall opposite to the operation portion <b>56</b> of the latch supporting frame <b>61</b> is provided with an extending portion <b>71</b>, extended, from an end portion closer to the frame member <b>21</b> of the side wall, with a width approximately equal to the width of an area between the pair of long holes <b>63</b> formed in the upper plate <b>42</b>. In addition, the extending portion <b>71</b> has a pair of leg portions <b>72</b>, formed on both widthwise ends at an end portion in a direction of extension of the extending portion <b>71</b>, and protruding toward the frame member <b>21</b>. The pair of leg portions <b>72</b> is formed to interpose, therebetween, the area which is located between the pair of long holes <b>63</b> formed in the upper plate <b>42</b>, and to pass through the pair of long holes <b>63</b>, respectively, so that the pair of leg portions <b>72</b> is positioned between the upper plate <b>42</b> and the lower plate <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Then, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the pair of leg portions <b>72</b> of the slide button <b>11</b> is inserted into the pair of long holes <b>63</b> of the frame member <b>21</b> on which the ejector spring <b>23</b> and the ejector <b>22</b> are mounted, respectively. The pawl pieces <b>58</b> formed on the side plates <b>57</b> of the slide button <b>11</b> are engaged, from the outside of the frame member <b>21</b>, between the upper plate <b>42</b> and the lower plate <b>43</b> of the frame member <b>21</b>. Thereby, the slide button <b>11</b> is mounted irremovably from the frame member <b>21</b>, and also slidable on the upper plate <b>42</b> in the lengthwise direction with respect to the frame member <b>21</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). The elongated piece <b>68</b> of the slide button <b>11</b> abuts on the end portion closer to the upper plate <b>42</b> of the ejector <b>22</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">[Slider Member]</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Next, a slider member <b>24</b> will be described based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 4</figref>, <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is an explanatory view depicting mounting of the slider member <b>24</b> onto the frame member <b>21</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is an explanatory view depicting locking of the slider member <b>24</b> with the ejector <b>22</b> mounted inside the frame member <b>21</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the slider member <b>24</b> is formed in an approximately portal shape in front view, to cross over the extending portion <b>71</b> of the slide button <b>11</b>. The thickness of the slider member <b>24</b> with respect to the lengthwise direction of the frame member <b>21</b> is smaller than the length of the extending portion <b>71</b> in the above lengthwise direction. A concave portion <b>75</b> of a predetermined depth is formed on the upper surface of the slider member <b>24</b>, in one end portion with respect to the widthwise direction of the frame member <b>21</b> (i.e., the end portion on lower side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, or the end portion facing the Hall IC switch <b>34</b>).

The pair of stopper rotating shafts <b>93</b> is projecting on both sides widthwise outward with respect to the frame member <b>21</b>, from an upper end portion of an inertial mass body <b>92</b>, which is approximately hexagonal shaped in cross section, of the stopper member <b>27</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 19</figref>). In peripheries on both sides widthwise outward with respect to the frame member <b>21</b> of the pair of shaft supporting grooves <b>95</b> is formed a pair of slide guide portions <b>96</b>, respectively, each of which is circular-arc shaped in cross section, projecting widthwise outward from each periphery (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 19</figref>).</p>

<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Thereby, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 10</figref>, the lever member <b>28</b> is kept in a state approximately parallel with the upper plate <b>42</b> of the frame member <b>21</b>, and also, the upper surface of the lever member <b>28</b> is kept in a state having contact with an end portion projecting in an approximately V-shape in cross section, on a side of the inertial mass body <b>92</b> of the stopper member <b>27</b> closer to the operation portion <b>56</b> of the slide button <b>11</b>. The gravity center of the inertial mass body <b>92</b> is set displaced from the axial center of the stopper rotating shafts <b>93</b> toward the frame member <b>21</b>, so that, as will be described later, when the inertial mass body <b>92</b> receives an inertial force in a direction opposite to the opening <b>13</b> in the lengthwise direction with respect to the frame member <b>21</b>, the inertial mass body <b>92</b> is rotated, while sliding on the lever member <b>28</b>, toward the frame member <b>21</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>).</p>

<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, after the base member <b>26</b> is fixed to the frame member <b>21</b> by each rivet <b>33</b>, the Hall IC switch <b>34</b> is fixed on the Hall IC switch supporting extension <b>106</b> of the base member <b>26</b> with the button spring <b>32</b> mounted thereon. The mechanical switch <b>35</b> is also fixed on the mechanical switch supporting extension <b>107</b> of the base member <b>26</b>. The buckle main body <b>3</b> is thus assembled. Alternatively, only one of the Hall IC switch <b>34</b> and the mechanical switch <b>35</b> may be mounted as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Here, the mounting of the Hall IC switch <b>34</b> onto the base member <b>26</b> will be described based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 through 17</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 through 16</figref>, the Hall IC switch <b>34</b> has a Hall element <b>132</b> which detects magnetism is provided inside a case <b>131</b> made of synthetic resin, formed into an approximately rectangle shape in plan view, long in the lengthwise direction of the frame member <b>21</b>, and approximately rectangular-parallelepiped shape. The Hall IC switch <b>34</b> is a switch that outputs ON/OFF signals in accordance with the proximity of the permanent magnet <b>25</b> to the Hall element <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Inside the Hall IC switch <b>34</b>, the Hall element <b>132</b> is arranged in the proximity of an end portion where the lead wires <b>15</b> inside the case <b>131</b> are extracted, namely, in the proximity of an end portion opposite to the opening <b>13</b> in the lengthwise direction of the frame member <b>21</b>. Accordingly, the permanent magnet <b>25</b> is configured to face the Hall element <b>132</b> of the Hall IC switch <b>34</b> when the slider member <b>24</b> is moved to the side opposite to the opening <b>13</b> in the lengthwise direction of the frame member <b>21</b></p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In addition, the Hall IC switch <b>34</b> has a locking projection <b>133</b>, which is approximately L-shaped in front view, formed on one lengthwise end face closer to the slide button <b>11</b>. One portion of the locking projection <b>133</b> is extended outward from whole length of a side edge portion closer to the one outer plate <b>105</b> of the base member <b>26</b>, and the other portion thereof is extended outward from part of a lower edge portion of the one lengthwise end face, the part ranging from the approximately center point thereof to an end portion closer to the one outer plate <b>105</b>. On the same one lengthwise end face, a guiding piece <b>134</b> is extended outward from an upper edge portion thereof to the vertically center point, arranged in parallel with the one portion of the locking projection <b>133</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Further, the Hall IC switch <b>34</b> has an engagement projection <b>135</b> formed thereon, extended with a predetermined width outward from the approximately widthwise center position of the lower edge, on the other lengthwise end face opposite to the one lengthwise end face closer to the slide button <b>11</b>. The Hall IC switch <b>34</b> yet further has a positioning projection <b>136</b> formed thereon, approximately quadrangular in cross section and projecting downward, on the bottom face thereof, at the approximately central position in the side edge closer to the one outer plate <b>105</b>. The positioning projection <b>136</b> is formed so as to have a height approximately equal to the thickness of the Hall IC switch supporting extension <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Meanwhile, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the base member <b>26</b> has an elastic locking piece <b>141</b>, provided on a wall portion which is formed by being extended at right angles outward from an edge closer to the slide button <b>11</b> of the one outer plate <b>105</b> where the Hall IC switch supporting extension <b>106</b> is formed. The elastic locking piece <b>141</b> is approximately plate-shaped and elastically-deformable toward the slide button <b>11</b>, being obliquely extended from the upper edge of a portion corresponding to the locking projection <b>133</b> of the Hall IC switch <b>34</b>, toward the Hall IC switch supporting extension <b>106</b>. Further, the clearance between the lower end of the elastic locking piece <b>141</b> and the upper face of the Hall IC switch supporting extension <b>106</b> is designed to be approximately equivalent to the thickness of the locking projection <b>133</b> of the Hall IC switch <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">There is formed an engagement frame <b>142</b>, which is approximately quadrangular-frame shaped in front view, on a lengthwise edge portion closer to the locking piece <b>113</b> of the Hall IC switch supporting extension <b>106</b>. Into the engagement frame <b>142</b>, the engagement projection <b>135</b> of the Hall IC switch <b>34</b> is fitted. Further, a through hole <b>143</b>, which is rectangular-shaped in plan view, is formed on the approximately center portion in the lengthwise direction of an edge portion closer to the one outer plate <b>105</b> of the Hall IC switch supporting extension <b>106</b>. Into the through hole <b>143</b>, the positioning projection <b>136</b> provided in a standing manner on the bottom face of the Hall IC switch <b>34</b> is fitted.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, while the engagement projection <b>135</b> is fitted into the engagement frame <b>142</b> of the base member <b>26</b>, the Hall IC switch <b>34</b> is pressed onto the Hall IC switch supporting extension <b>106</b>, and thereby the lower end portion of the locking projection <b>133</b> of the Hall IC switch <b>34</b> is engaged with the lower end portion of the elastic locking piece <b>141</b> of the base member <b>26</b>. Further, the positioning projection <b>136</b> provided in a standing manner on the bottom face of the Hall IC switch <b>34</b> is fitted into the through hole <b>143</b> formed in the approximately lengthwise center portion of the edge portion closer to the outer plate <b>105</b> of the Hall IC switch supporting extension <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Further, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 13</figref>, the lead wires <b>15</b> of the Hall IC switch <b>34</b> are bent at right angles along the outer periphery of the base member <b>26</b> and then drawn out in the lengthwise direction of the frame member <b>21</b> through a lead stopping piece <b>145</b>, which is L-shaped in side view and provided at a side wall positioned opposite to the latch housing portion <b>82</b> of the base member <b>26</b>. Thereby, the Hall IC switch <b>34</b> is irremovably mounted on the outside of the one outer plate <b>105</b> of the base member <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Next, the mounting of the mechanical switch <b>35</b> onto the base member <b>26</b> will be described based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>18</b> and <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>, the mechanical switch <b>35</b> includes a printed circuit board <b>151</b> which is formed approximately in a rectangular shape, in a manner facing almost all the surface of the other outer plate <b>105</b> of the base member <b>26</b>; two printed wirings <b>152</b> and <b>153</b> each of which is line-shaped, formed of such material as gold-plated copper foil, and arranged along the lengthwise direction in parallel with each other on the printed circuit board <b>151</b> on a surface thereof facing the outer plate <b>105</b>; and a slide brush <b>156</b> which is made of synthetic resin, formed approximately in a quadrangle in front view, provided slidably lengthwise, and fitted onto both widthwise edges of the printed circuit board <b>151</b> in a state of pressing onto the printed circuit board <b>151</b> a brush <b>155</b> formed of such material as phosphor bronze and configured to make the printed wirings <b>152</b> and <b>153</b> electrically connected therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The printed wiring <b>152</b>, which is one of the above printed wirings <b>152</b> and <b>153</b>, is cut off by a predetermined length approximately in a middle, so as to form printed wirings <b>152</b>A and <b>152</b>B arranged in a straight line and electrically disconnected. The lead wires <b>15</b> are soldered on the printed wirings <b>152</b>A and <b>153</b>, respectively. Accordingly, when the slide brush <b>156</b> comes onto the printed wiring <b>152</b>A, the printed wirings <b>152</b>A and <b>153</b> are electrically connected by the brush <b>155</b>, and the circuit is connected through the lead wires <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Meanwhile, when the slide brush <b>156</b> comes onto the printed wiring <b>15213</b>, the printed wirings <b>152</b>A and <b>153</b> are electrically disconnected and the circuit is broken through the lead wires <b>15</b>. That is, the mechanical switch <b>35</b> operates as a switch which outputs an ON/OFF signal in accordance with a position onto which the slide brush <b>156</b> is moved.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The slide brush <b>156</b> has a pair of projecting pieces <b>157</b> projecting outward to a predetermined height, provided on both edges thereof in the slide direction on a surface facing the outer plate <b>105</b>, respectively. Then, as later described, the engagement rib <b>77</b> of the slider member <b>24</b> comes between the pair of projecting pieces <b>157</b> when the mechanical switch <b>35</b> is mounted on the base member <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Further, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, engagement projections <b>161</b> and <b>162</b> projecting outward are formed on both lengthwise end faces of the printed circuit board <b>151</b>, respectively, at end portions closer to the mechanical switch supporting extension <b>107</b>. Meanwhile, a pair of insertion grooves <b>163</b> is formed on both lengthwise end portions of the mechanical switch supporting extension <b>107</b> of the base member <b>26</b>. Both edge portions of the printed circuit board <b>151</b> are inserted into the pair of insertion grooves <b>163</b> from above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Of the both lengthwise end portions of the mechanical switch supporting extension <b>107</b>, on a lengthwise end portion closer to the locking piece <b>113</b>, one of the insertion grooves <b>163</b> is formed, and on an outer side thereof, an engagement frame <b>164</b> is formed, in an approximately quadrangular frame shape in front view. The engagement frame <b>164</b> is configured to receive the engagement projection <b>161</b> of the printed circuit board <b>151</b> inserted therein. An elastic engagement piece <b>165</b> is also provided on an outer side of the other of the insertion grooves <b>163</b> which is formed at the other lengthwise end portion closer to the slide button <b>11</b> of the mechanical switch supporting extension <b>107</b>. The elastic engagement piece <b>165</b> is elastically deformable outward, extended toward the mechanical switch supporting extension <b>107</b>, so as to secure a clearance as high as the engagement projection <b>162</b> of the printed circuit board <b>151</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Accordingly, the mechanical switch <b>35</b> can place the printed wirings <b>152</b> and <b>153</b> in a position facing the outer plate <b>105</b>, and can make the slide brush <b>156</b> in a state moved closer to the slide button <b>11</b>, that is, a state where the lead wires <b>15</b> are electrically connected. The engagement projection <b>161</b> of the mechanical switch <b>35</b> is fitted into the engagement frame <b>164</b> of the base member <b>26</b>, while the both end portions are inserted into the insertion grooves <b>163</b> and pressed onto the mechanical switch supporting projection <b>107</b>, and thereby the engagement projection <b>162</b> is engaged with the elastic engagement piece <b>165</b>. The engagement rib <b>77</b> of the slider member <b>24</b> is then positioned between the projecting pieces <b>157</b> of the slide brush <b>156</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Further, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 19</figref>, the lead wires <b>15</b> of the mechanical switch <b>35</b> are bent approximately along the outer periphery of the base member <b>26</b> and then drawn out in the lengthwise direction of the frame member <b>21</b> through a lead stopping piece <b>167</b>, which is L-shaped in side view and provided at the upper end of the other outer plate <b>105</b> and a lead stopping piece <b>168</b>, which is L-shaped in side view and provided at the side wall positioned opposite to the latch housing portion <b>82</b> of the base member <b>26</b>. Thereby, the mechanical switch <b>35</b> is irremovably mounted on the outside of the other outer plate <b>105</b> of the base member <b>26</b>. Also, the slide brush <b>156</b> slidingly moves integrally with the slider member <b>24</b> in the lengthwise direction of the frame member <b>21</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 20</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">[Tongue Plate]</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Hereinafter, a schematic configuration of the tongue plate <b>17</b> will be described based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>20</b> and <b>21</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a plan view of a buckle device <b>1</b> in a state where a tongue plate <b>17</b> is inserted and the upper cover <b>2</b> is removed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a cross sectional view along line X<b>3</b>-X<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 20</figref>, the tongue plate <b>17</b> is provided with a tongue main body <b>171</b> formed of metal such as stainless steel into a plate-like shape and coated with a synthetic resin material on the periphery. The tongue main body <b>171</b> has a slit hole <b>172</b> formed therein, through which a long strip of webbing <b>173</b> is passed.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">One end of the webbing <b>173</b> is secured to a vehicle body on the opposite side to the buckle device <b>1</b> across a seat, and the other end thereof is wound around a take-up drum, which is urged in a direction of taking-up of a seatbelt retractor (not shown). The seatbelt retractor has employed a pretensioner (not shown) which abruptly takes up a predetermined length of the webbing <b>173</b> in a tightening direction in a vehicular emergency situation such as a collision, through rotating the take-up drum in high speed, so as to firmly restrain an occupant on the seat.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Meanwhile, the tip of the tongue plate <b>17</b> operates as an insertion plate portion <b>175</b>, and is configured to be inserted from the opening <b>13</b> to the inside of the buckle main body <b>3</b>, that is, to the insertion portion <b>45</b> formed between the upper plate <b>42</b> and the lower plate <b>43</b>. An engagement hole <b>176</b>, which is approximately rectangular-shaped, is formed in the insertion plate portion <b>175</b>. When the insertion plate portion <b>175</b> is inserted in the insertion portion <b>45</b> by a predetermined depth, the engagement hole <b>176</b> overlaps the through holes <b>127</b> and <b>128</b> provided at corresponding positions in the upper plate <b>42</b> and the lower plate <b>43</b>, and the engagement piece <b>126</b> of the latch <b>30</b> passes through the through holes <b>127</b> and <b>128</b>, so that the engagement piece <b>126</b> penetrates the engagement hole <b>176</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">[Operation and Effects in Normal Times]</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Next, the operation and effects in normal times with respect to the buckle device <b>1</b> as above configured will be described based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>20</b> and <b>21</b>. In a state where the insertion plate portion <b>175</b> of the tongue plate <b>17</b> is not inserted in the insertion portion <b>45</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the stoppers <b>65</b> of the slide button <b>11</b> abut on the abutment pieces <b>125</b> of the latch <b>30</b> respectively from below, so that the latch <b>30</b> will not be moved toward the frame member <b>21</b> by the urging force of the latch spring <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">As the insertion plate portion <b>175</b> of the tongue plate <b>17</b> is inserted from the opening <b>13</b> to the insertion portion <b>45</b>, the insertion plate portion <b>175</b> first engages with a concave portion formed at the front end of the ejector <b>22</b>, and the insertion plate portion <b>175</b> presses the ejector <b>22</b>. Following this, as the insertion plate portion <b>175</b> is further inserted against the urging force of the ejector spring <b>23</b> until the ejector <b>22</b> is slidingly moved to a predetermined position, the main body portion <b>50</b> of the ejector <b>22</b> abuts on the leg portions <b>72</b> of the slide button <b>11</b>, presses and slidingly moves the leg portions <b>72</b> in a direction lengthwise opposite to the opening <b>13</b> with respect to the frame member <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">As the leg portions <b>72</b> are slidingly moved in the direction lengthwise opposite to the opening <b>13</b> with respect to the frame member <b>21</b>, the stoppers <b>65</b> of the slide button <b>11</b> are removed from the abutment pieces <b>125</b> of the latch <b>30</b>, so that the latch <b>30</b> is moved by the urging force of the latch spring <b>31</b> in the direction of engagement, namely, in the direction toward the frame member <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Accordingly, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref>, the engagement piece <b>126</b> of the latch <b>30</b> penetrates the through hole <b>127</b> of the upper plate <b>42</b> and the through hole <b>128</b> of the lower plate <b>43</b>, and also penetrates the engagement hole <b>176</b> of the tongue plate <b>17</b>. Then the engagement piece <b>126</b> of the latch <b>30</b> engages with the engagement hole <b>176</b> of the tongue plate <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Following this, when the pressure on the tongue plate <b>17</b> is released, the slide button <b>11</b> is slidingly moved toward the opening <b>13</b> by the urging force of the button spring <b>32</b>, and a locked state as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref> is reached. The stoppers <b>65</b> of the slide button <b>11</b> abut on the abutment pieces <b>125</b> of the latch <b>30</b> respectively from above, preventing the latch <b>30</b> from moving in a disengagement direction, namely, in a direction to come off from the frame member <b>21</b>. In this locked state, the removal of the tongue plate <b>17</b> from the buckle device <b>1</b> is restricted by the engagement piece <b>126</b> of the latch <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Further, in the state where the insertion plate portion <b>175</b> of the tongue plate <b>17</b> is not inserted inside the insertion portion <b>45</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the ejector <b>22</b> is slidingly moved by the ejector spring <b>23</b> toward the opening <b>13</b>, and the slider member <b>24</b> engaged at the tips of the elastic locking pieces <b>52</b> of the ejector <b>22</b> abuts on the latch supporting frame <b>61</b> of the slide button <b>11</b>. Consequently, the permanent magnet <b>25</b> secured in the slider member <b>24</b> is separated from the Hall element <b>132</b> of the Hall IC switch <b>34</b>, so that the Hall IC switch <b>34</b> outputs an OFF signal.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Further, the slide brush <b>156</b> of the mechanical switch <b>35</b> is slidingly moved toward the opening <b>13</b> by the engagement rib <b>77</b> of the slider member <b>24</b> which is positioned between the pair of projecting pieces <b>157</b>, and the printed wirings <b>152</b>A and <b>153</b> are electrically connected. Consequently, in the mechanical switch <b>35</b>, the circuit is connected through the lead wires <b>15</b>, and an ON signal is output.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Meanwhile, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, in the locked state where the tongue plate <b>17</b> is inserted in the insertion portion <b>45</b> and the engagement piece <b>126</b> of the latch <b>30</b> engages with the engagement hole <b>176</b>, the ejector <b>22</b> has been slidingly moved by the insertion plate portion <b>175</b> of the tongue plate <b>17</b>, in the direction lengthwise opposite to the opening <b>13</b> with respect to the frame member <b>21</b>. Further, the slider member <b>24</b> engaged at the tips of the elastic locking pieces <b>52</b> of the ejector <b>22</b> is positioned in the proximity of the side wall portion opposite to the latch housing portion <b>82</b> of the base member <b>26</b>. Consequently, the permanent magnet <b>25</b> secured in the slider member <b>24</b> is positioned in the proximity of the Hall element <b>132</b> of the Hall IC switch <b>34</b>, so that the Hall IC switch <b>34</b> outputs an ON signal.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Further, the slide brush <b>156</b> of the mechanical switch <b>35</b> is slidingly moved toward the engagement projection <b>161</b>, namely, in the direction opposite to the opening <b>13</b> by the engagement rib <b>77</b> of the slider member <b>24</b> which is positioned between the pair of projecting pieces <b>157</b>, and the printed wirings <b>152</b>A and <b>153</b> are electrically disconnected. Consequently, in the mechanical switch <b>35</b>, the circuit is disconnected through the lead wires <b>15</b>, and an OFF signal is output.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Further, as the buckle device <b>1</b> will not move abruptly toward the take-up direction of the webbing <b>173</b>, no inertial force acts on the inertial mass body <b>92</b> of the stopper member <b>27</b>.

<p id="p-0140" num="0139">[Release of Tongue Plate from Buckle Main Body]</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Next, the release of the tongue plate <b>17</b> from the buckle main body <b>1</b> will be discussed based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is a cross sectional view depicting a state where the tongue plate <b>17</b> is released by pressing the slide button <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, for releasing the tongue plate <b>17</b> from the buckle main body <b>3</b>, the operation portion <b>56</b> of the slide button <b>11</b> is slidingly moved by being pressed with a finger against the urging force of the button spring <b>32</b>, so that the button slopes <b>66</b> of the slide button <b>11</b> are slidingly moved while having contact with the lower sides of the abutment pieces <b>125</b> of the latch <b>30</b>, respectively. Thereby the engagement piece <b>126</b> of the latch <b>30</b> is moved, against the urging force of the latch spring <b>31</b>, in a disengagement direction, that is, in the direction away from the frame member <b>21</b>. In the meantime the abutment portions <b>67</b> which are formed inside the side walls <b>62</b> of the slide button <b>11</b> pass below the projecting pieces <b>88</b> of the lever member <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Accordingly, the engagement piece <b>126</b> of the latch <b>30</b> is removed from the through holes <b>127</b> and <b>128</b> in the upper plate <b>42</b> and the lower plate <b>43</b>, and also removed from the engagement hole <b>176</b> in the tongue plate <b>17</b>, so that a disengagement state is reached. Here, the front end of the ejector <b>22</b> abuts on the tip of the insertion plate portion <b>175</b> of the tongue plate <b>17</b>, so that the tongue plate <b>17</b> is urged toward the opening <b>13</b> and pushed out. The ejector <b>22</b> is urged by the urging force of the ejector spring <b>23</b> toward the opening <b>13</b>, and moved toward the insertion hole <b>46</b>, overlaps and blocks the through holes <b>127</b> and <b>128</b> and abuts on the lower end of the engagement piece <b>126</b> of the latch <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">When the finger is released from the slide button <b>11</b>, the slide button <b>11</b> is urged by the urging force of the button spring <b>32</b> toward the opening <b>13</b>, and returns to the normal position of the slide button <b>11</b>. Accordingly, the stoppers <b>65</b> of the slide button <b>11</b> abut on the abutment pieces <b>125</b> of the latch <b>30</b> from below respectively, so that the urging force of the latch spring <b>31</b> works to prevent the latch <b>30</b> from moving toward the frame member <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">As the buckle device <b>1</b> will not move abruptly toward the take-up direction of the webbing <b>173</b>, no inertial force acts on the inertial mass body <b>92</b> of the stopper member <b>27</b>. Consequently, the lever member <b>28</b> is maintained in a state rotated toward the stopper member <b>27</b> by the urging force of the torsion spring <b>29</b> and approximately parallel with the frame member <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">[Operation and Effects at Activation of Pretensioner for Seatbelt Retractor]</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Next, the operation and effects when the pretensioner for the seatbelt retractor is activated will be discussed based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is a cross sectional view depicting a state where the pretensioner for the seatbelt retractor is activated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is a cross sectional view depicting a state where the slide button <b>11</b> is moved by the activation of the pretensioner for the seatbelt retractor.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, when the pretensioner for the seatbelt retractor is activated, the webbing <b>173</b> passed through the tongue plate <b>17</b> is abruptly taken up in the tightening direction by a predetermined length. Then, as the engagement piece <b>126</b> of the latch <b>30</b> is engaged with the engagement hole <b>176</b> of the tongue plate <b>17</b>, the buckle main body <b>3</b> experiences abrupt acceleration toward the webbing <b>173</b> (that is, in the direction of arrow <b>181</b>), and an inertial force in the direction opposite to the opening <b>13</b> acts on the inertial mass body <b>92</b> of the stopper member <b>27</b>, in a lengthwise direction of the frame member <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">In addition, the center of gravity of the inertial mass body <b>92</b> is eccentric toward the frame member <b>21</b>, with respect to the axis core of the stopper rotating shaft <b>93</b> of the stopper member <b>27</b>. Accordingly, the inertial mass body <b>92</b> of the stopper member <b>27</b> is rotated, against the urging force of the torsion spring <b>29</b> urged through the lever member <b>28</b>, toward the frame member <b>21</b> (that is, in the direction of arrow <b>182</b>). Thereby, the end portion closer to the opening <b>13</b> of the inertial mass body <b>92</b> of the stopper member <b>27</b> is slidingly moved on the upper face of the lever member <b>28</b> in the direction lengthwise opposite to the opening <b>13</b> with respect to the frame member <b>21</b>, and rotates the lever member <b>28</b> toward the frame member <b>21</b> (that is, in the direction of arrow <b>183</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Further, when rotated toward the frame member <b>21</b>, the lever member <b>28</b> is rotated to a position where each of the projecting pieces <b>88</b> is opposed to each of the abutment portions <b>67</b> which are formed on inner surfaces of the side walls <b>62</b> of the operation portion <b>56</b> of the slide button <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Next, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, when abrupt acceleration acts on the buckle main body <b>3</b> toward the webbing <b>173</b> (that is, in the direction of arrow <b>181</b>), the slide button <b>11</b> also experiences an inertial force in the direction opposite to the opening <b>13</b> (that is, in the direction of arrow <b>185</b>), then the slide button <b>11</b> is slidingly moved, against the urging force of the button spring <b>32</b>, in the lengthwise direction of the frame member <b>21</b>, that is, in the direction to release the engagement of the tongue plate <b>17</b> and the latch <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Meanwhile, the projecting pieces <b>88</b> of the lever member <b>28</b> are rotated by the rotation of the inertial mass body <b>92</b>, to the position where the projecting pieces <b>88</b> face the abutment portions <b>67</b> of the slide button <b>11</b> respectively. Thus, the projecting pieces <b>88</b> of the lever member <b>28</b> catch the abutment portions <b>67</b> of the slide button <b>11</b> which have started slide movement in the direction lengthwise opposite to the opening <b>13</b> with respect to the frame member <b>21</b>, respectively, and stop the slide movement in the direction opposite to the opening <b>13</b> of the slide button <b>11</b>, so that the release of the engagement of the latch <b>30</b> and the tongue plate <b>17</b> can be prevented. Thereby, when the pretensioner for the seatbelt retractor is activated, the tongue plate <b>17</b> can be surely prevented from being removed from the buckle main body <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">After the activation of the pretensioner for the seatbelt retractor, the slide button <b>11</b> returns to the normal position thereof closer to the opening <b>13</b> by the urging force of the button spring <b>32</b>. Further, the stopper member <b>27</b> is rotated by the urging force of the torsion spring <b>29</b> through the lever member <b>28</b> in a direction away from the frame member <b>21</b>, so that the projections <b>103</b> abut on the rotation restricting pieces <b>97</b> of the base member <b>26</b>, respectively. Further, the lever member <b>28</b> returns by the urging force of the torsion spring <b>29</b> to the state approximately parallel to the frame member <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">As has been described in detail, according to the buckle device <b>1</b> of the present embodiment, the frame member <b>21</b>, which is approximately U-shaped in side view, has the ejector <b>22</b> having elastic locking pieces <b>52</b> whose tips are configured to move along the long holes <b>63</b> formed in the upper plate <b>42</b>, mounted thereon. The permanent magnet <b>25</b> is mounted on the slider member <b>24</b>, at the end portion closer to the Hall IC switch <b>34</b>. The pairs of elastic engagement pieces <b>78</b> of the slider member <b>24</b> are respectively inserted through the long holes <b>63</b>, and engaged with the engagement portions <b>79</b> provided at the tips of elastic engagement pieces <b>52</b> of the ejector <b>22</b> and thus assembled. In the base member <b>26</b> formed approximately rectangular-frame-shaped in plan view, the Hall IC switch <b>34</b> is fitted on the Hall IC switch supporting extension <b>106</b>, extended approximately perpendicularly outward from the end portion closer to the frame member <b>21</b> of the one outer plate <b>105</b> thereof positioned adjacent to the permanent magnet <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">As a result, when the insertion plate portion <b>175</b> of the tongue plate <b>17</b> is not inserted in the insertion portion <b>45</b> of the frame member <b>21</b>, the permanent magnet <b>25</b> fixed to the slider member <b>24</b> is located away from the Hall element <b>132</b> of the Hall IC switch <b>34</b>, and then the Hall IC switch <b>34</b> outputs an OFF signal. Meanwhile, in the locked state where the tongue plate <b>17</b> is inserted in the insertion portion <b>45</b> and the engagement piece <b>126</b> of the latch <b>30</b> is engaged with the engagement hole <b>176</b>, the ejector <b>22</b> is slidingly moved in a direction lengthwise opposite to the opening <b>13</b> with respect to the frame member <b>21</b> by the insertion plate portion <b>175</b> of the tongue plate <b>17</b>. Accordingly, as the permanent magnet <b>25</b> fixed to the slider member <b>24</b> is located in the proximity to the Hall element <b>132</b> of the Hall IC switch <b>34</b>, the Hall IC switch <b>34</b> outputs an ON signal. As a result, through detecting an ON/OFF signal of the Hall IC switch <b>34</b>, the engagement and disengagement between the tongue plate <b>17</b> and the latch <b>30</b> can be reliably detected.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Further, the mechanical switch <b>35</b> is locked on the mechanical switch supporting extension <b>107</b>, in a state where the engagement rib <b>77</b> of the slider member <b>24</b> is positioned between the pair of projecting pieces <b>157</b> of the slide brush <b>156</b>. The engagement rib <b>77</b> is approximately L-shaped in side view, projecting from the horizontal notch portion <b>108</b> formed on the side edge portion on the side closer to the frame member <b>21</b>, of the outer plate <b>105</b> of the base member <b>26</b>. In other words, the mechanical switch <b>35</b> is fitted on the mechanical switch supporting extension <b>107</b>, in the state where the pair of projecting pieces <b>157</b> of the slide brush <b>156</b> is positioned side by side with the two lateral sides of the engagement rib <b>77</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">As a result, when the insertion plate portion <b>175</b> of the tongue plate <b>17</b> is not inserted in the insertion portion <b>45</b> of the frame member <b>21</b>, the slide brush <b>156</b> of the mechanical switch <b>35</b> is slidingly moved toward the opening <b>13</b> by the engagement rib <b>77</b> of the slider member <b>24</b> positioned between the pair of projecting pieces <b>157</b>, and the printed wirings <b>152</b>A and <b>153</b> are electrically connected. Accordingly, the mechanical switch <b>35</b> outputs an ON signal as the circuit is connected through the lead wires <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Meanwhile, in the locked state where the tongue plate <b>17</b> is inserted in the insertion portion <b>45</b> and the engagement piece <b>126</b> of the latch <b>30</b> is engaged with the engagement hole <b>176</b>; the ejector <b>22</b> is slidingly moved in a direction opposite to the opening <b>13</b> by the insertion plate portion <b>175</b> of the tongue plate <b>17</b>. Accordingly, the slide brush <b>156</b> is slidingly moved toward the engagement projection <b>161</b>, namely, in the direction opposite to the opening <b>13</b>, by the engagement rib <b>77</b> positioned between the pair of projecting pieces <b>157</b>, and the printed wirings <b>152</b>A and <b>153</b> are electrically disconnected. As a result, the mechanical switch <b>35</b> outputs an OFF signal as the circuit is disconnected through the lead wires <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Accordingly, through detecting the ON/OFF signal from the mechanical switch <b>35</b>, the engagement and disengagement between the tongue plate <b>17</b> and the latch <b>30</b> can be reliably detected. In addition, even if either the Hall IC switch <b>34</b> or the mechanical switch <b>35</b> malfunctions, the engagement and disengagement between the tongue plate <b>17</b> and the latch <b>30</b> can be reliably detected. Accordingly, the reliability thereof can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">In addition, in the Hal IC switch <b>34</b>, while the engagement projection <b>135</b> is fitted into the engagement frame <b>142</b> of the base member <b>26</b>, the engagement projection <b>135</b> is pushed onto the Hall IC supporting projection <b>106</b>, and thereby, the lower end of the locking projection <b>133</b> of the Hal IC switch <b>34</b> is locked with the lower end portion of the elastic locking piece <b>141</b> of the base member <b>26</b>. As a result, the Hall IC switch <b>34</b> can be mounted on the buckle main body <b>3</b> with a single operation. Accordingly, the efficiency in assembly of the buckle device can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Further, in a state where the slide brush <b>156</b> of the mechanical switch <b>35</b> is moved in a direction toward the slide button <b>11</b>, the engagement projection <b>161</b> of the mechanical switch <b>35</b> is fitted inside the engagement frame <b>164</b> of the base member <b>26</b> while each end portion is fitted into each insertion groove <b>163</b> and pushed onto the mechanical switch supporting projection <b>107</b>. Thus, the engagement projection <b>162</b> is locked with the elastic engagement piece <b>165</b>. As a result, the mechanical switch <b>35</b> can be mounted onto the buckle main body <b>3</b> with a single motion. Accordingly, the efficiency in assembly of the buckle device <b>1</b> can be further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Moreover, the lower cover <b>4</b> and the upper cover <b>2</b> can be mounted after mounting the Hall IC switch <b>34</b> and the mechanical switch <b>35</b> onto the base member <b>26</b> which makes up the buckle main body <b>3</b>. Accordingly, the efficiency in assembly of the buckle device <b>1</b> can be yet further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">However, the present invention is not limited to the aspects described in the above embodiment, but various improvements and alterations can be made thereto without departing from the spirit of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">(A) For example, the torsion spring which urges the inertial mass body <b>92</b> of the stopper member <b>27</b> in the direction away from the frame member <b>21</b> may be directly mounted thereon, and at the same time, the abutment portions <b>67</b> may be modified in the height to abut only when the inertial mass body <b>92</b> is rotated toward the frame member <b>21</b>, so that the lever member <b>28</b> can be omitted. With this, the total number of components can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">(B) Further, for example, the lever member <b>28</b> may be formed approximately T-shaped in plan view omitting the formation of the projecting pieces <b>88</b>, and may be arranged at the backside of the operation portion <b>56</b> of the slide button <b>11</b>, and the abutment portion <b>67</b> may be provided only at the approximately central point in the width direction of the frame member <b>21</b>. With this, the configuration of the lever member <b>28</b> can further be simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">(C) Still further, for example, only one of the Hall IC switch <b>34</b> and the mechanical switch <b>35</b> may be provided for the buckle main body <b>3</b>. With this, the total number of components can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">(D) Further yet, for example, the Hall element <b>132</b> in the Hall IC switch <b>34</b> may be disposed in the proximity of an end portion on a back side which is opposite to the side where the lead wires <b>15</b> are extracted, that is, in the proximity of an end portion closer to the opening <b>13</b>. Further, the lead wires <b>15</b> of the mechanical switch <b>35</b> may be soldered to the printed wiring <b>152</b>B and the printed wiring <b>153</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">In this case, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when the insertion plate portion <b>175</b> of the tongue plate <b>17</b> is not inserted in the insertion portion <b>45</b>, the ejector <b>22</b> is slidingly moved by the ejector spring <b>23</b> toward the opening <b>13</b>, and the slider member <b>24</b> locked at the tips of the elastic locking pieces <b>52</b> of the ejector <b>22</b> abuts on the latch supporting frame <b>61</b> of the slide button <b>11</b>. Thereby, as the permanent magnet <b>25</b> fixed to the slider member <b>24</b> is disposed in the proximity of the Hall IC switch <b>34</b>, the Hall IC switch <b>34</b> outputs an ON signal.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Further, the slide brush <b>156</b> of the mechanical switch <b>35</b> is slidingly moved toward the opening <b>13</b> by the engagement rib <b>77</b> of the slider member <b>24</b> positioned between the pair of projecting pieces <b>157</b>, and the printed wirings <b>152</b>B and <b>153</b> are electrically disconnected. As a result, the mechanical switch <b>35</b> outputs an OFF signal as the circuit is disconnected through the lead wires <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, in the locked state where the tongue plate <b>17</b> is inserted in the insertion portion <b>45</b> and the engagement piece <b>126</b> of the latch <b>30</b> is engaged with the engagement hole <b>176</b>, the ejector <b>22</b> is slidingly moved by the insertion plate portion <b>175</b> of the tongue plate <b>17</b> in the direction lengthwise opposite to the opening <b>13</b> with respect to the frame member <b>21</b>. The slider member <b>24</b> engaged at the tips of elastic locking pieces <b>52</b> of the ejector <b>22</b> is positioned in the proximity of the side wall portion opposite to the latch housing portion <b>82</b> of the base member <b>26</b>. As a result, the permanent magnet <b>25</b> fixed in the slider member <b>24</b> is positioned away from the Hall element <b>132</b> of the Hall IC switch <b>34</b>, so that the Hall IC switch <b>34</b> outputs an OFF signal.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Further, the slide brush <b>156</b> of the mechanical switch <b>35</b> is slidingly moved by the engagement rib <b>77</b> of the slider member <b>24</b> positioned between the pair of projecting pieces <b>157</b> in the direction toward the engagement projection <b>161</b>, namely, in the direction opposite to the opening <b>13</b>, and the printed wirings <b>152</b>B and <b>153</b> are electrically connected. As a result, the mechanical switch <b>35</b> outputs an ON signal as the circuit is connected through the lead wires <b>15</b>.</p>
