<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This disclosure relates to an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light generation system for generating extreme ultraviolet light.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With recent increase in integration of semiconductor process, transfer patterns for use in photolithography of the semiconductor process have rapidly become finer. In the next generation, microfabrication at 70 to 45 nm, further, microfabrication at 32 nm or less is to be demanded. Accordingly, to meet the demand for microfabrication at 32 nm or less, for example, an exposure apparatus is expected to be developed, where EUV light at a wavelength of approximately 13 nm is combined with a reduction projection reflective optical system.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There are mainly three types of known EUV light generation systems, namely, a laser produced plasma (LPP) type apparatus using plasma generated as a target material is irradiated with a laser beam, a discharge produced plasma (DPP) type apparatus using plasma generated by discharge, and a synchrotron radiation (SR) type apparatus using orbital radiation.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An extreme ultraviolet light generation system according to one aspect of this disclosure is an extreme ultraviolet light generation system which is used with a laser apparatus and is connected to an external device so as to supply extreme ultraviolet light thereto, and the extreme ultraviolet light generation system may include: a chamber provided with at least one inlet through which a laser beam is introduced thereinto; a target supply unit provided to the chamber for supplying a target material to a predetermined region inside the chamber; a discharge pump connected to the chamber; at least one optical element disposed inside the chamber; an etching gas introduction unit provided to the chamber through which etching gas passes, the etching gas being introduced to etch debris of the target material which is emitted when the target material is irradiated with the laser beam inside the chamber and adheres to the at least one optical element; and at least one temperature control mechanism for controlling a temperature of the at least one optical element.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Hereinafter, embodiments for implementing this disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the subsequent description, each drawing merely illustrates shape, size, positional relationship, and so on, schematically to the extent that enables the content of this disclosure to be understood; thus, this disclosure is not limited to the shape, the size, the positional relationship, and so on, illustrated in each drawing. In order to show the configuration clearly, part of hatching along a section is omitted in the drawings. Further, numerical values indicated hereafter are merely preferred examples of this disclosure; thus, this disclosure is not limited to the indicated numerical values.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">An EUV light generation system according to a first embodiment of this disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates the configuration of an EUV light generation system <b>1</b> according the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the EUV light generation system <b>1</b> may include: a highly airtight chamber defining a space for generation of EUV light; an exposure-apparatus connection <b>13</b> with which the chamber <b>11</b> is optically connected to an exposure apparatus (not shown); a droplet controller <b>14</b><i>a </i>and a droplet generator <b>14</b><i>b </i>for supplying into the chamber <b>11</b>, in the form of a liquid droplet D, a target material, such as tin (Sn), serving as a material for generating EUV light; a pre-pulse laser PL and a main pulse laser ML for outputting pulsed laser beams (pre-pulse laser beam L<b>1</b><i>a </i>and main pulse laser beam L<b>1</b><i>b</i>) for turning the droplet D into plasma; and an EUV light generation controller <b>10</b> for appropriately controlling the pre-pulse laser PL, the main pulse laser ML, the droplet controller <b>14</b><i>a</i>, and so on. The droplet D may be supplied into the chamber <b>11</b> through a tip of a nozzle (not shown) provided to the droplet generator <b>14</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The chamber <b>11</b> may be provided with windows W<b>1</b> and W<b>2</b>, and the pre-pulse laser beam L<b>1</b><i>a </i>and the main pulse laser beam L<b>1</b><i>b </i>may pass through the windows W<b>1</b> and W<b>2</b>, respectively, and enter the chamber <b>11</b>. Inside the chamber <b>11</b>, off-axis paraboloidal mirrors M<b>2</b> and M<b>3</b> for respectively focusing the pre-pulse laser beam L<b>1</b><i>a </i>and the main pulse laser beam L<b>1</b><i>b</i>, which have entered the chamber through the windows W<b>1</b> and W<b>2</b>, at a predetermined position in a plasma generation region P<b>1</b> inside the chamber <b>11</b>, and an EUV collector mirror M<b>1</b> for reflecting EUV light L<b>2</b> generated in the plasma generation region P<b>1</b> such that the EUV light L<b>2</b> is focused at an intermediate focus IF set inside the exposure-apparatus connection <b>13</b> may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In such a configuration, the EUV light generation controller <b>10</b> may control the droplet controller <b>14</b><i>a </i>to thereby control the timing at which the droplet D is outputted from the droplet generator <b>14</b><i>b</i>. The droplet D outputted from the droplet generator <b>14</b><i>b </i>may arrive in the plasma generation region P<b>1</b>. At the timing at which the droplet D arrives in the plasma generation region P<b>1</b>, the pre-pulse laser beam L<b>1</b><i>a </i>outputted from the pre-pulse laser PL may be focused on the droplet D via the window W<b>1</b> and the off-axis paraboloidal mirror M<b>2</b> from a side surface side of the EUV collector mirror M<b>1</b> (first-stage laser irradiation). With this, the droplet D may be diffused, and the liquid target material may be turned into a state in which weak plasma, neutral particles, clusters, fragments, and so on, mixedly exist. In the description to follow, this state is referred to as a &#x201c;diffused target.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The main pulse laser beam L<b>1</b><i>b </i>outputted from the main pulse laser ML may be focused on the diffused target generated in the plasma generation region P<b>1</b> via the window W<b>2</b> and the off-axis paraboloidal mirror M<b>3</b> from the back surface side of the EUV collector mirror M<b>1</b> (second-stage laser irradiation). With this, the diffused target may be turned into plasma. EUV light L<b>2</b> is emitted when this plasma deexcites. Note that a through-hole M<b>1</b><i>a </i>through which the main pulse laser beam L<b>1</b><i>b </i>passes may be provided in the EUV collector mirror M<b>1</b>. The timing at which the pre-pulse laser beam L<b>1</b><i>a </i>is outputted from the pre-pulse laser PL and the timing at which the main pulse laser beam L<b>1</b><i>b </i>is outputted from the main pulse laser ML may be controlled by the EUV light generation controller <b>10</b>. The droplet D may be irradiated with the pre-pulse laser beam L<b>1</b><i>a </i>at the timing at which the droplet D arrives in the plasma generation region P<b>1</b>, and the diffused target generated in the plasma generation region P<b>1</b> may be irradiated with the main pulse laser beam L<b>1</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The EUV light L<b>2</b> emitted from the plasma may be reflected by the EUV collector mirror M<b>1</b> having a spheroidal reflective surface, to thereby be reflected toward the exposure-apparatus connection <b>13</b>. The reflected EUV light L<b>2</b> may be focused at the intermediate focus IF set in the exposure-apparatus connection <b>13</b>, as described above. After that, the EUV light L<b>2</b> may be propagated to the exposure apparatus through a waveguide (such as a tube) (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The target material (droplet D) is turned into plasma with two-stage laser beam irradiation in the first embodiment, but without being limited thereto, the target material may be turned into plasma with one-stage, or three-or-more-stage laser irradiation. Further, the target material is supplied in the form of a liquid droplet in the first embodiment, but without being limited thereto, a solid target material preset rotatably in the chamber <b>11</b> may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">After the EUV light L<b>2</b> is emitted, particles of Sn serving as the target material, such as ions, atoms, charged particles, and neutral particles (hereinafter referred to as Sn debris), may be generated from the plasma generated in the plasma generation region P<b>1</b>. This Sn debris, having been emitted from the plasma generation region P<b>1</b>, may adhere to and accumulate on the optical elements, such as the EUV collector mirror M<b>1</b> and the off-axis paraboloidal mirrors M<b>2</b> and M<b>3</b>, disposed in the chamber <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Accordingly, the EUV light generation system <b>1</b> of the first embodiment may include radical generators <b>15</b><i>a </i>through <b>15</b><i>c </i>for supplying hydrogen radicals (hereinafter referred to as H radicals or H*) into the chamber <b>11</b>, and a discharge pump <b>12</b> for discharging gas from the chamber <b>11</b>. H radicals emitted from the radical generators <b>15</b><i>a </i>through <b>15</b><i>c </i>may be supplied into the chamber <b>11</b> through gas introduction pipes <b>16</b><i>a </i>through <b>16</b><i>c </i>extending into the chamber <b>11</b>. The radical generators <b>15</b><i>a </i>through <b>15</b><i>c </i>and the gas introduction pipes <b>16</b><i>a </i>through <b>16</b><i>c </i>may allow etching gas (H radical or H<sub>2 </sub>gas that has not been turned into H radical) for etching the Sn debris adhering to the optical elements provided in the chamber <b>11</b> to flow along the surface of the optical elements.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Gas discharge ports of the gas introduction pipes <b>16</b><i>a </i>through <b>16</b><i>c </i>preferably point respectively toward the optical elements, such as the EUV collector mirror M<b>1</b> and the off-axis paraboloidal mirrors M<b>2</b> and M<b>3</b>, provided in the chamber <b>11</b>. With this, H radicals may flow along the surfaces of the optical elements to which the Sn debris has adhered, and the H radicals may react with the Sn debris on the surfaces of the optical elements, whereby stannane (SnH<sub>4</sub>) gas may be generated. This stannane gas is in a gaseous state approximately at or above &#x2212;52&#xb0; C. Therefore, allowing Sn and the H radicals to react to thereby generate the stannane gas makes it possible to etch the Sn debris on the surfaces of the optical elements. As a result, performance degradation of the optical elements can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The stannane gas generated by allowing the H radicals to flow along the surfaces of the optical elements may be discharged outside the chamber <b>11</b> with the discharge pump <b>12</b>. In the first embodiment, hydrogen is preferably supplied in the form of a radical, in order to allow the Sn debris adhering to the optical elements to undergo the etching reaction with high efficiency; however, without being limited thereto, hydrogen may be supplied in the form of hydrogen molecules (H<sub>2</sub>). In this a case, when hydrogen molecules are turned into H radicals by ultraviolet light, vacuum ultraviolet light, EUV light, and the like, emitted in the plasma generation region P<b>1</b>, the H radicals may react with the Sn debris adhering to the optical elements, whereby stannane (SnH<sub>4</sub>) may be generated. As a result, the Sn debris adhering to the optical elements may be etched, and performance degradation of the optical elements can be prevented. In such case, the radical generators <b>15</b><i>a </i>through <b>15</b><i>c </i>are not required. A hydrogen gas supply source may be provided, in place of the radical generators <b>15</b><i>a </i>through <b>15</b><i>c</i>. The hydrogen gas supply source may be provided at a facility where an exposure apparatus is installed, or it may be provided to either of the EUV light generation system and the exposure apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Plate-shaped partitions <b>11</b><i>a </i>through <b>11</b><i>c</i>, for example, may be provided in the chamber <b>11</b>. The flow of gas (H radicals, hydrogen gas, stannane gas, and so on) inside the chamber <b>11</b> may be controlled with the partitions <b>11</b><i>a </i>through <b>11</b><i>c</i>. As a result, the Sn debris adhering to the optical elements can effectively be etched, and the generated stannane gas can efficiently be discharged. An opening A<b>1</b> defined between the partitions <b>11</b><i>b </i>and <b>11</b><i>c </i>may function as a flow channel for the etching gas and as an optical path of the main pulse laser beam L<b>1</b><i>a</i>. An opening A<b>2</b> defined between the partitions <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b </i>may function as a flow channel for the etching gas and as an optical path of the pre-pulse laser beam L<b>1</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The flow of gas is controlled with the partitions <b>11</b><i>a </i>through <b>11</b><i>c </i>such that the gas flows from the optical elements (such as the EUV collector mirror M<b>1</b> and the off-axis paraboloidal mirrors M<b>2</b> and M<b>3</b>) to the plasma generation region P<b>1</b> where the debris is generated, whereby the incidence of the Sn debris onto the optical elements can be suppressed. With this, adhesion of the Sn debris onto the optical elements can be minimized, and hence performance degradation of the optical elements can be prevented more reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> schematically illustrates a reaction in which hydrogen gas is changed into hydrogen radicals and reacts with solid Sn on the optical element to be turned into stannane gas and a reaction in which the stannane gas is decomposed and solid Sn is deposited. The reaction of Sn and H radicals may be expressed by the following chemical reaction formulae (1) and (2):

</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Here, (s) and (g) indicate a solid state and a gaseous state, respectively. The reactions given by the chemical reaction formulae (1) and (2) may occur simultaneously. The total etching rate Val is expressed as the difference between the etching reaction rate V<b>1</b> and the deposition rate V<b>2</b>, as given by the following expression (3):
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Val=V</i>1<i>&#x2212;V</i>2&#x2003;&#x2003;(3)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The etching rate V<b>1</b>, the deposition rate V<b>2</b>, and the total etching rate Val may fluctuate depending on the temperature of the optical element when the concentrations of H radicals, H<sub>2</sub>, and SnH<sub>4 </sub>are constant.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, illustrates the schematic of the configuration (temperature control mechanism) for controlling the temperature of an optical element. The temperature control mechanism may include: a temperature control element <b>20</b><i>b </i>provided on an optical element M, such as the EUV collector mirror M<b>1</b>; a power supply <b>20</b><i>a </i>for supplying electric current to the temperature control element <b>20</b><i>b</i>; a temperature sensor <b>20</b><i>c </i>provided on the optical element M; and a temperature controller <b>20</b> for controlling the electric current to be supplied to the temperature control element <b>20</b><i>b </i>by the power supply <b>20</b><i>a</i>, based on the temperature detected by the temperature sensor <b>20</b><i>c</i>. As an example of the temperature control element <b>20</b><i>b</i>, a heater may be used, and the electric current supplied to the heater may be controlled based on the detection result of the temperature sensor <b>20</b><i>c</i>, whereby the temperature may be stabilized at a predetermined temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The total etching rate Val with respect to the set temperatures (within the range from the normal temperature to the temperature to which heating control is possible) has been measured. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a graph showing relationship between the temperature and each of an etching reaction rate of Sn, a deposition reaction rate of Sn, and a total etching rate represented by a difference between the etching reaction rate of Sn and the deposition rate of Sn. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a dashed line indicates the temperature dependency of the etching rate V<b>1</b>, and a one-dot dashed line indicates the temperature dependency of the deposition rate V<b>2</b>. A solid line indicates the total etching rate Val (=V<b>1</b>&#x2212;V<b>2</b>). The case where the total etching rate is 0 indicates that the etching rate V<b>1</b> is equal to the deposition rate V<b>2</b>, and In this a case, Sn adhering to the surface of the optical element cannot be removed. The case where the total etching rate Val is positive indicates that Sn adhering to the surface of the optical element can be etched. Conversely, the case where the total etching rate Val is negative indicates that Sn is further deposited on the surface of the optical element. Therefore, the electric current supplied to the temperature control element <b>20</b><i>b </i>from the power supply <b>20</b><i>a </i>is controlled with the temperature controller <b>20</b> based on an actually observed temperature such that the temperature of the optical element M is maintained within a target temperature range (for example, not lower than 40&#xb0; C. and not higher than 120&#xb0; C., preferably, not lower than 60&#xb0; C. and not higher than 100&#xb0; C.), whereby the total etching rate Val may be maintained at a required etching rate, and Sn adhering to the optical element can be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the total etching rate Val of Sn adhering to the optical element rises as the temperature rises, while the temperature of the surface of the optical element is from 0&#xb0; C. to approximately 60&#xb0; C. Meanwhile, when the temperature of the surface of the optical element exceeds approximately 100&#xb0; C., the total etching rate Val starts to fall. Accordingly, in the first embodiment, the temperature of the optical element provided in the chamber <b>11</b> is controlled to be within, for example, a temperature range of not lower than 40&#xb0; C. and not higher than 120&#xb0; C., preferably, of not lower than 60&#xb0; C. and not higher than 100&#xb0; C. With this, the stannane gas may be prevented from being decomposed, whereby Sn may be prevented from being deposited on the surface of the optical element. As a result, Sn may be prevented from being deposited again on the optical element. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> schematically illustrates the configuration for controlling the temperature of the optical elements provided in the chamber according to the first embodiment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the windows W<b>1</b> and W<b>2</b>, the EUV collector mirror M<b>1</b>, and the off-axis paraboloidal mirrors M<b>2</b> and M<b>3</b> (hereinafter simply referred to as optical elements W<b>1</b> and W<b>2</b> and M<b>1</b> through M<b>3</b>) are given as examples of the optical elements of which the temperatures are to be controlled; however, this disclosure is not limited to these.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the EUV light generation system <b>1</b> of the first embodiment may include a chiller <b>17</b> provided outside the chamber <b>11</b>. The chiller <b>17</b> may feed, into a main supply pipe Cin, a heat carrier (for example, liquid that is stable at the operating temperature, such as temperature-controlled water or oil) for controlling the temperatures of the optical elements W<b>1</b> and W<b>2</b> and M<b>1</b> through M<b>3</b>. Sub-supply pipes C<b>1</b>in through C<b>5</b>in may branch off from the main supply pipe Cin to the optical elements W<b>1</b> and W<b>2</b> and M<b>1</b> through M<b>3</b>, respectively. With this, the temperature-controlled heat carrier fed into the main supply pipe Cin may be supplied to the optical elements W<b>1</b> and W<b>2</b> and M<b>1</b> through M<b>3</b> via the sub-supply pipes C<b>1</b>in through C<b>5</b>in, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The optical elements W<b>1</b> and W<b>2</b> and M<b>1</b> through M<b>3</b> may include heat carrier flow channels C<b>1</b> through C<b>5</b> through which the heat carrier fed thereinto circulates. The heat carrier distributed into the sub-supply pipes C<b>1</b>in through C<b>5</b>in may flow into the heat carrier flow channels C<b>1</b> through C<b>5</b> of the optical elements W<b>1</b> and W<b>2</b> and M<b>1</b> through M<b>3</b>, and then circulate inside the optical elements W<b>1</b> and W<b>2</b> and M<b>1</b> through M<b>3</b>. With this, the temperatures of the optical elements W<b>1</b> and W<b>2</b> and M<b>1</b> through M<b>3</b> may be controlled to be within the target temperature range.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The heat carrier having circulated in the heat carrier flow channels C<b>1</b> through C<b>5</b> of the optical elements W<b>1</b> and W<b>2</b> and M<b>1</b> through M<b>3</b> may then flow into sub-discharge pipes C<b>1</b>out through C<b>5</b>out connected to the heat carrier flow channels C<b>1</b> through C<b>5</b>. The sub-discharge pipes C<b>1</b>out through C<b>5</b>out may be connected to a main discharge pipe Cout connected to the chiller <b>17</b>. The heat carrier having flowed into the sub-discharge pipes C<b>1</b>out through C<b>5</b>out may then return to the chiller <b>17</b> via the main discharge pipe Cout. The heat carrier having returned to the chiller <b>17</b> may be fed out into the main supply pipe Cin again after the temperature thereof is controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The sub-supply pipes C<b>1</b>in through C<b>5</b>in and the sub-discharge pipes C<b>1</b>out through C<b>5</b>out may respectively be provided with temperature sensors T<b>1</b>in through T<b>5</b> in and T<b>1</b>out through T<b>5</b>out for detecting the temperature of the heat carrier flowing through the pipes. The total flow rate and the temperature of the temperature sensors T<b>1</b>in through T<b>5</b> in and T<b>1</b>out through T<b>5</b>out may be controlled, for example, by the EUV light generation controller <b>10</b> or by the chiller <b>17</b> equipped with a circulation pump (not shown). With this, the heat carrier may be supplied smoothly to the optical elements W<b>1</b> and W<b>2</b> and M<b>1</b> through M<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The sub-discharge pipes C<b>1</b>out through C<b>5</b>out of the optical elements W<b>1</b> and W<b>2</b> and M<b>1</b> through M<b>3</b> may be provided with flow-rate control valves V<b>1</b> through V<b>5</b>, respectively. For example, the EUV light generation controller <b>10</b> or the chiller <b>17</b> may control the flow-rate control valves V<b>1</b> through V<b>5</b>, in order to control the flow rate of the heat carrier flowing into the optical elements. With this, the flow rate of the heat carrier flowing through the sub-discharge pipes C<b>1</b>out through C<b>5</b>out may be controlled.
