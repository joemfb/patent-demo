<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a lubricant application device which applies a solid lubricant onto an image carrying member and an image forming apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In electrophotographic image forming apparatuses, it is widely performed to press a cleaning blade against the surface of an image carrying member to scrape a toner remaining on the image carrying member. Lubricant application devices, in which in order to reduce the friction between the image carrying member and the cleaning blade in scraping the toner, a brush roller rotating while contacting the image carrying member and a solid lubricant, shaves the solid lubricant and applies the shaved solid lubricant onto the image carrying member, are publicly known.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Furthermore, in Patent Documents 1 and 2, there is disclosed a technical idea in which a flicker abutting against the brush roller is disposed in the lubricant application device and the flicker knocks off a developer adhering to the brush roller through a rotation force of the brush roller.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In conventional lubricant application devices, the brush roller in which rigid brushes made of a resin are implanted are employed, but this brush roller tends to supply an insufficient solid lubricant since it shaves the solid lubricant in streak form. Therefore, it is investigated to scrape the solid lubricant uniformly by applying a brush roller having many soft brushes like a raised cloth wound around a shaft to stabilize lubrication performance. However, this method has a problem that when the flicker is used for the soft brushes, brushes are damaged and therefore it becomes impossible to scrape and apply the lubricant properly.

</ul>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0007">In view of the above problem, it is an object of the present invention to provide a lubricant application device and an image forming apparatus which can shave a solid lubricant evenly and can knock off a developer with a flicker.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0008">To solve the above problem, the lubricant application device according to the present invention includes a brush roller which rotates while contacting an image carrying member and a solid lubricant, shaves the solid lubricant and applies the shaved solid lubricant onto the image carrying member, and a flicker which abuts against the brush roller and knocks off a developer adhering to the brush roller through a rotation of the brush roller, wherein the brush roller has looped bristles implanted in a state of endless loop, and wherein the flicker has a contact surface which forms an acute angle with a direction of a tangent line on an upstream side in a rotation direction of the brush roller.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0009">In accordance with this constitution, the solid lubricant can be evenly shaved by the looped bristles. Further, since the looped bristles abut surely against the contact surface of the flicker first, they are not damaged by a tip edge of the flicker.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0010">Further, in the lubricant application device of the present invention, when an angle between the contact surface and a rotation direction of the brush roller is 5&#xb0; or more, the flicker has a sufficient effect of knocking off a developer adhering to the looped bristles, and when the angle between the contact surface and the rotation direction of the brush roller is 70&#xb0; or less, damages to the looped bristles can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0011">Further, in the lubricant application device of the present invention, when the looped bristle has the inclination of 30&#xb0; or more with respect to a direction of a rotation axis of the brush roller, damages to the looped bristles by the flicker can be reduced. Moreover, when an inclination of the looped bristles with respect to a direction of a rotation axis of the brush roller is 60&#xb0; or less, the solid lubricant can be adequately shaved.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0012">The lubricant application device according to the present invention, in the looped bristles, a plurality of fibers may be twined with each other and implanted.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0013">In accordance with this constitution, since the rigidity of a bundle of the loops becomes high, the solid lubricant can be moderately scraped.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0014">The lubricant application device according to the present invention, the brush roller further has auxiliary looped bristles in which fibers are not twined with each other and implanted in a state of endless loop.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0015">Since a bundle of the auxiliary looped bristle, which are not twined, has low rigidity, it has a weak action of scraping the solid lubricant, but it is less prone to being damaged by the flicker. By implanting such the auxiliary looped bristles to fill in a gap between the looped bristles which are twined, the attitude of the looped bristles can be held.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0016">The image forming apparatus according to the present invention includes any of the above-mentioned lubricant application devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Effect of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0017">As described above, the lubricant application device according to the present invention succeeds in reducing the damages of the brush roller while knocking off the developer from the brush roller by using a brush roller having looped bristles implanted in a state of endless loop and providing a flicker having a contact surface which forms an acute angle with a direction of a tangent line on an upstream side in a rotation direction of the brush roller. Thereby, in the lubricant application device of the present invention, consumption of the solid lubricant is uniform and the brush roller has a long-life.</p>

The image forming apparatus <b>1</b> has four developing units <b>2</b>Y, <b>2</b>M, <b>2</b>C, and <b>2</b>K which form an image by toners (developers) of yellow, magenta, cyan, and black, respectively, having negative charges, a transfer belt <b>3</b>, a primary transfer roller <b>4</b> to transfer toner images which the developing units <b>2</b> form to the transfer belt <b>3</b> through an electrostatic force, a secondary transfer roller <b>5</b> to transfer toner images transferred to the transfer belt <b>3</b> to a recording paper S through an electrostatic force, a fixing device <b>6</b> to fix the toner images by heating the recording paper S, and four toner cartridges <b>7</b>Y, <b>7</b>M, <b>7</b>C, <b>7</b>K to supply toners of yellow, magenta, cyan, and black, respectively, to the developing units <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0022">Each of the developing units <b>2</b>Y, <b>2</b>M, <b>2</b>C, and <b>2</b>K has a drum-shaped photoconductor (image carrying member) <b>8</b> to rotate, a charging unit <b>9</b> to cause the photoconductor <b>8</b> to be charged, an exposure unit <b>10</b> which selectively exposures the charged photoconductor <b>8</b> to form an electrostatic latent image, a developing unit <b>11</b> which supplies toner to the electrostatic latent image to form toner images, a lubricant application device <b>12</b> of the present invention which applies a lubricant onto the surface of the photoconductor <b>8</b>, and a cleaning blade <b>13</b> to scrape the toner on the surface of the photoconductor <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0023">The transfer belt <b>3</b> is looped over a drive roller to be rotationally driven, a driven roller <b>15</b> and a tension roller <b>16</b> to give tension and the transfer belt <b>3</b> is moved around these rollers in a direction of an arrow by the driving roller <b>14</b>. Further, the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> has a cleaner unit <b>17</b> which scrapes toner remaining on the surface of the transfer belt <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0024">The recording papers S are supplied to a paper feeding section <b>18</b>, and each recording paper is sent out one by one by a supply roller <b>19</b>, conveyed to a secondary transfer roller <b>5</b> by a conveying roller <b>20</b>, passes through a fixing device <b>6</b>, and discharged to a paper-discharging section <b>22</b> by a paper-discharging roller <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0025">Details of the photoconductor <b>8</b> and the lubricant application device <b>12</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The lubricant application device <b>12</b> includes a brush roller <b>23</b> to rotate, a solid lubricant <b>24</b> formed by solidifying, for example, zinc stearate, a biasing member <b>25</b> which presses the solid lubricant <b>24</b> against the brush roller <b>23</b> with a predetermined force (for example, 1 to 4 N/m), and a flicker <b>26</b> to abut against the brush roller <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0026">The photoconductor <b>8</b> has an overcoat layer in which SiO<sub>2 </sub>fine particles are dispersed and is rotated in a direction of an arrow Rp. The photoconductor <b>8</b> and the lubricant application device <b>12</b> are respectively positioned in such a manner that the photoconductor <b>8</b> dents in the brush roller <b>23</b> by about 0.5 mm. The brush roller <b>23</b> rotates in a direction of an arrow Rb in a manner of being rotated following the rotation of the photoconductor <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0027">The brush roller <b>23</b> is formed, for example, by winding a base cloth having a thickness of 0.5 mm, in which a bundle of conductive polyester fibers is woven and implanted in the shape of loop of 2.5 mm in height, around a metal shaft of 6 mm in outside diameter. These fibers are implanted as a bundle of 48 fibers, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the looped bristles <b>27</b> composed of fibers twined with each other and the auxiliary looped bristles <b>28</b> composed of fibers not twined are alternately arranged so as to be orthogonal to each other and implanted. This base cloth is wound around the shaft in such a manner that a loop direction of the looped bristles <b>27</b>, which are twined, is angled at an angle &#x3c6; with respect to a direction of a rotation axis (a direction orthogonal to a rotation direction Rp) of the brush roller <b>23</b>, that is, a direction of extension of the flicker. A density of fibers implanted in the base cloth is about 100000 fibers/square inch as a whole and a thickness of a bundle of fibers is about 210 decitex (per 48 fibers).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0028">The flicker <b>26</b> is formed by bending a metal plate, has a contact surface <b>29</b> which forms an angle &#x3b8; with an upstream side in a rotation direction at a periphery of the brush roller <b>23</b>, and is held in such a manner that a tip edge of the flicker <b>26</b> dents in the brush roller <b>23</b> by about 0.3 mm, that is, dents in the brush roller <b>23</b> to a depth of 120 of a height of the looped bristle.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0029">In the lubricant application device <b>12</b>, the brush roller <b>23</b> shaves the surface of the solid lubricant <b>24</b>, which is pressed against the brush roller <b>23</b> by a biasing member <b>25</b>, through the rotation of the brush roller <b>23</b>, and applies the shaved lubricant onto the surface of the photoconductor <b>8</b>. In this time, since the brush roller <b>23</b> has looped bristles <b>27</b> in an endless state, the looped bristles <b>27</b> abut against the surface of the solid lubricant over a certain length, and each looped bristle <b>27</b> scrapes the solid lubricant <b>24</b> widely and applies the scraped solid lubricant onto the photoconductor <b>8</b>. Accordingly, the brush roller <b>23</b> does not shave the solid lubricant <b>24</b> in the form of a groove as conventional brushes having straight yarn and an amount of the lubricant to be applied does not vary. On the other hand, a bundle of the auxiliary looped bristle <b>28</b> has a weak action of scraping the solid lubricant <b>24</b> since it has low rigidity because of being not twined. However, the auxiliary looped bristles <b>28</b> has the function of holding the attitude of the looped bristles <b>27</b> by filling in a gap between the looped bristles <b>27</b> to prevent a large deformation of the looped bristle <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0030">The lubricant thus applied onto the surface of the photoconductor <b>8</b> passes through a nip between the cleaning blade <b>13</b> and the photoconductor <b>8</b> with rotations of the photoconductor <b>8</b> to reduce the friction between the cleaning blade <b>13</b> and the photoconductor <b>8</b>. The toner having a larger particle than that of the lubricant cannot pass through the nip between the cleaning blade <b>13</b> and the photoconductor <b>8</b> and is scraped from the photoconductor <b>8</b> by the cleaning blade <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0031">The durability of the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> was tested at varying angles &#x3b8; between the contact surface <b>29</b> of the flicker <b>26</b> and an upstream side in a rotation direction of the brush roller <b>23</b>, and the results of the tests are shown in Table 1. Here, experiments were carried out by setting an angle &#x3c6; of a loop direction of the looped bristles <b>27</b> with respect to a direction of a rotation axis of the brush roller <b>23</b> at 45&#xb0;. In the durability tests, 600000 sheets of images of 600 dpi were printed at a printing speed of 65 sheets/min using an A4-sized recording paper, and then states of damages to the looped bristles <b>27</b> and the auxiliary looped bristles <b>28</b> of the brush roller <b>23</b> were visually checked, and the capabilities of removing the toner from the brush roller <b>23</b> were evaluated by measuring the weight of the brush roller <b>23</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0033">The states of damages of brush roller <b>23</b> can be identified as changes in a hue of the surface, and the case where there was no change in the hue was rated as a symbol &#x2299;, the case where the change in the hue could be slightly recognized was rated as a symbol &#x25ef;, the case where the change in the hue was large was rated as a symbol &#x394;, and the case where the break of the looped bristles <b>27</b> could be recognized was rated as a symbol x. Moreover, with respect to the capability of removing the toner, when an increase in weight of the brush roller <b>23</b> was 2 g or less, it was rated as a symbol &#x2299;, and when an increase in weight was 4 g or less, it was rated as a symbol &#x25ef;, and when an increase in weight was more than 4 g, it was rated as a symbol x.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0034">From this result, it was proven that by adjusting an angle &#x3b8; between the contact surface <b>29</b> of the flicker <b>26</b> and a direction of a tangent line on an upstream side in a rotation direction of the brush roller <b>23</b> so as to be an acute angle less than 90&#xb0;, damages to the looped bristles (and the auxiliary looped bristles <b>28</b>) of the looped bristles <b>23</b> can be reduced to a practicable level, and by adjusting the angle &#x3b8; so as to be 70&#xb0;or less, damages to the looped bristles <b>27</b> can be reduced to a safer level, and by adjusting the angle &#x3b8; so as to be 45&#xb0; or less, almost of damages to the looped bristles <b>27</b> can be eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0035">Further, it was also verified that when an angle &#x3b8; between the contact surface <b>29</b> of the flicker <b>26</b> and a direction of a tangent line on an upstream side in a rotation direction of the brush roller <b>23</b> is 5&#xb0; or more, the toner adhering to the brush roller <b>23</b> can be adequately knocked off by the flicker <b>26</b>, and when the angle &#x3b8; is 25&#xb0; or more, the toner adhering to the brush roller <b>23</b> can be knocked off by the flicker <b>26</b> with more reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0036">Subsequently, the durability of the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> was similarly tested at varying angles &#x3c6; of a loop direction of the looped bristles <b>27</b> with respect to a direction of a rotation axis of the brush roller <b>23</b>, and the results of the tests are shown in Table 2. Here, experiments were carried out by setting the angle &#x3b8; between the contact surface <b>29</b> of the flicker <b>26</b> and a direction of a tangent line of the brush roller <b>23</b> at 45&#xb0;. In this experiment, the capability of applying a lubricant was evaluated according to a consumed amount of the lubricant. Specifically, the case where a remaining weight after the durability test of the solid lubricant <b>24</b> of 18 g in initial weight was 5 g or less was rated as a symbol O, the case where the remaining weight was 10 g or less was rated as a symbol A, and the case where the remaining weight was more than 10 g was rated as a symbol x.</p>
