<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a) to an application filed in the Korean Industrial Property Office on Feb. 24, 2009 and assigned Ser. No. 10-2009-0015446, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to a method and an apparatus for digital up-down conversion using an Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter, and more particularly, to a method for digital up-down conversion for reducing a delay time greater than a delay time in a structure using a conventional Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter by applying a decimation filter and an interpolation filter used in up-conversion and down-conversion procedures in a relay system as an IIR filter structure, and an apparatus thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A conventional service enterpriser establishes infrastructure, through extension of a base station, in order to provide various high-quality wireless communication services to a user. However, as the number of service subscribers has increased, in order to maintain service quality, most communication service enterprisers have installed and managed a relay capable of increasing communication network coverage for a shade zone, which has relatively lower installation and maintenance costs than installation and maintenance costs of a conventional base station, which typically has a high cost as a main communication infra construction method. Such a relay system functions as a relay between a base station and a user. The relay system amplifies a received signal that has a weak power due to various reasons such as a distance from a base station and a channel environment, eliminates interference from the amplified signal, and transmits the amplified signal back to a user.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Meanwhile, in recent years, mobile communication systems have been using Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) to increase a transmission rate of signals. A system using OFDM as a modulation technology requires a guard interval between symbols in order to prevent deterioration of performance caused by intersymbol interference. The guard interval is determined considering a delay spread. Accordingly, as a transmission delay occurs between a transmitting end and a receiving end, when the delay spread becomes larger than the guard interval of the OFDM, intersymbol interference occurs in demodulation of a receiving procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, a delay time occurring between a transmitting end and a receiving end, in particular during a relay procedure causes intersymbol interference, thereby degrading system performance. Therefore, there is a need for a scheme for reducing a delay time of the relay so as to prevent degradation of the system performance.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In particular, an element having a most significant influence on a time delay in a conventional relay system is processing delay times of a decimation filter and an interpolation filter used during up-down conversion procedures. A general FIR filter has a disadvantage, in that the general FIR filter cannot reduce a delay time below a given limit while maintaining a magnitude response characteristic of a filter during a processing procedure of a relay system due to an original delay and a processing delay time.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Consequently, there is a demand for a method of reducing processing delay times of a decimation filter and an interpolation filter with an FIR filter.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention has been made in view of the above problems, and provides a method for digital up-down conversion that implements a decimation filter and an interpolation filter using an Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter, which is approximate to an FIR filter, and has a stable magnitude response characteristic and a processing delay time of a filter itself relatively less than that of a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter, and an apparatus thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, a method for performing digital up-down conversion for a frequency conversion in a mobile communication system using plural frequency conversion includes IIR-filtering, by a magnitude response IIR filter having the same magnitude response as in FIR filtering, an input signal and a stable filter coefficient calculated according to a Levinson polynomial; and receiving, by the magnitude response IIR filter, the IIR filtered signal, and performing IIR filtering by a phase compensation IIR filter having a filter coefficient compensating for a non-linear phase to a linear phase.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, an apparatus for performing digital up-down conversion for a frequency conversion in a mobile communication system using plural frequency converts includes a magnitude response unit for IIR-filtering an input signal by a magnitude response IIR filter having the same magnitude response as in FIR filtering and a stable filter coefficient calculated by a Levinson polynomial; and a phase compensation unit for receiving the IIR filtered signal by the magnitude response IIR filter, and for performing IIR filtering by a phase compensation IIR filter having a filter coefficient compensating for a non-linear phase to a linear phase.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Unlike a conventional FIR filter having no secure stability and having a non-linear phase response characteristic, since an IIR filter of the present invention has secure stability and a linear phase response characteristic, it may reduce a delay time in a digital up-down conversion procedure of a relay.</p>

The same reference numbers are used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts. Detailed descriptions of well-known functions and structures incorporated herein may be omitted to avoid obscuring the subject matter of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an inner structure of a conventional relay.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the conventional relay includes an RF front-end unit having a low noise amplifier <b>110</b> and a high output amplifier <b>120</b>, an interference cancellation block <b>130</b> functioning as an interference cancellation system, a digital down-converter <b>140</b> down-converting a signal from a high frequency band to a baseband for interference cancellation, a digital up-converter <b>150</b> up-converting a signal from which interference is cancelled into the high frequency band, an analog/digital converter <b>160</b> converting an analog signal into a digital signal, and a digital/analog converter <b>170</b> converting a digital signal into the analog signal.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the down-converter <b>140</b> includes a plurality of decimators <b>210</b>.

There is a need to reduce the delay time of the relay so as to prevent degradation of system performance. However, a decimation filter and an interpolation filter used for down-conversion or up-conversion procedure of the relay are implemented using an FIR filter. In this case, the FIR filter requires relatively many coefficient values for high quality filter characteristics. This usage of many coefficient values causes an excessive processing delay time.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In a typical IIR filter, since an input signal and an output signal are fed back to perform filtering, and accordingly divergence can occur due to a feedback loop, the stability is not secure. Unlike an FIR filter, which has linear phase response characteristics, the IIR filter has non-linear phase response characteristics. Since a wave of an input signal and a wave of an output signal differ from each other in the IIR filter with the non-linear phase response characteristics, the IIR filter has degraded signal quality.</p>

<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In an embodiment of the present invention, in order to minimize a delay time of a relay, a decimator or an interpolator can be configured by a poly-phase structure. In this case, a partial branch filter of the poly-phase structure may be substituted by a frequency convention filter <b>510</b>, which is a combination of the magnitude response unit <b>520</b> and the phase compensation unit <b>530</b>, to minimize the delay time of the relay.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">A method of designing a decimator or an interpolator of a poly-phase structure configured by the frequency conversion filter <b>510</b> is described as follows. When a branch filter of an FIR form is directly converted into an IIR filter, it is difficult to design a rapid variation in a transition section of a magnitude response by an IIR filter. Accordingly, a general FIR filter is converted to a magnitude response IIR filter of the present invention before configuration according to a poly-phase structure. Secondly, a generated impulse response of the IIR filter is obtained. Thirdly, each branch filter of a poly-phase structure is extracted from the obtained impulse response. Fourthly, each branch filter extracted from the impulse response is again converted into the magnitude response IIR filter. Fifthly, in order to obtain a performance similar to a performance of the branch filter of a reference FIR form, a phase compensation IIR filter is added to a next unit of the magnitude response IIR filter generated in each branch filter to compensate for a non-linear phase response. Sixthly, the fifth operation is applied to remaining branch filters to complete a poly-phase structure.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">When the poly-phase structure that has a branch filter of an IIR structure generated in the foregoing method also has the same delay time, the poly-phase structure may have better signal quality than a case where a general FIR filter is converted into an IIR filter form. That is, when the poly-phase structure that has a branch filter of an IIR structure generated in the foregoing method also has the same signal quality, the poly-phase structure also has a shorter time delay.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In the meantime, when each branch filter of a poly-phase structure is converted into an IIR structure, a phase response of each branch filter is not completely restored, and total poly-phase filter magnitude response may have a spectrum peak in a rejection band of a total poly-phase filter magnitude response. As described above, so as to eliminate a spectrum peak occurring in a rejection band of an up-conversion part, a low pass filter h<sub>LPF</sub>(k) is designed to be added to the up-conversion part. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a view illustrating a structure of a poly-phase filter including a low pass filter <b>1210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a view illustrating an up-down conversion unit of a specific relay system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> includes a down conversion unit <b>1210</b> which frequency shifts an input signal of an IF band to a base band, and then, decreases a sampling rate through two decimators, and an up conversion unit <b>1240</b> which increases a sampling rate through two interpolators <b>1220</b>, <b>1230</b> and frequency shifts a signal of the base band to the IF band.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is completed based on the description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>11</b>. In case the branch filters having an up poly-phase structure are converted into IIR filter, the low pass filter existing in interpolator #1 of the up converter unit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> can be used to eliminate a spectrum peak in a rejection band of whole poly-phase filter magnitude response which is generated as the phase response of each branch filter is not completely restored.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In the poly-phase filter including a low pass filter <b>1210</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, since a spectrum peak occurs in a constant frequency of a rejection band, a phase response of each branch filter can be completely restored.</p>
