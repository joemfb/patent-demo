The positioning portion <b>141</b> includes a positioning head <b>1411</b> and a screw post <b>1413</b> connected to the positioning head <b>1411</b>. A second plastic gasket <b>145</b> is attached to the positioning head <b>1411</b>. A screw hole <b>1431</b>, corresponding to the screw post <b>1413</b>, is defined in the nut <b>143</b>. In one embodiment, the positioning head <b>1411</b> is round, and the second plastic gasket <b>145</b> is a rectangle. An area of the second plastic gasket <b>145</b> is greater than an area of the positioning head <b>1411</b>, and the positioning head <b>1411</b> can be covered by the second plastic gasket <b>145</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The sliding member <b>15</b> includes a sliding portion <b>151</b> and a clipping portion <b>153</b>, such as a hook, extending from an outer surface of the sliding portion <b>151</b>. A receiving hole <b>1511</b> is defined in the sliding portion <b>151</b>. In one embodiment, the sliding portion <b>151</b> is a cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Each of the three mounting members <b>16</b> defines a mounting hole <b>161</b>, corresponding to the screw pole <b>114</b>. The tension meter <b>20</b> includes a hook <b>21</b> can be engaged with the clipping portion <b>153</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in assembly, the screw pole <b>114</b> extends through the first through hole <b>121</b> to secure the first clipping panel <b>12</b> to the screw pole <b>114</b>. The first clipping panel <b>12</b> is moved towards the head <b>112</b> until the first clipping panel <b>12</b> is attached to the head <b>112</b>. One of the three mounting members <b>16</b> is engaged with the screw pole <b>114</b> and attached to the first clipping panel <b>12</b>, for preventing the first clipping panel <b>12</b> from moving. The screw pole <b>114</b> extends through the receiving hole <b>1511</b>, and the sliding portion <b>151</b> is moveably secured to the screw pole <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The second clipping panel <b>13</b> is secured to the screw pole <b>114</b> by two of the three mounting members <b>16</b>. At this point, the sliding member <b>15</b> is located between the first clipping panel <b>12</b> and the second clipping panel <b>13</b>. The screw post <b>1413</b> extends through the positioning hole <b>133</b>, and the nut <b>143</b> is engaged with the screw post <b>1413</b>, to secure the positioning member <b>14</b> to the second clipping panel <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In use, the two of the three mounting members <b>16</b> are detached from the second clipping panel <b>13</b>. The first plastic gasket <b>123</b> is attached to the first side panel <b>12</b>. One of the three mounting members <b>16</b> is engaged with the screw pole <b>114</b>, and the second clipping panel <b>13</b> is engaged with the screw pole <b>114</b>. The second clipping panel <b>13</b> is moved towards the second side panel <b>32</b>, until the second plastic gasket <b>145</b> is attached to the second side panel <b>32</b>. The other mounting member <b>16</b> is attached to the second side panel <b>32</b> and engaged with the screw pole <b>114</b>, for preventing the second clipping panel <b>13</b> from moving away from the second side panel <b>32</b>. Therefore, the first clipping panel <b>12</b> and the second clipping panel <b>13</b> can sandwich the electronic device <b>30</b> therebetween. The sliding member <b>15</b> is slid until a distance between the sliding portion <b>151</b> and the first clipping panel <b>12</b> is equal to a distance between the sliding portion <b>151</b> and the second clipping panel <b>13</b>. The hook <b>21</b> is engaged with the clipping portion <b>153</b>. The tension meter <b>20</b> is moved in a direction substantially perpendicular to the screw pole <b>114</b>, and the electronic device <b>30</b> is moved relative to a testing desk. Therefore, a vibration absorbing plastic gasket (not shown) attached to a bottom surface of the electronic device <b>30</b>, can be tested.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an embodiment, a first coefficient of friction between a plastic and a wood is 0.6, and a second coefficient of friction between the plastic and a steel is 0.45. A weight of the electronic device <b>30</b> is about 20 kg, and the first coefficient of friction, between a plastic vibration absorbing plastic gasket and the wood testing desk, is 0.6. Thus, a tension F&#x2267;Nu=20&#xd7;9.8&#xd7;0.6N=117.6N, and the tension can move the electronic device <b>30</b>. The second coefficient of friction, between the first plastic gasket <b>123</b> and the first side plate <b>31</b>, and the second plastic gasket <b>145</b> and the second side plate <b>32</b> , is 0.45, so a pressure f&#x2267;F/2u=117.6N/(2&#xd7;0.45)=130.7N. Therefore, the pressure f is greater than the tension F, and the first clipping panel <b>12</b> cannot be disengaged from the first side plate <b>31</b>, and the second clipping panel <b>13</b> cannot be disengaged from the second side plates <b>32</b> when the electronic device <b>30</b> is pulled.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In disassembly, the nut <b>143</b> is disengaged from the second clipping panel <b>13</b>. The second clipping panel <b>13</b> is removed from the second side plate <b>32</b>, and the electronic device <b>30</b> can be detached from the securing member assembly <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">It is to be understood, however, that even though numerous characteristics and advantages have been set forth in the foregoing description of embodiments, together with details of the structures and functions of the embodiments, the disclosure is illustrative only and changes may be made in detail, especially in matters of shape, size, and arrangement of parts within the principles of the disclosure to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed.</p>
