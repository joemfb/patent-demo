<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A switching power-supply apparatus and a switching power supply circuit in which a feedback signal is input from a feedback circuit to a feedback terminal of a switching control IC includes a capacitor and a Zener diode connected between the feedback terminal and a ground terminal. The Zener diode is a selectively connected external circuit. A voltage of the feedback terminal during an overcurrent operation changes depending on whether or not the external circuit is present. A return/latch determination circuit detects the voltage of the feedback terminal to switch between an automatic return system and a latch system in an overcurrent operation state.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a switching control circuit integrated into an IC (integrated circuit), and also relates to a switching power-supply apparatus including the switching control circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typically, a switching control IC in a switching power-supply apparatus includes a circuit arranged to provide various functions for, for example, output control, startup operation, overcurrent protection operation, overvoltage protection operation, standby operation, and power-factor correction operation. The number of functions is increased to improve the functions of the switching control ICs.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to set the functions of a switching control IC so that they correspond to operation specifications of an application, multiple terminals arranged to interface with external circuits are required for the respective functions. Thus, when the number of functions increases, the number of terminals increases accordingly. An increase in the number of terminals results in an increased package size of the switching control IC, which leads to an increase in the unit price of the IC.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand, a switching control IC having a reduced number of terminals is required in order to meet demands for miniaturization of a switching control IC and reduction of the mounting dimension thereof. Sixteen pins are often provided as the terminals for typical switching control ICs and eight pins are often provided for small-sized switching control ICs. Four pins are also provided for further miniaturized switching control ICs.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When the number of terminals for a switching control IC is limited, the number of functions that can be provided are also limited. Thus, it is necessary to produce a wide range of variants of ICs in accordance with the functions and to selectively use the ICs depending on the specifications and the applications. In this case, there are problems in that the number of variants of the ICs increases, not only the manufacturing process but also the IC management becomes complicated, and consequently the unit price of the ICs increases.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is inevitable that the size of the IC will increase as the required functionality increases. However, recently, even for small-sized switching control circuits, the number of required functions has been increasing. Under the current situation, mass production of a small number of variants is effective in order to reduce the unit price of semiconductors, such as ICs. In addition, a small-sized IC package that includes a smaller number of terminals can also reduce the unit price of the IC.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2007-73954 discloses a technology for a switching control IC directed at reducing the number of terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a circuit diagram of a switching power-supply apparatus disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2007-73954. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a switching power-supply apparatus <b>101</b> includes a transformer <b>105</b> including a primary winding <b>127</b> and a secondary winding <b>129</b>, a rectifying/smoothing circuit including a diode <b>117</b> and a capacitor <b>119</b>, a feedback circuit including a Zener diode <b>121</b>, a photocoupler <b>113</b>, and a resistor <b>123</b>, and an integrated circuit <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The integrated circuit <b>103</b> is connected to the primary winding <b>127</b>. The integrated circuit <b>103</b> is a switching regulator including an internal switch coupled between a drain (D) terminal and a source (S) terminal of the integrated circuit <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">During operation, the internal switch in the integrated circuit <b>103</b> adjusts energy transmission from an input <b>107</b> to an output <b>109</b> through the transformer <b>105</b>. A feedback signal is input from the feedback circuit to the integrated circuit <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A multifunction capacitor <b>111</b> is connected to a bypass terminal BP of the integrated circuit <b>103</b>. The multifunction capacitor <b>111</b> is arranged to provide a power-supply decoupling function for the integrated circuit <b>103</b> during normal operation. The internal circuit of the integrated circuit <b>103</b> receives power or bias current from the multifunction capacitor <b>111</b> to operate during normal operation while adjusting the output <b>109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The multifunction capacitor <b>111</b> is arranged to select a parameter/mode of the integrated circuit <b>103</b> during an initialization period of the integrated circuit <b>103</b>. During the initialization period, the parameter/mode of the integrated circuit <b>103</b> is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the switching power-supply apparatus disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2007-73954, a terminal arranged to provide a necessary function is used to determine the setting of another function during an initialization period. Thus, the capacitance of the multifunctional capacitor is set so that the parameter/mode of the integrated circuit <b>103</b> is selected in accordance with a difference in the rate of an increase in the charging voltage during the initialization period.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">With such a configuration in which the setting of the parameter/mode of the switching control IC is determined during the initialization period, the number selectable functions is relatively small. In addition, since only the capacitor is used to set the parameter/mode, the selection function is severely restricted.</p>

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Preferred Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a circuit diagram of a PFC (power-factor corrected) converter <b>301</b> according to a first preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The PFC converter <b>301</b> is one example of a switching control device according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention and includes a switching control integrated circuit (IC) <b>201</b> corresponding to the switching control circuit of a preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The PFC converter <b>301</b> includes input terminals P<b>11</b> and P<b>12</b> and output terminals P<b>21</b> and P<b>22</b>. An alternating-current (AC) input power supply Vac, which is commercial AC power supply, is preferably input to the input terminals P<b>11</b> and P<b>12</b> and a load circuit is connected to the output terminals P<b>21</b> and P<b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Examples of the load circuit include a DC-DC converter or a circuit of electronic equipment that receives a power supply through a DC-DC converter.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">An input stage of the PFC converter <b>301</b> includes a diode bridge B<b>1</b>, which functions as a rectifier circuit to rectify full waves of the AC voltage of the AC input power supply Vac. A series circuit including an inductor L<b>1</b>, a switching element Q<b>1</b>, and a current detection resistor R<b>1</b> is preferably connected to output ends of the diode bridge B<b>1</b>. A rectifying/smoothing circuit including a diode D<b>1</b> and a smoothing capacitor C<b>1</b> is preferably connected in parallel with two opposite ends of the switching element Q<b>1</b>. The inductor L<b>1</b>, the switching element Q<b>1</b>, the diode D<b>1</b>, and the smoothing capacitor C<b>1</b> define a step-up chopper circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The switching control IC <b>201</b> preferably includes a power-supply terminal VCC, a ground terminal GND, an output terminal OUT of a switching control signal, an input-voltage detection terminal Vdet, a feedback terminal FB, and a current detection terminal IS.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">A noise elimination and voltage stabilization capacitor C<b>2</b> is preferably connected between the power-supply terminal VCC and the ground terminal GND of the switching control IC <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">An input-voltage detection circuit including resistors R<b>2</b> and R<b>3</b> is preferably provided between two opposite output ends of the diode bridge B<b>1</b>. A voltage output from the input-voltage detection circuit is preferably input to the input-voltage detection terminal Vdet of the switching control IC <b>201</b>. An output-voltage detection circuit including resistors R<b>4</b> and R<b>5</b> is preferably provided between the output terminals P<b>21</b> and P<b>22</b>. A voltage output from the output-voltage detection circuit is preferably input to the feedback terminal FB of the switching control IC <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">A resistor R<b>6</b> is preferably connected between a gate of the switching element Q<b>1</b> and the output terminal OUT of the switching control IC <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The switching control IC <b>201</b> includes a drive-signal generating circuit <b>21</b>. Based on the signal input to the input-voltage detection terminal Vdet, the drive-signal generating circuit <b>21</b> detects an instantaneous voltage of the AC input power source. Based on the signal input to the feedback terminal FB, the drive-signal generating circuit <b>21</b> also detects an output voltage. In addition, the drive-signal generating circuit <b>21</b> turns on/off the switching element Q<b>1</b> at a predetermined switching frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an example of a specific circuit diagram of the drive-signal generating circuit <b>21</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a capacitor Cd and a resistor Rd smooth a voltage of the input-voltage detection terminal Vdet. Comparators CMP<b>1</b> and CMP<b>2</b> compare a voltage of the capacitor Cd with corresponding reference voltages Vr<b>1</b> and Vr<b>2</b> and output a high-level or a low-level signal in accordance with the high-and-low relationships. An operational amplifier OP<b>1</b> and resistors R<b>11</b>, R<b>12</b>, and Ro define a summing circuit. A voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) preferably generates a substantially triangular wave signal, for example, having a frequency corresponding to the voltage output from the summing circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">An error amplifier EA<b>1</b> preferably generates an error voltage signal indicating an error between a proportional value of a voltage output from the PFC converter and a reference voltage Vr. A multiplier MU multiplies the error voltage signal and a rectification voltage obtained from the diode bridge B<b>1</b>. The diode Dd prevents reverse flow from the capacitor Cd to the multiplier MU. An error amplifier EA<b>2</b> preferably generates an error between the result of the multiplication performed by the multiplier MU and a current signal flowing in the diode bridge B<b>1</b> and outputs the generated error to a PWM (pulse-width modulation) comparator CMP<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The substantially triangular wave signal output from the VCO is input to a negative (&#x2212;) terminal of the PWM comparator CMP<b>3</b> and the signal output from the error amplifier EA<b>2</b> is input to a positive (+) terminal of the PWM comparator CMP<b>3</b>. Thus, the PWM comparator CMP<b>3</b> applies a duty pulse corresponding to the current flowing in the diode bridge B<b>1</b> and the output voltage to the switching element Q<b>1</b>. The duty pulse is a pulse-width control signal that is sequentially compensated for at regular intervals in response to variations in the AC power-supply voltage and the DC load voltage. With this arrangement, the average value of current of the inductor L<b>1</b> is controlled so as to have a form that is similar to the full-wave-rectified waveform of the input voltage, thereby causing the switching control device to operate as a PFC converter.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In the first preferred embodiment, the input-voltage detection terminal Vdet of the switching control IC <b>201</b> is preferably defined by a multifunctional external terminal according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Since a control voltage for the VCO changes in a stepwise manner according to the voltage of the input-voltage detection terminal Vdet, the frequency of the substantially triangular wave signal is switched according to the voltage of the input-voltage detection terminal Vdet.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a graph showing a relationship between the waveform of the signal input to the input-voltage detection terminal Vdet and an oscillation frequency of the VCO. When a charging voltage of the capacitor Cd does not exceed Vr<b>1</b>, the oscillation frequency of the VCO is preferably about 60 kHz, for example. When the charging voltage of the capacitor Cd exceeds Vr<b>1</b> and does not exceed Vr<b>2</b>, the oscillation frequency of the VCO is preferably about 70 kHz, for example. When the charging voltage of the capacitor Cd exceeds Vr<b>2</b>, the oscillation voltage of the VCO is preferably about 80 kHz, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In order to satisfy such a relationship, the reference voltages Vr<b>1</b> and Vr<b>2</b> for the comparators CMP<b>1</b> and CMP<b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are predetermined and the values of the resistors R<b>11</b>, R<b>12</b>, and Ro of the summing circuit are predetermined.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The voltage input to the input-voltage detection terminal Vdet changes according to the resistance division ratio of the input-voltage detection circuit that is connected to the input-voltage detection terminal Vdet and that includes the resistors R<b>2</b> and R<b>3</b>. Thus, selection of the value of the resistor R<b>2</b> or R<b>3</b> connected to the input-voltage detection terminal Vdet makes it possible to select a switching frequency. That is, the input-voltage detection terminal Vdet preferably functions as both a terminal arranged to input an input voltage waveform to the PFC converter and a terminal arranged to set the switching frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The configuration described above is also applicable to a switching control IC including a terminal Idet arranged to detect an inductor current. That is, the original function of the inductor-current detection terminal Idet is to input a voltage signal from a circuit to detect an inductor current and to control an ON time of the switching element in accordance with a comparison between the average value of the input voltage signal and a reference voltage (i.e., a value corresponding to an average inductor current). For example, the switching frequency may preferably be switched depending on whether or not the value of the voltage signal input to the inductor-current detection terminal Idet exceeds a predetermined threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Instead of the switching of the switching frequency, a threshold at which the operation is in one of an overcurrent protection operation state, an overload protection operation state, and an overvoltage protection operation state in response to a peak value of the voltage input to the terminal may preferably be specified, for example. In addition, a threshold at which the operation is changed from a normal operation to the protection operation and a threshold at which the operation is changed from the protection operation to the normal operation may also preferably be specified, for example.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Second Preferred Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a circuit diagram of a DC-DC converter <b>302</b> according to a second preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The DC-DC converter <b>302</b> is one example of the switching control device according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention and includes a switching control IC <b>202</b> corresponding to the switching control circuit according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">A voltage of the DC input power supply Vi is input between an input terminal PI(+) and an input terminal PI(G) of the DC-DC converter <b>302</b>. A load is connected between an output terminal PO(+) and an output terminal PO(G) of the DC-DC converter <b>302</b>. A predetermined DC voltage is output to the load.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">A first series circuit including a capacitor Cr, an inductor Lr, a primary winding np of a transformer T, a first switching element Q<b>1</b>, and a current-detection resistor R<b>7</b> that are connected in series is preferably provided between the input terminal PI(+) and the input terminal PI(G). The first switching element Q<b>1</b> preferably includes an FET (field-effect transistor). Preferably, a drain terminal of the first switching element Q<b>1</b> is connected to the primary winding np of the transformer T and a source terminal of the first switching element Q<b>1</b> is connected to the current-detection resistor R<b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">A second series circuit including a second switching element Q<b>2</b>, the capacitor Cr, and the inductor Lr that are connected in series is preferably connected to two opposite ends of the primary winding np of the transformer T.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Secondary windings ns<b>1</b> and ns<b>2</b> of the transformer T are preferably provided with a first rectifying/smoothing circuit including diodes Ds and Df and a capacitor Co. The first rectifying/smoothing circuit preferably rectifies full waves of an AC voltage output from the secondary windings ns<b>1</b> and ns<b>2</b>, smoothes the resulting voltages, and outputs the smoothed voltages to the output terminals PO(+) and the PO(G).</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">A rectifying/smoothing circuit including a diode D<b>3</b> and a capacitor C<b>3</b> is preferably connected to a drive winding nb of the transformer T. This rectifying/smoothing circuit preferably provides a DC voltage, which is supplied between a GND terminal and a VCC terminal of the switching control IC <b>202</b>, as a power-supply voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">A substantially rectangular wave signal, for example, is preferably output to a drive circuit <b>11</b> from an OUT terminal of the switching control IC <b>202</b>. The drive circuit <b>11</b> preferably performs control so that the first switching element Q<b>1</b> and the second switching element Q<b>2</b> are alternately turned on and off. A dead-time period is preferably provided so as to prevent the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> from being simultaneously turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The switching control IC <b>202</b> has a current detection terminal IS to which a resistor R<b>8</b> is connected so that a dropped voltage of the current-detection resistor R<b>7</b> is input to the current detection terminal IS.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">A feedback circuit <b>12</b> is preferably provided between the output terminals PO(+) and PO(G) and the switching control IC <b>202</b>. The feedback circuit <b>12</b> preferably functions as a circuit that generates a feedback signal by comparing a voltage division value of a voltage between the output terminals PO(+) and the PO(G) with a reference voltage and that inputs a feedback voltage to a feedback terminal FB of the switching control IC <b>202</b> in an insulated state.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">A capacitor C<b>4</b> and a Zener diode D<b>4</b> are preferably connected between the feedback terminal FB and the ground terminal GND. The Zener diode D<b>4</b> is a selectively connected external circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a circuit diagram of the feedback circuit <b>12</b>. A series circuit including a shunt regulator SR, a resistor Rs, and a light-emitting element including a photocoupler PC and a voltage dividing circuit including resistors Ro<b>1</b> and Ro<b>2</b> are preferably connected between the output terminal PO(+) and the output terminal PO(G). A light receiving element including a photocoupler PC is preferably connected between the feedback terminal FB and the ground terminal GND of the switching control IC <b>202</b>. Inside the switching control IC <b>202</b>, a constant-current circuit is preferably connected to the feedback terminal FB.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The feedback circuit <b>12</b> operates such that the voltage at the feedback terminal FB decreases as the voltage output to the output terminals PO(+) and PO(G) is increased to greater than a preset voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> are diagrams of waveforms at the output terminal OUT and the feedback terminal FB of the switching control IC. The internal configuration and the operation of the switching control IC <b>202</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 to 7B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">A drive-signal generating circuit <b>22</b> turns on/off the first switching element Q<b>1</b> and the second switching element Q<b>2</b> via the drive circuit <b>11</b> at a predetermined switching frequency. Thus, the DC-DC converter <b>302</b> operates as a current resonant converter.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">During normal operation, which is not an overcurrent operation, the voltage fed back from the feedback circuit <b>12</b> does not exceed a Zener voltage of the Zener diode D<b>4</b>. Thus, during the normal operation, the drive-signal generating circuit <b>22</b> detects an output voltage based on the signal input to the feedback terminal FB and controls the frequency of the substantially rectangular wave signal to be output to the output terminal OUT so that the detected output voltage becomes constant or substantially constant. As a result of the control, the output voltage of the DC-DC converter <b>302</b> is stabilized.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">When the voltage of the feedback terminal FB exceeds about 3.3 V for more than about 800 ms, for example, an overcurrent detection circuit <b>23</b> determines that the operation is in an overcurrent operation state (overload state). After the period of about 800 ms, for example, passes, a delay circuit <b>24</b> turns on a switch SW in the switching control IC <b>202</b> to cause the feedback terminal FB to become about 0 V, for example. Consequently, the drive-signal generating circuit <b>22</b> stops the switching of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Thereafter, when about 3200 ms, for example, passes, the delay circuit <b>24</b> turns off the switch SW to release the voltage of the feedback terminal FB from the about 0 V clamp. A constant-current circuit <b>25</b> is preferably connected to the feedback terminal FB via a resistor Rc. Thus, if the Zener diode D<b>4</b> is not connected to the feedback terminal FB, the external capacitor C<b>4</b> increases to about 5.3 V, for example, which is the voltage at the power-supply voltage terminal VCC, and the voltage of the feedback terminal FB exceeds about 5 V, for example. On the other hand, for example, when the Zener diode D<b>4</b> connected to the feedback terminal FB has a Zener voltage of about 3.9 V, the voltage at the feedback terminal FB does not exceed the Zener voltage of about 3.9 V.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">A return/latch determination circuit <b>26</b> detects a voltage at the feedback terminal FB when about 50 &#x3bc;s, for example, passes after the switch SW is turned off. When the detected voltage is greater than about 5 V, for example, the return/latch determination circuit <b>26</b> stops the drive-signal generating circuit <b>22</b>. That is, the return/latch determination circuit <b>26</b> latches the switching operation while stopping it. On the other hand, when the detected voltage is less than about 5 V, for example, the drive-signal generating circuit <b>22</b> operates and the operation automatically returns to the switching operation state.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">As a result of the operation described above, when the Zener diode D<b>4</b> is not connected to the feedback terminal FB, the operation enters a latch operation mode, and when the Zener diode D<b>4</b> is connected to the feedback terminal FB, the operation enters an automatic return operation mode.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">For example, the automatic return system and the latch system can be switched by detecting the voltage of the feedback terminal FB and performing setting so as to accomplish an operation as described below:</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">About 0.4 V to about 3.3 V: Range of Control Operation using Feedback Voltage</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">About 3.3 V or greater: Range of Overcurrent Protection Operation (Automatic Return (Hiccup) System)</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">About 5.0 V or greater: Range of Overcurrent Protection Operation (Latch System).</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Thus, there is no need to provide a switching control IC based on two systems, i.e., the latch system and the automatic feedback system, as the overcurrent protection functions of the DC-DC converter <b>302</b>. Consequently, the amount of inventory is reduced, the standardization of the components is improved, and the cost is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In addition, since there is no need to provide a dedicated IC terminal for switching between the latch system and the automatic return system, the size of the IC can be reduced. Effective use of the terminals of the IC makes it possible to improve the function of the IC.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The latch system and the automatic return system can be switched by merely connecting the Zener diode to the terminal of the IC as a peripheral circuit. Thus, the normal operation of the IC is not adversely affected.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In addition, combining the functions associated with the terminals of the IC makes it possible to hide the functions and also to prevent counterfeiting of the IC.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a diagram showing an example of another external circuit connected to outside of the feedback terminal FB. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an external circuit including an operational amplifier OP<b>1</b>, a reference-voltage generating circuit Vr, a resistor R<b>13</b>, a capacitor C<b>13</b>, and a transistor Q<b>3</b> is preferably connected to the feedback terminal FB. The operational amplifier OP<b>1</b>, the reference-voltage generating circuit Vr, and the transistor Q<b>3</b> preferably operate as a constant-voltage circuit. The resistor R<b>13</b> and the capacitor C<b>13</b> preferably function as a filter circuit arranged to prevent malfunction due to noise components superimposed on the voltage of the feedback terminal FB.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">As described above, the external circuit may preferably include active elements, such as an operational amplifier and a transistor, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The configuration described above is applicable not only to an overcurrent operation, but also to an operation in switching between the automatic return system and the latch system is selected in an overvoltage state.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Third Preferred Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a block diagram showing an internal configuration of a switching control IC <b>200</b> included in a DC-DC converter according to a third preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, when the standby mode is on, a maximum-blanking-frequency setting circuit <b>230</b> preferably sets a maximum blanking frequency in accordance with a voltage of a feedback terminal FB (a hidden function of ON/OFF of the standby mode is accomplished at a ZT terminal described below). The maximum-blanking-frequency setting circuit <b>230</b> also reads the voltage of the feedback terminal FB when the converter is started. Now, a description will be given of a case in which the read voltage value is less than or equal to a predetermined value.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Based on the voltage at the ZT terminal, a ZT-voltage detection circuit <b>226</b> detects that the voltage across the drive winding nb of the transformer T is reversed and issues a trigger to a one-shot circuit <b>240</b>. The maximum-blanking-frequency setting circuit <b>230</b> preferably changes the output thereof to a low level to thereby cause an output of an AND gate <b>231</b> to become a low level, so that a blanking time during which a low level at an OUT terminal is maintained is determined. Consequently, the switching frequency is determined.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">When the voltage of the feedback terminal FB exceeds about 1 V, for example, the upper-limit frequency is, for example, about 250 kHz and a switching frequency that is less than or equal to the upper-limit frequency is determined in accordance with the voltage of the feedback terminal FB. When the voltage of the feedback terminal FB is about 1 V or less, for example, the switching frequency is set to less than or equal to about 250 kHz, for example, which is the upper-limit frequency, in accordance with the blanking time. In the present preferred embodiment, for example, the switching frequency is about 1 kHz, for example, when the voltage of the feedback terminal FB is about 0.4 V.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">When the voltage of the feedback terminal FB is about 1 V or less, the maximum-blanking-frequency setting circuit <b>230</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> performs setting so that the blanking frequency determined according to the blanking time changes linearly from about 250 kHz to about 1 kHz with respect to a change in the voltage of the feedback terminal FB from about 1 V to about 0.4 V, for example. Thus, the amount of load decreases and the switching frequency decrease as the voltage of the feedback terminal FB decreases, so that the operation enters a standby mode in which the switching frequency is reduced. This arrangement helps to reduce loss at low load.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">On the other hand, when the value of the voltage of the feedback terminal FB, the value being read by the maximum-blanking-frequency setting circuit <b>230</b> during the startup of the converter, is less than or equal to a predetermined voltage value, an operation as described below is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">When the voltage of the feedback terminal FB is about 1 V or less, for example, the maximum-blanking-frequency setting circuit <b>230</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> performs setting so that the ratio of an oscillation period changes linearly from 1 to 0 with respect to a change in the voltage of the feedback terminal FB from about 1 V to about 0.4 V, by changing the ratio of the oscillation period in which the oscillation continues to a stop period in which the switching operation stops. Thus, as the amount of load decreases to reduce the voltage of the feedback terminal FB, the rate of the oscillation period decreases, so that the operation enters an intermittent-oscillation standby mode. This arrangement helps to reduce loss at low load.</p>

<p id="p-0135" num="0134">A voltage of DC input power supply Vi is input between an input terminal PI(+) and an input terminal PI(G) of the DC-DC converter <b>304</b>. A load is connected between an output terminal PO(+) and an output terminal PO(G) of the DC-DC converter <b>304</b>. A predetermined DC voltage is output to the load.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Differences between the third preferred embodiment and the second preferred embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are the configuration of the switching control IC <b>200</b> and a structure in which an external circuit including a resistor Rss and a capacitor Css is connected between a soft start terminal SS and ground GND.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the original function of the soft start terminal SS of the switching control IC <b>200</b> is to cause a soft start operation. The term &#x201c;soft start&#x201d; refers to control to gradually increase the ON duration of an output pulse to drive switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> during startup of the converter. The speed of the soft start is set according to the time constant of the external circuit connected to the soft start terminal SS. More specifically, a constant-current circuit is connected to the soft start terminal SS and a charging time constant for the external capacitor Css for the soft start terminal SS is specified according to the capacitance of the capacitor Css.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">The internal configuration of the switching control IC <b>200</b> is substantially the same as the internal configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the one-shot circuit <b>240</b> preferably sets a flip-flop <b>213</b>, so that a Q output signal of the flip-flop <b>213</b> is output to an AND gate <b>214</b> and is then output to the OUT terminal via a drive <b>215</b> as a high-level gate control voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">A CT generator circuit <b>241</b> preferably outputs a lamp waveform voltage after the output of the AND gate <b>214</b> becomes a high level. When the voltage output from the CT generator circuit <b>241</b> exceeds a lowest one of voltages input to three negative (&#x2212;) terminals of a comparator <b>212</b>, the comparator <b>212</b> resets the flip-flop <b>213</b>. As a result of the resetting, the voltage of the OUT terminal is returned to the low level.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The above-described operation is preferably repeated to change the waveform of the voltage output from the OUT terminal to a substantially rectangular waveform, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">A constant-current circuit CCC<b>1</b> is preferably connected to the soft start terminal SS. Since the capacitor Css is connected to the soft start terminal SS, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the voltage at the soft start terminal SS preferably becomes equal or substantially equal to the charging voltage of the capacitor Css. As the voltage of the soft start terminal SS increases, the timing at which the output of the comparator <b>212</b> is reversed is delayed and the ON time of the switching element increases gradually. With this arrangement, the soft start operation is started.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, when the resistor Rss is externally connected to the soft start terminal SS, the voltage at the soft start terminal SS is determined according to the resistance value of the resistor Rss when the capacitor Css is fully charged.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">During the soft start period, the voltage output from a resistance dividing circuit <b>216</b> is the lowest among voltages input to the three negative (&#x2212;) terminals of the comparator <b>212</b>. Thus, the soft start operation is performed as described above. When the soft start operation is completed, the voltage output from a resistance dividing circuit <b>224</b> becomes the lowest among the voltages input to the three negative (&#x2212;) terminals of the comparator <b>212</b>. Thus, the ON time of the switching element is determined according to a voltage applied to a feedback terminal FB. When the voltage of the feedback terminal FB exceeds the voltage applied to the SS terminal and determined according to the resistance value of the external resistor Rss (i.e., exceeds the voltage of about 3.3 V or less at a resistance dividing circuit <b>225</b>), the voltage applied to the SS terminal becomes the lowest among the voltages input to the three negative (&#x2212;) terminals of the comparator <b>212</b>, rather than the output voltage of the resistance dividing circuit <b>225</b>. Thus, control is performed so that the ON time does not further increase, and a maximum ON time or a maximum duty ratio is set.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">For example, when a threshold is about 4 V and the voltage at the soft start terminal SS exceeds about 4 V, a first overcurrent protection selection circuit <b>217</b> activates an AND gate <b>218</b> to thereby enable an output of a first overcurrent detection circuit <b>222</b>. When the voltage at an IS terminal exceeds about 0.3 V, for example, the first overcurrent detection circuit <b>222</b> changes the output to a high level to start a timer operation of an overcurrent protection timer <b>219</b>. When the output of the first overcurrent detection circuit <b>222</b> becomes a high level and the high-level state continues for about 50 ms, for example, the overcurrent protection timer <b>219</b> causes a timer latch <b>221</b> to perform latching via an OR gate <b>220</b>. The timer latch <b>221</b> causes the switching of the switching element to stop for about 3.2 s, for example. As a result, first overcurrent protection is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">With this arrangement, a maximum ON time or a maximum duty ratio is preferably set in accordance with the resistance value of the external resistor Rss.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">When the voltage at the IS terminal enters a state of overcurrent greater than about 0.4 V, for example, an output of a second overcurrent detection circuit <b>223</b> becomes a high level to thereby force the switching operation to stop.</p>

<p id="p-0151" num="0150">The polarity detection terminal ZT is used to detect a reversal of the polarity of the voltage of the winding of the transformer T. A signal input from the drive winding nb of the transformer T to the polarity detection terminal ZT is an ON/OFF pulse voltage.

<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The voltage waveform peak value of the pulse voltage input to the polarity detection terminal ZT is preferably set by determining the ratio of the number of turns of the primary winding np of the transformer T to the number of turns of the drive winding nb thereof or by providing a resistance dividing circuit, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the ZT-voltage detection circuit <b>226</b> is connected to the ZT terminal of the switching control IC <b>200</b>. Based on the voltage of the ZT terminal, the ZT-voltage detection circuit <b>226</b> detects a reversal of the voltage across the drive winding nb of the transformer T and issues a trigger to the one-shot circuit <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">A standby-mode selection circuit <b>227</b> is preferably connected to the ZT terminal of the switching control IC <b>200</b>. When the voltage of the ZT terminal is greater than or equal to a threshold (e.g., about 3.3 V), the standby-mode selection circuit <b>227</b> preferably outputs a low-level signal to an AND gate <b>229</b> to thereby stop a signal output from the OUT terminal.

<p id="p-0160" num="0159">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, when the voltage of the IS terminal becomes an overcurrent of about 0.4 V or greater, for example, an output of a second overcurrent detection circuit <b>223</b> becomes a high level to thereby force the switching operation to stop.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">A constant current circuit CCC<b>2</b> and a resistor R<b>228</b> are connected to the IS terminal.

<p id="p-0204" num="0203">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, a signal output from an oscillation circuit <b>512</b> is output from the OUT terminal via an AND gate <b>513</b> and an output driver <b>514</b>. When a comparator <b>511</b> detects that the voltage of the OUT terminal is greater than or equal to a predetermined value, it outputs a control signal to the oscillation circuit <b>512</b> to switch the switching frequency. For example, when the voltage of the OUT terminal is greater than or equal to the predetermined value, the switching frequency is reduced by about 10 kHz as compared to when the voltage of the OUT terminal is less than the predetermined value.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">Accordingly, the arrangement may be configured such that an external circuit is connected to the OUT terminal so that the voltage of the OUT terminal is changed through switching of the external circuit. Thus, the switching of the external circuit enables the switching frequency to be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">Since the voltage of the OUT terminal is determined by a power-supply voltage applied to the output driver <b>514</b>, the arrangement may also be configured such that the power-supply voltage is switched by an external circuit connected to anther terminal. The configuration is not limited to such a configuration in which the switching frequency is selected according to the voltage of the OUT terminal, and the switching frequency may be selected according to a voltage of another terminal. For example, when the switching frequency is selected according to a voltage applied to the power-supply terminal VC, a comparator arranged to detect whether or not the voltage exceeds a predetermined threshold voltage in a voltage range specified by an input voltage specification may preferably be provided to output a control signal to the oscillation circuit <b>512</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">Similarly, the function of selecting the switching frequency can be achieved using an ON/OFF terminal. In addition, the function of selecting the switching frequency can also be achieved using a Valm terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the ON/OFF terminal and the Valm terminal are not illustrated. The ON/OFF terminal includes a function of stopping output of a pulse from the OUT terminal through reduction of the potential at the ON/OFF terminal to a ground level. For example, when the operation of the IC is in an overvoltage state or overcurrent state, the Valm terminal enables an alarm indicating that the operation of the power supply is malfunctioning to be issued by increasing the potential of the Valm terminal to a high level.</p>

<p id="p-0220" num="0219">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, a first function of the VREF terminal is to output a reference voltage to outside. A second function of the VREF terminal is to select between automatic return and a latch operation upon detection of an overcurrent.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">A selection circuit <b>515</b> reads a voltage of the VREF terminal when a startup-time signal is output from a startup circuit <b>517</b>.

When the read voltage is less than or equal to the threshold voltage, the selection circuit <b>515</b> activates an overcurrent latch circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">For example, the operation start voltage of the switching control IC <b>211</b> is about 10 V and the rated voltage thereof is about 15 V.

The VC voltage detection circuit <b>14</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> turns on the transistor Q<b>4</b> when the VC terminal voltage is about 12 V or less, for example. Thus, when the voltage of the VREF terminal is about 12 V or less, the VREF terminal has a GND potential. Since the voltage of the VC terminal immediately after the startup is about 10 V, the VREF terminal has the GND potential and the automatic return mode is selected. When the above-described external circuit is not connected to the VREF terminal, a reference voltage is output to the VREF terminal immediately after the startup of the switching control IC <b>211</b> and thus the latch operation mode is selected.
