<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to the data processing field, and more particularly, relates to a method and circuit for implementing aperture function calibration for Logic Built In Self Test (LBIST) diagnostics, and a design structure on which the subject circuit resides.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">When testing integrated circuits or chips, techniques such as Logic Built In Self Test (LBIST) diagnostics advantageously are used to test memory arrays and logic.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An aperture function can be used to debug LBIST failures on a chip by masking certain bits from contributing to the MISR signature. To do this effectively, the aperture edges must be controlled precisely.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some known LBIST diagnostics arrangements, when the aperture edges are misaligned, it has proven difficult to determine the severity or direction of the misalignment in system. The misaligned aperture edges reduces the confidence in the results and requires additional analysis of latches before and after an identified defective latch in the scan path from the LBIST diagnostics, and can substantially increase the overall LBIST diagnostics or debug time.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A need exists for a circuit having an efficient and effective mechanism for calibrating the aperture function for LBIST.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Principal aspects of the present invention are to provide a method and circuit for implementing aperture function calibration for Logic Built In Self Test (LBIST) diagnostics, and a design structure on which the subject circuit resides. Other important aspects of the present invention are to provide such method, circuit and design structure substantially without negative effects and that overcome many of the disadvantages of prior art arrangements.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In brief, a method and circuits for implementing aperture function calibration for Logic Built In Self Test (LBIST) diagnostics, and a design structure on which the subject circuit resides are provided. The aperture function calibration uses aperture calibration data, and an LBIST calibration channel having a predefined number of scan inversions between the aperture calibration data and a multiple input signature register (MISR). LBIST is run selecting the LBIST calibration channel and masking other LBIST channels to the MISR. A change in the MISR value, for example, from zero to a non-zero value, is identified and an aperture adjustment is calculated and used to identify any needed adjustment of aperture edges.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with features of the invention, a calibration software mode configures a no clocks run for the LBIST run, which selects the LBIST calibration channel and masks other LBIST channels to the MISR, enabling the aperture upper and lower edges to be easily be calibrated in system. The aperture function calibration reduces the amount of debug time related to misaligned edges, reducing the overall LBIST debug time.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Aperture function calibration circuit <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a similar structure to the structure of aperture function calibration circuit <b>200</b>. Aperture function calibration circuit <b>300</b> includes an APTCALDATA <b>302</b>, a two-input AND gate <b>304</b> receiving an input LBIST zero-scan and a second input from a pseudo-random pattern generator (PRPG), such as the PRPG <b>108</b>. The AND gate output is applied to APTCALDATA <b>302</b> and coupled by a plurality of XOR gates <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>310</b>, <b>312</b> to an input of a multiplexer <b>314</b>. The multiplexer <b>314</b> receives a second input from the pseudo-random pattern generator (PRPG), such as the PRPG <b>108</b>. The multiplexer <b>314</b> provides an input to an LBIST calibration channel <b>316</b>. The aperture calibration enable signal APTCALEN applied to multiplexer <b>314</b> is the option bit that inserts the APTCALDATA into the LBIST channel <b>314</b>.</p>

The same APTCALDATA <b>302</b> is inserted to one or more channels. It should be understood that the APTCALEN signal could be altered to a control signal based off the scan cycle count to allow the insertion of the APTCALDATA into any position in the LBIST channel, without requiring modifications to the chip channels.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Aperture function calibration circuit <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is part of the normal LBIST channels, eliminating the multiplexer <b>208</b>, <b>314</b> of respective aperture function calibration circuits <b>200</b>, <b>300</b>. Aperture function calibration circuit <b>400</b> includes APTCALDATA <b>402</b> applied to a section of a LBIST channel <b>404</b> through a pair of XOR gates <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>.

Aperture function calibration circuit <b>400</b> includes a NOT gate <b>410</b> receiving the APTCALEN signal and providing an input to an AND gate <b>412</b>. A different section of the LBIST channel <b>404</b> provides a second input to the AND gate <b>412</b>, which provides an input to the APTCALDATA <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In aperture function calibration circuit <b>400</b>, where APTCALDATA is part of the normal LBIST channels, when APTCALEN is not asserted, the APTCALDATA <b>402</b> latches are not modified during a normal LBIST run. When APTCALEN is asserted, the APTCALDATA is initialized to 0110 on the last zero scan cycle. For the remaining LBIST cycles the APTCALDATA scan input is held to a 0.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It should be understood that in each of the aperture function calibration circuits <b>200</b>, <b>300</b>, and <b>400</b>, the APTCALDATA also can be held to 0s by masking the PRPG data to the calibration channel, eliminating the need for the extra logic at the scan-in.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In accordance with features of the invention, the LBIST control program <b>103</b> configures the LBIST controller <b>102</b> to perform a no clocks run. A channel that has an even number of scan inversions between the APCALDATA and the MISR is selected as the calibration channel, such as LBIST calibration channel <b>112</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, while the rest of the channels feeding the MISR are masked. The MISR is written or defaulted to all 0s.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In accordance with features of the invention, the number of test loops is set to something short such as two cycles. The channel length should be set, for example, to the length of the calibration channel plus 15, effectively moving the APTCALDATA from the end of the channel to the middle of the channel. Over-scanning will not affect the APTCALDATA because the scan-in is held to 0.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In accordance with features of the invention, an Aperture Enable and APTCALEN bits are set with the aperture sense set to positive. A positive aperture sense masks the data between the aperture edges from feeding the MISR. Initially, the upper aperture edge should be set for the length of the calibration channel length plus 15 and the lower edge should be set, for example, to the calibration channel length minus 10.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In accordance with features of the invention, when LBIST is run, the result in the MISR should be zero. The test should be rerun, while incrementing the lower edge until the MISR value is non-zero. A non-zero value indicates the APTCALDATA has been scanned into the MISR without being masked; pin-pointing the lower edge. The adjusted lower edge is the difference between the Lower Edge and (the Calibration Length+1). To align the upper edge, the process should be repeated with decrementing the upper edge. The adjusted upper edge is the difference between the Upper Edge and (the Calibration Length&#x2212;1).</p>

A change in the MISR value, for example, from zero to a non-zero value, is identified and an aperture adjustment is calculated to identify aperture edges.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In accordance with features of the invention, a calibration software mode configures a no clocks run for the LBIST run, which selects the LBIST calibration channel and masks other LBIST channels to the MISR, enabling the aperture upper and lower edges to be easily be calibrated in system.
