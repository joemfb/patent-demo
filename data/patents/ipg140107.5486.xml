<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Advertising is a significant component of marketing efforts used by companies to promote their goods and services. Advertisers spend billions of dollars each year on their advertising campaigns. Generally, a wide variety of advertising techniques and media have historically been used and are currently available to market products and services. For instance, advertising media may include billboards, human billboards, print media (e.g., newspapers, magazines, etc.), radio, and television advertising. Moreover, as technology continues to develop, new advertising opportunities are also continuously being created. For example, the advent of the Internet has given rise to Internet-based advertising, such as web banners.

In other embodiments, advertising usage information may be primarily tracked by the network component, which may access a variety of network-based advertising usage information (e.g., as described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). In further embodiments, the network component may store both advertising usage information received from the wearable advertising display system and network-based advertising usage information. Any and all such variations are contemplated within the scope of embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a flow diagram is illustrated showing an exemplary method <b>800</b> for tracking adverting usage information at a wearable advertising display system for billing advertising services provided by the wearable advertising display system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In the present exemplary embodiment, advertising usage information is tracked by the wearable advertising display system and communicated to a network component (e.g., the advertising server <b>304</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). As shown at block <b>802</b>, the wearable advertising display system tracks advertising usage information. For instance, the wearable advertising display system may track what advertising content was received from, for example, an advertising server. When wearable advertising display system presents advertising content, it may track what advertising content was presented and when the advertising content was presented. In some embodiments, the wearable advertising display system may also determine the location where advertising content was presented (e.g., using a GPS component).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, the wearable advertising display system may also be able to track the presence of onlookers within proximity of the wearable advertising display system while advertising content is being displayed. For instance, the wearable advertising display system may be able to detect the presence of onlooker devices (e.g., an onlooker's mobile phone) within the wireless personal area network of the wearable advertising display system. As another example, the wearable advertising display system may be able to detect the presence of onlookers by incorporating a device, such as a heat sensing device or a motion sensing device, capable of detecting the presence of an onlooker within proximity of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In further embodiments, the wearable advertising display system may also be able to track onlooker interaction with the wearable advertising display system. For instance, the wearable advertising display system may track information regarding onlooker interaction via an input device associated with the wearable advertising display system. Similarly, the wearable advertising display system may track information regarding onlooker interaction via devices associated with onlookers (e.g., an onlooker's mobile phone).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As shown at block <b>804</b>, the wearable advertising display system communicates the advertising usage information to a network component, such as the advertising server <b>304</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, for example. In some embodiments, the wearable advertising display system may communicate advertising usage information to the network component as the information is tracked. In other embodiments, the wearable advertising display system may store advertising usage information as it is tracked and periodically communicate the stored advertising usage information to the network component. In embodiments, the wearable advertising display system and/or network component may associate various pieces of advertising usage information together. For instance, the information regarding when and where particular advertising content was presented may be associated with an identification of that advertising content.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The network component stores the advertising usage information received from the wearable advertising display system, as shown at block <b>806</b>. The stored advertising usage information may be used by the network component or another associated component to determining billing for the advertising services provided by the wearable advertising display systems. In some embodiments of the present invention, this may comprise determining compensation amounts based on the advertising usage information. In other embodiments, this may comprise verifying that a specified advertising service has been provided. For instance, a wearer may be instructed and compensated to present specified advertising content at a specified location, and at a specified time. The tracked advertising usage information may be used to verify that the specified advertising content was presented at the specified location and time.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a flow diagram is provided illustrating a method <b>900</b> for tracking advertising usage information at a network component for billing advertising services provided by a wearable advertising display system. As shown at block <b>902</b>, advertising content is communicated to the wearable advertising display system. For example, an advertising server, such as the advertising server <b>304</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, may select advertising content and communicate the advertising content to the wearable advertising display system.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">A network component, such as the advertising server <b>304</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, receives an acknowledgement from the wearable advertising display system that the advertising content was received and displayed, as shown at block <b>904</b>. The network component may store advertising usage information based on the acknowledgement, including what advertising content was communicated and when the advertising content was communicated to the wearable advertising display system, as shown at block <b>906</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some embodiments, the network component may also track other network-based advertising usage information, as shown at block <b>908</b>. For instance, in an embodiment, the network component may be able to access location information associated with the wearable advertising display system to determine the location of the wearable advertising display system when advertising content was communicated and/or presented. In embodiments, the network component may also be able to determine the presence of onlookers within the vicinity of the wearable advertising display system. The network component may be able to determine the location of the wearable advertising display system and the location of devices associated with onlookers (e.g., onlookers' mobile phones) to determine that onlookers are within proximity of the wearable device display system. The network component may do so, for example, by recognizing the onlooker devices and wearable display system are within the same Wi-Fi zone or by accessing GPS location information for the onlooker devices and wearable display system. In further embodiments, the network component may also be able to track onlooker interaction with the wearable advertising display system.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The advertising usage information tracked by the network component may be used for billing advertising services provided by the wearable advertising system. Similar to that discussed above for the method <b>800</b> and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the advertising usage information may be used to determine compensation for advertising services and/or to verify that specified advertising was provided by the wearable advertising display system.</p>
