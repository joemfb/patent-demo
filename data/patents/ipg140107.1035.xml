<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to packaging, and more particularly to paperboard and plastic composite package structures intended for use in containing and displaying articles at the point of sale.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A wide variety of composite packages are used to contain and display articles at the point of sale. A conventional composite package includes a combination of paperboard and plastic components. There is a variety of types of composite packages in which the paperboard and plastic components are combined in different ways. For example, &#x201c;book-style&#x201d; composite packages are shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,775,512 to Hones and U.S. Pat. No. 4,724,957 to Burgschweiger. A conventional &#x201c;book-style&#x201d; composite package include an inner plastic clam shell that forms a compartment to contain the article(s) to be packaged and an outer paperboard cover that covers the clam shell. The clam shell and paperboard each include an integral &#x201c;spine.&#x201d; The spines are generally coextensive to allow the package to be opened and closed along one edge in a book-like manner. Book-style composite packages provide the benefits of being easily recloseable and relatively stable constructions, but they can be relatively expensive to manufacture. Further, the paperboard spine, which spans the thickness of the package, may be too flexible to provide confident registration between the clam shell portions, particularly after repeated opening and closing.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Another type of composite package is a blister package. Blister packages are used to package a wide range of articles. A conventional blister package includes a plastic component (or blister) having a peripheral flange that is face-sealed to a paperboard card or sandwiched between a pair of paperboard panels. In some cases, the two paperboard panels are a single piece of paperboard folded along an edge. In other cases, they are two separate panels. Various attempts have been made to provide recloseable blister packages. In one type of recloseable blister package, the blister is formed with an integral door. With this construction, the blister remains sealed to the paperboard and a door within the blister is opened. In another type of recloseable blister package, the blister is secured to the paperboard in a way that allow the blister to pivot away from the paperboard. For example, one edge of the blister may be permanently sealed to the paperboard and the other three edges may be joined only by a peelable adhesive. This allows the blister to open while remaining joined to the paperboard. In yet another example, the paperboard panel closing the blister may include a door, such as a perforated region that can be opened to gain access to the interior of the blister.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although existing composite packages are suitable for many applications, there remains a desire for a stable and easily reclosable package that is less expensive to manufacture and provides a wide range of packaging options.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides a composite package having a folded paperboard card and two plastic components shaped to interfit with one another when the package is closed. The plastic components define a space for containing one or more articles. The folded paperboard card may be a dual-panel card with two panels joined to one another along a fold line or other hinge. Each paperboard panel may include an opening to seat a plastic component. The openings are configured to bring the two plastic components into registration when the panels are folded together along the hinge.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one embodiment, the plastic components are configured to releasably interlock with one another when the package is closed. One of the two plastic components may include a shoulder that is configured to be snap-fitted into the opening of the other plastic component. The opening may include a shelf shaped to closely receive the shoulder and provide a stop against which the shoulder abuts when the package is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment, the shoulder and opening include interfitting contours that provide a snap-fit. The configuration of the snap-fitting features may be set to provide the desired resistance to opening and closing.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment, each of the plastic components includes a peripheral flange sealed to the corresponding panel. The flanges may be sealed to the inside surfaces of the panels so that the flanges are hidden from view when the package is closed. The flanges may be joined to one another along an integral hinge seated in the interior of the paperboard fold line.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention provides an inexpensive and effective recloseable composite package. The use of interfitting plastic components provides a stable package with an extended life. The interfitting plastic components can be designed with contours that provide the desired amount of resistance to opening and closing. Further, the fold line provides substantially more stability than offered by the paperboard &#x201c;spine&#x201d; of book-style composite packages. The present invention may also be used to provide a package with the aesthetically pleasing appearance of a blister package. In those embodiments in which the plastic components are separate from one another, the paperboard hinge does not bind against an underlying plastic hinge and the amount of plastic used to manufacture the package is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">These and other features of the invention will be more fully understood and appreciated by reference to the description of the embodiments and the drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF CURRENT EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A composite package in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref> and generally designated <b>10</b>. The composite package <b>10</b> generally includes a paperboard portion <b>12</b> and a plastic portion <b>14</b>. The paperboard portion <b>12</b> of this embodiment includes two panels <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> that are joined along a fold line <b>20</b>. The plastic portion <b>14</b> of this embodiment includes two plastic components <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> joined via an integral hinge adjacent the fold line <b>20</b>. The plastic components <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are configured to interfit with one another to cooperatively define an article containing space, and each plastic component <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> is interconnected with a different panel <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>. The plastic components <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are positioned in the panels <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> so that they come into engagement with each other when the panels <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> are closed along the fold line <b>20</b>. In use, the composite package <b>10</b> can be opened and closed along the paperboard fold line <b>20</b> to open and close the plastic components and selectively provide access to the contents. Although the present invention is described in connection with a composite package having two plastic components that cooperatively define a single generally rectangular space for holding articles, the configuration may vary from application to application. For example, the number, size, shape and configuration of plastic components may vary from application to application. It should also be noted that the present invention is described in connection with a display package intended primarily for use in holding and displaying articles at the point of sale. For example, the packages may be placed on a store shelf or hung from a display hook in a store where they are visible to consumers. The package is capable of being repeatedly opened and closed, and therefore may be used by consumers as a storage container. For example, the package may contain a supply of articles and the consumer may use the package as a storage container for articles until all of them have been consumed. A consumer may also reuse the package to store other articles. Directional terms, such as top, bottom, up, down, right, left, front, rear, inner and outer are used as expedients to denote directions with respect to the orientation of the composite package and package components in the drawings. The use of these directional terms should not be interpreted to limit the present invention to use in any specific orientation or configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As noted above, the paper board portion <b>12</b> of the illustrated composite package <b>10</b> includes a pair of paperboard panels <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> that are joined along a fold line <b>20</b>. The paperboard portion <b>12</b> of this embodiment is rectangular shape and includes a fold line <b>20</b> that divides the paperboard portion <b>12</b> into two essentially identical rectangular panels <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>. The fold line <b>20</b> may be defined a score line, a partial cut line or a series of perforations, if desired, so that the cover <b>12</b> may be easily folded in a controlled manner when the package <b>10</b> is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the illustrated embodiment, the first panel <b>16</b> defines an opening or cut-out <b>21</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the cut-outs <b>21</b> is configured to receive a raised portion of the first plastic components <b>26</b>. For example, the cut-out <b>21</b> may be sized and shaped to match the contours of the raised plastic pocket <b>26</b>. In alternative embodiments, the cut-out may have another shape. The cut-out <b>21</b> is generally located substantially between the fold line <b>20</b> and the lateral edges of the panel <b>16</b>. The cut-out <b>21</b> is positioned to come into alignment with the plastic component <b>26</b> when the paperboard portion <b>12</b> is folded into the closed position bringing the panels <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> in opposition.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref> and <b>6</b>, the paperboard portion <b>12</b> includes an outer major surface <b>29</b> that may be adapted to receive printed graphics, and an inner major surface <b>30</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) that is capable of receiving a conventional adhesive and may also receive printed graphics. The surfaces <b>29</b> and <b>30</b> may or may not include a coating such as a varnish or other commonly used paperboard coating.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Although the illustrated paperboard portion <b>12</b> is generally rectangular, the paperboard portion <b>12</b> may have essentially any shape that allows two panels to be folded into opposition. The illustrated panels <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> are joined along a fold line <b>20</b>, but may alternatively be joined in other ways. For example, the panels may be separately manufactured and joined together by a material capable of functioning as a hinge, such as a strip of tape or other flexible adhesive material. The illustrated package <b>10</b> includes two panels, but the package may alternatively include more than two panels. For example, the package may include three panels with two panels that fold to cover different regions of the third panel. During manufacture, the paperboard portion <b>12</b> may be manufacture from a paperboard blank that is die cut or otherwise formed from paperboard stock of the desired type and thickness. If the paperboard portion <b>12</b> is formed as a single continuous piece of stock, a score line or perforations may be formed in the blank to facilitate folding along the desire fold line <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The plastic portion <b>14</b> may be constructed from a polymer such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC), Barex&#xae;, copolyester or any other plastic material that can be thermoformed or otherwise shaped to create the desired compartment for containing one or more articles. In the illustrated embodiment, the polymer is substantially transparent, but it may be translucent or opaque in other applications if desired. The unitary plastic portion <b>14</b> includes two plastic components <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, each of which is secured to a different panel <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>, respectively. The front package component <b>26</b> and the rear package component <b>28</b> may be formed from a single sheet of plastic and may be joined by one or more segments of plastic. As perhaps best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the plastic components <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are joined along first and second integral hinges <b>25</b> and <b>27</b>. The integral hinges <b>25</b> and <b>27</b> are of a closed C-type structure nested or seated within the interior of the paperboard fold line <b>20</b>. The plastic components <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are pivotable with respect to each other about the hinges <b>25</b> and <b>27</b> between a first, closed position as show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> and a second, open position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>. While shown as having multiple hinges <b>25</b> and <b>27</b>, the plastic components <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> may instead be joined along a single, continuous integral hinge.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the front plastic component <b>26</b> is generally rectangular in shape and includes a raised pocket <b>32</b> and a flange <b>34</b>. The pocket <b>32</b> is shaped to provide the desired space for containing the articles to be packaged. In this illustrated embodiment, this is a single compartment capable of receiving articles. In other applications, the front plastic component <b>26</b> may define a plurality of separate compartments. The pocket <b>32</b> may be shaped to correspond in shape with and closely receive the article(s) to be packaged. The pocket <b>32</b> may alternatively be shaped to loosely receive the article or articles. For example, the pocket <b>32</b> may be a rectangular pocket capable of containing a plurality of fasteners, such as nails or screws. In the illustrated embodiment, the outer dimensions of the pocket <b>32</b> at its conjunction with the flange <b>34</b> are substantially the same as the inner dimensions of the corresponding cut-out <b>21</b>. Although the close fit between the pocket <b>32</b> and the cut-out <b>21</b> helps to register the front plastic component <b>26</b> with respect to the panel <b>16</b>, a close fit is not required and the pocket <b>32</b> need not correspond in shape with the cut out. For example, if the outer dimensions of the pocket <b>32</b> are substantially smaller than then inner dimensions of the cut-out <b>21</b>, the flange <b>34</b> may bridge the space between the pocket <b>32</b> and the panel <b>16</b> surrounding the cut-out <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The flange <b>34</b> of the illustrated embodiment extends entirely around the periphery of the pocket <b>32</b> to provide a continuous section of material along which the front plastic component <b>26</b> may be joined to the panel <b>16</b>. The flange <b>34</b> need not, however, be continuous, and it may alternatively be a single incomplete segment or it may be broken into multiple segments disposed at different locations around the periphery of the pocket <b>32</b>. The flange <b>34</b> may be joined to the panel <b>16</b> in essentially any way. In the illustrated embodiment, the flange <b>34</b> is secured to the panel <b>16</b> by a heat-activated adhesive, but other types of adhesives may be used. An adhesive may be extend along any regions where the plastic component <b>14</b> and the paperboard portion <b>12</b> are in contact, but in the illustrated embodiment extends along the interface between the panel <b>16</b> and the flange <b>34</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the plastic component <b>14</b> is disposed with the flange <b>34</b> engaging the inside surface <b>30</b> of the panel <b>16</b> and the pocket <b>32</b> extending outwardly through the cut-out <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Although the front package component <b>26</b> and the rear package component <b>28</b> are shown as joined along a bridge or a hinge <b>25</b>, the package components <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> may be separate components. In addition, the number of plastic components may vary from application to application. For example, each panel may have a plurality of cut-outs that are fitted with a plurality of plastic components. In some embodiments, each front and rear pair of plastic components can define a separate article containing space. In other embodiments, the plastic components are not arranged in unique pairs. For example, two or more components on one panel may be fitted into a single plastic component on an opposed panel.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the illustrated embodiment, the front plastic component <b>26</b> and the rear plastic component <b>28</b> are configured to be interfitted with one another. In the package of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>, one of the plastic components <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> may be shaped to include a shoulder <b>40</b> and the other may be shaped to include a seat <b>42</b> adapted to receive the shoulder <b>40</b>. Although the shoulder <b>40</b> and seat <b>42</b> may be on the same plastic components, in the illustrated embodiment, the shoulder <b>40</b> is part of the rear plastic component <b>28</b> and the seat <b>42</b> is part of the front plastic component <b>26</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the shoulder <b>40</b> of this embodiment protrudes from the rear plastic component <b>28</b> and is configured to be closely fitted into the seat <b>42</b> in the front plastic component <b>26</b>. The seat <b>42</b> of this embodiment includes a sidewall <b>60</b> and a base <b>62</b>. The sidewall <b>60</b> is sized and shaped to correspond with and closely receive the shoulder <b>40</b> protruding from the rear plastic component <b>28</b>. The base <b>62</b> is configured to engage and support the shoulder <b>40</b> when the plastic components are interfitted. The shoulder <b>40</b> and seat <b>42</b> may be intersecured by a friction fit, and the amount of force required to join and separate the components may vary from application to application as desired. In some applications, protrusions <b>44</b> and catches <b>46</b> may also be included in the shoulder <b>40</b> and seat <b>42</b> to assist in holding the package <b>10</b> closed. In use, the protrusions <b>44</b> and catches <b>46</b> frictionally interfit when the package <b>10</b> is closed to retain the package <b>10</b> in the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A composite package in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-11</figref> and generally designated <b>110</b>. Except as expressly described herein, the composite package <b>110</b> is similar to composite package <b>10</b>, and the features of package <b>110</b> which correspond to the features of package <b>10</b> are designated by the corresponding reference numerals increased by <b>100</b>. For example, the paperboard portion <b>112</b> and the plastic portion <b>114</b> correspond to the paperboard portion <b>12</b> and the plastic portion <b>14</b>. Only the elements that differ significantly are described below</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The plastic portion <b>114</b> is generally similar to the previously described second plastic portion <b>14</b> with the exception that it defines a second raised portion or pocket <b>170</b> extending rearwardly with respect to a second flange <b>172</b>. In addition, each flange <b>134</b>, <b>172</b> is generally coextensive with the corresponding paperboard panel <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>. The paperboard portion <b>112</b> is generally similar to the previously described paperboard portion <b>12</b> with the exception that it defines a second opening or cut-out <b>174</b> shaped to receive the rearwardly extending pocket <b>170</b>. As described above in connection with the first embodiment, the rearwardly extending pocket <b>170</b> may be shaped to loosely receive the article or articles. For example, the pocket <b>170</b> may be a rectangular pocket capable of containing a plurality of fasteners, such as nails or screws. In the illustrated embodiment, the outer dimensions of the pocket <b>170</b> at its conjunction with the flange <b>172</b> are substantially the same as the inner dimensions of the corresponding cut-out <b>174</b>. Although the close fit between the pocket <b>170</b> and the cut-out <b>174</b> helps to register the rear plastic component <b>128</b> with respect to the rear panel <b>118</b>, a close fit is not required and the rear pocket <b>170</b> need not correspond in shape with the cut out <b>174</b>. For example, if the outer dimensions of the pocket <b>170</b> are substantially smaller than then inner dimensions of the cut-out <b>174</b>, the flange <b>172</b> may bridge the space between the pocket <b>170</b> and the panel <b>118</b> surrounding the cut-out <b>176</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Like the front plastic component <b>126</b>, the rear plastic component <b>128</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-11</figref> as being generally rectangular in shape and includes a pocket <b>132</b> and a flange <b>134</b>. The plastic components <b>126</b> and <b>128</b> may, however, be other shapes depending on the desired function and the articles to be held in the package <b>110</b>. The rear plastic component <b>128</b> may to include any or all of the alternative features described above in connection with the front plastic component <b>126</b>, and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> show another alternative embodiment. In this embodiment, the package <b>210</b> includes a paperboard portion <b>212</b> with four panels <b>216</b>, <b>217</b>, <b>218</b> and <b>219</b> that cooperate with the plastic portion <b>214</b> to form the package <b>210</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows the plastic portion <b>214</b> positioned over the paperboard portion <b>212</b>. The broken lines of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> show where the plastic portion <b>214</b> is to be positioned in the paperboard portion <b>212</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the outermost panels <b>217</b> and <b>218</b> fold inwardly onto the innermost panels <b>216</b> and <b>218</b> to trap/hold the plastic portion <b>214</b> in place. Although the hinges between the various panels are parallel in the illustrated embodiment, the outermost panels may be joined to the innermost panels along any other free edge, such as the top or bottom edges. The outermost panels <b>217</b> and <b>219</b> define openings <b>231</b> and <b>233</b>, respectively, that will align with the front package component <b>226</b> and the rear package component <b>228</b>. In this embodiment, opening <b>231</b> is sized, shaped and positioned to align and correspond with the opening of the front package component <b>226</b>. The opening <b>233</b> of this embodiment is sized, shaped and positioned to align and interfit with the shoulder <b>240</b> of the rear package component <b>228</b>. As can be seen, in this embodiment, the openings <b>231</b> and <b>233</b> are configured so that the outermost panels do not interfere with the article containing space or the interfitting of the plastic components <b>226</b> and <b>228</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Once folded, the innermost panels <b>216</b> and <b>218</b> and outermost panel <b>217</b> and <b>219</b> may be joined in essentially any suitable manner, such as through the use of adhesives and cements. In the illustrated embodiment, the mating surfaces of the panels <b>216</b>, <b>217</b>, <b>218</b> and <b>219</b> are joined by a cohesive, such as a rubber-based or latex-based cohesive. More specifically, in this embodiment, the mating surfaces of the panels <b>216</b>, <b>217</b>, <b>218</b> and <b>219</b> are coated with a cohesive so that, once folded, panel <b>216</b> adhesively joins to panel <b>217</b> and panel <b>218</b> adhesively joins to panel <b>219</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The package <b>210</b> can then be opened and closed by bending along fold line <b>220</b> as shown by line F of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. In use, the shoulder <b>240</b> of the rear plastic component <b>228</b> can be fitted into the front plastic component <b>226</b>. The components may be configured to snap-lock together. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the shoulder <b>240</b> may include protrusions <b>244</b> and the front plastic component <b>226</b> may include catches <b>246</b> configured to receive the catches <b>246</b> when the package <b>210</b> is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The extra panels provided in this embodiment can facilitate assembly of the package <b>212</b> because the plastic portion <b>212</b> can be secured in place without the use of expensive sealing equipment. Instead, the package <b>212</b> can be manually assembled simply by folding the outermost panels onto the innermost panels so that the cohesive secures them together. Further, the extra panels increase the strength/stiffness of the package <b>210</b>. Also, because the extra panels are folded, they allow printing to appear on all visible sides of the package <b>210</b> even when printing is applied to only one side of the paperboard portion <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The above description is that of current embodiments of the invention.
