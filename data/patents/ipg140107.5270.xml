<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a vehicle control apparatus and a vehicle control method.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are hybrid vehicles that include a motor generator, which serves as, an electric motor and a generator, in addition to an internal combustion engine (engine). In the hybrid vehicles, the internal combustion engine is operated at highest possible efficiency, and the motor generator compensates for a shortfall in a drive power or an engine braking force.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An example of such hybrid vehicles is described in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2004-345527 (JP-A-2004-345527). In the hybrid vehicle described in JP-A-2004-345527, the shift mode is switched between the continuously variable shift mode and the stepped shift mode. The hybrid vehicle includes a power split mechanism that is formed by combining, for example, two planetary gear mechanisms with each other. The power split mechanism is connected to an engine, a first motor generator, a drive shaft and a brake, and a second motor generator is connected to the drive shaft. When the brake is released, the engine speed is continuously adjusted by continuously adjusting the rotational speed of the first motor generator. In this case, the vehicle is driven in the continuously variable shift mode. On the other hand, when the brake is locked, the gear ratio is fixed by preventing rotation of one of the above-described rotating elements. In this case, the vehicle is driven in the stepped shift mode.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the drive shaft responds to the output from the engine more quickly in the stepped shift mode than in the continuously variable shift mode. Therefore, the drivability may differ between the continuously variable shift mode and the stepped shift mode.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention provides a vehicle control apparatus and a vehicle control method that minimize a difference in drivability between the continuously variable shift mode and the stepped shift mode.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A first aspect of the invention relates to a control apparatus for a vehicle that has the shift modes including the continuously variable shift mode, in which the ratio of the rotational speed of a power source to the rotational speed of a drive shaft is continuously adjusted, and the stepped shift mode, in which the ratio of the rotational speed of the power source to the rotational speed of the drive shaft is fixed. The control apparatus includes a control unit that controls the torque that is output from the power source to make the time that is required to bring the drive torque of the drive shaft from a predetermined value to a target value in the stepped shift mode equal to the time that is required to bring the drive torque of the drive shaft from the predetermined value to the target value in the continuously variable shift mode.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The control apparatus is applied to the vehicle that has the shift modes including the continuously variable shift mode, in which the ratio of the rotational speed of the power source to the rotational speed of the drive shaft is continuously adjusted, and the stepped shift mode, in which the ratio of the rotational speed of the power source to the rotational speed of the drive shaft is fixed. The control apparatus includes the control unit, for example, an ECU (Electronic Control Unit). The control unit controls the torque that is output from the power source to make the time that is required to bring the drive torque of the drive shaft from the predetermined value to the target value in the stepped shift mode equal to the time that is required to bring the drive torque of the drive shaft from the predetermined value to the target value in the continuously variable shift mode. The predetermined value is a value that is determined as needed, and the target value is a value that is determined as needed and that is larger than the predetermined value. Thus, the difference in drivability between the continuously variable and the stepped shift mode is minimized. As a result, it is possible to provide the drivability that does not give a sense of discomfort to a driver.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the first aspect of the invention, the control unit may control the torque that is output from the power source in such a manner that the time that is required to bring the drive torque from the predetermined value to the target value in the stepped shift mode is increased by a predetermined time. In this case, the predetermined time is the difference between the time that is required to bring the drive torque from the predetermined value to the target value in the continuously variable shift mode and the time that is required to bring the drive torque from the predetermined value to the target value in the stepped shift mode. In the stepped shift mode, the torque output from the power source is controlled to increase the time that is required to bring the drive torque from the predetermined value to the target value by the predetermined time. In this way, the time that is required to bring the drive torque from the predetermined value to the target value in the stepped shift mode is made equal to the time that is required to bring the drive torque from the predetermined value to the target value in the continuously variable shift mode.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The control apparatus according to the first aspect of the invention may further include an energy storage unit that stores energy which is supplied to the power source. The control unit may detect an amount of energy that is able to be supplied from the energy storage unit to the power source, and may adjust the predetermined time based on the detected amount of energy. The energy storage unit is, for example, a battery. In this way, even if the output from the energy storage unit is limited, the time required to bring the drive torque from the predetermined value to the target value in the stepped shift mode is made equal to the time required to bring the drive torque from the predetermined value to the target value in the continuously variable shift mode. As a result, it is possible to provide the drivability that does not give a sense of discomfort to the driver.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The control apparatus according to the first aspect of the invention may be applied to a hybrid vehicle in which an internal combustion engine and a motor generator are provided as power sources and the shift mode is switched between the continuously variable shift mode and the stepped shift mode.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The control apparatus according to the first aspect of the invention may be applied to a hybrid vehicle which includes a first motor generator, a power split mechanism to which the internal combustion engine and the first motor generator are connected, a second motor generator that is connected to the drive shaft, and a brake that is able to lock a rotating element of the power split mechanism, in which when the brake releases the rotating element, the continuously variable shift mode where a reaction force, which corresponds to the torque output from the internal combustion engine, is output from the first motor generator is achieved, and in which when the brake locks the rotating element, the stepped shift mode where the torque output from the internal combustion engine is transferred to the drive shaft without being influenced by the reaction force output from the first motor generator is achieved. In this hybrid vehicle, if the control apparatus according to the first aspect of the invention is not provided, it takes longer to transfer the torque output from the internal combustion engine to the drive shaft in the continuously variable shift mode than in the stepped shift mode because the reaction force from the first motor generator is changed in the continuously variable shift mode. Therefore, it takes longer to bring the drive torque to the target value in the continuously variable shift mode than in the stepped shift mode. However, if the control apparatus according to the first aspect of the invention is provided, the time that is required to bring the drive torque to the target value in the stepped shift mode is increased by the predetermined time. Accordingly, the time that is required to bring the drive torque from the predetermined value to the target value in the stepped shift mode is made equal to the time that is required to bring the drive torque from the predetermined value to the target value in the continuously variable shift mode. As a result, it is possible to provide the drivability that does not give a sense of discomfort to the driver.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The control apparatus is provided in the vehicle which has the shift modes including the continuously variable shift mode, in which the ratio of the rotational speed of the power source to the rotational speed of the drive shaft is continuously adjusted by changing the reaction force that corresponds to the torque output from the power source, and the stepped shift mode, in which the ratio of the rotational speed of the power source to the rotational speed of the drive shaft is fixed. The control apparatus includes the control unit that controls the torque that is output from the power source to make the time that is required to bring the drive torque of the drive shaft from the predetermined value to the target value in the stepped shift mode equal to the time that is required to bring the drive torque of the drive shaft from the predetermined value to the target value in the continuously variable shift mode. Accordingly, the difference in drivability between the continuously variable shift mode and the stepped shift mode is minimized. As a result, it is possible to provide the drivability that does not give a sense of discomfort to the driver.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A second aspect of the invention relates to a control method for a vehicle which has the shift modes including the continuously variable shift mode, in which the ratio of the rotational speed of a power source to the rotational speed of a drive shaft is continuously adjusted, and the stepped shift mode, in which the ratio of the rotational speed of the power source to the rotational speed of the drive shaft is fixed. According to the control method, the torque that is output from the power source is controlled to make the time that is required to bring the drive torque of the drive shaft from the predetermined value to the target value in the stepped shift mode equal to the time that is required to bring the drive torque of the drive shaft from the predetermined value to the target value in the continuously variable shift mode. Accordingly, the difference in drivability between the continuously variable shift mode and the stepped shift mode is minimized. As a result, it is possible to provide the drivability that does not give a sense of discomfort to the driver.</p>

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Hereafter, an embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a view schematically showing the structure of a hybrid vehicle that includes a vehicle control apparatus according to the embodiment of the invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the hybrid vehicle according to the embodiment of the invention includes an engine (internal combustion engine) <b>1</b>, a first motor generator MG<b>1</b>, a second motor generator MG<b>2</b>, and a power split mechanism <b>20</b>. The engine <b>1</b> and the first motor generator MG<b>1</b>, which serve as power sources, are connected to the power split mechanism <b>20</b>. The second motor generator MG<b>2</b>, which serves as a power source that is used to compensate for a shortfall in a torque of the drive shaft <b>3</b> (drive torque) or a braking force, is connected to the drive shaft <b>3</b> of the power split mechanism <b>20</b>. The second motor generator MG<b>2</b> is connected to the drive shaft <b>3</b> via a MG<b>2</b> speed-change unit <b>6</b>. The drive shaft <b>3</b> is connected to right and left drive wheels <b>9</b> via a final gear reduction unit <b>8</b>. The first motor generator MG<b>1</b> and the second motor generator MG<b>2</b> are electrically connected to each other directly or via a battery, an inverter or a controller (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The second motor generator MG<b>2</b> is driven by the electric power generated by the first motor generator MG<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The engine <b>1</b> is a thermal engine that generates a drive power by burning fuel. For example, a gasoline engine or a diesel engine may be used as the engine <b>1</b>. The main function of the first motor generator MG<b>1</b> is to generate electric power. The first motor generator MG<b>1</b> rotates using the torque from the engine <b>1</b> to generate electric power. Due to the electric power generation, a reaction force in the form of torque is generated at the first motor generator MG<b>1</b>. The rotational speed of the engine <b>1</b> is continuously adjusted by controlling the rotational speed of the first motor generator MG<b>1</b>. This shift mode is referred to as the continuously variable shift mode. The continuously variable shift mode is achieved by a differential effect produced by the power split mechanism <b>20</b>, described later in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The second motor generator MG<b>2</b> generates a supplemental drive torque or a supplemental braking force. When generating a supplemental drive torque, the second motor generator MG<b>2</b> serves as an electric motor that generates power using the supplied electric power. On the other hand, when generating a supplemental braking force, the second motor generator MG<b>2</b> serves as a generator that is rotated by the torque transferred from the drive wheels <b>9</b> to generate electric power.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the structure of the first motor generator MG<b>1</b>, the second motor generator MG<b>2</b>, and the power split mechanism <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The power split mechanism <b>20</b> distributes the torque output from the engine <b>1</b> between the first motor generator MG<b>1</b> and the drive shaft <b>3</b>, and produces a differential effect. The power split mechanism <b>20</b> includes multiple sets of differential mechanisms. There are four rotating elements that produce a differential effect. The engine <b>1</b> is connected to a first rotating element, the first motor generator MG<b>1</b> is connected to a second rotating element, and the drive shaft <b>3</b> is connected to a third rotating element. A fourth rotating element may be locked by a brake unit <b>7</b>. The brake unit <b>7</b> is, for example, a mesh mechanism that includes an engaging element (not shown) which has a plurality of dog teeth and an engaged element (not shown) which has a plurality of dog teeth.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">When the fourth rotating element is not locked by the brake unit <b>7</b>, the rotational speed of the engine <b>1</b> is continuously adjusted by continuously adjusting the rotational speed of the first motor generator MG<b>1</b>. In this case, the continuously variable shift mode is achieved. On the other hand, when the fourth rotating element is locked by the brake unit <b>7</b>, the gear ratio that is determined by the power split mechanism <b>20</b> is fixed to an over-drive gear ratio (that is, a gear ratio at which the speed of rotation output from the engine <b>1</b> is smaller than the rotational speed of the drive shaft <b>3</b>). In this case, the stepped shift mode is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the embodiment of the invention, the power split mechanism <b>20</b> is formed by combining two planetary gear mechanisms with each other, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. A first planetary gear mechanism includes a ring gear R<b>1</b>, a carrier C<b>1</b> and a sun gear S<b>1</b>. A second planetary gear mechanism is a double pinion planetary gear mechanism, and includes a ring gear R<b>2</b>, a carrier C<b>2</b> and a sun gear S<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">An output shaft <b>2</b> of the engine <b>1</b> is connected to the carrier C<b>1</b> of the first planetary gear mechanism, and the carrier C<b>1</b> is connected to the ring gear R<b>2</b> of the second planetary gear mechanism. The carrier C<b>1</b> and the ring gear R<b>2</b> constitute the first rotating element. A rotor <b>11</b> of the first motor generator MG<b>1</b> is connected to the sun gear S<b>1</b> of the first planetary gear mechanism. The rotor <b>11</b> and the sun gear S<b>1</b> constitute the second rotating element.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The ring gear R<b>1</b> of the first planetary gear mechanism and the carrier C<b>2</b> of the second planetary gear mechanism are connected to each other, and connected to the drive shaft <b>3</b>. The ring gear R<b>1</b> and the carrier C<b>2</b> constitute the third rotating element. The sun gear S<b>2</b> of the second planetary gear mechanism is connected to a rotating shaft <b>29</b>. The sun gear S<b>2</b> and the rotating shaft <b>29</b> constitute the fourth rotating element. The rotating shaft <b>29</b> may be locked by the brake unit <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A power supply unit <b>30</b> includes an inverter <b>31</b>, a converter <b>32</b>, a HV battery <b>33</b> and a converter <b>34</b>. The first motor generator MG<b>1</b> is connected to the inverter <b>31</b> via a power supply line <b>37</b>, and the second motor generator MG<b>2</b> is connected to the inverter <b>31</b> via a power supply line <b>38</b>. The inverter <b>31</b> is connected to the converter <b>32</b>, and the converter <b>32</b> is connected to the HV battery <b>33</b>. The HV battery <b>33</b> is connected to an auxiliary battery <b>35</b> via the converter <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The inverter <b>31</b> supplies electric power to or receives electric power from the first motor generator MG<b>1</b> and the second motor generator MG<b>2</b>. During regeneration operation of the motor generators, the inverter <b>31</b> converts alternating-current electric power generated through the regeneration operation of the first motor generator MG<b>1</b> and the second motor generator MG<b>2</b> into direct-current electric power, and supplies the direct-current electric power to the converter <b>32</b>. The converter <b>32</b> converts the voltage of the electric power supplied from the inverter <b>31</b> into an appropriate voltage, and charges the HV battery <b>33</b>. During powering operation of the motor generator, the voltage of the direct-current electric power output from the HV battery <b>33</b> is boosted by the converter <b>32</b> and supplied to the inverter <b>31</b>, and then supplied to the first motor generator MG<b>1</b> via the power supply line <b>37</b>, or to the second motor generator MG<b>2</b> via the power supply line <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The electric power from the HV battery <b>33</b> undergoes voltage conversion at the converter <b>34</b>. Then, the electric power is supplied to the auxiliary battery <b>35</b>, and is used to drive various auxiliaries.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The operations of the inverter <b>31</b>, the converter <b>32</b>, the HV battery <b>33</b> and the converter <b>34</b> are controlled by an ECU <b>4</b>. The ECU <b>4</b> transmits control signals S<b>4</b> to control the operations of the elements in the power supply unit <b>30</b>. Required signals indicating, for example, the conditions of the elements in the power supply unit <b>30</b> are transmitted to the ECU <b>4</b> as control signals S<b>4</b>. More specifically, the state of charge (SOC) of the HV battery <b>33</b>, input/output limit values for the battery, etc. are translated into the control signals S<b>4</b>, and the control signals S<b>4</b> are transmitted to the ECU <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The ECU <b>4</b> exchanges control signals S<b>1</b>, control signals S<b>2</b> and control signals S<b>3</b> with the engine <b>1</b>, the first motor generator MG<b>1</b> and the second motor generator MG<b>2</b>, respectively, and controls the engine <b>1</b>, the first motor generator MG<b>1</b> and the second motor generator MG<b>2</b> based on the controls signals S<b>1</b>, the control signals S<b>2</b>, and the control signals S<b>3</b>, respectively. For example, the ECU <b>4</b> detects the accelerator pedal operation amount based on a control signal from an accelerator pedal (not shown), and determines the required drive torque. Then, the ECU <b>4</b> controls the engine <b>1</b>, the first motor generator MG<b>1</b>, and the second motor generator MG<b>2</b> in such a manner that the drive torque agrees with the required drive torque. Therefore, the ECU <b>4</b> serves as a control unit according to the invention. The ECU <b>4</b> transmits a control signal to a brake operation unit (not shown). The brake operation unit causes the brake unit <b>7</b> to lock or release the fourth rotating element based on the control signal.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Next, a vehicle control method according to the embodiment of the invention will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">First, the operation state of the hybrid vehicle in the continuously variable shift mode and the operation state of the hybrid vehicle in the stepped shift mode will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, respectively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows an example of a collinear diagram in the continuously variable shift mode, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows an example of a collinear diagram in the stepped shift mode. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, ordinate axes represent rotational speeds, and the upper portion represents the forward rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Straight lines A<b>1</b><i>a</i>, A<b>1</b><i>b </i>and A<b>1</b><i>c </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> each show an example of a collinear diagram in the continuously variable shift mode. In the continuously variable shift mode, a reaction force that corresponds to an output torque TKE from the engine <b>1</b> is output from the first motor generator MG<b>1</b> as a torque TK<b>1</b>. A torque TK<b>2</b> represents a torque that is output from the second motor generator MG<b>2</b>. In the continuously variable shift mode, the rotational speed of the engine <b>1</b> may be continuously adjusted by adjusting the rotational speed of the first motor generator MG<b>1</b>. In the case where the rotational speed of the drive shaft <b>3</b> is N<b>1</b>, when the rotational speed of the first motor generator MG<b>1</b> is changed from m<b>1</b> to m<b>2</b>, and then from m<b>2</b> to m<b>3</b>, the rotational speed of the engine <b>1</b> is changed from Ne<b>1</b> (&#x3e;N<b>1</b>) to Ne<b>2</b> (=N<b>1</b>), and then from Ne<b>2</b> to Ne<b>3</b> (&#x3c;N<b>1</b>). That is, the rotational speed of the engine <b>1</b> is changed from a value that is higher than the rotational speed of the drive shaft <b>3</b> to a value that is equal to the rotational speed of the drive shaft <b>3</b>, and then from the value equal to the rotational speed of the drive shaft <b>3</b> to a value that is lower than the rotational speed of the drive shaft <b>3</b>. In this case, as shown by the straight line A<b>1</b><i>c</i>, when the rotational speed of the first motor generator MG<b>1</b> is a negative value, that is, when the first motor generator MG<b>1</b> performs the powering operation, electric power is supplied from the second motor generator MG<b>2</b> to the first motor generator MG<b>1</b>. If the electric power is supplied from the second motor generator MG<b>2</b> to the first motor generator MG<b>1</b>, power transmission efficiency in the vehicle deteriorates, which reduces the fuel efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A straight line A<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows an example of a collinear diagram in the stepped shift mode. In the stepped shift mode, because the fourth rotating element is locked by the brake unit <b>7</b>, the gear ratio that is determined by the power split mechanism <b>20</b> is fixed to an over-drive gear ratio (that is, a gear ratio at which a rotational speed NeS of the engine <b>1</b> is lower than the rotational speed N<b>1</b> of the drive shaft <b>3</b>). At this time, a reaction force TKB that corresponds to the output torque TKE from the engine <b>1</b> is mechanically supported at the brake unit <b>7</b> because the brake unit <b>7</b> locks the sun gear S<b>2</b>. Therefore, the first motor generator MG<b>1</b> need to be used as neither an electric motor nor a generator. As a result, the first motor generator MG<b>1</b> substantially idles. Therefore, electric power need not be supplied from the second motor generator MG<b>2</b> to the first motor generator MG<b>1</b>. Therefore, when the vehicle is traveling at a high speed in a steady state, it is possible to avoid the situation, in which electric power is supplied from the second motor generator MG<b>2</b> to the first motor generator MG<b>1</b>, by switching the shift mode from the continuously variable shift mode to the stepped shift mode. As a result, it is possible to enhance the fuel efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">When the torque output from the engine <b>1</b> rises in the stepped shift mode, the torque output from the engine <b>1</b> is transferred to the drive shaft <b>3</b> without being influenced by the reaction force output from the first motor generator MG<b>1</b> because the reaction force that corresponds to the torque output from the engine <b>1</b> is mechanically supported at the brake unit <b>7</b>. In contrast, in the continuously variable shift mode, the torque output from the engine <b>1</b> decreases while being transferred to the drive shaft <b>3</b> via the power split mechanism <b>20</b> because the reaction force from the first motor generator MG<b>1</b> is changed. Therefore, it takes longer to transfer the torque output from the engine <b>1</b> to, the drive shaft <b>3</b> in the continuously variable shift mode than in the stepped shift mode. This will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates graphs showing temporal changes in the accelerator pedal operation amount, the torque output from the engine <b>1</b>, and the drive torque. The graphs in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> show the case in which a driver depresses the accelerator pedal to increase the drive torque from a predetermined value Tst to a target value Ted. In the case shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the drive torque is increased to the target value Ted by increasing only the torque output from the engine <b>1</b> without generating supplemental torque with the use of the second motor generator MG<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">If the driver depresses the accelerator pedal at time t<b>1</b>, the accelerator pedal operation amount increases. The accelerator pedal operation amount sensor transmits a control signal indicating the accelerator pedal operation amount to the ECU <b>4</b>. Upon reception of the control signal from the accelerator pedal sensor, the ECU <b>4</b> detects the accelerator pedal operation amount, and determines the required drive torque that corresponds to the detected accelerator pedal operation amount. As the accelerator pedal operation amount increases, the required drive torque increases. The ECU <b>4</b> transmits a control signal to the engine <b>1</b> to control the torque that is output from the engine <b>1</b> in such a manner that the drive torque agrees with the required drive torque.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the stepped shift mode, the torque output from the engine <b>1</b> is transferred to the drive shaft <b>3</b> without being influenced by the reaction force from the first motor generator MG<b>1</b>. Therefore, immediately after the torque output from the engine <b>1</b> increases, the drive torque increases. As a result, the drive torque reaches the target value Ted at time t<b>2</b>. In contrast, the drive torque increases more moderately in the continuously variable shift mode than in the stepped shift mode. This is because, in the continuously variable shift mode, the drive torque is influenced by the reaction force from the first motor generator MG<b>1</b>. Accordingly, the drive torque reaches the target value Ted at time t<b>3</b> that is later than time t<b>2</b>. As is clear from this fact, when the torque output from the engine <b>1</b> rises, the drive shaft <b>3</b> responds to the output from the engine <b>1</b> more quickly in the stepped shift mode than in the continuously variable shift mode. Therefore, the drivability may differ between the continuously variable shift mode and the stepped shift mode. As a result, the driver may feel a sense of discomfort.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Therefore, the vehicle control apparatus according to the embodiment of the invention makes the time required to bring the drive torque from the predetermined value to the target value in the continuously variable shift mode equal to the time required to bring the drive torque from the predetermined value to the target value in the stepped shift mode. This will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a graph showing temporal changes in the drive torque. More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a graph that shows the temporal change in the drive torque when the drive torque is increased from a predetermined value Tout<b>1</b> to a predetermined value Tout<b>2</b> and then from the predetermined value Tout<b>2</b> to a target value Tked in each of the stepped shift mode and the continuously variable shift mode. From the predetermined value Tout<b>1</b> to the predetermined value Tout<b>2</b>, the torque output from the motor generator is mainly used to increase the drive torque. From the predetermined value Tout<b>2</b> to the target value Tked, the torque output from the engine <b>1</b> is mainly used to increase the drive torque.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, &#x201c;&#x3b1;&#x201d; represents a response time for the drive shaft <b>3</b> in the continuously variable shift mode, and &#x201c;&#x3b2;&#x201d; represents a response time for the drive shaft <b>3</b> in the stepped shift mode. &#x201c;&#x3b3;&#x201d; represents a response time difference &#x201c;&#x3b1;&#x2212;&#x3b2;&#x201d; between the continuously variable shift mode and the stepped shift mode. In this case, the response time for the drive shaft <b>3</b> signifies the time that is required to bring the drive torque from the predetermined value Tout<b>2</b> to the target value Tked. That is, &#x201c;&#x3b1;&#x201d; represents the time that is required to bring the drive torque from the predetermined value Tout<b>2</b> to the target value Tked in the continuously variable shift mode, &#x201c;&#x3b2;&#x201d; represents the time that is required to bring the drive torque from the predetermined value Tout<b>2</b> to the target value Tked in the stepped shift mode, and &#x201c;&#x3b3;&#x201d; represents the difference between the time &#x3b1; in the continuously variable shift mode and the time &#x3b2; in the stepped shift mode. &#x201c;&#x3b5;&#x201d; represents an amount of decrease in the drive torque that is caused when the output from the HV battery <b>33</b> is limited.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The predetermined values Tout<b>1</b>, Tout<b>2</b> and Tked are values that are set as needed. &#x201c;&#x3b1;&#x201d; and &#x201c;&#x3b2;&#x201d; are empirically determined in the form of maps that show the relationships with the predetermined value Tout<b>2</b> and the target value Tked, and stored in, for example, a ROM of the ECU <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">When the output from the HV battery <b>33</b> is not limited, in both the stepped shift mode and the continuously variable shift mode, the torque output from the motor generator (more specifically, the second motor generator MG<b>2</b>) is mainly used to increase the drive torque from the predetermined value Tout <b>1</b> to the predetermined value Tout <b>2</b> (from time ta<b>1</b> to time ta<b>2</b>) in response to an increase in the required drive torque. After the drive torque exceeds the predetermined value Tout<b>2</b>, the torque output from the engine <b>1</b> is mainly used to increase the drive torque to the target value Tked. When the torque output from the engine <b>1</b> is mainly used to increase the drive torque, the drive shaft <b>3</b> responds to the output from the engine <b>1</b> more quickly in the stepped shift mode than in the continuously variable shift mode, as described above. Therefore, the response time &#x3b2; that is required to bring the drive torque from the predetermined value Tout<b>2</b> to the target value Tked in the stepped shift mode is shorter than the response time &#x3b1; that is required to bring the drive torque from the predetermined value Tout <b>2</b> to the target value Tked in the continuously variable shift mode. &#x201c;ta<b>3</b>&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> represents the time at which the drive torque reaches the target value Tked in the continuously variable shift mode.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the vehicle control apparatus according to the embodiment of the invention, the ECU <b>4</b> increases the time required to bring the drive torque from the predetermined value Tout<b>2</b> to the target value Tked in the stepped shift mode. More specifically, the ECU <b>4</b> controls the engine <b>1</b> in such a manner that the rate of increase in the torque output from the engine <b>1</b> in the stepped shift mode is as low as that in the continuously variable shift mode. Thus, the ECU <b>4</b> increases the time required to bring the drive torque to the target value Tked in the stepped shift mode by the time &#x3b3;. According to the embodiment of the invention, the engine <b>1</b> is controlled in such a manner that the rate of increase in the torque output from the engine <b>1</b> is changed depending on the shift mode. This control is executed, for example, according to the following method. In this method, maps that show the relationship between the required drive torque and each of the ignition timing, the intake air amount, and the fuel injection amount are prepared individually for the continuously variable shift mode and the stepped shift mode, and the ECU <b>4</b> switches the map that the ECU <b>4</b> uses between the map for the stepped shift mode and the map for the continuously variable shift mode.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the stepped shift mode, the response time for the drive shaft <b>3</b> is &#x201c;&#x3b2;&#x201d;. Therefore, if the time required to bring the drive torque to the target value Tked is increased by the time &#x3b3;, the drive torque reaches the target value Tked when a time &#x201c;&#x3b2;+&#x3b3;(=&#x3b1;)&#x201d; has elapsed after time ta<b>2</b>, that is, the drive torque reaches the target value Tked at time ta<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">That is, in the stepped shift mode, the ECU <b>4</b> controls the torque that is output from the engine <b>1</b> in such a manner that the time required to bring the drive torque to the target value lied is increased by the time &#x3b3; (the time required to bring the drive torque to the target value Tked is &#x201c;&#x3b2;+&#x3b3;&#x201d;). That is, the ECU <b>4</b> controls the torque output from the engine <b>1</b> in such a manner that the drive torque reaches the target value Tked when the response time &#x201c;&#x3b2;+&#x3b3;&#x201d;, which is obtained by adding the time &#x201c;&#x3b3;&#x201d; to the response time &#x201c;&#x3b2;&#x201d;, has elapsed after time ta<b>2</b>. In this way, the time that is required to bring the drive torque from the predetermined value Tout<b>2</b> to the target value Tked in the stepped shift mode is made equal to the time that is required to bring the drive torque from the predetermined value Tout<b>2</b> to the target value Tked in the continuously variable shift mode. Thus, it is possible to reduce the difference in the response of the drive shaft <b>3</b> to the output from the engine <b>1</b> between the continuously variable shift mode and the stepped shift mode. In other words, it is possible to reduce the difference in the response of the drive shaft <b>3</b> to a change in the accelerator pedal operation amount between the continuously variable shift mode and the stepped shift mode. As a result, it is possible to provide the drivability that does not give a sense of discomfort to the driver.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the above-described example, the ECU <b>4</b> increases the response time required to bring the drive torque to the target value Tked by the time &#x3b3; in the stepped shift mode. That is, in the stepped shift mode, the ECU <b>4</b> controls the torque output from the engine <b>1</b> in such a manner that the drive torque reaches the target value Tked when the response time &#x201c;&#x3b2;+&#x3b3;&#x201d; has elapsed after time ta<b>2</b>. Alternatively, the ECU <b>4</b> may decrease the time required to bring the drive torque to the target value Tked by the time &#x3b3; in the continuously variable shift mode. That is, in the continuously variable shift mode, the ECU <b>4</b> may control the torque output from the engine <b>1</b> in such a manner that the drive torque reaches the target value Tked when a response time &#x201c;&#x3b1;&#x2212;&#x3b3;&#x201d; has elapsed after time ta<b>2</b>. However, increasing the response time in the stepped shift mode is easier than decreasing the response time in the continuously variable shift mode. Therefore, increasing the response time in the stepped shift mode is more advantageous than decreasing the response time in the continuously variable shift mode.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Next, the case where the output from the HV battery <b>33</b> is limited will be described. When the output from the HV battery <b>33</b> is limited, the magnitude of torque output from the motor generator is also limited. Accordingly, the drive torque increases more moderately when the output from the HV battery <b>33</b> is limited than when the output from the HV battery <b>33</b> is not limited. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the drive torque is not increased to the predetermined value Tout<b>2</b> within a period from time ta<b>1</b> to time ta<b>2</b> in the stepped shift mode. Therefore, at time ta<b>2</b>, the drive torque is lower when the output from the battery <b>33</b> is limited than when the output from the battery <b>33</b> is not limited. &#x201c;&#x3b5;&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> represents a decrease amount by which the drive torque when the output from the HV battery <b>33</b> is limited is lower than the drive torque when the output from the HV battery <b>33</b> is not limited at time t<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the case where the output from the HV battery <b>33</b> is not limited, the engine <b>1</b> is controlled in such a manner that the drive torque reaches the target value Tked when the response time &#x201c;&#x3b2;+&#x3b3;&#x201d; has elapsed after time ta<b>2</b>, namely, in such a manner that the time required to bring the drive torque to the target value Tked is increased by the time &#x3b3;. However, in the case where the output from the HV battery <b>33</b> is limited, if the engine <b>1</b> is controlled in the same manner as that in the case where the output from the HV battery <b>33</b> is not limited, there is a possibility that the drive torque does not reach the target value Tked at time ta<b>3</b>. As a result, the time required to bring the drive torque from the predetermined value to the target value may differ between the stepped shift mode and the continuously variable shift mode.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Therefore, in the vehicle control apparatus according to the embodiment of the invention, the ECU <b>4</b> adjusts the time &#x3b3; based on the degree of limitation on the output from the HV battery <b>33</b>. More specifically, the ECU <b>4</b> determines an output limit ratio &#x3b4; based on the SOC and the output limit value of the HV battery <b>33</b>, and determines the drive torque decrease amount &#x3b5; based on the output limit ratio &#x3b4;. Then, the ECU <b>4</b> determines a correction amount for the time &#x3b3; based on the drive torque decrease amount &#x3b5;.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The ECU <b>4</b> first determines the output limit ratio <b>8</b> based on the SOC and the output limit value of the HV battery <b>33</b>. The output limit ratio &#x3b4; is a ratio of the power that can be output from the motor generator to the maximum power output from the motor generator. More specifically, the output limit ratio &#x3b4; is determined, for example, based on a map that shows the relationship between the SOC and the output limit value, and the output limit ratio. When the output limit ratio &#x3b4; is 40%, the motor generator is able to output electric power that is only 40% of the maximum power output from the motor generator.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Next, the ECU <b>4</b> calculates the drive torque decrease amount <b>6</b> based on the determined output limit ratio <b>8</b>. More specifically, the ECU <b>4</b> stores, for example, a map that shows the relationship between the drive torque decrease amount &#x3b5; and the output limit ratio &#x3b4; in, for example, the ROM in advance, and calculates the drive torque decrease amounts based on the output limit ratio &#x3b4; with the use of the map. The ECU <b>4</b> calculates a correction amount for the time &#x3b3; by multiplying the determined drive torque decrease amounts by a drive power correction coefficient &#x3b6;(&#x3b5;&#xd7;&#x3b6;). The drive power correction coefficient &#x3b6; is a coefficient for calculating a delay in the time at which the drive torque reaches the target value Tked, the delay corresponding to the drive torque decrease amount &#x3b5;. The drive power correction coefficient &#x3b6; is obtained in advance, for example, empirically, and stored in, for example, the ROM of the ECU <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The ECU <b>4</b> adds a time &#x201c;&#x3b3;&#x2212;&#x3b5;&#xd7;&#x3b6;&#x201d;, which is obtained by correcting the time &#x3b3; by the correction amount &#x201c;&#x3b5;&#xd7;&#x3b6;&#x201d;, to the response time &#x3b2;. The time &#x201c;&#x3b3;&#x2212;&#x3b5;&#xd7;&#x3b6;&#x201d; obtained through correction is shorter than the time &#x3b3; that is used before correction. The ECU <b>4</b> controls the torque output from the engine <b>1</b> in such a manner that the drive torque reaches the target value Tked when a response time &#x201c;&#x3b2;+&#x3b3;&#x2212;&#x3b5;&#xd7;&#x3b6;&#x201d; has elapsed after time ta<b>2</b>, that is, in such a manner that the time required to bring the drive torque to the target value Tked is increased by the time &#x201c;&#x3b3;&#x2212;&#x3b5;&#xd7;&#x3b6;&#x201d;. In this way, the drive torque reaches the target value Tked at time ta<b>3</b>. Thus, even when the output from the HV battery <b>33</b> is limited, it is possible to reduce the difference in the response of the drive shaft <b>3</b> to the accelerator pedal operation amount between the continuously variable shift mode and the stepped shift mode. As a result, it is possible to provide the drivability that does not give a sense of discomfort to the driver.</p>

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Next, modifications of the vehicle control apparatus according to the above-described embodiment of the invention will be described. In the embodiment of the invention, the vehicle control apparatus according to the invention is applied to a hybrid vehicle in which the stepped shift mode is achieved when the rotating shaft <b>29</b> is locked by the brake unit <b>7</b>. However, a vehicle to which the vehicle control apparatus according to the invention is applied is not limited to such a hybrid vehicle. For example, the vehicle control apparatus according to the invention may be applied to a hybrid vehicle in which the stepped shift mode is achieved when the rotation of a motor shaft of a first motor generator MG<b>1</b> is locked, or a hybrid vehicle of a so-called multi-mode type that includes a stepped shift mechanism that is able to select a gear from among multiple gears in the stepped shift mode. In these types of hybrid vehicles, it is possible to avoid the situation, in which the electric power is supplied from the second motor generator MG<b>2</b> to the first motor generator MG<b>1</b>, and enhance the fuel efficiency by switching the shift mode to the stepped shift mode when the vehicle is traveling at a high speed in a steady state.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">A vehicle to which the vehicle control apparatus according to the invention is applied is not limited to a hybrid vehicle. Also, the power sources are not limited to an engine and a motor generator, and various power sources may be employed. For example, the vehicle control apparatus according to the invention may be applied to an electric vehicle in which only a motor generator is used as a power source and the engine is not used as a power source. That is, the vehicle control apparatus according to the invention may be applied to any vehicles in which the shift mode is switched between the continuously variable shift mode, in which the ratio of the rotational speed of a power source to the rotational speed of a drive shaft is continuously adjusted, and the stepped shift mode in which the ratio of the rotational speed of the power source to the rotational speed of the drive shaft is fixed. Accordingly, the shift mechanism is not limited to the power split mechanism, and another mechanism may be used as the shift mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Description will be provided concerning a case in which the invention is applied to a vehicle provided with a belt or toroidal continuously variable shift mechanism in addition to a stepped shift mechanism. In the vehicle provided with the belt or toroidal continuously variable shift mechanism in addition to the stepped shift mechanism, shifting performed with the use of the continuously variable shift mechanism is prohibited by switching the shift mode to the stepped shift mode when the vehicle is traveling at a high speed. As a result, it is possible to enhance the fuel efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a view showing an example of a vehicle that is provided with a belt continuously variable shift mechanism in addition to a stepped shift mechanism that adjusts the speed of rotation from a power source at a fixed gear ratio to achieve the stepped shift mode. The vehicle mainly includes a power source <b>51</b>, a torque converter <b>52</b>, a clutch <b>56</b>, a continuously variable shift mechanism <b>53</b>, gears <b>57</b>, <b>58</b> and <b>59</b>, and a drive shaft <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The power output from the power source <b>51</b> is transferred to the torque converter <b>52</b>. The torque converter <b>52</b> connects the power source to the shift mechanism via a fluid coupling, for example, oil, and has the function of switching the vehicle travel state between the forward travel state and the backward travel state. The output from the torque converter <b>52</b> is transferred to the clutch <b>56</b>. The clutch <b>56</b> is used to switch the shift mode between the stepped shift mode and the continuously variable shift mode. When the clutch <b>56</b> is disengaged, the continuously variable shift mode is achieved. On the other hand, when the clutch <b>56</b> is engaged, the stepped shift mode is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">More specifically, when the clutch <b>56</b> is disengaged, the output from the torque converter <b>52</b> is transferred to the belt continuously variable shift mechanism <b>53</b>. The belt continuously variable shift mechanism <b>53</b> is formed of a primary pulley <b>54</b><i>a</i>, a secondary pulley <b>54</b><i>b</i>, and a belt <b>55</b> which is made of, for example, metal and which is looped over these pulleys <b>54</b><i>a </i>and <b>54</b><i>b</i>. When a movable sheave <b>54</b><i>aa </i>of the primary pulley <b>54</b><i>a </i>and a movable sheave <b>54</b><i>ba </i>of the secondary pulley <b>54</b><i>b </i>are moved in the axial direction (direction indicated by the arrowed lines), the effective diameter of the belt changes. In this way, the speed of rotation output from the torque converter <b>52</b> is adjusted while the rotation is transferred from the primary pulley <b>54</b><i>a </i>to the secondary pulley <b>54</b><i>b</i>. The secondary pulley <b>54</b><i>b </i>is connected to the drive shaft <b>60</b>, and the output from the secondary pulley <b>54</b><i>b </i>is transferred to the drive shaft <b>60</b>. The output transferred to the drive shaft <b>60</b> is transferred to drive wheels <b>65</b> via gears <b>61</b>, <b>62</b> and <b>63</b> and a differential gear unit <b>64</b>. Thus, the continuously variable shift mode is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">When the clutch <b>56</b> is engaged, the output from the torque converter <b>52</b> is not transferred to the belt continuously variable shift mechanism <b>53</b> but is transferred to the drive shaft <b>60</b> via the gears <b>57</b>, <b>58</b> and <b>59</b>. At this time, the speed of rotation output from the torque converter <b>52</b> is adjusted based on the gear ratio among the gears <b>57</b>, <b>58</b> and <b>59</b>, and then, transferred to the drive shaft <b>60</b>. Therefore, the gears <b>57</b>, <b>58</b> and <b>59</b> function as a stepped shift mechanism. The output transferred to the drive shaft <b>60</b> is transferred to the drive wheels <b>65</b> via the gears <b>61</b>, <b>62</b> and <b>63</b> and the differential gear unit <b>64</b>. Thus, the stepped shift mode is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the vehicle provided with the above-described belt continuously variable shift mechanism, reaction forces from the pulleys, which correspond to the torque output from the power source, change due to shifting in the continuously variable shift mechanism <b>53</b>. Therefore, the time that is required to bring the drive torque to the target value is longer in the continuously variable shift mode than in the stepped shift mode. Accordingly, the vehicle control apparatus according to the invention is applied to the vehicle that is provided with the belt continuously variable shift mechanism. More specifically, in the stepped shift mode, the torque output from the power source <b>51</b> is controlled in such a manner that the time that is required to bring the drive torque to the target value is increased by a predetermined time. Thus, the time required to bring the drive torque from the predetermined value to the target value in the stepped shift mode is made equal to the time required to bring the drive torque from the predetermined value to the target value in the continuously variable shift mode. Accordingly, the difference in drivability between the continuously variable shift mode and the stepped shift mode is minimized. As a result, it is possible to provide the drivability that does not give a sense of discomfort to the driver.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the example described above, the vehicle control apparatus according to the invention is applied to the vehicle provided with the belt continuously variable shift mechanism in addition to the stepped skill mechanism. Alternatively, the vehicle control apparatus according to the invention may be applied to a vehicle provided with a toroidal continuously variable shift mechanism instead of a belt continuously variable shift mechanism. The toroidal continuously variable shift mechanism includes an input disc, an output disc, and a power roller that is clamped between these discs, and is able to perform shifting by controlling the position of the power roller. A power source is connected to the input disc, and a drive shaft is connected to the output disc. When the vehicle control apparatus according to the invention is applied to the vehicle that is provided with the toroidal continuously variable shift mechanism in addition to the stepped shift mechanism, the effect described above is obtained. That is, the difference in drivability between the continuously variable shift mode and the stepped shift mode is minimized. As a result, it possible to provide the drivability that does not give a sense of discomfort to the driver.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The vehicle control apparatus according to the invention may be applied to a vehicle provided with a torque converter. The torque converter has two modes, that is, a mode in which a power source and a transmission are connected to each other via a fluid coupling, for example, oil, whereby the speed ratio is continuously adjusted (fluid coupling mode) and a mode in which the power source and the transmission are mechanically connected to each other via a friction engaging element, for example, a lockup clutch (connection mode). When the vehicle is traveling in a steady state, the connection mode is selected so that it is possible to avoid a transfer loss that is caused when the fluid coupling is used in the fluid coupling mode. As a result, it is possible to enhance the fuel efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the vehicle provided with the torque converter, the torque that is output from the power source is decreased by a reaction force from the fluid in the fluid coupling mode. Therefore, the time that is required to bring the drive torque to the target value is longer in the fluid coupling mode than in the connection mode. That is, in the vehicle provided with the torque converter, the fluid coupling mode corresponds to the continuously variable shift mode, and the connection mode corresponds to the stepped shift mode.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Therefore, in the vehicle provided with the torque converter, the effect described above is obtained by employing the vehicle control apparatus according to the invention. That is, in the connection mode, the torque output from the power source is controlled in such a manner that the time required to bring the drive torque to the target value is increased by a predetermined time. In this way, the time that is required to bring the drive torque to the target value in the connection mode is made equal to the time that is required to bring the drive torque to the target value in the fluid coupling mode. Accordingly, the difference in drivability between the fluid coupling mode and the connection mode is minimized. As a result, it is possible to provide the drivability that does not give a sense of discomfort to the driver.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In each of the vehicles in the modifications described above, an energy storage unit, for example, a battery, that is provided outside the power source and that is able to supply energy to the power source may be provided. When the output from the energy storage unit is limited, control that is similar to the control that is executed when the output from the HV battery <b>33</b> is limited is executed. That is, in the stepped shift mode, the amount of energy that can be supplied from the energy storage unit to the power source is detected, and the time that is required to bring the drive torque to the target value is adjusted based on the detected amount of energy that can be supplied to the power source. With this control, even when the SOC is low or the amount of energy that can be supplied to the power source is decreased due to an influence of, for example, heat, and therefore the drive torque is decreased, the difference in drivability between the continuously variable shift mode and the stepped shift mode is minimized. As a result, it is possible to provide the drivability that does not give a sense of discomfort to the driver.</p>
