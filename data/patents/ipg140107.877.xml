<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to the field of power generation and, more particularly, to a solar energy power generation system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The high cost, diminishing supply and environmental impact of fossil fuels continues to promote interest in solar energy and other alternative clean energy sources. Solar energy has been used to heat water for use in homes and businesses for many years. Likewise, direct conversion of solar energy to electricity has been used for many years for satellites and spacecraft. But, these existing solar energy systems typically have low thermal efficiencies, require large installation areas and/or require expensive components. As a result, systems to efficiently and cost effectively convert solar energy to electricity are not available to the general public.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, there is a need for a more efficient and economical system to generate electricity from solar energy.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides a system for generating AC electrical power from solar radiation through the use of parabolic troughs capturing the energy and a fluid turbine to convert the solar energy to mechanical energy.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">While the making and using of various embodiments of the present invention are discussed in detail below, it should be appreciated that the present invention provides many applicable inventive concepts that can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed herein are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the invention and do not delimit the scope of the invention. The discussion herein relates primarily to reflective parabolic trough solar collectors, but it will be understood that the concepts of the present invention are applicable to any type of solar collector, such as a parabolic dish.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present invention provides a system for generating AC electrical power from solar radiation through the use of parabolic troughs capturing the energy and a fluid turbine to convert the solar energy to mechanical energy. The turbine is directly coupled to a generator to produce AC electrical power.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a high level block diagram of a solar energy power generation system <b>100</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown. The solar energy power generation system <b>100</b> provides an encapsulated solution in which all components and fluids are fully contained within a single compact unit. The major subsystems of the solar energy power generation system <b>100</b> are a turbine and generator assembly <b>102</b> and a solar collector array <b>104</b> that can have one or more solar collectors (troughs) <b>106</b>. In one example, the turbine and generator assembly <b>102</b> weighs approximately 150 lbs and is approximately 4 ft&#xd7;2 ft&#xd7;2 ft, and the solar collector (trough) <b>106</b> weighs approximately 105 lbs and is approximately 4 ft&#xd7;12 ft. The turbine and generator assembly <b>102</b> are connected to the one or more solar collectors (troughs) <b>106</b> with input <b>108</b> and output <b>110</b> hoses or pipes. A low power cable <b>112</b> (e.g., 5V) runs from the turbine and generator assembly <b>102</b> to the one or more solar collectors (troughs) <b>106</b>). Power generated by the turbine and generator assembly <b>102</b> is provided to the home, building, business, electrical load or utility circuit via a power connection <b>114</b>. Note that various meters, relays, breakers, reverse power flow sensors and other monitoring/protection devices may be installed between the generator and the home, building, business, electrical load or utility circuit. The turbine and generator assembly <b>102</b> and the solar collector (troughs) <b>106</b> will be described in more detail below. Note that the number of solar collectors (troughs) <b>106</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is merely for illustration purposes and present invention is not limited to the number of solar collector shown.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a block diagram of a turbine and generator assembly <b>102</b> connected to solar collector (trough) <b>106</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown. The turbine and generator assembly <b>102</b> is contained within a weather resistant cabinet <b>200</b> suitable for ground or attic installations. The solar energy power generation system <b>100</b> can be controlled and monitored by user interface <b>202</b> (software) that allows remote control and monitoring of the system. The user interface <b>202</b> is not the code running on the controller <b>204</b> (e.g., Programmable Logic Controller). Instead, user interface <b>202</b> provides allows a user to track power consumption, power production, system diagnostics and other control/monitoring functions. The user interface <b>202</b> can be installed on any user device communicably coupled to the controller. For example, the user device may include a computer, a laptop, a PDA, a phone, a mobile communications device or other electronic device. The user device having user interface <b>202</b> can be communicably coupled to the controller <b>204</b> via a direct connection, a network connection, a USB connection, a wireless network, a wide area network or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The solar collector <b>106</b> includes one or more support structures for securely mounting the solar collector <b>106</b> to a surface (not shown), a reflective parabolic trough for concentrating solar energy along a focal axis, one or more receiver tubes <b>206</b> attached to the reflective parabolic trough along the focal axis, a motor <b>208</b> operably connected to the reflective parabolic trough to rotate the reflective parabolic trough around the longitudinal axis, and a solar tracking device or circuit <b>210</b>. A typical installation will have eight to twenty solar collectors <b>106</b>, although the exact number of solar collectors <b>106</b> will be determined by various design specifications, such as energy requirements, geographic location, physical constraints and other factors.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The weather resistant cabinet <b>200</b> provides protection and concealment of a fluid/vapor turbine <b>212</b> having a drive shaft <b>214</b>, a generator <b>216</b> connected to the drive shaft <b>214</b> of the fluid/vapor turbine <b>212</b>, a controller <b>204</b>, a pressure vessel <b>218</b> and a primer/boost pump <b>220</b>. The generator <b>216</b> and the fluid/vapor turbine <b>212</b> can be directly coupled or coupled through a transmission or gear assembly. Note that the fluid/vapor turbine <b>212</b> can be a Tesla or Sterling engine. The fluid/vapor turbine <b>212</b>, pressure vessel <b>218</b> and primer/boost pump <b>220</b> are connected together and to the receiver tube(s) <b>206</b> with input <b>108</b> and output <b>110</b> hoses or pipes. A low power cable <b>112</b> (e.g., 5V) runs from the cabinet <b>200</b> to each solar collector <b>106</b> (typically in a daisy chain). Power generated by the generator <b>216</b> is provided to the home, building, business, electrical load or utility circuit via a power connection <b>114</b>. Note that various meters, relays, breakers, reverse power flow sensors and other monitoring/protection devices may be installed between the generator and the home, building, business, electrical load or utility circuit.

<p id="p-0041" num="0071">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, diagrams of a solar tracking device or circuit <b>210</b> mounted on the reflective parabolic trough <b>400</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention are shown. The solar tracking device or circuit <b>210</b> includes one or more sensors. In this embodiment, the one or more sensors include three or more photosensitive diodes <b>500</b> disposed on the reflective parabolic trough <b>400</b> such that when the reflective parabolic through <b>400</b> is properly aligned: (a) at least a first of the photosensitive diodes <b>500</b><i>a </i>is positioned within a center <b>504</b> of a shadow <b>502</b> cast by the receiver tube(s) <b>206</b>, (b) a least a second of the photosensitive diodes <b>500</b><i>b </i>is positioned within and near a first edge <b>506</b> of the shadow <b>502</b> cast by the receiver tube(s) <b>206</b>, and (c) a least a third of the photosensitive diodes <b>500</b><i>c </i>is positioned within and near a second edge <b>508</b> of the shadow <b>502</b> cast by the receiver tube(s) <b>206</b>. The solar tracking device <b>210</b> can position the solar collector <b>106</b> at a previously recorded time-based position whenever the one or more sensors <b>500</b> do not provide a position to maximize the solar energy collected by the receiver tube(s) <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0072">The solar tracking device or circuit <b>210</b> measures the difference in light intensity measured by the photosensitive diodes <b>500</b> and if the diodes in sunlight (e.g., <b>500</b><i>b </i>or <b>500</b><i>c</i>) move to the shadow <b>502</b>, the tracking motor <b>209</b> (e.g., stepper motor) adjusts the position of the reflective parabolic trough <b>400</b> to move the diodes (e.g., <b>500</b><i>b </i>or <b>500</b><i>c</i>) back into sunlight. If this cannot be achieved within a pre-defined number of steps, the solar tracking device or circuit <b>210</b> will position the reflective parabolic trough <b>400</b> to a prior days position for the given time slot. As a result, the solar tracking device <b>210</b> aligns each solar collector <b>106</b> to be in the correct position to maximize the solar energy collected by the receiver tube(s) <b>206</b> regardless of weather conditions.</p>
