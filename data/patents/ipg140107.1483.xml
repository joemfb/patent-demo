<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to step drill bits for drilling holes in wood, metal and the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Step drill bits are used to drill generally larger holes in a work piece that may be a material such as wood and metal. The step drill bits typically have a series of steps, or cutting disks, that increase in diameter from the tip of the bit to the back end of the bit. This allows the step drill bit to cut and drill successively larger holes in the work piece, until the desired sized of the hole is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">These types of bits, step drill bits, are generally more efficient for a user when compared with other types of bits because they do not require a pilot hole to be drilled first. Rather, the tip of the step drill bit acts to drill the first hole, and the successive steps gradually increase the diameter of the hole. This is advantageous in that it does not require a user to continuously replace drill bits with progressively larger drill bits until the hole in the work piece is the desired size. Moreover, this configuration and lack of changing bits may create a straighter hole with less chance that a bit is used to drill at an incorrect angle. Thus, a step drill bit is advantageous and useful for drilling holes.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides an adjustable step drill bit for drilling holes of various sizes that generally includes a first stop disposed on a shaft. The first stop may be a drill tip. The shaft generally has a shank portion disposed adjacent the first stop, a threaded portion disposed adjacent the shank portion and an engagement portion disposed adjacent the threaded portion. The adjustable drill bit also includes a plurality of cutting disks disposed on the shank. In addition, a second stop is rotatably received on the threaded portion of the shaft such that the cutting disks are held in compression between the first stop and the second stop.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is contemplated that the second stop comprises a nut.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is further contemplated that at least one spacer is disposed between two cutting disks.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is also contemplated that the shank portion has a keyed shaft and that each cutting disk has a channel configured complementary to the keyed shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The engagement portion may include a cross section such as a hexagonal shape, a cylindrical shape, a non-cylindrical shape, and a square shape.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is further contemplated that a safety cap be disposed over the drill tip.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an embodiment of the invention the cutting disks each include a diameter and the cutting disks are configured from the first stop such that the diameters of the cutting disk progressively increase.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another embodiment of the invention, the cutting disks each include a diameter and the cutting disks are configured from the second stop such that the diameters of the cutting disk progressively increase.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is further contemplated that the drill tip be integrally formed to the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In addition to providing the benefits of a typical step drill bit, a step drill bit according to the present invention provides numerous advantageous for a user. For example, a step drill bit according to the present invention will allow a user to select only those cutting disks that are necessary to drill the hole that is needed. This is beneficial because it may avoid the situation where a user's step drill bit is too large for the hole needed (which would create to large of a hole). Rather, a user would be able to configure the step drill bit to drill the required hole size.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition, a step drill bit according to the present invention will allow a user to use the shaft and the drill tip to drill a pilot hole and then arrange the cutting disks in a configuration that will allow the step drill bit to be used with a pulling technique.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Furthermore, a step drill bit according to the present invention can be used for drilling especially thick work pieces. The inclusion of the spacers, along with the user's ability to configure the workpiece, may allow for the step drill bit to be used in especially thick work pieces where typical step drill bits may not be as useful.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It will be readily understood that the components of the embodiments as generally described and illustrated in the Figures herein could be arranged and designed in a wide variety of different configurations. Thus, the following more detailed description of various embodiments, as represented in the Figures, is not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure, but is merely representative of various embodiments. While the various aspects of the embodiments are presented in drawings, the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale unless specifically indicated.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics. The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. All changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Reference throughout this specification to features, advantages, or similar language does not imply that all of the features and advantages that may be realized with the present invention should be or are in any single embodiment of the invention. Rather, language referring to the features and advantages is understood to mean that a specific feature, advantage, or characteristic described in connection with an embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, discussion of the features and advantages, and similar language, throughout this specification may, but does not necessarily, refer to the same embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Furthermore, the described features, advantages, and characteristics of the invention may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific features or advantages of a particular embodiment. In other instances, additional features and advantages may be recognized in certain embodiments that may not be present in all embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">With reference to the accompanying Figures, an adjustable drill bit <b>10</b> according to the present invention includes a first stop <b>12</b>, a shaft <b>14</b>, a plurality of cutting disks <b>16</b>, and a second stop <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The first stop <b>12</b> is disposed on the shaft <b>14</b> and it may be integrally formed therewith. The first stop <b>12</b> may be a drill tip <b>20</b>. Since the first stop <b>12</b> maybe be a drill tip <b>20</b>, a user may not need to drill a pilot hole with a separate drill bit. Rather, the drill tip <b>20</b> will act to drill and create the pilot hole in the work piece.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The shaft <b>14</b> generally has a shank portion <b>22</b> disposed adjacent the first stop <b>12</b>, a threaded portion <b>24</b> disposed adjacent the shank portion <b>22</b> and an engagement portion <b>26</b> disposed adjacent the threaded portion <b>24</b>. The engagement portion <b>26</b> may have a cross sectional shape such as a hexagonal shape, a cylindrical shape, a non-cylindrical shape, and a square shape. The engagement portion <b>26</b> is intended to be inserted into a device capable of providing rotary motion to the drill bit <b>10</b>, such as a hand drill or a drill press.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The cutting disks <b>16</b> are disposed on the shank portion <b>22</b> of the shaft <b>14</b>. A cutting disk <b>16</b> may be generally circular and have a wedged shaped cut out portion <b>42</b>. The wedged shaped cut out portion <b>42</b> creates two cutting surfaces <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>b </i>that allow the drill bit <b>10</b> to be used to drill in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction of rotation. Alternately, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the cutting disk <b>16</b>, may include two wedged shaped cut out portions <b>42</b>, which create four cutting surfaces <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>b</i>, <b>44</b><i>c</i>, <b>44</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In addition to cutting disks <b>16</b>, spacers <b>28</b> may be disposed on the shank portion <b>22</b>. A spacer <b>28</b> may be a cutting disk <b>16</b> that is the same size as a cutting disk <b>16</b> adjacent thereto. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, spacer <b>28</b><i>a </i>is the same size as cutting disk <b>16</b><i>a </i>and spacer <b>28</b><i>b </i>is the same size as cutting disk <b>16</b><i>b</i>. The spacer <b>28</b> may be used when needed for particularly thick work pieces.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In order to transfer the rotational force from the shaft <b>14</b> to the cutting disks <b>16</b>, it is preferred that the shank portion <b>22</b> of the shaft <b>14</b> be a keyed shank portion <b>30</b>. One example may be a generally circular shaped keyed shank portion <b>32</b> with four ridges <b>34</b> located on the circumference of the circular shaped keyed shank portion <b>32</b>. The cutting disk <b>16</b> may include a channel <b>36</b> configured complementary to the circular shaped keyed shank portion <b>32</b> of the shaft <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The second stop <b>18</b> is rotatably received on the threaded portion <b>24</b> of the shaft <b>14</b> such that the cutting disks <b>16</b> are held in compression between the first stop <b>12</b> and the second stop <b>18</b>. The second stop <b>18</b> may comprise a nut <b>38</b>. Utilizing a second stop <b>18</b> that is rotatably received on the shaft <b>14</b> allows the user to configure the drill bit <b>10</b> in a configuration that meets the user's particular needs. Since the second stop <b>18</b> is rotatably received, a user can arrange the cutting disk <b>16</b> on the shaft <b>14</b> and then tighten the second stop <b>18</b>. The cutting disks <b>16</b> will be held in compression between the first stop <b>12</b> and the second stop <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in one possible configuration the cutting disks <b>16</b> each include a diameter and the cutting disks <b>16</b> are configured from the first stop <b>12</b> such that the diameters of the cutting disk <b>16</b> progressively increase.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in another possible configuration, a user may modify the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> with spacers <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in another potential configuration of the drill bit <b>10</b>, the cutting disks <b>16</b> each include a diameter and the cutting disks <b>16</b> are configured from the second stop <b>18</b> such that the diameters of the cutting disk <b>16</b> progressively increase. In other words, relative to the drill tip <b>12</b>, the diameters of the cutting disks <b>16</b> progressively decrease. In this type of configuration, it is contemplated that a safety cap <b>40</b> be disposed over the drill tip <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">This last configuration is believed to be beneficial where it is desired to drill with a pulling technique. The user may use the drill bit <b>10</b> without any cutting disks <b>16</b> to drill a pilot hole in the work piece. Subsequently, the user arranges the drill bit <b>10</b> with the appropriate configuration of cutting disks <b>16</b> and/or spacers <b>28</b>. Then the drill bit <b>10</b> may be inserted through the pilot hole. The user may then attach the engagement portion <b>26</b> to a tool designed to impart a rotational force, such as a drill, or a drill press. The drill bit <b>10</b> may then be pulled through the pilot hole.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Without further elaboration, it is believed that one skilled in the art can use the preceding description to utilize the present disclosure to its fullest extent. The examples and embodiments disclosed herein are to be construed as merely illustrative and not a limitation of the scope of the present disclosure in any way. It will be apparent to those having skill in the art that changes may be made to the details of the above-described embodiments without departing from the underlying principles of the disclosure provided herein. In other words, various modifications and improvements of the embodiments specifically disclosed in the description above are within the scope of the appended claims.
