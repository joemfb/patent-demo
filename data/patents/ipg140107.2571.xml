<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an LED chip package structure and a method for making the same, and particularly relates to an LED chip package structure using sedimentation and a method for making the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a known LED package structure includes a substrate <b>1</b>, an LED <b>2</b> disposed on the substrate <b>1</b>, two wires <b>3</b>, and a colloid layer <b>4</b> with phosphor powder <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The LED <b>2</b> has a light-emitting surface <b>20</b> opposite to the substrate <b>1</b>. The LED <b>2</b> has a positive electrode area <b>21</b> and a negative electrode area <b>22</b> electrically connected to two corresponding positive and negative electrode areas <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> of the substrate <b>1</b> via the two <b>3</b> respectively. Moreover, the colloid layer <b>4</b> with the phosphor powder <b>40</b> covers the LED <b>2</b> and the two wires <b>3</b> for protecting the LED <b>2</b>. Therefore, when the LED <b>2</b> is a blue LED, the blue light generated by the blue LED can pass through the colloid layer <b>4</b> with the phosphor powder <b>40</b> to generate white light.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, the phosphor powder <b>40</b> does not be uniformly mixed into the colloid layer <b>4</b>. Hence, when the blue light generated by the blue LED can pass through the colloid layer <b>4</b> with the phosphor powder <b>40</b> to generate white light, &#x201c;the condensing capability&#x201d; and &#x201c;the color and luster&#x201d; of the white light are bad and non-uniform.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One particular aspect of the present invention is to provide an LED chip package structure using sedimentation and a method for making the same. Because the powder of the present invention can be fully deposited on the inner surface of the package body, &#x201c;the condensing capability&#x201d; and &#x201c;the color and luster&#x201d; of the present invention are good and uniform. In other words, the powder of the present invention can be fully deposited on the inner surface of the package body, so that light generated by the light-emitting elements can pass through the uniform package colloid layer to project uniform light beams out. Hence, the present invention can generate a best light-projecting quality.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to achieve the above-mentioned aspects, the present invention provides an LED chip package structure using sedimentation, including: a package body, at least two conductive substrates, at least one light-emitting element, and a package unit. The package body has a receiving space. The two conductive substrates are received in the receiving space. The light-emitting element is received in the receiving space and electrically connected to the two conductive substrates. The powder is uniformly deposited in the receiving space by maintaining the package unit at room temperature firstly and the powder is solidified in the receiving space by heating to a predetermined temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Moreover, the package unit has the following three aspects:</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">1. First aspect: The package unit has a package colloid layer and a powder mixed into the package colloid layer, and the package unit is filled into the receiving space.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">2. Second aspect: The package unit has a package colloid layer with powder and a transparent colloid layer received in the receiving space. The light-emitting element is covered by the package colloid layer with the powder, and the transparent colloid layer is disposed on the package colloid layer in order to protect the package colloid layer.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">3. Third aspect: The package unit has a package colloid layer with powder and a transparent colloid layer received in the receiving space. The light-emitting element is covered by the transparent colloid layer, and the package colloid layer is disposed on the transparent colloid layer in order to prevent the quality of the package colloid layer from being affected by heat generated by the light-emitting element.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In order to achieve the above-mentioned aspects, the present invention provides a method for making an LED chip package structure using sedimentation, including: receiving at least one light-emitting element in a receiving space of a package body; electrically connecting the light-emitting element with two conductive substrates that are received in the receiving space; filling a package colloid layer with powder into the receiving space; and maintaining the package colloid layer with the powder at room temperature in order to uniformly depositing the powder in the receiving space.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Moreover, after the step of maintaining the package colloid layer, the method further includes heating the package colloid layer with the powder in order to solidify the package colloid layer with the powder in the receiving space. In addition, the step of heating the package colloid layer is a one-step heating process that includes a heating temperature of 80&#x2dc;150&#xb0; C. and a heating time of 1&#x2dc;6 hours; Alternatively, the step of heating the package colloid layer is a two-step heating process that includes a first-step heating process and a second-step heating process, the first-step heating process has a heating temperature of 30&#x2dc;100&#xb0; C. and a heating time of 10&#x2dc;120 minutes, and the second-step heating process has a heating temperature of 80&#x2dc;150&#xb0; C. and a heating time of 1&#x2dc;6 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Furthermore, after the step of heating the package colloid layer, the method further includes: filling a transparent colloid layer in the receiving space of the package body in order to form the transparent colloid layer on the package colloid layer with the powder; and heating the transparent colloid layer to 80-150&#xb0; C. during 1-6 hours in order to solidify the transparent colloid layer.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In addition, in another embodiment, before the step of filling the package colloid layer with the powder into the receiving space, the method further includes: filling a transparent colloid layer in the receiving space of the package body in order to cover the light-emitting element; and heating the transparent colloid layer to 80-150&#xb0; C. during 1-6 hours in order to solidify the transparent colloid layer, wherein the package colloid layer is disposed on the transparent colloid layer.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Therefore, the package colloid layer with the powder is fully deposited firstly, and then the package colloid layer with the powder is heated, in order to make the powder be fully deposited in the receiving space of the package body. Hence, the present invention can prevent non-deposited powder from be solidified in the receiving space of the package body. In addition, the curing time can be decreased, so that the usage life of the package colloid layer with the powder is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Furthermore, the present invention has the following three deposition types according to different light-projecting properties and package structures</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">1. First type is a single deposition as the first embodiment. The advantage is: the manufacture process is simple.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">2. Second type is a dual-layer structure with an inner deposition as the second embodiment. The advantage is: the dual-layer structure has two colloid layers that have the same or different physical property and chemical property such as adhesiveness, hardness or refractive index etc. In addition, the optical quality and the package structure of the second type are good.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">3. Third type is a dual-layer structure with an outer deposition as the third embodiment. The advantage is: the package colloid layer is disposed on the transparent colloid layer in order to prevent the quality and the usage life of the package colloid layer from being affected (decreased) by heat generated by the light-emitting element.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary, and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed. Other advantages and features of the invention will be apparent from the following description, drawings and claims.</p>
