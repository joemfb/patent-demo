<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-250436 filed on Oct. 30, 2009, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an in-vehicle device for storing information of a gadget and for displaying an icon corresponding to the gadget on a screen.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">JP-A-2009-26239 teaches that an icon corresponding to a gadget is displayed on a screen of an information processing device such as a personal computer. The icon is a pictorial figure having a predetermined pixel for representing the contents of the gadget. In this case, when a user touches the icon on the screen, the function corresponding to the gadget is performed, or the program corresponding to the gadget is executed. Here, the gadget is a program for accessing a tool easily, which the user uses very often. The gadget is also defined as a widget.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recently, a technique for a GUI (graphical user interface) in an in-vehicle device is much improved. The in-vehicle device may display an icon corresponding to the gadget. The in-vehicle device is mounted on a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When the gadget such as a clock program provides information to the user, the information is changed with time. In this case, the display content of the icon on the screen is also changed with time. When the icon having the display content, which is changed with time, is displayed on a screen of the in-vehicle device, the user may watch the icon when the vehicle stops running. Further, the user may watch the icon when the vehicle runs. Thus, it is necessary to consider visibility of the icon even when the vehicle runs. Specifically, when the vehicle stops running, the user easily recognizes the icon so that the change of the contents of the icon is easily checked by the user. On the other hand, when the vehicle runs, it is difficult for the user to watch the icon sufficiently. Thus, the user may not recognize the change of the contents of the icon. As a result, the display of the icon may be useless.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of the above-described problem, it is an object of the present disclosure to provide an in-vehicle device for storing information of a gadget and for displaying an icon corresponding to the gadget on a screen. Visibility of the icon is improved even when the vehicle runs, and a display content of the icon is changed with time.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, an in-vehicle device includes: a memory for storing a gadget corresponding to an icon, a display content of which is changed with time, wherein the gadget provides a process; a display having a screen, on which the icon is displayed; an operation receiver for receiving an operation to the icon; a controller for executing the process when the controller determines that the operation receiver receives the operation to the icon under a condition that the display displays the icon; and a driving condition information obtaining element for obtaining driving condition information of a vehicle. The controller controls the display to change a display mode of the icon based on the driving condition information when the display displays the icon.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the above device, the display mode of the icon is changed so that a user of the in-vehicle device easily and visually recognizes the display content of the icon even when the content is changed with time, and the user drives the vehicle. Thus, the visibility of the icon is improved.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">(First Embodiment)</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an in-vehicle device <b>1</b>. The in-vehicle device <b>1</b> is mounted on a vehicle. The device <b>1</b> includes a controller <b>2</b>, a gadget memory <b>3</b>, a display unit <b>4</b>, an operation receiver <b>5</b>, a communication unit <b>6</b>, a USB interface <b>7</b>, an in-vehicle LAN interface <b>8</b> and a flash player memory <b>9</b>, which are coupled with each other. The in-vehicle LAN interface <b>8</b> provides a driving condition obtaining element for obtaining driving condition information.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The controller <b>2</b> includes a CPU, a RAM and a ROM. The controller <b>2</b> executes a control program so that the controller <b>2</b> controls operation of the in-vehicle device <b>1</b>. Here, the operation of the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> is, for example, data management operation and communication operation. The gadget memory <b>3</b> stores a gadget received by a communication unit <b>6</b> from a server <b>10</b> via a broad band wireless communication line such as a mobile communication line and a fixed communication line. Further, the memory <b>3</b> stores a gadget transmitted from a USB memory <b>11</b> to a USB interface <b>7</b>. The USB memory <b>11</b> is detachable from the in-vehicle device <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The gadget to be stored in the memory <b>3</b> is, for example, a program for providing information, which is changed with time. Specifically, when the gadget is a clock program, the information is time information so that the time information is changed with time. Alternatively, the gadget may be a program for providing information, which is not changed with time. Specifically, when the gadget is an image display program, the information is image information so that the image information is not changed with time. When the gadget is the program for providing time variant information to the user, the display contents of the icon corresponding to the gadget is changed with time. For example, when the icon is an image of an analog clock, a hand of the clock is changed with time. When the icon is an image of a digital clock, a numeral is changed with time. When the gadget is the program for providing constant information, which is not changed with time, the display contents of the icon corresponding to the gadget is not changed with time.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The display unit <b>4</b> is a liquid crystal display device, for example. When a display instruction signal is input from the controller <b>2</b> into the unit <b>4</b>, the unit <b>4</b> displays an image on a screen based on the display instruction signal. The operation receiver <b>5</b> is, for example, a touch switch, which is formed on the screen of the display unit <b>4</b>. When the user touches the touch switch, i.e., when the user operates the touch switch, an operation, detection signal corresponding to operation contents of the touch switch is output to the controller <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The in-vehicle LAN interface <b>8</b> is coupled with a ECU and a sensor via an in-vehicle LAN. The ECU and the sensor are mounted on the vehicle.

The predetermined period is set preliminary to be, for example, one day or one month. When the content of the icon is not changed within the predetermined period, the gadget corresponding to the icon is not defined as the gadget corresponding to the icon that the content is changed with time. In this case, the gadget is excluded from an object of the gadget.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The display size of the icon is changed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 4B</figref>. Alternatively, when the icon merely includes a digit or a character, the digit or the character may be changed to be large. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, the background color of the icon is changed to the advancing color or the expansive color. Alternatively, the background color of the region other than the icon may be change to a retreating color or a contracting color. The retreating color seems to recede behind another color although the retreating color is applied on the same plane. The contracting color is a dark color seems to be contracted small.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Alternatively, the display position on the screen may be changed. Specifically, for example, when the vehicle is a right steering wheel vehicle, the icon may be displaced from a left side to a right side of the screen. Here, the left side of the screen is a far side with respect to the driver, and the right side of the screen is a near side with respect to the driver. Alternatively, the display size, the display color and the display position may be changed at the sate time.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the above embodiments, the controller <b>2</b> determines based on the vehicle speed signal input from the vehicle speed sensor into the LAN interface <b>8</b> whether the vehicle runs.
