<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a detector for detecting sulfur components.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A SO<sub>x </sub>concentration sensor for detecting a SO<sub>x </sub>concentration in exhaust gas is known. A normal SO<sub>x </sub>concentration sensor measures electromotive force produced when SO<sub>x </sub>changes into sulfuric acid ion within a solid electrolyte, in order to detect a SO<sub>x </sub>concentration in the exhaust gas. However, it is difficult for this SO<sub>x </sub>concentration sensor to detect an accurate SO<sub>x </sub>concentration when the SO<sub>x </sub>concentration in the exhaust gas is low.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A proposed detector for detecting sulfur components cannot detect an instantaneous SO<sub>x </sub>concentration but can detect an integrated amount of SO<sub>x </sub>passing through the exhaust passage during a given period (for example, refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2008-175623).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The detector for detecting sulfur components comprises a SO<sub>x </sub>storage portion for storing SO<sub>x </sub>contained in the exhaust gas, measures a property such as electric resistance, volume, heat capacity or the like of the SO<sub>x </sub>storage portion, which changes according to the increase in an amount of SO<sub>x </sub>stored in the SO<sub>x </sub>storage portion, and detects an integrated amount of SO<sub>x </sub>passing through the exhaust passage during a given period on the basis of the measured property.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Since it is difficult to accurately measure a change in electric resistance, volume, heat capacity or the like, the above-mentioned detector may be not able to accurately detect an integrated amount of SO<sub>x </sub>passing through the exhaust passage during a given period.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a detector for detecting sulfur components, which can accurately detect an integrated amount of SO<sub>x </sub>passing through the exhaust passage in a given period or a value on the basis of the integrated amount.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A first detector for detecting sulfur components of the present invention is provided. The first detector comprises a storage portion for storing SO<sub>x </sub>and NO<sub>x </sub>in the exhaust gas passing through an exhaust passage, in which the more an amount of stored SO<sub>x </sub>increases, the more an amount of stored NO<sub>x </sub>decreases, and which does not release SO<sub>x </sub>but release NO<sub>x </sub>at a set temperature, and a temperature sensor, estimates the amount of stored SO<sub>x </sub>on the basis of a relationship between, after the storage portion becomes the set temperature by heating, a heating pattern of the storage portion and temperature change of the storage portion measured by the temperature sensor, and defects an integrated amount of SO<sub>x </sub>passing through the exhaust passage during a given period or an value on the basis of the integrated amount.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A second detector for detecting sulfur components of the present invention is provided as the first detector characterized in that the heating pattern being set so as to elevate the temperature of the storage portion when NO<sub>x </sub>is not stored by a predetermined temperature per unit time, so that the temperature of the storage portion while NO<sub>x </sub>is stored elevates by a temperature lower than the predetermined temperature per unit time by the heating pattern, all of the NO<sub>x </sub>released from the storage portion being estimated on the basis that NO<sub>x </sub>is released during a period in which the temperature of the storage portion elevates by the temperature lower than the predetermined temperature per unit time, and the amount of stored SO<sub>x </sub>being estimated on the basis of all of the released NO<sub>x</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A third detector for detecting sulfur components of the present invention is provided as the first or second detector characterized in that the storage portion being elevated to the set temperature and over by heating of the exhaust gas, and the amount of stored SO<sub>x </sub>being estimated on the basis of the heating pattern by the exhaust gas.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A fourth detector for detecting sulfur components of the present invention is provided as the first or second detector characterized in that an electric heater being provided to heat the storage portion, the storage portion being elevated to the set temperature and over by heating of the electric heater, and the amount of stored SO<sub>x </sub>being estimated on the basis of the heating pattern by the electric heater.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A fifth detector for detecting sulfur components of the present invention is provided as the first, second, third, or fourth detector characterized in that when the oxygen concentration in the exhaust gas being lowered, the storage portion releasing the stored NO<sub>x </sub>and reducing the released NO<sub>x </sub>by using of reduction materials in the exhaust gas, so that the temperature of the storage portion elevates by heat produced in the reduction of NO<sub>x</sub>, if necessary, the amount of stored SO<sub>x </sub>being estimated on the basis of an increase value of temperature of the storage portion measured by the temperature sensor after the oxygen concentration in the exhaust gas is lowered, and the integrated amount of SO<sub>x </sub>passing through the exhaust passage during the given period or the value on the basis of the integrated amount being detected.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to the first detector for detecting sulfur components of the present invention, the storage portion in which the more an amount of stored SO<sub>x </sub>increases, the more an amount of stored NO<sub>x </sub>decreases, does not release SO<sub>x </sub>but release NO<sub>x </sub>at the set temperature. An amount of NO<sub>x </sub>stored in the storage portion can be estimated on the basis of a relationship between, after the storage portion becomes the set temperature by heating, a heating pattern of the storage portion and temperature change of the storage portion measured by the temperature sensor. Therefore, because the larger an amount of stored NO<sub>x </sub>is, the smaller an amount of SO<sub>x </sub>stored in the storage portion is, an amount of stored SO<sub>x </sub>can be estimated. A given rate of an amount of SO<sub>x </sub>passing through the exhaust passage is stored in the storage portion of the detector. Therefore, an integrated amount of SO<sub>x </sub>passing through the exhaust passage during the given period or a value on the basis of the integrated amount can be accurately detected on the basis of the amount of SO<sub>x </sub>stored in the storage portion.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the second detector for detecting sulfur components of the present invention, in the first detector, the heating pattern of the storage portion is set so as to elevate the temperature of the storage portion when NO<sub>x </sub>is not stored by a predetermined temperature per unit time, so that the temperature of the storage portion while NO<sub>x </sub>is stored in the storage portion elevates by a temperature lower than the predetermined temperature per unit time by the heating pattern. All amount of NO<sub>x </sub>released from the storage portion is estimated on the basis that NO<sub>x </sub>is released during a period in which the temperature of the storage portion elevates by the temperature lower than the predetermined temperature per unit time and thus the amount of SO<sub>x </sub>stored in the storage portion can be estimated on the basis of the all amount of released NO<sub>x</sub>. Therefore, an integrated amount of SO<sub>x </sub>passing through the exhaust passage during the given period or a value on the basis of the integrated amount can be accurately detected.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the third detector for detecting sulfur components of the present invention, in the first or second detector, the storage portion is elevated to the set temperature and over by heating of the exhaust gas, and the amount of SO<sub>x </sub>stored in the storage portion is estimated on the basis of the heating pattern by the exhaust gas. Thus, an integrated amount of SO<sub>x </sub>passing through the exhaust passage during the given period or a value on the basis of the integrated amount can be accurately detected.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the fourth detector for detecting sulfur components of the present invention, in the first or second detector, an electric heater is provided to heat the storage portion, the storage portion is elevated to the set temperature and over by heating of the electric heater, and the amount of SO<sub>x </sub>stored in the storage portion is estimated on the basis of the heating pattern by the electric heater. Thus, an integrated amount of SO<sub>x </sub>passing through the exhaust passage during the given period or a value on the basis of the integrated amount can be accurately detected.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to the fifth detector for detecting sulfur components of the present invention, in the first, second, third, or fourth detector, when the oxygen concentration in the exhaust gas is lowered, the storage portion releases the stored NO<sub>x </sub>and reduces the released NO<sub>x </sub>by using of reduction materials in the exhaust gas, so that the temperature of the storage portion elevates by heat produced in the reduction of NO<sub>x</sub>. If necessary, the amount of NO<sub>x </sub>stored in the storage portion can be estimated on the basis of an increase value of temperature of the storage portion measured by the temperature sensor after the oxygen concentration in the exhaust gas is lowered. Therefore, because the larger an amount of stored NO<sub>x </sub>is, the smaller an amount of SO<sub>x </sub>stored in the storage portion, an amount of stored SO<sub>x </sub>can be estimated. A given rate of an amount of SO<sub>K </sub>passing through the exhaust passage is stored in the storage portion of the detector. Therefore, an integrated amount of SO<sub>x </sub>passing through the exhaust passage during the given period or a value on the basis of the integrated amount can be accurately detected on the basis of the amount of SO<sub>x </sub>stored in the storage portion.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic view showing an engine exhaust system in which a detector for detecting sulfur components according to the present invention is arranged. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, reference numeral <b>1</b> is an exhaust passage of an internal combustion engine. The engine performs lean combustion such as in a diesel engine or a direct fuel injection-type spark-ignition engine. The exhaust gas of such an engine includes a relatively large amount of NO<sub>x </sub>so that a NO<sub>x </sub>catalyst device <b>2</b> for purifying NO<sub>x </sub>is arranged in the exhaust passage <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The NO<sub>x </sub>catalyst device <b>2</b> carries a NO<sub>x </sub>storage material and a noble metal catalyst such as platinum Pt. The NO<sub>x </sub>storage material is at least one element selected from for example potassium K, sodium Na, lithium Li, cesium Cs, or another alkali metal, barium Ba, calcium Ca, or another alkali earth metal, and lanthanum La, yttrium Y, or another rare earth.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The NO<sub>x </sub>catalyst device <b>2</b> satisfactorily stores NO<sub>x </sub>in the exhaust gas so as to absorb NO<sub>x </sub>as nitrate or so as to adsorb NO<sub>x </sub>as NO<sub>2 </sub>when the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is lean, that is, when the oxygen concentration of the exhaust gas is high. However, the NO<sub>x </sub>catalyst device cannot store NO<sub>x </sub>without limitation. Accordingly, before the NO<sub>x </sub>catalyst device can not almost store further NO<sub>x </sub>because an amount of NO<sub>x </sub>stored in the NO<sub>x </sub>catalyst device almost reaches the largest amount of NO<sub>x </sub>that can be stored therein, the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is changed to a stoichiometric air-fuel ratio or a rich air-fuel ratio as the regeneration treatment, namely, the concentration of oxygen of the exhaust gas is lowered. Therefore, the stored NO<sub>x </sub>is separated, namely, the absorbed NO<sub>x </sub>is released or the adsorbed NO<sub>2 </sub>is disconnected, and thereafter the separated NO<sub>x </sub>is reduced and purified to N<sub>2 </sub>by reducing materials in the exhaust gas.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Once the NO<sub>x </sub>catalyst device <b>2</b> stores SO<sub>x </sub>in the exhaust gas as sulfate, sulfate is more stable than nitrate so that the stored SO<sub>x </sub>cannot be released by the regeneration treatment and an amount of NO<sub>x </sub>that can be stored drops (sulfur contamination). Therefore, an S trap device <b>3</b> which can store SO<sub>x </sub>in the exhaust gas is arranged upstream of the NO<sub>x </sub>catalyst device <b>2</b> in the exhaust passage <b>1</b> to restrain the sulfur contamination of the NO<sub>x </sub>catalyst device <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The detector for detecting sulfur components <b>4</b> according to the present invention is arranged, for example, between the S trap device <b>3</b> and the NO<sub>x </sub>catalyst device <b>2</b>, and detects an integrated amount of SO<sub>x </sub>passing through the S trap device <b>3</b>. When the integrated amount of SO<sub>x </sub>reaches a set value, it can be determined that it is time to exchange the S trap device <b>3</b> for a new one.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic sectional view showing an embodiment of the detector for detecting sulfur components <b>4</b> according to the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, reference numeral <b>10</b> is a base plate. Reference numeral <b>20</b> is a temperature sensor <b>42</b> such as a thermocouple arranged on the base plate <b>10</b>. Reference numeral <b>30</b> is a storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub>arranged so as to cover the temperature sensitive portion of the temperature sensor <b>20</b>. Reference numeral <b>40</b> is an electric heater arranged on the base plate <b>10</b> opposite the temperature sensor <b>20</b>. The storage portion <b>30</b> stores NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub>in the exhaust gas and, for example, can be formed to apply the above-mentioned NO<sub>x </sub>storage material and a noble metal catalyst such as platinum Pt on the temperature sensitive portion of the temperature sensor <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As mentioned above, the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> constructed like this absorb NO<sub>x </sub>in the exhaust gas as nitrate and absorb SO<sub>x </sub>in the exhaust gas as sulfate. In the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b>, a total of an amount of NO<sub>x </sub>that can be stored and an amount of SO<sub>x </sub>that can be stored is constant. Sulfate is more stable than nitrate so that in the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b>, an amount of stored SO<sub>x </sub>keeps on increasing, and the more an amount of stored SO<sub>x </sub>increases, the more an amount of NO<sub>x </sub>that can be stored decreases,</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Accordingly, if an amount of stored NO<sub>x </sub>when a current upper limit amount of NO<sub>x </sub>is stored is detected, a current amount of stored SO<sub>x </sub>can be estimated because the smaller the amount of stored NO<sub>x </sub>is, the larger an amount of stored SO<sub>x </sub>is. Since a give rate of an amount of SO<sub>x </sub>passing through the exhaust passage <b>1</b> at the position of the detector for detecting sulfur components <b>4</b> is stored in the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> of the detector <b>4</b>, an integrated amount of SO<sub>x </sub>passing through the exhaust passage <b>1</b> at the position of the detector for detecting sulfur components <b>4</b> during a given period between the initial engine start time and the current time can be accurately detected on the basis of the current amount of stored SO<sub>x</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">On the other hand, as a value on the basis of the integrated amount of SO<sub>x</sub>, an average value of each SO<sub>x </sub>concentration in the exhaust gas passing through the exhaust passage <b>1</b> at the position of the detector for detecting sulfur components during the given period can be also detected or an average value of each amount of SO<sub>x </sub>passing through the exhaust passage <b>1</b> at the position of the detector for detecting sulfur components during the given period can be also detected.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As explained below, the detector for detecting sulfur components <b>4</b> of the present embodiment estimates a current amount of stored SO<sub>x </sub>on the basis of output of the temperature sensor <b>20</b> with operating the electric heater <b>40</b> by an electronic control unit.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">When the temperature of the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> using the NO<sub>x </sub>storage material becomes, for example, a set temperature (T<b>1</b>) (for example 500 degrees C.), it does not release SO<sub>x </sub>but release NO<sub>x </sub>without lowering the oxygen concentration in the exhaust gas.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">When a current amount of SO<sub>x </sub>stored in the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> of the detector for detecting sulfur components <b>4</b> is estimated, first, it is confirmed if the temperature of the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> is a temperature (for example 300 degrees C.) which is sufficiently lower than the set temperature (T<b>1</b>) for some time, the NO<sub>x </sub>storage material and the noble metal catalyst of the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> sufficiently activate and the lean-burn of which exhaust gas includes a relatively large amount of NO<sub>x </sub>is carried out. Once these are confirmed, the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> stores a current upper limit amount of NO<sub>x</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, heat is generated by the electric heater <b>40</b> with turning on the electricity to heat the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b>, and thus the temperature of the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> is made the set temperature (T<b>1</b>). From this time (t<b>0</b>), the electricity of the electric heater <b>40</b> is controlled such that the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> is heated by a heating pattern in which the temperature of the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> when NO<sub>x </sub>is not completely stored is elevated by a predetermined temperature (dT) per unit time (dt) as shown by the chain line.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The heating pattern actually makes the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> release the stored NO<sub>x </sub>from the time (t<b>0</b>) when the temperature of the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> becomes the set temperature (T<b>1</b>). For example, in case that barium Ba is used as the NO<sub>x </sub>storage material, an endothermic reaction such as Ba(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>&#x2192;BaO+2NO+3/2O<sub>2</sub>-619 kJ/mol occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Thus, while NO<sub>x </sub>is released, heat for releasing NO<sub>x </sub>is required so that the temperature of the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> is elevated by a temperature which is lower than the predetermined temperature (dT) per the unit time (dt) as shown by the solid line. After all amount of NO<sub>x </sub>has been released at time (t<b>1</b>), the temperature of the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> is elevated by the predetermined temperature (dt) per the unit time (dt) as shown by the solid line.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The higher the predetermined temperature (dT) by the heating pattern is, the larger an amount of NO<sub>x </sub>released from the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> per the unit time becomes. Because NO<sub>x </sub>is released in a period from the time (t<b>0</b>) to the time (t<b>1</b>), all amount of released NO<sub>x</sub>, this is, an amount of NO<sub>x </sub>stored in the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> at the time (t<b>0</b>) can be estimated on the basis of the heating pattern and the period from the time (t<b>0</b>) to the time (t<b>1</b>). Therefore, a current amount of SO<sub>x </sub>stored in the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> can be estimated.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Once the amount of SO<sub>x </sub>stored in the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> further increases so that an amount of NO<sub>x </sub>that can be stored further decrease, by the same heating pattern to elevate the temperature of the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> when NO<sub>x </sub>is not completely stored by the predetermined temperature (dT) per the unit time (dt), all the amount of NO<sub>x </sub>has been released before the time (t<b>1</b>) so that the temperature of the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> is elevated by the predetermined temperature (dT) per the unit time (dt) at time (t<b>2</b>) before the time (t<b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">All of the released NO<sub>x </sub>can be simply calculated by multiplying an amount of NO<sub>x </sub>released per the unit time every the predetermined temperature (dT) by the heating pattern and the releasing period (from (t<b>0</b>) to (t<b>1</b>) or from (t<b>0</b>) to (t<b>2</b>)). However, strictly speaking, the amount of NO<sub>x </sub>released per the unit time is not determined on the basis of only the predetermined temperature (dT). The higher the temperature of the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> at each time is, the larger the amount of NO<sub>x </sub>released per the unit time becomes. The larger the amount of NO<sub>x </sub>stored in the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> at each time is, the larger the amount of NO<sub>x </sub>released per the unit time becomes. Accordingly, taking account of these, all of the released NO<sub>x </sub>calculated as mentioned above is preferably corrected.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A difference between a quantity of heat supplied to the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> between the time (t<b>0</b>) and the time (t<b>1</b>) (or the time (t<b>2</b>)) and a quantity of heat required to make the temperature of the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> from the set temperature (T<b>1</b>) to the temperature at the time (t<b>1</b>) (or the time (t<b>2</b>)) is a quantity of heat used to release all of the NO<sub>x </sub>from the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b>. Because the larger this difference quantity of heat is, the larger the amount of released NO<sub>x </sub>is, the amount of NO<sub>x </sub>stored in the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> at the time (t<b>0</b>) may be estimated on the basis of this difference quantity of heat. Strictly speaking, a quantity of heat released from the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> is generated at each time on the basis of a difference between the temperature of the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> at each time and the surrounding temperature so that the quantity of heat released from the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub>is preferably subtracted from the quantity of heat supplied to the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> at each time.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The heating pattern is not limited to one making the temperature of the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub>when NO<sub>x </sub>is completely stored elevate by the predetermined temperature (dT) per unit time (dt), and may be one making the temperature elevated per unit time vary in two stages or multi-stages. In any case, if the heating pattern is clear, all of the released NO<sub>x </sub>can be estimated on the basis of the heating pattern and the period while NO<sub>x </sub>is released (from the time at which the temperature of the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> becomes the set temperature (T<b>1</b>) to the time when the temperature of the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> elevated per unit time corresponds to the predetermined one indicating the complete release of NO<sub>x</sub>), for example, by using of the above mentioned idea of the difference between quantities of heat, and thus the current amount of SO<sub>x </sub>stored in the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> can be estimated.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the detector for detecting sulfur components <b>4</b> of the present embodiment, the electric heater <b>40</b> heats the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b>. The present invention is not limited by the storage portion heated by the electric heater. For example, when a specific steady engine operation in which the temperature of the exhaust gas becomes more than the set temperature (T<b>1</b>) is carried out, the current amount of SO<sub>x </sub>stored in the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> of the detector for detecting sulfur components <b>4</b> can be estimated.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the specific steady engine operation, the engine speed and the engine load (the high engine load) are constant, the flow rate of the exhaust gas is constant, and the temperature of the exhaust gas more than the set temperature (T<b>1</b>) is also constant. At this time, the temperature of the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> becomes the set temperature (T<b>1</b>) by heating of the exhaust gas and a heating pattern thereafter of the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> by the exhaust gas can be predetermined by way of experiment or the like. Accordingly, all of the released NO<sub>x </sub>can be estimated on the basis of the heating pattern and the period while NO<sub>x </sub>is released (from the time at which the temperature of the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> becomes the set temperature (T<b>1</b>) to the time when the temperature of the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> elevated per unit time corresponds to the predetermined one indicating to the complete release of NO<sub>x</sub>), for example, by using of the above mentioned idea of the difference between quantities of heat, and thus the current amount of SO<sub>x </sub>stored in the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> can be estimated.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Incidentally, the detector for detecting sulfur components <b>4</b> of the present embodiment releases the stored NO<sub>x </sub>and reduces the released NO<sub>x </sub>by the reduction materials in the exhaust gas, similarly with the NO<sub>x </sub>catalyst device <b>2</b> when the oxygen concentration in the exhaust gas is lowered. The heat generated by the reduction of NO<sub>x </sub>elevates the temperature of the storage portion of NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b>. Therefore, if an increase value of temperature of the storage portion <b>30</b> when all of the NO<sub>x </sub>is released and reduced after the concentration of oxygen in the exhaust gas is lowered, i.e., the difference temperature between the temperature of the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> when the concentration of oxygen in the exhaust gas is lowered and a peak temperature of the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> thereafter, is detected by the temperature sensor <b>20</b>, the amount of NO<sub>x </sub>stored in the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> can be estimated because the higher the increase value of temperature is, the more the amount of reduced NO<sub>x </sub>released from the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> is. Accordingly, the current amount of SO<sub>x </sub>stored in the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> can be estimated.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">For example, in the regeneration treatment of the NO<sub>x </sub>catalyst device <b>2</b>, as mentioned above, the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is made rich to lower the concentration of oxygen. At this time, if the temperature of the storage portion of NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> is observed, the current amount of SO<sub>x </sub>stored in the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> can be estimated without heating of the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">When the concentration of oxygen in the exhaust gas is lowered, a part of oxygen included in the exhaust gas generates heat with reducing the reduction material in the exhaust gas at the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b>. Accordingly, the temperature of the storage portion <b>30</b> elevated by this generated heat is preferably subtracted from the measured elevated temperature of the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b>. For that purpose, it is preferable that an amount of oxygen included in the exhaust gas when the concentration of oxygen in the exhaust gas is lowered is estimated or measured and the temperature subtracted from the measured elevated temperature for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b> is preset on the basis that a specified rate of the predetermined amount of oxygen generates heat with reducing the reduction material in the exhaust gas at the storage portion for NO<sub>x </sub>and SO<sub>x </sub><b>30</b>.</p>
