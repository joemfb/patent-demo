<p id="p-0005" num="0004">With the continuing development of electronics technology, electronic components of electronic devices, such as central processing units (CPUs), memory modules, and video graphics array (VGA) chips, generate much heat in operation. The heat needs to be dissipated efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, heat sinks combined with cooling fans are used for dissipating heat of such electronic components, to ensure the continued proper functioning of the electronic device. However, in a typical electronic device, the electronic components are of various sizes, and thus the heat sinks usually have different thicknesses. Each type of heat sink needs a particular fixing frame for securing the heat sink and the fan to the corresponding electronic component. Thus, a number of different heat sinks and fixing frames are needed, which adds to the cost of the electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">What is needed, therefore, is a heat dissipation device with a fixing frame to overcome the above-described limitations.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, a heat dissipation device according to an embodiment is disclosed. In the present embodiment, the heat dissipation device is applied for dissipating heat generated by a heat-generating component <b>42</b> mounted on a printed circuit board (PCB) <b>40</b>. The heat dissipation device comprises a heat sink <b>10</b> attached to the heat-generating component <b>42</b>, a fan <b>30</b>, and a fixing frame <b>20</b>. The fan <b>30</b> is mounted to the heat sink <b>10</b> via the fixing frame <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The heat sink <b>10</b> is substantially cylindrical. The heat sink <b>10</b> can be made of a metallic material having good heat conductivity, such as aluminum, copper, etc. The heat sink <b>10</b> comprises a cylindrical core <b>12</b>, four supports <b>16</b>, and a multiplicity of fins <b>14</b>. The cylindrical core <b>12</b> has a bottom end protruding downwardly beyond an annular bottom face cooperatively defined by bottom ends of the supports <b>16</b> and bottom ends of the fins <b>14</b>. With such configuration, the bottom end of the cylindrical core <b>12</b> can make good contact with the heat-generating component <b>42</b>. The four supports <b>16</b> and the fins <b>14</b> extend generally radially and outwardly from an outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical core <b>12</b>. The four supports <b>16</b> evenly divide the fins <b>14</b> into four sets of fins <b>14</b>. The supports <b>16</b> protrude outwardly beyond outmost ends of the fins <b>14</b>. That is, the supports <b>16</b> are longer than the fins <b>14</b>, as measured along radial directions of the heat sink <b>10</b>. Each of the fins <b>14</b> comprises an inner portion <b>141</b> connected to the outer surface of the cylindrical core <b>12</b>, and two branches <b>142</b> extending outwards from the inner portion <b>141</b>. A slit <b>140</b> is defined between the two branches <b>142</b>. In the present embodiment, the heat sink <b>10</b> is fabricated by extrusion. Each of the supports <b>16</b> has a thickness gradually increased along a corresponding generally radial direction of the heat sink <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The fins <b>14</b> and the supports <b>16</b> are all curved, and are all oriented along substantially the same direction relative to the radial directions of the heat sink <b>10</b>. With this configuration, a surface area of the heat sink <b>10</b> is increased. In the present embodiment, the fins <b>14</b> and the supports <b>16</b> are curved outwards in a generally clockwise direction as viewed from a top of the heat sink <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The fan <b>30</b> comprises a housing <b>31</b>. The housing <b>31</b> comprises an annular sidewall <b>32</b>, and a top wall <b>33</b> and a bottom wall <b>34</b> extending outwardly from top and bottom ends of the sidewall <b>32</b>, respectively. Each of the top and bottom walls <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> has a rectangular outline. Four through holes <b>340</b> are defined in four corners of the bottom wall <b>34</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The fixing frame <b>20</b> is typically made of plastic material, and formed by an integral molding method. Alternatively, the fixing frame <b>20</b> can be made of metallic material having high rigidity. The fixing frame <b>20</b> comprises a circular top plate <b>21</b> defining a square hole <b>24</b> at the center thereof, an annular side plate <b>22</b> extending downwardly and perpendicularly from an outer periphery of the top plate <b>21</b>, and four fixing legs <b>28</b> extending downwardly from a bottom of the side plate <b>22</b>. Four ears <b>26</b> equally spaced from each other extend outwardly from the outer periphery of the top plate <b>21</b>. The ears <b>26</b> are positioned corresponding to the corners of the square hole <b>24</b> of the top plate <b>21</b>. A mounting post <b>260</b> and a fastening arm <b>262</b> extend upwardly and perpendicularly from a top surface of each of the ears <b>26</b>, respectively. The mounting posts <b>260</b> correspond to the through holes <b>340</b> of the bottom wall <b>34</b> of the fan <b>30</b>, respectively. Each of the fastening arms <b>262</b> includes a hook <b>264</b> extending inwardly from a top end thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each of the fixing legs <b>28</b> comprises a vertical wall <b>281</b> extending downwardly from the bottom of the side plate <b>22</b>, and a horizontal wall <b>282</b> extending outwardly and perpendicularly from a bottom end of the vertical wall <b>281</b>. The vertical wall <b>281</b> comprises an inner surface and an outer surface. The inner surfaces of the vertical walls <b>281</b> and an inner surface of the side plate <b>22</b> are arranged along the same imaginary cylindrical surface. A protruding member <b>25</b> extends inwardly from the inner surface of the vertical wall <b>281</b> towards a center of the side plate <b>22</b>. The protruding member <b>25</b> has a guiding face <b>251</b> inclined inwards and upwards from the inner surface of the vertical wall <b>281</b>. Each of the horizontal walls <b>282</b> defines a hole <b>280</b> therein. A circumferential wall <b>283</b> extends upwardly from a circumferential edge of the horizontal wall <b>282</b>, with one side of the circumferential wall <b>283</b> also extending from the outer surface of the vertical wall <b>281</b>. The circumferential wall <b>283</b>, the horizontal wall <b>282</b> and the vertical wall <b>281</b> cooperatively define a receiving space <b>284</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) for receiving a fastener <b>100</b> therein. The receiving spaces <b>284</b> communicate with the corresponding holes <b>280</b> of the horizontal walls <b>282</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The side plate <b>22</b> of the fixing frame <b>20</b> defines two sets of slots in the inner side thereof, being a set of first slots <b>23</b> and a set of second slots <b>27</b>. Each of the first and second slots <b>23</b>, <b>27</b> extends upwardly and perpendicularly from a bottom surface of the side plate <b>22</b> towards the top plate <b>21</b> of the fixing frame <b>20</b>. A length of each of the first slots <b>23</b> is smaller than a length of each of the second slots <b>27</b>. The set of first slots <b>23</b> has four first slots <b>23</b>. The four first slots <b>23</b> are evenly spaced from each other; that is, the four first slots <b>23</b> are evenly arranged along a circumferential direction of the side plate <b>22</b>. The set of second slots <b>27</b> has four second slots <b>27</b>. The four second slots <b>27</b> are evenly spaced from each other; that is, the four second slots <b>27</b> are evenly arranged along the circumferential direction of the side plate <b>22</b>. Each of the first and second slots <b>23</b>, <b>27</b> defines a transverse cross section similar to a transverse cross section of an outmost end of each support <b>16</b>, so that the outmost end of each support <b>16</b> can fit into a selected one of the first and second slots <b>23</b>, <b>27</b>. Each of the first and second slots <b>23</b>, <b>27</b> has a step <b>29</b> formed at a top end thereof. Each of the first and second slots <b>23</b>, <b>27</b> is spaced from the vertical walls <b>281</b> of the fixing legs <b>28</b>. In particular, the first and second slots <b>23</b>, <b>27</b> are arranged in four pairs, with each pair having one first slot <b>23</b> and one second slot <b>27</b>. The pairs of first and second slots <b>23</b>, <b>27</b> are staggered with respect to the vertical walls <b>281</b> of the fixing legs <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when the heat sink <b>10</b> and the fixing frame <b>20</b> are assembled, both the heat sink <b>10</b> and the fixing frame <b>20</b> are firstly placed upside-down, with the fins <b>14</b> and the supports <b>16</b> curved generally counterclockwise as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The supports <b>16</b> correspond to the first slots <b>23</b> of the fixing frame <b>20</b>. At the same time, the fixing legs <b>28</b> correspond to the sets of fins <b>14</b>. The outmost ends of one or more of the fins <b>14</b> in each set of fins <b>14</b> ride over the guiding faces <b>251</b> of the protruding members <b>25</b> until top faces of the protruding members <b>25</b> abut (or clasp) the annular bottom face of the bottom ends of the supports <b>16</b> and fins <b>14</b>. Simultaneously, the supports <b>16</b> slide in the first slots <b>23</b> until tops of the outmost ends of the supports <b>16</b> abut the steps <b>29</b> of the first slots <b>23</b>. In this position, the heat sink <b>10</b> is sandwiched between the protruding members <b>25</b> and the steps <b>29</b> of the first slots <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">When the heat sink <b>10</b> and the fixing frame <b>20</b> are disassembled, a radially outward force is exerted on each of the fixing legs <b>28</b>. The fixing legs <b>28</b> elastically deform until the protruding members <b>25</b> move radially outwardly beyond the outmost ends of the fins <b>14</b>. Then, the heat sink <b>10</b> is removed from the fixing frame <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Alternatively, the fixing frame <b>20</b> can be used with another different heat sink. Typically, the alternative heat sink is the same as the heat sink <b>10</b>, except that the alternative heat sink is thicker (higher) than the heat sink <b>10</b>. For example, firstly, the heat sink <b>10</b> may need to be detached from the fixing frame <b>20</b>. Then the outmost ends of one or more of fins in each set of fins of the alternative heat sink ride over the guiding faces <b>251</b> of the protruding members <b>25</b> until top faces of the protruding members <b>25</b> abut (or clasp) an annular bottom face of the bottom ends of supports and the fins of the alternative heat sink. Simultaneously, the supports slide in the second slots <b>27</b> until tops of the outmost ends of the supports abut the steps <b>29</b> of the second slots <b>27</b>. In this position, the alternative heat sink is sandwiched between the protruding members <b>25</b> and the steps <b>29</b> of the second slots <b>27</b>. The combination of the fixing frame <b>20</b> and the alternative heat sink provides a heat dissipation device with a given thickness (height). Such thickness is substantially the same as the thickness of the heat dissipation device constituted by the combination of the fixing frame <b>20</b> and the heat sink <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the present embodiment, the side plate <b>22</b> defines two sets of slots <b>23</b>, <b>27</b> for selective fitting of either of two heat sinks having different specifications, in particular, different thicknesses. In alternative embodiments, the side plate <b>22</b> of the fixing frame <b>20</b> can define three or more sets of slots, for selective fitting of any one of three or more corresponding heat sinks having different thicknesses.</p>
