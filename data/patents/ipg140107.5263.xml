<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This is the U.S. National Phase of PCT/US2008/053402, filed Feb. 8, 2008, which in turn claims priority to U.S. provisional application no. 60/900,091, filed Feb. 8, 2007, the contents of both of which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a feathering, flapping and rotor loads indicator for use in an aircraft rotor system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Flight envelope limitations have been conventionally used to delineate the safe range of operation of an aircraft. Flight envelope limitations may be defined as the parameters within which an aircraft can be safely operated, with average pilot ability, at varying density altitudes, airframe states, wing or blade loadings and atmospheric turbulence. These limitations are determined based on flight test or laboratory data, which are used to calculate the stress, temperature or other measures of health of critical components during various flight conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, flight envelope limitations are typically very conservative. As a result, they generally reduce the overall operational capability of the aircraft. In addition, they are often difficult or impossible to consider during high workload operations such as combat maneuvering or terrain following.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To address this concern and to expand the allowable flight envelope of an aircraft, it has been proposed to use strain gages to provide pilots with information pertaining to the current condition of critical elements of the aircraft. For example, in rotorcrafts, it has been proposed to use strain gages to measure most-critical component loads. However, it is not common for a single component to be critical in all flight regimes. Additionally, strain gages are generally unreliable and their use increases the recurring cost of an aircraft because they require maintenance and dedicated instrumentation. Furthermore, strain gages are unable to provide information about the temperature of critical elastomeric bearings that are used, for example, in rotorcrafts.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the feathering, flapping and rotor loads (FFR) indicator is adapted to provide the pilot of the rotorcraft with current and projected temperatures of critical elastomeric bearings in the rotor and a direct feedback regarding the oscillatory loads severity of the current flight condition. The information provided by the feathering, flapping and rotor loads indicator are designed to assist the pilot of the rotorcraft in avoiding flight conditions where either oscillatory loads are exceeding critical limits on critical parts or temperatures of selected bearings are exceeding a critical limit. In an embodiment of the invention, the feathering, flapping and rotor loads indicator is configured to maximize the allowable flight envelope and to provide additional flight safety by displaying to the pilot updated information pertaining to the health of the elastomeric bearings and the severity of the present maneuver, directing the pilot to take corrective action if necessary. Because the actual flight conditions are always being considered, fewer conservative assumptions are made, allowing for additional envelope beyond what conventional flight restriction charts can provide. In one implementation, the feathering, flapping and rotor loads indicator is adapted to supplement current advisory and caution messages that already exist in rotorcrafts.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The feathering, flapping and rotor loads indicator may be implemented in conventional helicopters or tiltrotor aircrafts. A tiltrotor aircraft has three modes of operation: airplane mode, helicopter mode and transition mode. These three modes of operation are schematically represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a tiltrotor aircraft <b>100</b> in an airplane mode of flight operation. Wings <b>105</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>of tiltrotor aircraft <b>100</b> are being utilized to lift the fuselage <b>110</b> in response to the action of rotor assemblies <b>115</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, rotor assemblies <b>115</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>are composed of a plurality of rotor blades <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>which are rotated in a rotor disk that is substantially transverse to the fuselage <b>110</b>. In this mode, the rotor assemblies <b>115</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>provide thrust for the airplane mode of flight. In contrast, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts the tiltrotor aircraft <b>100</b> in a helicopter mode of flight with rotor assemblies <b>115</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>positioned substantially parallel to the fuselage <b>110</b>. In this view, the pylons or nacelles <b>125</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>of the rotor assemblies <b>115</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>are depicted. Pylons <b>125</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>rotate in position to allow switching between the aircraft mode of flight and the helicopter mode of flight. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts the aircraft <b>100</b> in a transition mode with rotor assemblies <b>115</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>being shifted in position between that of an aircraft mode of flight and a helicopter mode of flight. In the transition mode of flight, the nacelles or pylons <b>125</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>define an angle between 0 and 95 degrees relative to the longitudinal direction of the fuselage <b>110</b>. At an angle substantially equal to zero, the tiltrotor aircraft <b>100</b> operates in an aircraft mode. The nacelles or pylons <b>125</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>are positioned along a direction that is substantially parallel to the fuselage <b>110</b>. At an angle substantially equal to 90 degrees, the tiltrotor aircraft <b>100</b> operates in a helicopter mode. The nacelles or pylons <b>125</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>are positioned along a direction that is substantially perpendicular to the fuselage <b>110</b>. One significant benefit of this type of aircraft is the ability to take off and land like a helicopter, but with the ability to travel at relatively high speeds like an airplane. The feathering, flapping and rotor loads indicator in an embodiment of the invention is integrated into a tiltrotor aircraft such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">By way of comparison, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a helicopter <b>400</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Helicopter <b>400</b> includes a fuselage <b>410</b> and a main rotor assembly <b>415</b>. Rotor assembly <b>415</b> defines a rotor disk <b>420</b> which is substantially parallel to the fuselage <b>410</b>. Torque imparted by the main rotor assembly <b>415</b> to fuselage <b>410</b> is counteracted by a tail rotor <b>425</b> carried by a tail portion <b>430</b> of fuselage <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Control of the rotor assemblies <b>115</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>and/or main rotor assembly <b>415</b> is performed using mechanical and electrical systems that are designed to respond to the pilot's inputs. Mechanical systems typically include a swashplate arrangement which consists of a stationary portion and a rotating portion.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, this figure schematically shows a rotor assembly <b>500</b> of a tiltrotor aircraft in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Rotor assembly <b>500</b> includes a swashplate control system <b>510</b> that includes a nonrotating portion <b>511</b> and a rotating portion <b>512</b>. A mast <b>515</b> extends through the rotating and nonrotating members <b>511</b>, <b>512</b> and is coupled to a plurality of blades (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). A hub <b>520</b> is provided which couples the rotor blades to mast <b>515</b> in a manner which transfers torque and thrust while allowing tilting of the rotor thrust vector. For example, in a mechanical system, the hub <b>520</b> may include a gimbaled yoke <b>525</b>, but in electromechanical systems it may include other types of couplings. Yoke <b>525</b> is coupled to several intermediary members <b>530</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>attached to the blades. Each intermediary member <b>530</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>is connected through a pitch horn, such as pitch horn <b>535</b>, and a linkage such as pitch link <b>536</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, back to the nonrotating member <b>511</b> and to the pilot control systems.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The control system depicted in simplified form in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> allows for the combination of collective control and cyclic control. Both collective control and cyclic control are accomplished through the swashplate arrangement, and the engineering details of the swashplate vary between helicopter designs. As discussed above, the upper portion of the assembly (the rotating portion) <b>512</b> is free to rotate relative to the lower, stationary (non-rotating portion) <b>511</b>. Pilot inputs are provided to alter the vertical position of the stationary plate <b>511</b> through the collective control and the tilt of the plate through the cyclic control. Since the rotating plate <b>512</b> always follows the orientation of the stationary plate <b>511</b>, any pilot input to the stationary plate <b>511</b> is passed onto the rotating plate <b>512</b> above it. The pitch links <b>536</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>and pitch horns <b>535</b> are utilized to allow the rotating plate <b>512</b> to alter the blade angle of each blade. Pulling the vertical axis control lever up moves the swashplate <b>510</b> vertically upward so that all blades contain the same increase in blade angle, referred to hereinafter as the feathering angle. Similarly, pushing the vertical axis control lever down decreases the blade angle of all blades. Variations in blade angle or feathering angle change the amount of total rotor thrust produced. Accordingly, changes in vertical axis control cause changes in total rotor thrust but they do not alter total rotor thrust orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Rotor assembly <b>500</b> also includes various bearings that are designed to provide a mechanical interconnection between various elements of the rotor assembly <b>500</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the hub spring bearing <b>555</b> that is provided on the hub <b>520</b>. The hub spring bearing <b>555</b> is sensitive to the flapping angle of the blades. Flapping angle is defined by the angle between the rotor hub and the rotor mast. The hub spring bearing <b>555</b> is sensitive to heat build-up caused by 1 per revolution oscillatory deflection induced by flapping. Flapping angle may be monitored by transducers arranged in the blades. Rotor assembly <b>500</b> also includes additional bearings such as, for example, a centrifugal force bearing or CF bearing, a spindle bearing and a pitch change bearing. For example, the CF bearing is adapted to allow the blades to pivot. The CF bearing is arranged in each intermediary member <b>530</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>(not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The CF bearing is positioned between the yoke <b>525</b> and the blades and is generally sensitive to 1 per rotor revolution feathering. One per rotor revolution feathering is defined as:

<p id="p-0034" num="0039">These various bearings, e.g. hub spring bearing <b>555</b> and CF bearing are subject to a considerable amount of oscillatory motion during operation of the rotorcraft and, as a result, tend to heat up. These bearing are made of elastomerics, which may degrade rapidly when subjected to high temperature. For safety reasons, it is therefore desirable to provide an estimate of the temperature of these bearings during operation of the rotorcraft.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the feathering, flapping and rotor loads indicator <b>600</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The feathering, flapping and rotor loads indicator <b>600</b> is constructed and arranged to calculate or provide an estimated temperature of selected bearings and estimated oscillatory loads exerted on selected components of the rotor assemblies <b>115</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>and <b>415</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the feathering, flapping and rotor loads indicator <b>600</b> includes a calculation unit <b>605</b> and a display unit <b>610</b>. The calculation unit <b>605</b> is inputted with a plurality of flight control parameters <b>620</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>-<i>ai </i>(with 1&#x3c;i&#x3c;n=integer) including, for example, outside air temperature, flapping angle, feathering angle and/or nacelle position. Flight control parameters <b>620</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>-<i>ai </i>correspond to various parameters that are monitored and accessible to the flight control computers during operation of the rotorcraft. It will be appreciated that additional flight control parameters other than outside air temperature, flapping angle, feathering angle and or nacelle position may be inputted to and processed by the calculation unit <b>605</b> in another embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0041">The calculation unit <b>605</b> includes a plurality of calculation models <b>615</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>-<i>ai </i>(with 1&#x3c;i&#x3c;n=integer), <b>616</b> and <b>617</b> that are each adapted to calculate or provide an estimated temperature of a selected bearing, or an estimated oscillatory load exerted on a selected component, of the rotor assemblies <b>115</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>or <b>415</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, calculation models <b>615</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>-<i>ai </i>are each configured to calculate the oscillatory load exerted on a selected component of the rotor assemblies <b>115</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>or <b>415</b>. Calculation models <b>616</b> and <b>617</b> are configured to calculate or provide an estimated temperature of, respectively, the hub spring bearing <b>555</b> and the CF bearing as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Each of the calculation models <b>615</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>-<i>ai</i>, <b>616</b> and <b>617</b> is adapted to calculate the temperature or the oscillatory load based on the inputted flight control parameters <b>620</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>-<i>ai</i>. For example, in one implementation, oscillatory loads are calculated based on feathering angle and nacelle position, temperature of the hub spring bearing <b>555</b> is calculated based on flapping angle and outside air temperature, and temperature of the CF bearing is calculated based on feathering angle and outside air temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0042">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the calculation unit <b>605</b> includes a single calculator to perform all the calculations. In this configuration, the calculation unit <b>605</b> includes a plurality of simulation models that are used to calculate or provide estimated bearing temperatures and oscillatory loads exerted on selected components. However, it will be appreciated that the calculation unit may include separate calculators to calculate or provide estimated bearing temperatures and oscillatory loads exerted on selected components. In this latter configuration, each of the separate calculators includes a dedicated calculation/simulation model.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0043">The display unit <b>610</b> includes a screen <b>625</b> and is configured to display the data processed by the calculation unit <b>605</b> in a specific manner. The display unit <b>610</b> includes a single gauge/indicator <b>630</b> in round-dial format and a first indicating needle or inner pointer <b>635</b><i>a </i>that provides the most critical information as to the projected temperature of the most critical bearing if the current flight condition is maintained or oscillatory load severity at a glance. The display unit <b>610</b> also includes a second or additional movable indicator or outer pointer <b>635</b><i>b </i>that shows the greatest value of any current bearing temperature. The gauge/indicator <b>630</b> may also be referred to hereinafter as a common scale. As explained in more detail below, the position of the indicating needle <b>635</b><i>a </i>is driven by the parameter with the highest value on the common scale. The position of the indicating needle <b>635</b><i>b </i>is driven by the bearing temperature with the highest value on the common scale.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0044">The gauge/indicator <b>630</b> includes a plurality of segments <b>640</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>that each define an operating zone for the calculated temperature or the loads exerted on the selected components. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, segment <b>640</b><i>a </i>extends from radial tick mark <b>645</b><i>a </i>to radial tick mark <b>645</b><i>b </i>and is represented by a first color (e.g., green). Segment <b>640</b><i>a </i>corresponds to the safe operating zone of feathering, flapping and rotor loads indicator <b>600</b>. When the indicating needle <b>635</b><i>a </i>is within the first segment <b>640</b><i>a</i>, the bearing temperatures and/or oscillatory loads are all within their safe recommended range of operation and the aircraft can operate indefinitely without any safety concern. Segment <b>640</b><i>b </i>extends from radial tick mark <b>645</b><i>b </i>to radial tick mark <b>645</b><i>c </i>and may be represented by a second color (e.g., yellow). Segment <b>640</b><i>b </i>corresponds to the advisory zone of feathering, flapping and rotor loads indicator <b>600</b>. In this range, the bearing temperatures and/or oscillatory loads are elevated but still remain within a safe range of operation. Segment <b>640</b><i>c </i>extends from radial tick mark <b>645</b><i>c </i>to radial tick mark <b>645</b><i>d </i>and may be represented by a third color (e.g., red). Segment <b>640</b><i>c </i>corresponds to the caution zone of feathering, flapping and rotor loads indicator <b>600</b>. When the indicating needle <b>635</b> is within the third segment <b>640</b><i>c</i>, the bearing temperatures and/or oscillatory loads are within an undesirable range of operation of the aircraft in which, potentially, excessive damage could occur. When the indicating needle <b>635</b><i>a </i>reaches the radial tick mark <b>645</b><i>d</i>, the bearing temperatures and/or oscillatory loads are within an unsafe range of operation of the aircraft in which, potentially, critical failures could occur. Post flight inspection of the bearings and the selected components is highly recommended following operation in that zone.

The endurance limit of Table 1 represents the highest stress or range of stress that can be repeated indefinitely without failure of the component.
<br/>
The oscillatory loads differ depending on whether the aircraft is in a 1 G flight mode or maneuver mode. As shown in Table 1, a more conservative criteria is applied to a 1 G level flight than in a maneuver mode. A 1 G flight mode of operation corresponds to a straight level flight, which generally represents the majority of the aircraft's flight time. In this mode of operation, the aircraft is not climbing, or descending. A maneuver mode of operation corresponds to a non straight level flight such as, for example, a turn, a takeoff or a landing. A maneuver mode is much less frequent and shorter in duration than the 1 G flight mode. However; the oscillatory loads exerted on any given components are generally higher in a maneuver mode. In practice, the calculation unit <b>605</b> estimates the load exerted for each component for a 1 G flight mode and applies a more conservative criteria depending on whether the aircraft is in a 1 G flight mode or a maneuver mode. For example, when the <b>645</b><i>d </i>tick mark is reached, this means that either a 1 G flight mode is at the 10 hour limit or a maneuvering mode is at the 1 hour limit.
</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0046">As also shown in Table 1, the position of the tick mark <b>645</b><i>d </i>for a 1 G flight mode and tick marks <b>645</b><i>c </i>and <b>645</b><i>d </i>for a maneuver mode are defined in terms of occurrence of damage fraction after a given time period. For example, when the indicating needle <b>635</b><i>a </i>reaches the third segment <b>640</b><i>c </i>and the aircraft is in a maneuver mode of operation, a stress exerted on the selected component during a 10 hour period will create an expected damage failure. Similarly, when the indicating needle <b>635</b> reaches the radial tick mark <b>645</b><i>d </i>(i.e., band-edge of the third segment <b>640</b><i>c</i>) and the aircraft is in a maneuver mode, a stress exerted on the selected component during a 1 hour period will create an expected damage failure. These time limits may be referred to hereinafter as the 1 hour limit and the 10 hour limit.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0047">It will be appreciated that the position of the radial tick marks <b>645</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>on the common scale and their corresponding limits in terms of temperature and oscillatory load values are up to the designer and may, therefore, change in other embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0048">In one embodiment of the invention, the calculation unit <b>605</b> is adapted to calculate or provide estimate oscillatory loads for a plurality of components. Examples of components that may be monitored with the feathering, flapping and rotor loads indicator <b>600</b> in connection with a tiltrotor aircraft, such as, for example, the V22 Tiltrotor aircraft manufactured by Bell Helicopter, Inc., include (1) the inboard proprotor blade (tangs), (2) the proprotor blade abrasion strip, (3) the outboard proprotor blade or trailing edge, (4) the blade fold support, (5) the blade fold latch pin, (6) the inboard bearing retainer, (7) the outboard spindle pitch change bearing assembly, (8), the proprotor yoke, (9) the pendulum yoke mast adaptor and (10) the pendulum yoke mast adapter bushings. All of these components are selected, in one embodiment of the invention, for their susceptibility to stress. However, it will be appreciated that additional, fewer or different components may be used in other embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0049">In one embodiment of the invention, the various calculation models, which are used to calculate or estimate the oscillatory loads for the selected components, are constructed based on load level surveys. Information provided by the load level surveys are used to construct trends of oscillatory loads as a function of feathering angle. These trends are provided for (a) each of the selected components, (b) the 1 G flight mode of operation and (c) the maneuver mode of operation. In addition, for a tiltrotor aircraft, these trends may also be provided for various nacelle angles (e.g., 30&#xb0;, 60&#xb0;, 75&#xb0; and 90&#xb0;).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0050">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, this figure shows the oscillatory load values (in lbs) for the inboard proprotor blade. Oscillatory loads for the inboard proprotor blade were retrieved from load level surveys and plotted against feathering angle. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the models are constructed for feathering angles included in the range between about 0&#xb0; and 18&#xb0;. Variations of the oscillatory loads in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> are provided for (a) two engines (denoted engines <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), (b) a nacelle angle of 90&#xb0; and (c) a maneuver mode of operation. For a nacelle angle of 90&#xb0;, the tiltrotor aircraft is in a helicopter mode.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the 90% endurance limit, the endurance limit EL, the 10 hour limit and the one hour limit. Based on these data, a bottom of scatter analysis (curve <b>705</b>) is used to determine a conservative trend of oscillatory loads as a function of feathering angle for the selected component.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0052">Similar charts and trends are obtained for each of the selected components, the 1 G flight and maneuver modes of operation, and various nacelle angles (for tilt rotor aircrafts). In each of the charts obtained for the 1 G flight mode of operation, the intersections of the bottom of scatter trendlines and the oscillatory loads defining the 90% endurance limit, the endurance limit and the 10 hour limit are used to define breakpoints for the feathering, flapping and rotor loads indicator <b>600</b> for each component. Similarly, in each of the charts obtained for a maneuver mode of operation, the intersections of the bottom of scatter trendlines and the oscillatory loads defining the endurance limit, the 10 hour limit and the 1 hour limit are also used to define breakpoints for the feathering, flapping and rotor loads indicator for each component. These breakpoints correspond to the positions of the radial tick marks <b>645</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0053">For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, this figure shows summary data representing the oscillatory load trends as a function of feathering angle for five different components and for a 1 G flight mode of operation and a maneuver mode of operation.

The five components of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> are inboard proprotor blade, outboard proprotor blade, blade fold latch pin, inboard bearing retainer and proprotor yoke. All the scatter plots obtained for the selected components, the different flying modes of operation (1 G mode and maneuver mode) and the various nacelle angles are used by the calculation unit <b>605</b> to determine oscillatory loads exerted on the various components for various feathering angles.

For reference, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the corresponding segments <b>640</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>of the gauge/indicator <b>630</b>.</p>

where T<sub>steadystate </sub>represents the steady state temperature change, T<sub>O </sub>represents the initial outside air temperature and &#x3c4; is a time constant function of feathering angle.
</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0057">The first order linear model is determined based on temperature surveys. Specifically, variations of the bearing temperature as a function of time for a given feathering angle are used to extract the value of the steady state temperature T<sub>steadystate </sub>and the time constant &#x3c4;. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the variation of the bearing temperature as a function of time for three feathering angles: 8&#xb0;, 10&#xb0; and 12&#xb0;. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the measured temperatures and the temperatures provided by the calculation model. The outside air temperature T<sub>O</sub>, which corresponds to the temperature at t=0, is about 70 F. Based on these experimental data obtained by infrared measurements, the steady state temperature and the time constant are derived. For an 8&#xb0; feathering angle, the steady state temperature increase is about 100 F. The time constant is about 63% of the steady state delta temperature. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the first order linear model matches the experimental data.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0058">Similar calculations are made for each feathering angle in order to retrieve the steady state temperatures and the time constants. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows the predicted temperature buildup in the feathering bearing as a function of time for six different feathering angles (2&#xb0;, 4&#xb0;, 6&#xb0;, 8&#xb0;, 10&#xb0; and 12&#xb0;). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> also shows the measured temperature in the bearing for each feathering angle. As can be seen, the bearing temperatures predicted by the first order linear models match the measured temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0059">In one embodiment of the invention, the calculation model that calculates or provides an estimated buildup temperature in the hub bearing is also a first order linear model. However, the estimated buildup temperature of the hub bearing is calculated based on the flapping angle and outside air temperature. The flapping angle is generally measured with transducers that are adapted to measure the deflection of the blades. Similarly to the feathering angle and outside air temperature, the flapping angle is one of the control system parameters that is monitored during operation of the aircraft.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0060">The hub bearing calculation model is adapted to accurately replicate test data of hub bearing temperature as a function of time. In one implementation, the hub bearing calculation model uses two variables, which are both functions of the flapping angle. The two variables are (1) stabilized hub spring temperature or steady state temperature above ambient and (2) time constant &#x3c4;&#x2032;. The time constant &#x3c4;&#x2032; is defined as the time that is necessary to reach 0.632 of the stabilized delta temperature. These two variables are used in the first order linear model to estimate the buildup temperature T<sub>h </sub>in the hub bearing. In one implementation, the first order linear model is defined as follows</p>
