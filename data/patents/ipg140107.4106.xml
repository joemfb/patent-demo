<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an image processing apparatus and a color processing method, and in particular relates to an image processing apparatus and a color processing method performing color processing that corrects the colorimetric value of a printed matter, which fluctuates depending on temperature.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Ordinarily, the colorimetric value of a colored material changes with temperature, and this phenomenon is known as &#x201c;thermochromism&#x201d;. Thermochromism is a problem whenever a very precise colorimetry is desired, since the error due to the temperature of the object to be measured affects the colorimetric value.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is known that the temperature variation caused by this error is substantially linear over temperature and is reversible. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows the result of analyzing a color chart (referred to in the following as &#x201c;patch&#x201d;) printed with an electrophotographic printer, by measuring its spectral reflectivity. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the color fluctuations can be classified into fluctuations caused by the influence of fluorescent substance, such as fluorescent brighteners contained in the media, and fluctuations caused by the influence of non-fluorescent substances, such as toner compositions. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the spectral reflectivity of fluorescent substances changes in the vertical direction of the chart depending on the temperature, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the spectral reflectivity of non-fluorescent substances changes in the horizontal direction of the chart depending on the temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to increase their whiteness, some media that are used for ordinary printing contain fluorescent brighteners that absorb UV light and exhibit fluorescence in the visible part of the spectrum. The fluorescent brightening effect due to the fluorescent brighteners depends on the temperature, that is, increases or decreases with the temperature, so that also the colorimetric value of the printed matter that is obtained by printing on the media containing the fluorescent brighteners will depend on and change with the temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The following is an explanation of a color stabilization process and a color matching process performed by an ordinary printing apparatus. Conventionally, in order to output a desired color with a printing apparatus, such as an electrophotographic printer, a color conversion look-up table (referred to below as &#x201c;LUT&#x201d;) is used. Among color conversion LUTs, there are LUTs used for a calibration in order to keep the printing apparatus in a given constant state and LUTs used for color matching, for which ICC profiles are a typical example. To prepare these color conversion LUTs, a plurality of color charts, such as IT8.7/3 patches or the like, are output with the printing apparatus. Using a colorimeter, such as a spectrophotometer, the colors of the plurality of color charts are measured, thus obtaining their colorimetric values, and by associating the device value with the device independent value, a color conversion LUT is prepared. By using the prepared LUT, differences in color among devices as well as differences in color due to variations among print engines can be reduced, and better color matching and color stabilization can be attained.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Recently, such LUTs are generated in real-time by using a color sensor mounted inside the electrophotographic printer. Such a printer detects, with the built-in color sensor, the patch immediately after fixing, and returns the colorimetric value of the patch to the LUT generation process.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, in ordinary electrophotographic printers, patches that have just been is fixed are very hot (about 70 degrees Celsius), so that the colorimetric value of the patches changes due to the above-mentioned thermochromism. Therefore, there is the problem that a LUT that is suitable for the environment in which the user views the printed matter (room temperature) cannot be prepared with high precision.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Consequently, there is a need for a technology in printing apparatuses to correct the colorimetric value in view of the temperature at the time of the colorimetry. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, printing apparatuses have been proposed, which prepare the LUT considering the media temperature immediately after the fixing of the patch (see Japanese Patent Number 3555706, for example). The printer <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is characterized in that it generates colorimetric values for any desired temperature by performing a correction regarding temperature fluctuations to the colorimetric values of any patch printed on a medium (any color reproduced with the printer), using a colorimetric value correction unit <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows an outline of the operation of the colorimetric value correction unit <b>114</b>. As shown in this figure, the device value <b>1112</b> of the patch (patch data), whose color is to be measured, is entered from a color matching unit <b>111</b> into the colorimetric value correction unit <b>114</b>. Furthermore, the patch temperature <b>1221</b> and the colorimetric value <b>1231</b>, which are output from a temperature sensor unit and a color sensor unit within the engine, are entered into the colorimetric value correction unit <b>114</b>. Then, using the specified object temperature and a temperature characteristics LUT <b>1141</b> of a reference patch that has been set in advance, the colorimetric value correction unit <b>114</b> corrects the colorimetric value and outputs the corrected colorimetric value <b>1142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, in ordinary electrophotographic printers, including the above-described conventional printers performing temperature-dependent correction of the colorimetric values, all patches keep a certain temperature immediately after fixing, but when the sheet paper has been transported for a certain distance after the patch has been fixed, the temperature differs from patch to patch. The reason for this is that the amount of toner differs from patch to patch, so that the specific heat differs from patch to patch and there are differences in the amount by which the temperature drops.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, in order to make the colorimetric value correction for the temperature of the patch more accurate, it is necessary to measure the temperature of the patch under test at the same time of colorimetry, for each colorimetric analysis using a radiation thermometer or the like on each patch to be measured, so that the system becomes more complicated and more expensive.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thus, since the patch temperature immediately after fixing the patch changes, it is difficult to perform a suitable colorimetric value correction taking into account the patch temperature.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to the accompanying drawings, the following is a detailed explanation of exemplary embodiments of the present invention. It should be noted that the configurations discussed in the following embodiments are merely examples, and that the present invention is not limited to the configurations shown in the figures.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Apparatus Configuration</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the present embodiment, an example of performing a colorimetric value correction with an electrophotographic printer on which a color sensor is mounted is explained.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing the configuration of a printer according to the present embodiment. The printer <b>1</b> outputs a calibration patch before performing a print job or during performing a print job and measures its color (colorimetric value) using a built-in color sensor. Then, the printer <b>1</b> maintains color reproducibility by preparing and updating a correction table based on the colorimetric value.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The functional components of the printer <b>1</b> can be roughly categorized into a controller unit <b>11</b> and an engine unit <b>12</b>. The controller unit <b>11</b> includes a color matching unit <b>111</b>, a calibration unit <b>112</b>, a LUT generation unit <b>113</b>, a colorimetric value correction unit <b>114</b>, and a temperature drop correction unit <b>115</b>. It should be noted that the controller unit <b>11</b> includes further functional components relating to other image processing, but here, explanations not directly related to the present embodiment have been omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The color matching unit <b>111</b> performs a color adjustment using a color matching LUT <b>1111</b>, such as an ICC profile. The calibration unit <b>112</b> performs an image correction (calibration) for keeping a printing condition constant, using a calibration LUT <b>1121</b>. That is to say, the CMYK values of the image data to be formed (device values) that are output from the color matching unit <b>111</b> are converted multidimensionally using the calibration LUT <b>1121</b>, thus obtaining corrected CMYK values.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The temperature drop correction unit <b>115</b> generates a corrected temperature <b>1151</b> by correcting the temperature <b>1221</b> obtained from a temperature sensor unit <b>122</b> located in the engine unit <b>12</b>, based on the device value (patch data) <b>1112</b> obtained from the color matching unit <b>111</b>. This corrected temperature <b>1151</b> corresponds to the temperature at the time when the color of the patch based on the patch data is measured with the color sensor unit <b>123</b>, and is the estimated patch colorimetry temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an outline of the operation of the temperature drop correction unit <b>115</b>. As shown in this figure, the temperature drop correction unit <b>115</b> includes a temperature drop table <b>1201</b> indicating the characteristics of the patch temperature drops, and a correction amount calculation unit <b>1202</b>. In the temperature drop correction unit <b>115</b>, the correction amount calculation unit <b>1202</b> calculates a correction amount by looking up the temperature drop table <b>1201</b>, which has been prepared in advance. A method for preparing this temperature drop table <b>1201</b> is explained later.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The colorimetric value correction unit <b>114</b> estimates the patch colorimetric value at a predetermined desired temperature (object temperature) by correcting the patch colorimetric values with respect to temperature fluctuations, based on the patch colorimetry temperature estimated with the temperature drop correction unit <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an overview of the operation of the colorimetric value correction unit <b>114</b>. As shown in this figure, the device value <b>1112</b> from the color matching unit <b>111</b>, the patch colorimetry temperature <b>1151</b> corrected with the temperature drop correction unit <b>115</b>, and the colorimetric value <b>1231</b> from the color sensor unit <b>123</b> in the engine unit <b>12</b> are entered into the colorimetric value correction unit <b>114</b>. Then, a correction of the colorimetric value is performed using the specified object temperature and the previously set temperature characteristics LUT <b>1141</b> of the reference patch, and the corrected colorimetric value <b>1142</b> is output.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">It should be noted that in the present embodiment, the process for estimating the patch colorimetric value with the colorimetric value correction unit <b>114</b> can be performed in the same manner as in the above-discussed related art, so that a further detailed discussion thereof has been omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The LUT generation unit <b>113</b> generates the calibration LUT <b>1121</b> in the calibration unit <b>112</b>, using the corrected colorimetric value <b>1142</b> at the object temperature, which has been corrected by the colorimetric value correction unit <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">On the other hand, the engine unit <b>12</b> includes a fixing unit <b>121</b>, which fixes the patch formed on the medium by applying heat and pressure, a temperature sensor unit <b>122</b> that measures the temperature of the patch on the medium or the white portion of the paper, and a color sensor unit <b>123</b> that measures the color of the patch on the medium. It should be noted that the engine unit <b>12</b> includes further functional components for forming an image on a medium, but here, explanations not directly related to the present embodiment have been omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The fixing unit <b>121</b> includes a combination of a roller and a belt and has a built-in heat source, such as a halogen heater. It melts the toner attached onto the medium by applying heat and pressure and fixes it thereto. The temperature sensor unit <b>122</b> and the color sensor unit <b>123</b> are arranged along the transport path from the fixing unit <b>121</b> to the ejection port, and respectively measure the temperature of the patch and the color value of the patch.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the printer <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment, the temperature sensor unit <b>122</b> and the color sensor unit <b>123</b> are arranged at a predetermined distance from each other, and the temperature drop while the medium is transported between the sensors, immediately after the patch has been fixed to it, depends on the patch. In the present embodiment, the temperature drop correction unit <b>115</b> corrects the patch temperature measured with the temperature sensor unit <b>122</b> considering the temperature drop of the patch. In the following, first, a process for preparing the temperature drop table, which is necessary for correcting the temperature drop of the patch, is explained. Then, a process by which the printer <b>1</b> corrects the patch temperature drop using the temperature drop table is explained.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Process for Preparing Patch Temperature Drop Characteristics Table</heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to the flowchart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the following is an explanation of a process for preparing in advance the temperature drop table <b>1201</b>, which is necessary for correcting the temperature drop of the patch with the temperature drop correction unit <b>115</b>. It should be noted that this process is carried out by the printer <b>1</b>, and at that time, a special temperature sensor (referred to below as &#x201c;special temperature sensor&#x201d;), for measuring the temperature on the medium that has been transported to the position of the color sensor unit <b>123</b>, needs to be provided separately from the temperature sensor unit <b>122</b>. A radiation thermometer or the like can be used as the special temperature sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">First, in step S<b>1001</b>, the medium (recording paper) serving as the target is provided, and the printer <b>1</b> forms a maximized patch which has maximum loading of the coloring sample on that target medium (maximally loaded patch). For this maximally loaded patch, the printer <b>1</b> may print a patch in which each of the printable toners, that is, cyan, magenta, yellow and black, is printed at a density of 100%, that is, at a total density of 400%.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Then, in step S<b>1002</b>, the temperature at the position where the maximally loaded patch passes the color sensor unit <b>123</b> is measured as the maximally loaded patch temperature Tm by the above-noted special temperature sensor (not shown in the figures). That is to say, the target medium, on which the maximally loaded patch has been printed in step S<b>1001</b>, is transported to the vicinity of the color sensor unit <b>123</b>, and when the maximally loaded patch passes the color sensor unit <b>123</b>, the maximally loaded patch temperature Tm is measured by the special temperature sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Next, in step S<b>1003</b>, the temperature of a white portion on the target medium while passing the color sensor unit <b>123</b> is measured as the paper white temperature at the colorimetry Tw (at the time the color is measured), by the special temperature sensor (not shown in the figures). Here, the white portion on the target medium corresponds to a paper white patch without coloring sample (that is, a portion of the patch without coloring that is left white).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The temperature sensor unit <b>122</b> measures the temperature T<b>0</b> (paper white temperature at the temperature measurement) when the target medium passes the temperature sensor unit <b>122</b>. Then, the relation between the temperature T<b>0</b> (paper white temperature at the temperature measurement) and the temperature Tw (paper white temperature at the colorimetry), and more specifically the temperature difference between the two is calculated as the temperature difference between the sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Next, in step S<b>1004</b>, the temperature drop table <b>1201</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is prepared based on the relation between the maximally loaded patch temperature Tm and the paper white temperature at the colorimetry Tw obtained in steps S<b>1002</b> and S<b>1003</b>, and the amount of the color sample on the patch (referred to below as &#x201c;patch amount&#x201d;). As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the temperature of the patch formed on the target medium changes with the patch amount. Assuming that this change is linear, it is possible to estimate the temperature at the time that patch passes the color sensor unit <b>123</b> (patch colorimetry temperature), for any patch amount.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The temperature drop table <b>1201</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) prepared in this manner and the temperature difference between the sensors are looked up whenever the printer <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment corrects the patch temperature drop. For this reason, the temperature drop table <b>1201</b> is held within the temperature drop correction unit <b>115</b>, and similarly, also the temperature difference between the sensors is held in a memory (not shown in the figures) within the temperature drop correction unit <b>115</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Processing for Correcting the Drop of the Patch Temperature</heading>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the following is an explanation of the processing for correcting the patch temperature drop by looking up the temperature drop table <b>1201</b> prepared in the manner described above. It should be noted that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the processing by which the temperature drop correction unit <b>115</b> corrects the patch temperature drop, as well as the processing by which the colorimetric value correction unit <b>114</b> thereafter corrects colorimetric value fluctuations due to temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">First, in step S<b>1301</b>, a patch constituted by device color values (C<b>0</b>, M<b>0</b>, Y<b>0</b>, K<b>0</b>) is printed. Here, the printed patch may be of any color, and it is possible to print any patch depending on the purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the following step S<b>1302</b>, the temperature of a white paper portion on the medium, transported through the fixing unit <b>121</b> to the color sensor unit <b>123</b> within the engine unit <b>12</b>, is measured by the temperature sensor unit <b>122</b>. The temperature that is measured here is the medium paper white temperature Tw<b>0</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the next step S<b>1303</b>, the color sensor unit <b>123</b> within the engine <b>12</b> measures the color of the patch and obtains the colorimetric value <b>1231</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the next step S<b>1304</b>, the correction amount calculation unit <b>1202</b> of the temperature drop correction unit <b>115</b> calculates the patch amount, and based on this patch amount, calculates the corrected temperature (patch colorimetry temperature) <b>1151</b> of the patch.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">First, the total amount PQ (%) indicating the amount of the coloring sample used when forming the patch (C<b>0</b>, M<b>0</b>, Y<b>0</b>, K<b>0</b>) on the medium is calculated with the following Equation (1):
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>PQ=C</i>0+<i>M</i>0+<i>Y</i>0+<i>K</i>0&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Then, based on the temperature drop table shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and the temperature difference between the sensors calculated at the time of preparing that table, the corrected temperature Tc (patch colorimetry temperature <b>1151</b>) for the patch is calculated with the following Equation (2):
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Tc=Tw</i>0+(<i>Tm&#x2212;Tw</i>)&#xd7;<i>PQ/</i>400+(<i>Tw&#x2212;T</i>0)&#x2003;&#x2003;(2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The second term on the right in Equation (2), that is, the term (Tm&#x2212;Tw)&#xd7;PQ/400 indicates the correction amount depending on the specific heat of the output patch, and the correction of the patch temperature is performed using the temperature drop table shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the value calculated by this second term on the right corresponds to the temperature difference between the patch colorimetry temperature based on the temperature drop table, and the medium paper white temperature Tw<b>0</b>. Consequently, this temperature difference is added to the medium paper white temperature Tw<b>0</b> of the first term on the right.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The third term on the right in Equation (2), that is, the term (Tw&#x2212;T<b>0</b>) indicates the temperature difference between the sensors that has already been calculated in the above-noted step S<b>1003</b>. In Equation (2), the correction to the paper white temperature at the position of the color sensor unit <b>123</b> is performed by measuring with the temperature sensor unit <b>122</b> and adding the temperature difference between the sensors to the medium paper white temperature Tw<b>0</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the last step S<b>1305</b>, the colorimetric value correction unit <b>114</b> performs a colorimetric value correction, in which it corrects the colorimetric value of the patch using this corrected temperature Tc. That is to say, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the colorimetric value <b>1231</b> of the patch obtained in step S<b>1303</b> is corrected based on the patch colorimetry temperature <b>1151</b> (Tc) obtained in step S<b>1304</b> and the device value (CMYK) <b>1112</b> used when printing the patch.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">With the present embodiment as explained above, it is possible to suitably correct the colorimetric value of a patch of any color, taking into account the temperature changes from immediately after fixing the patch up to the color sensing. Consequently, since a suitable colorimetric value is obtained, more suitable print processing becomes possible.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">It should be noted that a feature of the present invention is that the drop of the patch temperature when the medium is transported immediately after fixing the patch is corrected, so that the method for utilizing the temperature of the patch after the correction is not limited to the example of the present embodiment.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Modified Examples</heading>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Other Configurations of the Temperature Sensor</heading>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As discussed above, in the present embodiment, the temperature sensor unit <b>122</b> measures, as an example, the medium paper white temperature Tw<b>0</b> at the time of transport, and the temperature is corrected to the temperature of the white paper that would be measured at the color sensor unit <b>123</b>. It is also possible to estimate the white paper temperature of the medium at the color sensor unit <b>123</b> with a configuration using, instead of the temperature sensor unit <b>122</b>, the atmospheric temperature immediately after the fixing and a temperature sensor that is ordinarily arranged in the fixing roller.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Omitting the Temperature Sensor</heading>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Furthermore, in the present embodiment, as an example, the estimation of the patch temperature was carried out by entering a signal into the temperature drop correction unit <b>115</b> from the temperature sensor unit <b>122</b> every time as the paper white temperature Tw<b>0</b> of the transported medium. Here, the case is considered that the medium paper white temperature Tw<b>0</b> measured by the temperature sensor unit <b>122</b> is constant, and the maximally loaded patch temperature Tm at the position of the color sensor unit <b>123</b> and the paper white temperature Tw at the time of colorimetry are both substantially constant. In this case, the correction equation for obtaining the corrected temperature Tc can be expressed by the following simpler Equation (3):
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Tc=Tw+</i>(<i>Tm&#x2212;Tw</i>)&#xd7;<i>PQ/</i>400&#x2003;&#x2003;(3)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In this case, a measurement with the temperature sensor unit <b>122</b> included in the configuration of the printer <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> becomes unnecessary, so that the printer <b>1</b> can be configured in a simpler manner, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Omitting the Temperature Drop Correction Unit</heading>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the corrected temperature Tc according to Equation (3) can be reflected in the temperature characteristics LUT <b>1141</b>, which is prepared by measuring the variation amount of the colorimetric value due to temperature changes for a plurality of reference patches, held in the colorimetric value correction unit <b>114</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. That is to say, the results of determining the temperature drop using the above-noted correction equation (3) for a plurality of reference patches can be combined in the temperature characteristics LUT <b>1141</b>. As a result of this combination, the colorimetric value correction unit <b>114</b> operates as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, so that the calculation costs for correcting the colorimetric values can be reduced. In this case, the temperature drop correction unit <b>115</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> becomes unnecessary, so that a simpler configuration can be realized, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="1">When the Specific Heat Differs for Each Toner Color</heading>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the above embodiment, a correction was performed with the Correction Equations (1) and (2) using the total amount PQ, which was obtained by adding up the amounts of the individual colors under the assumption that the specific heat per unit weight is the same for each of cyan, magenta, yellow and black toner. However, if the specific heats a, b, c and d per unit amount of the cyan, magenta, yellow and black toner differ, then a patch specific heat amount PE should be calculated instead of the total amount PQ, and the correction should be carried out using this value. That is to say, the correction should be carried out with the following Equations (4) and (5):

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the above-described first embodiment, as an example, the temperature drop due to the paper transport was estimated from the temperature drop of both the maximally loaded patch and the white paper medium (white paper patch), under the assumption that the temperature of the medium is ordinarily uniform immediately after the fixing process by applying heat and pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">However, in a system employing another fixing method, such as for example UV fixing, the amount of thermal energy that is absorbed depends on the color of the patch, so that the initial value of the temperature differs, and consequently the patch temperature that is measured at the location of the color sensor unit <b>123</b> also depends on the color of the patch.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In this case, the temperature at the location of the color sensor unit <b>123</b> can be measured for a number of patches with representative device values (reference patches), and a multidimensional temperature drop table <b>1201</b> can be configured having a plurality of device values. Thus, the temperature drop of any patch can be estimated by LUT interpolation with the temperature drop table <b>1201</b> in accordance with the device values of the patches.</p>
