<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to domestic pets, and in particular, to an apparatus adapted for the quick removal of dirt and debris from a pet's feet and legs.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One (1) of the foremost responsibilities of caring for a domestic pet is that of allowing the pet to go to the bathroom. For many indoors animals, this requires either providing a designated bathroom area for the pet or allowing them to go outdoors at regular intervals. In many cases, this activity is undertaken several times every day.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A prominent inconvenience with most methods of allowing a pet to go to the bathroom is that the pet is prone to subsequently track substantial amounts of dirt and other foreign materials around the indoors of the domicile. Litter boxes and the like are rife with small bits of material which cling to a pet easily and are subsequently scattered about ground surfaces. Allowing a pet to go outdoors in order to go to the bathroom can result in the pet tracking dirt, moisture, and other foreign materials back into a house. This problem is particularly aggravated during unfavorable weather such as rain and snow. As a result, a caretaker is relegated to either cleaning the domicile afterwards or spending time in a difficult effort to wash and dry the pet upon reentering the house.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various attempts have been made to provide devices which help to prevent tracking of dirt and foreign matter through a household by a pet. Examples of these attempts can be seen by reference to several U.S. patents. U.S. Pat. No. 5,797,352, issued in the name of Ebert, describes a paw cleaning litter mat which comprises a plurality of inclined louvers in order to trap and retain cat litter or the like prior to subsequent scattering throughout a domicile.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 6,439,160, issued in the name of Wheelwright, describes a paw cleaning apparatus for animals which provides vibrating brushes in order to effect removal of foreign material from an animal's lower extremities.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 6,851,391, issued in the name of Mulich et al., describes a cylindrical apparatus for brushing a single animal paw and leg and removing debris via a suctioning of the cylinder upon removal of the pet's leg.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat. No. 7,111,585, issued in the name of Hale et al., describes a paw cleaning device which provides localized moistening of an animal's paws as the animal traverses the device, effecting removal of dirt and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">While these devices fulfill their respective, particular objectives, each of these references suffer from one (1) or more of the aforementioned disadvantages. Many such devices depend upon the animal to engage the device, which results in inefficient use or necessary undesirable placement of the device within a domicile. Also, many such devices are uncomfortable or unpleasant for an animal to use. Furthermore, many such devices do not provide a sufficient level of cleaning to remove large amount of dirt and foreign material from a pet's paws. Accordingly, there exists a need for a pet paw and leg cleaning device without the disadvantages as described above. The development of the present invention substantially departs from the conventional solutions and in doing so fulfills this need.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In view of the foregoing references, the inventor recognized the aforementioned inherent problems and observed that there is a need for a means to provide comfortable and thorough cleaning to a pet prior to entry into a domicile in a manner which is quick and easily repeatable for a caretaker. Thus, the object of the present invention is to solve the aforementioned disadvantages and provide for this need.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">To achieve the above objectives, it is an object of the present invention to comprise an animal paw massager and dirt remover which provides an aid in the cleaning of an animal's paws. The apparatus comprises a plastic basin assembly and a plurality of vibrators. The vibrators are integrally housed within a lower portion of the basin assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another object of the present invention is to conduct vibrating energy into a contained cleaning fluid in order to clean an animal's paws and lower legs.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Yet still another object of the present invention is to provide enough space within the basin to accommodate a domestic pet standing within. The basin may be providing in various length and width sizes based upon intended utilization.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Yet still another object of the present invention is to provide a comfortable standing surface for an animal while promoting circulation of a contained fluid around the paws of an animal. A floor portion of the basin comprises a plurality of equally spaced hemispherical protrusions.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Yet still another object of the present invention is to facilitate transportation of the apparatus via handle portions which extend outward from a top rim of the basin.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Yet still another object of the present invention is to stabilize the apparatus upon a floor surface via a plurality of integrally molded supporting feet along a bottom portion of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Yet still another object of the present invention is to remove foreign material from an animal's paws and lower legs via vibrating motioning of the vibrators, a soluble cleaning fluid, and the textured floor portion of the basin.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Yet still another object of the present invention is to provide a soothing function to an animal via the vibrating motions of the vibrators.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Yet still another object of the present invention is to provide a draining means for a contained fluid via an integral drain valve located in a lower portion of the basin. The drain valve comprises a lever-operated valve and a male hose receptacle which allows connection to a hose to route the fluid to a suitable waste water receptacle.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Yet still another object of the present invention is to provide protective waterproof enclosure to the electrical components of the apparatus including the vibrators, a battery power source, and interconnecting wiring. The batteries are replaceable via a battery access panel along a bottom portion of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Yet still another object of the present invention is to allow a user to select a desired level of vibration to be applied to the basin and fluid via a variable output voltage control switch located along a side portion of the basin assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Yet still another object of the present invention is to provide a method of utilizing the device that provides a unique means of obtaining an apparatus of a desired aesthetic appearance and size, installing batteries via the battery access panel, placing the apparatus upon a flat floor surface, filling the basin assembly with a desired volume of water and cleaning fluid, placing or walking a pet into the basin, motioning the control switch to provide a desired level of vibration, washing and treating the paw and lower legs of the pet via the vibrating motions, cleaning fluid, and textured floor portions of the basin, stopping the vibrations via the control switch, removing the animal from the apparatus, draining the fluid from the basin via the drain valve as desired, and allowing the pet to enter a domicile with substantially clean paws and legs.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Further objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from a consideration of the drawings and ensuing description.</p>
