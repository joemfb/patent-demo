<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to oscillator circuits and in particular to a low noise CMOS ring oscillator.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Unless otherwise indicated herein, the approaches described in this section are not prior art to the claims in this application and are not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) ring oscillators are widely used in Phase Locked Loop (PLL) circuits. PLLs are commonly used for clock and data recovery, frequency synthesis, clock generation circuitry, etc. Among the various types of CMOS ring oscillators, inverter based single ended or differential ring oscillators are recognized as being efficient and are often the ring oscillator design of choice.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a schematic diagram for a three-stage inverter-based ring oscillator <b>100</b>. The ring oscillator <b>100</b> comprises a chain of three inverters <b>102</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>b</i>, and <b>102</b><i>c </i>connected in cascade fashion. The output of last inverter <b>102</b><i>c </i>feeds back into the input of the first inverter <b>102</b><i>a</i>. Inverter-based ring oscillators can be constructed with any odd number of inverters.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a circuit diagram of a typical inverter cell <b>102</b> that may be used for inverters <b>102</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>b</i>, and <b>102</b><i>c </i>in the ring oscillator <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The inverter cell <b>102</b> comprises a first transistor <b>122</b> and a second transistor <b>124</b>. The transistors <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> may be Field Effect Transistors (FETs). A gate G of each transistor <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> is connected to an input terminal V<sub>in </sub>of the inverter cell <b>112</b>. A drain D of each transistor <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> is connected to an output terminal V<sub>OUT </sub>of the inverter cell <b>102</b>. A source S of transistor <b>122</b> is configured for connection to a first voltage potential; e.g., V<sub>SS</sub>. A source S of transistor <b>124</b> is configured for connection to a second voltage potential; e.g., V<sub>DD</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As semiconductor manufacturing processes continue to shrink and the requirements for higher switching speeds continue to increase, inverter-based ring oscillators are designed with increasingly smaller device sizes in order to maintain reasonable levels of power consumption. As device dimensions decrease, device noise in ring oscillators become significant. One kind of noise called &#x201c;flicker noise,&#x201d; which occurs in most electronic devices, is dominant at low frequencies. For inverter-based ring oscillator devices using deep submicron processes like 45 nm processes or 30 nm processes, flicker noise can predominate at frequencies as high as about 10 MHz-20 MHz. For frequencies above a corner frequency of 10 MHz to 20 MHz, &#x201c;thermal noise&#x201d; tends to predominate. For circuit applications that run at 1 MHz to 10 MHz, the flicker noise is the predominant noise source, and can manifest itself in the output signal of the ring oscillator as phase noise (frequency domain) or jitter (time domain).</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous examples and specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be evident, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention as defined by the claims may include some or all of the features in these examples alone or in combination with other features described below, and may further include modifications and equivalents of the features and concepts described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an inverter cell <b>202</b> in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure comprises a first transistor M<sub>1 </sub>and a second transistor M<sub>2</sub>, and a first resistor R<sub>1 </sub>and a second resistor R<sub>2</sub>. The transistors M<sub>1 </sub>and M<sub>2 </sub>may be FETs; e.g., Metal Oxide Semiconductor FETs (MOSFETs). In an embodiment, the transistor M<sub>1 </sub>is an N-channel MOSFET and the transistor M<sub>2 </sub>is a P-channel MOSFET. It will be appreciated of course that other combinations of transistor types for M<sub>1 </sub>and M<sub>2 </sub>may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">An input terminal V<sub>in </sub>of the inverter cell <b>202</b> is connected to a gate G of each transistor M<sub>1 </sub>and M<sub>2</sub>. An output terminal V<sub>OUT </sub>of the inverter cell <b>202</b> is connected to a drain D of each transistor M<sub>1 </sub>and M<sub>2</sub>. A source S of transistor M<sub>1 </sub>is connected to a first terminal <b>212</b> of resistor R<sub>1</sub>. A second terminal <b>214</b> of resistor R<sub>1 </sub>may be connected to a first power rail <b>222</b> that is configured for connection to a first voltage potential; e.g., V<sub>SS</sub>. A source S of transistor M<sub>2 </sub>is connected to a first terminal <b>216</b> of resistor R<sub>2</sub>. A second terminal <b>218</b> of resistor R<sub>2 </sub>may be connected to a second power rail <b>224</b> that is configured for connection to a second voltage potential; e.g., V<sub>DD</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a ring oscillator <b>300</b> comprising inverter cells <b>302</b><i>a</i>, <b>302</b><i>b</i>, and <b>302</b><i>c </i>of the form shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In some embodiments, the inverter cells <b>302</b><i>a</i>, <b>302</b><i>b</i>, and <b>302</b><i>c </i>are connected in cascade fashion. Accordingly, the output V<sub>OUT </sub>of cell <b>302</b><i>a </i>is fed into the input V<sub>in </sub>of cell <b>302</b><i>b</i>. The output V<sub>OUT </sub>of cell <b>302</b><i>b </i>is fed into the input V<sub>in </sub>of cell <b>302</b><i>c</i>. The output V<sub>OUT </sub>of cell <b>302</b><i>c </i>is fed back into the input V<sub>in </sub>of cell <b>302</b><i>a</i>. The resistors R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>of each cell <b>302</b><i>a</i>, <b>302</b><i>b</i>, and <b>302</b><i>c </i>may be connected to respective power rails <b>322</b> and <b>324</b> to provide power to the ring oscillator <b>300</b>. The power rails <b>322</b> and <b>324</b>, in turn, may be at respective first and second voltage potentials (e.g., V<sub>SS </sub>and V<sub>DD</sub>). In some embodiments, the ring oscillator <b>300</b> may include additional cells. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates a more generic ring oscillator design <b>300</b>&#x2032; comprising some number of stages <b>302</b><i>a </i>through <b>302</b><i>n </i>other than the three stages shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The number of stages <b>302</b><i>a </i>through <b>302</b><i>n </i>may be an even number or an odd number.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The ring oscillator <b>300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> may output an oscillatory signal <b>304</b><i>a </i>at a terminal <b>304</b>. The resistors R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>can attenuate the level of flicker noise (phase noise) in the output signal <b>304</b><i>a </i>as a result of the effect of resistor degeneration. Though the output signal <b>304</b><i>a </i>is oscillatory, its shape may not be adequate for use by electronic circuits that the ring oscillator <b>300</b> is being used in. For example, the output signal <b>304</b><i>a </i>may not be a properly formed square (or rectangular) wave or a properly formed sinusoidal wave. Accordingly, additional circuitry may be used to produce a suitable waveform. For instance, the output signal <b>304</b><i>a </i>may be further processed by a buffer that can output a properly formed square wave based on the received output signal.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 1A</figref>, the frequency of the output signal of the ring oscillator <b>100</b> is dependent upon various aspects of the design of the ring oscillator. For example, the number of inverter stages that comprise the ring oscillator <b>100</b> affects the frequency. The frequency will decrease as the number of inverter stages increase, because each additional inverter adds to the propagation delay of the signal along the chain of inverters and hence how frequently the output signal will switch between HI and LO logic levels.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The transconductance (g<sub>m</sub>) of the inverters that comprise a ring oscillator <b>100</b> is another factor that affects the frequency of the output signal of the ring oscillator. The transconductance of a CMOS inverter is a function of the device size of its constituent transistors. Referring to the inverter cell <b>102</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, for example, the device size of FET transistor <b>124</b> is typically specified by its channel dimensions, which may be expressed as the ratio W/L, where W is the FET channel width (W) and L is the FET channel length. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows typical channel dimensions for the FET transistors <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> of the inverter <b>102</b>. For example, transistor <b>122</b> may have a channel dimension of 600/100 and transistor <b>124</b> may have a channel dimension of 1200/100. The transconductance also affects power consumption in each inverter during operation, and hence power consumption of the ring oscillator <b>100</b> as a whole.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure, the transconductance of the inverter <b>202</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is dependent not only on the channel dimensions of FET transistors M<sub>1 </sub>and M<sub>2</sub>, but also on the sizes of the resistors R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2</sub>. Suppose the inverters <b>302</b><i>a</i>, <b>302</b><i>b</i>, and <b>302</b><i>c </i>comprising ring oscillator <b>300</b> are designed to have substantially the same transconductance as the design of inverter <b>102</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. For example, the transconductance of the particular inverter design shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is substantially the same as the transconductance as the design of inverter <b>102</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, where the channel dimension of FET transistor M<sub>1 </sub>is 1200/50, the channel dimension of FET transistor M<sub>2 </sub>is 2400/50, and each resistor R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>is 600&#x3a9;. In other embodiments, the resistors R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>may have different resistance values. Suppose the inverters <b>302</b><i>a</i>, <b>302</b><i>b</i>, and <b>302</b><i>c </i>use the inverter design of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Since the ring oscillator <b>300</b> is also a three-stage device as is ring oscillator <b>100</b>, then the output frequency and power consumption performance of both ring oscillators <b>100</b> and <b>300</b> are about the same. However, the ring oscillator <b>300</b> will exhibit attenuated flicker noise, and in particular reduced phase noise.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Simulations of a three-stage ring oscillator designed using the inverter cell <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> and a three-stage ring oscillator designed using the inverter cell <b>202</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> were compared. Both ring oscillators were designed to produce an output signal in the gigahertz range. The simulations have shown that the ring oscillator based on the inverter cell <b>202</b> exhibits a 2.5 dB reduction in phase noise at 10 MHz as compared to the ring oscillator based on the inverter cell <b>102</b>. Simulations were made using ring oscillators designed for 3-5 GHz output signals with even greater improvement; a 6 dB difference in phase noise was noted.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, the resistor degeneration effect in the ring oscillator <b>300</b> can be increased to further attenuate phase noise by increasing the sizes of the resistors R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>in the ring oscillator. However, the frequency of the output signal <b>304</b><i>a </i>is inversely related to the resistance of the resistors R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, increasing the resistance of resistors R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>in an attempt to further attenuate phase noise will also decrease the frequency of the output signal <b>304</b><i>a. </i></p>

The inverter cell <b>212</b> includes a capacitor C to compensate for the reduction in the frequency of the output signal <b>304</b><i>a </i>that may result from using bigger resistors R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2</sub>. In the particular embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the capacitor C has a capacitance of 10 pF.</p>

The cells <b>312</b><i>a</i>, <b>312</b><i>b</i>, and <b>312</b><i>c </i>are connected in cascade fashion; for example, the output V<sub>OUT </sub>of cell <b>312</b><i>a </i>is fed into the input V<sub>in </sub>of cell <b>312</b><i>b</i>. The output V<sub>OUT </sub>of cell <b>312</b><i>b </i>is fed into the input V<sub>in </sub>of cell <b>312</b><i>c</i>.
