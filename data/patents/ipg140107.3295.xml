<heading id="h-0003" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates generally to semiconductor device fabrication and, more particularly, to composite semiconductor substrates for use in semiconductor device fabrication.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">With increasing interest in thin-film devices, flexible electronics, and three-dimensional integration schemes, techniques have been developed to transfer thin-film device layers from a growth substrate with one set of characteristics desirable for growth of the device layers, such as a particular lattice parameter or a particular crystallographic orientation, to an alternate, device substrate with another set of characteristics desirable for the intended application, such as high flexibility or high thermal conductivity. Traditionally, wafer bonding and grind or etchback techniques have been used to achieve this goal. Though effective, these techniques can significantly add to resource consumption and fabrication cost, as a growth substrate can be substantially consumed as a result of grinding or etchback. Certain thin-film device layer transfer techniques, such as thin-film lift-off, can allow device layer removal while leaving a growth substrate intact for reuse. However, the resulting freestanding device layers can be difficult to manipulate for subsequent bonding to a dissimilar, device substrate. Other thin-film device layer transfer techniques, such as Cleavage of Lateral Epitaxial Films for Transfer (&#x201c;CLEFT&#x201d;) and Electronic Layer Transfer (&#x201c;ELTRAN&#x201d;), exploit mechanically weak layers to facilitate device layer transfer to an alternate, device substrate. Unfortunately, these techniques can suffer from certain deficiencies that limit their applicability. In particular, device layer transfer by the CLEFT technique can be restricted to the use of growth substrates having a particular crystallographic orientation, while the ELTRAN technique can be restricted to a particular lattice parameter related to silicon homoepitaxial or pseudomorphic growth.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is against this background that a need arose to develop the composite semiconductor substrates and related devices and methods described herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One aspect of the invention relates to a semiconductor device fabrication method. In one embodiment, the method includes: (1) etching a silicon substrate to form a porous silicon layer adjacent to a surface of the silicon substrate, wherein the porous silicon layer has a Young's modulus value in the range of 35 percent to 65 percent of a corresponding Young's modulus value of bulk silicon; (2) forming a first silicon nitride layer adjacent to the porous silicon layer of the silicon substrate; (3) forming a second silicon nitride layer adjacent to a surface of an indium phosphide substrate; (4) bonding the first silicon nitride layer with the second silicon nitride layer to form a set of bonded substrates; and (5) separating the set of bonded substrates along an interface within the indium phosphide substrate to form a composite substrate, wherein an indium phosphide layer adjacent to the second silicon nitride layer is separated from a remainder of the indium phosphide substrate, and the composite substrate includes the indium phosphide layer.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another embodiment, the method includes: (1) providing a first substrate including a first semiconductor material, wherein the first substrate has a first Young's modulus value; (2) forming a porous layer within the first substrate, wherein the porous layer has a second Young's modulus value in the range of 35 percent to 65 percent of the first Young's modulus value; (3) forming a first bonding layer adjacent to the porous layer of the first substrate; (4) providing a second substrate including a second semiconductor material, wherein the second semiconductor material is different from the first semiconductor material; (5) forming a second bonding layer adjacent to a surface of the second substrate; (6) implanting hydrogen ions in the second substrate; (7) bonding the first bonding layer of the first substrate with the second bonding layer of the second substrate to form a set of bonded substrates; and (8) based on the implanted hydrogen ions, exfoliating a layer of the second semiconductor material adjacent to the second bonding layer, wherein the exfoliated layer of the second semiconductor material is separated from a remainder of the second substrate so as to form a composite substrate including the exfoliated layer of the second semiconductor material.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another aspect of the invention relates to a composite substrate for semiconductor device fabrication. In one embodiment, the composite substrate includes: (1) a bulk silicon layer; (2) a porous silicon layer adjacent to the bulk silicon layer, wherein the porous silicon layer has a Young's modulus value that is no greater than 110.5 GigaPascal (&#x201c;GPa&#x201d;); (3) an epitaxial template layer, wherein the epitaxial template layer has a root-mean-square surface roughness value in the range of 0.2 nanometer (&#x201c;nm&#x201d;) to 1 nm; and (4) a set of bonding layers disposed between the porous silicon layer and the epitaxial template layer.</p>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Composite Semiconductor Substrates</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Certain embodiments of the invention relate to a composite semiconductor substrate that is readily capable of thin-film device layer transfer to another substrate, without the constraint of a particular lattice parameter or a particular crystallographic orientation for growth of thin-film device layers. The composite substrate also can be referred as a &#x201c;Transfer-Enhanced Semiconductor&#x201d; substrate or a TES substrate. Application of wafer bonding and hydrogen exfoliation techniques to form the composite substrate allows dissimilar materials to be readily and effectively incorporated within the composite substrate, while maintaining a high degree of crystalline quality for epitaxial growth of thin-film device layers. In particular, the techniques described herein can be used to incorporate a thin layer of a desired epitaxial template material on a handle substrate of a dissimilar material having desired bulk characteristics. In such manner, a variety of handle substrate-epitaxial template combinations can be realized to form different heterostructures, and a lattice parameter and a crystallographic orientation of a handle substrate are no longer constraints. The incorporation of an embedded porous layer having relatively weaker mechanical characteristics adds an additional degree of freedom to a composite substrate, facilitating transfer of overlying epitaxial template and device layers by mechanical fracture through a cross-section of the composite substrate. Thus, the techniques described herein allow a variety of possibilities for heterogeneous materials integration as well as facile transfer capabilities to device substrates with more desirable characteristics for the intended application, such as high flexibility or high thermal conductivity. Furthermore, the techniques allow a significant reduction in overall cost and resource consumption for semiconductor device fabrication, since an epitaxial template substrate and a handle substrate can be reused for subsequent device layer formation and transfer operations.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Attention first turns to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which illustrates a semiconductor device fabrication method implemented in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. By way of overview, a handle substrate is provided, and is subjected to etching, thereby forming a lower-density porous layer within the handle substrate and adjacent to a surface of the handle substrate (stage <b>100</b>). The porous layer is mechanically weaker, and allows subsequent transfer of overlying thin-film device layers to a device substrate. Next, an epitaxial template substrate is provided, and bonding layers are formed adjacent to respective surfaces of the handle substrate and the epitaxial template substrate (stages <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>). The epitaxial template substrate, which is implanted with hydrogen ions (stage <b>106</b>), is then bonded to the handle substrate via the bonding layers (stage <b>108</b>). A thin layer of an epitaxial template material is transferred from the epitaxial template substrate to the handle substrate through hydrogen exfoliation (stage <b>110</b>), and the transferred epitaxial template layer is subjected to further processing to achieve a surface of low roughness and high crystalline quality for epitaxial growth of a set of overlying device layers. The device layers are formed adjacent to the epitaxial template layer, and the device layers are subsequently separated from the handle substrate and transferred to an alternate, device substrate, by bonding the device layers to the device substrate and initiating mechanical fracture within the porous layer (stage <b>112</b>). In such manner, the device layers are readily transferred to the device substrate, without being subjected to excessive chemical or mechanical processing that can be detrimental to the resulting semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to stage <b>100</b> in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the handle substrate is a [001]-oriented p+-silicon wafer having a resistivity in the range of about 0.001 &#x3a9;.cm to about 0.005 &#x3a9;.cm, although it is contemplated that a variety of other p-type and highly re-doped silicon wafers can be used as the handle substrate. It is also contemplated that a crystallographic orientation of the silicon wafer can vary for other embodiments, and that the handle substrate, in general, can be formed of a variety of semiconductor materials, including other Group IV semiconductor materials, having desirable bulk characteristics and that are capable of being processed to form a porous layer. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the silicon wafer is subjected to anodic etching by placing the silicon wafer in an electrochemical cell with a gold wire mesh cathode and with the silicon wafer serving as an anode. Within the electrochemical cell, the silicon wafer is contacted with an electrolyte including hydrofluoric acid, deionized water, and ethanol in a substantially 1:1:2 ratio, although it is contemplated that electrolyte components and their ratios can vary for other embodiments. A surface of the silicon wafer is anodized by applying a current density in the range of about 5 mA/cm<sup>2 </sup>to about 100 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, such as from about 10 mA/cm<sup>2 </sup>to about 100 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, from about 5 mA/cm<sup>2 </sup>to about 50 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, or about 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, for a time interval in the range of about 10 sec to about 10 min, such as from about 10 sec to about 5 min, from about 3 min to about 10 min, or about 5 min, thereby forming a porous silicon/silicon wafer. A doping condition of the starting silicon wafer and the anodization parameters can influence a porosity and a microstructure of the porous silicon layer and, therefore, a mechanical strength of the porous silicon layer.

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Next, at stage <b>102</b>, a bonding layer is formed by coating or covering a surface of the porous silicon layer with a silicon nitride layer having a thickness in the range of about 10 nm to about 100 nm, such as from about 10 nm to about 80 nm, from about 30 nm to about 80 nm, or about 50 nm.

Next, at stage <b>106</b>, the indium phosphide wafer is implanted with hydrogen ions in the form of H<sub>2 </sub>at a dose level in the range of about 1&#xd7;10<sup>16</sup>/cm<sup>2 </sup>to about 1&#xd7;10<sup>17</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>, such as from about 3&#xd7;10<sup>16</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>to about 8&#xd7;10<sup>16</sup>/cm<sup>2 </sup>or about 5&#xd7;10<sup>16</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>, while cooled at a temperature below about 0&#xb0; C., such as about &#x2212;20&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to stage <b>108</b> in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the indium phosphide wafer and the porous silicon/silicon wafer are subjected to oxygen plasma activation at an oxygen pressure in the range of about 50 millitorr (&#x201c;mtorr&#x201d;) to about 300 mtorr, such as from about 100 mtorr to about 300 mtorr or about 200 mtorr, at a power level in the range of about 50 Watts (&#x201c;W&#x201d;) to about 300 W, such as from about 100 W to about 300 W or about 200 W, and for a time interval in the range of about 10 sec to about 5 min, such as from about 30 sec to about 2 min or about 1 min. The wafers are rinsed with deionized water and nitrogen-dried, and surfaces of their respective silicon nitride layers are aligned so as to face each other and are bonded at or near room temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Next, at stage <b>110</b>, the bonded wafers are subjected to multi-stage annealing, with each annealing stage carried out at a temperature T<sub>i </sub>for a time interval and i=1, . . . n, where n&#x2267;2. In particular, the bonded wafers are initially annealed at a temperature in the range of about 50&#xb0; C. to about 250&#xb0; C., such as from about 100&#xb0; C. to about 200&#xb0; C., from about 120&#xb0; C. to about 180&#xb0; C., or about 150&#xb0; C., for a time interval in the range of about 1 hr to about 10 hr, such as from about 2 hr to about 10 hr, from about 5 hr to about 10 hr, or about 8 hr, thereby strengthening the bonding and promoting diffusion of hydrogen ions to defects in the indium phosphide wafer. This initial annealing stage is followed by another annealing stage at a temperature in the range of about 200&#xb0; C. to about 400&#xb0; C., such as from about 250&#xb0; C. to about 350&#xb0; C., from about 270&#xb0; C. to about 330&#xb0; C., or about 300&#xb0; C., for a time interval in the range of about 5 sec to about 30 min, such as from about 5 sec to about 20 min or from about 1 min to about 20 min, thereby further strengthening the bonding, inducing exfoliation and transfer of an indium phosphide layer onto the porous silicon/silicon wafer, and removing residual implanted hydrogen ions. The wafer bonding and exfoliation parameters can influence characteristics of the indium phosphide layer that is separated from the indium phosphide wafer and transferred onto the porous silicon/silicon wafer. For example, insufficient annealing time can result in insufficient &#x201c;healing&#x201d; of the transferred indium phosphide layer and adversely affect its crystalline quality. After annealing, the transferred indium phosphide layer is subjected to chemical mechanical polishing to further remove implantation damage and planarize its surface. It is contemplated that another surface planarization technique can be used in place of, or in combination with, chemical mechanical polishing. After polishing, a thickness of the transferred indium phosphide layer can be in the range of about 0.05 &#x3bc;m to about 1 &#x3bc;m, such as from about 0.2 &#x3bc;m to about 0.5 &#x3bc;m, from about 0.2 &#x3bc;m to about 0.4 &#x3bc;m, or about 0.3 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Using the above-described fabrication parameters, a composite semiconductor substrate can be formed using the porous silicon/silicon wafer and the transferred indium phosphide layer, which serves as a template for epitaxial growth of thin-film device layers in stage <b>112</b>. The transferred indium phosphide layer can be characterized in accordance with conventional techniques, such as Atomic Force Microscopy (&#x201c;AFM&#x201d;), Cross-Sectional Transmission Electron Microscopy (&#x201c;XTEM&#x201d;), and High-Resolution X-ray Diffraction (&#x201c;HRXRD&#x201d;). For example, AFM can be used to characterize a surface roughness of the transferred indium phosphide layer in terms of an extent of variation of surface heights, such as in accordance with a root-mean-square (&#x201c;rms&#x201d;) value, while HRXRD can be used to characterize its crystalline quality in terms of a spectral width of a triple-axis X-ray rocking curve, such as in accordance with a Full-Width-at-Half-Maximum (&#x201c;FWHM&#x201d;) of a spectral peak. Advantageously, the transferred indium phosphide layer can be substantially planar, with a rms surface roughness value in the range of about 0.2 nm to about 1 nm, such as from about 0.3 nm to about 0.7 nm, from about 0.4 nm to about 0.6 nm, or about 0.5 nm, and can be of a high crystalline quality, with a FWHM in the range of about 25 arcsec to about 40 arcsec, such as from about 28 arcsec to about 38 arcsec, from about 28 arcsec to about 34 arcsec, or about 31 arcsec.</p>

As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an assembly <b>200</b> includes a composite semiconductor substrate <b>202</b>, which includes a bulk silicon layer <b>204</b>, a porous silicon layer <b>206</b> adjacent to the bulk silicon layer <b>204</b>, an indium phosphide layer <b>210</b>, and a set of silicon nitride layers <b>208</b> disposed between the porous silicon layer <b>206</b> and the indium phosphide layer <b>210</b>.

In the illustrated embodiment, the device layers <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, and <b>220</b> correspond to an indium gallium arsenide/indium aluminum arsenide quantum well structure, with respective ones of the device layers <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, and <b>220</b> serving as a cap layer, a barrier layer, a channel layer, and a buffer layer.

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, once the thin-film device layers are formed in stage <b>112</b>, surfaces of the device substrate and an upper one of the device layers are aligned so as to face each other and are bonded using a suitable bonding technique. Advantageously, separation of the indium phosphide layer and the device layers from the porous silicon/silicon wafer and their transfer onto the device substrate can be readily induced by mechanical fracture within the porous silicon layer. In the illustrated embodiment, mechanical fracture is promoted by annealing at a temperature in the range of about 300&#xb0; C. to about 700&#xb0; C., such as from about 400&#xb0; C. to about 700&#xb0; C., from about 500&#xb0; C. to about 700&#xb0; C., or about 600&#xb0; C., for a time interval in the range of about 10 min to about 4 hr, such as from about 1 hr to about 4 hr, from about 2 hr to about 4 hr, or about 3 hr, thereby further weakening the porous silicon layer and allowing fracture to occur by insertion of a sharp object or by another suitable mechanical, sonic, or vibrational technique. Annealing of the porous silicon layer can be carried out as part of wafer bonding and exfoliation operations in stages <b>108</b> and <b>110</b>, as part of device layer formation in stage <b>112</b>, or both. Once the indium phosphide layer and the device layers are transferred onto the device substrate, any excess material or layer, such as any remaining porous silicon, can be removed by polishing or another suitable removal technique.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Mechanical characteristics of the porous silicon layer can influence device layer transfer capabilities in at least two ways. First, the porous silicon layer desirably has sufficient strength to withstand wafer bonding and exfoliation operations as well as chemical mechanical polishing of the indium phosphide layer. Second, after formation of the device layers, the porous silicon layer desirably is sufficiently weak to facilitate transfer of the indium phosphide layer and the device layers onto the device substrate. Weakening of the porous silicon layer can be evidenced by a reduction in a Young's modulus value of the porous silicon layer after annealing, relative to corresponding Young's modulus values of bulk silicon and of the porous silicon layer prior to annealing. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, bulk silicon typically has a Young's modulus value of about 170 GPa, while the porous silicon layer, in an &#x201c;as-etched&#x201d; condition prior to annealing, can have a Young's modulus value in the range of about 35 percent to about 65 percent of the corresponding value for bulk silicon (or in the range of about 59.5 GPa to about 110.5 GPa), such as from about 45 percent to about 55 percent (or from about 76.5 GPa to about 93.5 GPa), from about 47 percent to about 53 percent (or from about 79.9 GPa to about 90.1 GPa), or about 50 percent (or about 85 GPa). In contrast, the porous silicon layer, as further weakened by annealing, can have a Young's modulus value in the range of about 15 percent to about 45 percent of the corresponding value for bulk silicon (or in the range of about 25.5 GPa to about 76.5 GPa), such as from about 25 percent to about 40 percent (or from about 42.5 GPa to about 68 GPa), from about 32 percent to about 38 percent (or from about 54.4 GPa to about 64.6 GPa), or about 35 percent (or about 60 GPa).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Alternatively, or in combination, weakening of the porous silicon layer can be correlated with a coarsening of the microstructure of the porous silicon layer, as promoted by elevated temperatures during annealing. This coarsening of the microstructure can be evidenced by an increase in porosity, an increase in pore size, or both. In some instances, the porous silicon layer, in the &#x201c;as-etched&#x201d; condition prior to annealing, can have an average pore size that is no greater than about 1 &#x3bc;m, such as from about 1 nm to about 10 nm, from about 10 nm to about 100 nm, or from about 100 nm to about 1 &#x3bc;m, while the porous silicon layer, as further weakened by annealing, can have an average pore size that is greater than 1 &#x3bc;m, such as from about 1.1 &#x3bc;m to about 100 &#x3bc;m, from about 2 &#x3bc;m to about 80 &#x3bc;m, or from about 2 &#x3bc;m to about 50 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The techniques described herein can be exploited in the fabrication of semiconductor solar cells as well as a variety of other semiconductor devices, by allowing thin-film devices to be realized while reducing the consumption of costly starting materials. After exfoliation and device layer separation, an epitaxial template substrate and a handle substrate can be reused for subsequent device layer formation and transfer operations. The techniques can also reduce time and effort for semiconductor device fabrication, as chemical or mechanical processing to separate device layers, such as in accordance with grind or etchback techniques, can be circumvented by facile fracture through a porous layer. The techniques can be extended to a variety of semiconductor material combinations to form transfer-ready composite substrates for the fabrication of indium phosphide-based devices and other Group III-V-based devices as well as other types of semiconductor devices. Once device layers are separated from a handle substrate, those layers can be incorporated in a variety of applications, such as flexible electronics and complex three-dimensional device architectures that would be otherwise difficult and costly to fabricate.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">[001]-oriented p<sup>+</sup>-silicon handle wafers (0.001-0.005 &#x3a9;.cm resistivity) were placed in an electrochemical cell with a gold wire mesh cathode in an electrolyte including hydrofluoric acid, deionized water, and ethanol in a 1:1:2 ratio. A current density of 10 mA/cm<sup>2 </sup>was applied for 5 min to anodize surfaces of the silicon wafers. The resulting porous surfaces were then covered with a 50 nm silicon nitride bonding layer by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. Next, [001]-oriented, semi-insulating indium phosphide template wafers were sputter-coated with a 80 nm silicon nitride bonding layer and outgassed in a rapid thermal anneal furnace at 500&#xb0; C. for 1 min. The indium phosphide wafers were subsequently implanted with a H<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> dose of 5&#xd7;10<sup>16</sup>/cm<sup>2 </sup>at 150 keV while being cooled at &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. The indium phosphide wafers and silicon wafers were then subjected to <b>1</b> min oxygen plasma activation at an oxygen pressure of 200 mTorr and a power of 200 W. The wafers were rinsed with deionized water and nitrogen-dried, and the silicon nitride surfaces were bonded at room temperature. The resulting bonded wafers were annealed at 150&#xb0; C. for 8 hr to strengthen the bonding and promote hydrogen diffusion to defects in the indium phosphide wafers, followed by a second anneal at 300&#xb0; C. to strengthen the bonding, induce exfoliation of an indium phosphide layer, and remove residual implanted hydrogen. The exfoliated indium phosphide layer was then subjected to chemical mechanical polishing to reduce implantation damage and planarize its surface. A comparison structure was formed by transferring an indium phosphide layer to a silicon handle wafer that did not include a porous layer. Surface roughness was assessed using AFM (Ambios Technology). Bede D<sup>3 </sup>and Maxflux D<sup>1 </sup>diffractometers were used for triple-axis X-ray rocking curves and reciprocal space maps. A JEOL 2000 FX electron microscope was used to obtain XTEM images.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Results</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">AFM images of a porous silicon surface were analyzed after etching. The porous silicon surface was smooth, with a rms surface roughness of 0.4 nm that is comparable to that of a pristine polished silicon wafer. After deposition of a silicon nitride layer on the porous silicon surface, the surface morphology was assessed, and a rms surface roughness was measured to be 0.6 nm. The low roughness of the silicon nitride surface indicated that the deposition of the silicon nitride layer was conformal on the smooth, porous silicon surface, and no additional surface planarization operation was required for subsequent wafer bonding.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">After wafer bonding and exfoliation of an indium phosphide layer onto a handle wafer, a chemical mechanical polishing operation was employed to improve the surface morphology and crystalline quality of the indium phosphide layer. Prior to polishing, the rms surface roughness of the indium phosphide surface was measured to be 2.9 nm. After polishing, the surface roughness improved to a rms value of 0.5 nm. In addition to planarizing the surface, the chemical mechanical polishing operation substantially removed any crystalline damage remaining at the surface of the indium phosphide layer due to the exfoliation operation. Triple-axis rocking curve measurements of the indium phosphide layer were made before and after polishing. In the as-exfoliated condition, the indium phosphide layer exhibited a peak with a FWHM of 39 arcsec, while the layer after polishing exhibited a peak with a FWHM of 31 arcsec. Improvement in surface quality was apparent in the reduction of diffuse scattering. The measured Full-Width-at-One-Thousandth-the-Maximum (&#x201c;FW0.001M&#x201d;) was 178 arcsec in the as-exfoliated condition, which improved upon polishing to 129 arcsec. The decrease in diffracted intensity observed (&#x3e;30 percent) is likely attributed to the loss of material after polishing. About 0.2 &#x3bc;m of material was removed during polishing, or about 40 percent of the transferred indium phosphide layer thickness. A bright-field transmission electron microscopy image of the resulting composite substrate was analyzed after polishing. The indium phosphide layer was observed to be highly planar, with no visible defects at the surface from polishing. The indium phosphide layer measured about 0.3 &#x3bc;m in thickness, and the porous silicon layer thickness was about 2.3 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Triple axis reciprocal space maps of indium phosphide layers transferred to different handle wafers were analyzed. In particular, an indium phosphide layer was transferred to a silicon handle wafer including a porous silicon layer, and a reciprocal space map was analyzed for indium phosphide [004] reflection. The indium phosphide layer exhibited a tensile strain with respect to relaxed indium phosphide of 0.25 percent. In order to assess any impact the porous layer may have on the strain state of the indium phosphide layer, a comparison structure, which included an indium phosphide layer transferred to a bare silicon handle wafer, was similarly formed and characterized. The [004] reciprocal space map for the comparison structure indicated a measured tensile strain of 0.20 percent. Though residual strain observed in the indium phosphide layer on the porous silicon/silicon handle wafer was greater than on the bare silicon wafer (with an angular separation between indium phosphide layer peaks of 59 arcsec in the [001] direction), the similarity in magnitude of the measured strains indicates that the porous layer does not significantly enhance compliance of the resulting composite substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Results also indicate that transfer of epitaxial layers from a resulting composite substrate can be readily induced through a porous silicon layer. A test structure including a silicon wafer bonded to a porous silicon/silicon handle wafer with silicon nitride interlayers was formed and annealed at 600&#xb0; C. for 3 hr to mimic MOVPE deposition conditions. Before heat treatment, the test structure was mechanically rigid, and fracture could not be induced by razor blade insertion through the porous silicon layer. However, after heat treatment, the test structure remained intact until a razor blade was inserted, and separation of the silicon wafer from the handle wafer propagated through the porous silicon layer, as evidenced by the presence of porous material on surfaces of both of the separated wafers.</p>
