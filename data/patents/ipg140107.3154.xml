<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, with advancement of digital technologies, electronic hardware such as portable information devices and information home appliance have been developed to provide higher speeds and higher functionalities. With progresses of higher-speed and highly-functional electronic hardware, there has been an increasing demand for fuses with several hundreds bit level for regulation after completion of LSI or system boards.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The fuses have a wide variety of uses such as numerous process products and generation LSI such as state-of-the-art CMOS and bipolar CMOS analogs. Therefore, it is required that the fuses be easily applied to devices and processes.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Under the circumstances in which there have been such demands, electric fuse elements, polysilicon fuse elements, laser fuse elements and so on have been conventionally used. But, these fuse elements can overwrite only once in an operation principle.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An exemplary application of nonvolatile elements to fuses is a flash memory or a ferroelectric memory. These memories require many additional masks to process of the existing CMOS, for example, five to ten additional masks, which has a disadvantage in cost performance and provides low compatibility with other processes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">These days, as a use of the fuses, there has been proposed three-dimensional nonvolatile elements in cross-point array, comprising memory cells each including a resistance variable memory and a polycrystalline silicon diode which are stacked together (see patent document 1).</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, fuse elements using the above mentioned resistance variable elements are inevitably affected by post-process steps which are steps for forming contacts and wires above resistance variable layers, after forming the resistance variable layers. Especially when resistance variable layers containing oxygen which are represented by transition metal oxide are used, oxygen diffuses in the resistance variable layers due to thermal budget in the post-process steps, resulting in a variation in cell resistances.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention is directed to solving the above mentioned problem, and an object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor device in which nonvolatile resistance variable elements which stably change resistance without being affected by post-process steps such as a wiring step are formed in such a manner that resistance variable layers are formed at the upper side of uppermost wires and potential is led out from underlying layers of the resistance variable layers (i.e., potential of the resistance variable layers is detected from underlying layers of the resistance variable layers), and the nonvolatile resistance variable elements are used as fuse elements for application to various processes, and a manufacturing method of the semiconductor device.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Means for Solving the Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">To achieve the above object, a semiconductor device of the present invention comprises a semiconductor substrate; a plurality of transistors formed on the semiconductor substrate; a multi-layered wire structure including wires arranged in different layers via an insulating layer above the plurality of transistors, the multi-layered wire structure connecting a resistance variable element to the transistor, the resistance variable element being configured to change its resistance in response to voltages applied thereto; a first terminal and a second terminal which are formed above an uppermost wire of the multi-layered wire structure and are electrically connected to the uppermost wire, or the first terminal and the second terminal which are formed in a part of the uppermost wire; and resistance variable layer which is arranged to cover and contact an upper surface of at least one of the first terminal and the second terminal; and the resistance variable element including the first terminal, the resistance variable layer and the second terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In such a configuration, since the resistance variable layer is formed at the upper side of the uppermost wire and electric potential is led out from underlying layers, it is possible to implement a semiconductor device incorporating resistance variable memories stably without being affected by post-process steps.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">When the first terminal and the second terminal are formed using a part of the uppermost wire, masks used to fabricate these terminals individually and steps for fabricating these terminals are omitted. Therefore, it is possible to implement a semiconductor device at a reduced process cost without increasing the number of process steps.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the semiconductor device of the present invention, the resistance variable element may include the first terminal, the resistance variable layer and the second terminal such that the resistance variable element does not share the resistance variable layer with the other resistance variable elements.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the above configuration, in the semiconductor device of the present invention, the resistance variable element is operable stably without being affected by writing to other adjacent resistance variable elements, and can serve as the fuse element effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the semiconductor device of the present invention, the resistance variable layer may be arranged to cover and contact an upper surface of both of the first terminal and the second terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In this way, the resistance variable layer may be formed at the upper side of the uppermost wire and the resistance variable element may operate horizontally.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">An upper surface of the resistance variable element may be covered with only a passivation layer. In such a configuration, only a step for forming the passivation layer is performed after forming the resistance variable element. This makes it possible to minimize an influence of thermal treatment and the like. Furthermore, since the entire upper surface of the resistance variable element is covered with the highly moisture-resistant passivation layer, the resistance variable element is allowed to have a stable resistance changing characteristic and reliability without being affected by external environment.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A material of the first terminal may be different from a material of the second terminal. In such a configuration, the resistance variable layer is allowed to change its resistance at a specified region which is an interface between the resistance variable layer and metal which provides higher compatibility with the resistance variable layer, and an incorrect operation at an opposite interface can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Either one of the first terminal and the second terminal may includes electrode layer comprising precious metal which is in contact with the resistance variable layer. The precious metal may include platinum and iridium. In such a configuration, precious metal does not react with the resistance variable layer at a low temperature and serves as a stable electrode. Especially, since platinum and iridium are relatively higher in standard electrode potential of redox for enabling a stable resistance changing operation to occur, a semiconductor device with a stable characteristic can be implemented using platinum and iridium. In some cases, precious metal may be a cause of junction leakage associated with the transistors. But, since the precious metal is used for the uppermost wire which are positioned distant from the transistors, there is substantially no fear of contamination which would be caused by diffusion of the precious metal. In the manufacturing method, the precious metal is used in a step which is close to a final step. This can significantly reduce semiconductor equipment exclusive for contamination of the precious metal.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A conductive layer which is lower in resistance than the resistance variable layer may be formed on the upper surface of the resistance variable layer. In such a configuration, since the conductive layer is lower in resistivity than the resistance variable layer, a wire resistance between the first terminal and the second terminal can be reduced. The conductive layers serve as the upper electrode of the resistance variable element, and in some cases, design flexibility is improved such that the resistance variable layer is allowed to change its resistance in a region at the upper electrode side.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The conductive layer may include electrode layer comprising precious metal in contact with the resistance variable layer. For the reason mentioned above, there is substantially no fear of contamination in addition to achievement of a stable resistance changing characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The resistance variable layer may comprise a transition metal oxide. In particular, the resistance variable layers may comprise a tantalum oxide. In such a configuration, the resistance variable layer has a reversible and stable rewrite characteristic and a good resistance value retention characteristic as well as high-speed operability. Especially when the tantalum oxide is used for the resistance variable layer, it is possible to implement a semiconductor device which can be manufactured with a manufacturing process which is highly compatible with a standard Si semiconductor process.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The resistance variable layer may include two transition metal oxide layers which are different from each other in oxygen concentration, and a portion of the resistance variable layer which is in contact with one of the first terminal, the second terminal and the conductive layer may be the transition metal oxide layer with higher oxygen concentration, of the two transition metal oxide layers. In such a configuration, the resistance variable layer is allowed to change its resistance at a specified region which is an interface where oxygen concentration is higher, and an incorrect operation at an opposite interface can be suppressed. In addition, a step (forming step) for allowing oxygen to concentrate at one of the first terminal and second terminal by applying a voltage after the end of diffusion of oxygen can be dispensed with. The resistance variable element is operable in a forming-less method, without a need for a high forming voltage, and at low voltages.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A method of manufacturing a semiconductor device of the present invention comprises the steps of: forming a plurality of transistors on a semiconductor substrate; forming wires in different layers via an insulating layer above the plurality of transistors; forming a first terminal and a second terminal on an uppermost wire such that the first terminal and the second terminal are electrically connected to the uppermost wire; forming a resistance variable layer such that the resistance variable layer covers and contacts the upper surface of at least one of the first terminal and the second terminal; and covering an entire surface of the resistance variable layer with a passivation layer.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In such a method, since the resistance variable layer is formed at the upper side of the uppermost wire and electric potential is led out from underlying layers, it is possible to implement a semiconductor device incorporating nonvolatile resistance variable memories which can change its resistance stably without being affected by post-process steps such as a wiring step.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A method of manufacturing a semiconductor device of the present invention, comprises the steps of: forming a plurality of transistors on a semiconductor substrate; forming wires in different layers via an insulating layer above the plurality of transistors; forming resistance variable layer such that the resistance variable layer covers and contacts the upper surface of a part of the uppermost wire; and covering an entire surface of the resistance variable layers with a passivation layer.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In such a method, in addition to the above advantage, masks used to fabricate the first terminal and the second terminal individually and the process steps for fabricating these terminals individually are omitted. Therefore, it is possible to implement a semiconductor device at a reduced process cost without increasing the number of process steps.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The method may further comprise a step of: forming conductive layers over the upper surface of the resistance variable layer, the conductive layer being lower in resistance than the resistance variable layer. With addition of such a step, since the conductive layer is lower in resistivity than the resistance variable layer, wire resistance between the first terminal and the second terminal can be reduced. The conductive layer serves as the upper electrode of the resistance variable element, and in some cases, the design flexibility is improved such that the resistance variable layer is allowed to change its resistance in a region at the upper electrode side.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A semiconductor chip of the present invention comprises the above semiconductor device of the present invention; and a semiconductor memory or an analog processing LSI. For example, the semiconductor chip may be a chip in which the above semiconductor device of the present invention is incorporated into a fuse circuit used to relieve faulty bits in semiconductor memories. Or, the semiconductor chip may be a chip in which the above semiconductor device of the present invention is incorporated as a correction circuit used to regulate the output of an analog circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In such a configuration, the semiconductor device including the nonvolatile resistance variable element of the present invention makes it possible to relieve faulty bits in the semiconductor memory and regulate parameters of the analog processing LSI after completion of LSI or completion of a system board, which is adapted for achievement of higher speeds and higher functionalities of electronic hardware such as portable information devices and information home appliance.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A system of the present invention comprises a semiconductor chip incorporating the above semiconductor device of the present invention; and a chip incorporating a semiconductor memory or a chip incorporating an analog processing LSI, the chip being electrically connected to the semiconductor chip. For example, a system may comprise a semiconductor memory mounted chip; and a control LSI mounted chip electrically connected to the semiconductor memory mounted chip; wherein a fuse circuit using the above semiconductor device is incorporated into the control LSI mounted chip to relieve faulty bits in a semiconductor memory. Or, a system may comprise a semiconductor memory mounted chip; and a control LSI mounted chip electrically connected to the semiconductor memory mounted chip; wherein a fuse circuit using the above semiconductor device is incorporated into the semiconductor memory mounted chip to relieve faulty bits in a semiconductor memory. Or, a system may comprise an external information input device; an analog processing LSI mounted chip configured to receive an analog output signal from the external information input device; and a digital processing LSI mounted chip configured to receive a digital output signal from the analog processing LSI mounted chip, wherein a correction circuit using the above semiconductor device is incorporated into the analog processing LSI mounted chip to regulate an output of the analog processing LSI mounted chip.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In such a configuration, the semiconductor device of the present invention is capable of relieving faulty bits in the semiconductor memory of other chips and regulating parameters of analog processing LSI, outside a semiconductor chip into which the semiconductor device of the present invention is mounted. As a result, even a system for a variety of electronic hardware with higher speeds and higher functionality, can regulate a variation in a unified manner and can be made into a system having a regulation capability.</p>

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Hereinafter, a semiconductor device and a manufacturing method thereof according to Embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings. In the drawings, the constituents designated by the same reference numerals will not be described repetitively in some cases. For easier understanding, in the drawings, the constituents are schematically depicted and the shapes and others are not depicted correctly.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">(Embodiment 1)</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view showing an exemplary configuration of a semiconductor device <b>100</b> according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the semiconductor device <b>100</b> of Embodiment 1 includes a substrate <b>101</b> provided with a plurality of transistors each including a gate electrode <b>104</b> and a diffusion layer <b>105</b>, a first interlayer insulating layer <b>106</b> formed over the substrate <b>101</b> to cover the transistors, and a first contact <b>107</b> penetrating the first interlayer insulating layer <b>106</b> and electrically connected to the diffusion layer <b>105</b> of the transistor, resistively. A first wire <b>108</b> is formed on the first interlayer insulating layer <b>106</b> to cover the first contact <b>107</b>. A second interlayer insulating layer <b>109</b> is formed over the first interlayer insulating layer <b>106</b> to cover the first wire <b>108</b>. A second contact <b>110</b> is formed on the first wire <b>108</b> and is electrically connected to an upper wire. On the semiconductor substrate <b>101</b>, a region corresponding to a device main circuit <b>102</b> such as memories or bipolar CMOS and a region corresponding to a resistance variable element rewrite fuse circuit <b>103</b> are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a multi-layered wire structure ML of the semiconductor device <b>100</b> comprises n (n: two or more) wire layers and n interlayer insulating layers and is used to connect the above mentioned transistors to resistance variable elements (described later in detail). In other words, in the multi-layered wire structure ML, wires are formed in difference layers via the interlayer insulating layer.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">To be specific, an uppermost wire (n-th wire) <b>114</b> formed on the n-th interlayer insulating layer <b>112</b> is electrically connected to a (n&#x2212;1)-th wire <b>111</b> via a n-th contact <b>113</b>. Over the uppermost wire <b>114</b>, a (n+1)-th interlayer insulating layer <b>115</b> is formed, and (n+1)-th contacts <b>116</b> and <b>117</b> that penetrate the (n+1)-th interlayer insulating layer <b>115</b> and are connected to the uppermost wire <b>114</b> are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Each of the resistance variable elements comprises a resistance variable layer <b>119</b>, and first and second terminals used to apply voltages to the resistance variable layer <b>119</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In this embodiment, lower electrode <b>118</b><i>a </i>of the resistance variable element is formed on the (n+1)-th interlayer insulating layers <b>115</b> to cover the (n+1)-th contact <b>116</b>. The resistance variable layer <b>119</b> is formed on the (n+1)-th interlayer insulating layer <b>115</b> to cover the lower electrode <b>118</b><i>a </i>and the (n+1)-th contact <b>117</b>. In this embodiment, the (n+1)-th contact <b>116</b> and the lower electrode <b>118</b><i>a </i>serve as the first terminal of the resistance variable element, and the (n+1)-th contact <b>117</b> serve as the second terminal of the resistance variable element.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As used herein, the term &#x201c;electrode&#x201d; of the resistance variable element refers to a conductive member which is adapted to draw oxygen in the resistance variable layer <b>119</b> and is in contact with a portion of the resistance variable layer <b>119</b> where resistance change occurs. The &#x201c;electrode&#x201d; commonly comprises precious metal such as platinum, which is relatively high in standard electrode potential of redox.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In this embodiment, only a passivation layer <b>120</b> is formed to directly cover the entire surface (especially the upper surface of the resistance variable element) including the resistance variable element. For example, if a highly moisture-resistant passivation layer such as silicon nitride is used, a thermal budget to the resistance variable element can be restricted to an amount of heat given at a deposition temperature of 400 degrees C. or lower for a very short deposition time of several minutes or less. In other words, in this embodiment, since the thermal budget to the resistance variable element is restricted to an amount of heat in a deposition step of silicon nitride, a total heat amount given to the resistance variable elements of this embodiment is much less than a total heat amount given to the conventional resistance variable element. This can effectively suppress a variation in cell resistance of the resistance variable element. Furthermore, a pad hole <b>121</b> for allowing transmission and reception of electric signals between the semiconductor device <b>100</b> and an external device penetrates the passivation layer <b>120</b> and the (n+1)-th interlayer insulating layer <b>115</b> and is connected to the uppermost wire <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In such a configuration, since the resistance variable layer is formed at the upper side of the uppermost wire and electric potential is led out from underlying layers, it is possible to implement a semiconductor device incorporating the resistance variable memory which change resistance stably without being affected by post-process steps such as a wiring step. In addition, since the entire upper surface of the resistance variable element is covered with the highly moisture-resistant passivation layer, the resistance variable element is not affected by the external environment and has a stable resistance changing characteristic and reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In this embodiment, the (n+1)-th contacts <b>116</b> and <b>117</b> are made of a filling material containing tungsten as a major component, the lower electrode <b>118</b><i>a </i>comprises platinum, and the resistance variable layer <b>119</b> comprises tantalum oxide.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Thus, a portion of the first terminal which contacts the resistance variable layer <b>119</b> comprises a platinum, and the second terminal comprises a tungsten. That is, materials of these terminals are different from each other. In such a configuration, resistance change is allowed to occur at platinum where the standard electrode potential of redox is relatively higher.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The resistance variable layer <b>119</b> comprises oxide of transition metal (in this embodiment, tantalum) and includes at least two layers which are different from each other in oxygen concentration. To be specific, the lower layer (portion contacting the lower electrode <b>118</b><i>a</i>) of the resistance variable layer <b>119</b> is formed by a transition metal oxide layer with higher oxygen concentration (the same occurs in another embodiments including the lower electrode). This can dispense with a step (forming step) for allowing oxygen to concentrate at one of the first and second terminals by applying a voltage after the end of diffusion of oxygen. The resistance variable layer <b>119</b> is operable in a forming-less method, without a need for a high forming voltage, and at low voltages. The two-layered structure is accomplished by, for example, intentionally changing the flow rate of reactant gas (oxygen gas) in reactive sputtering or by oxidating the surface of the resistance variable layer <b>119</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Next, the structure of the semiconductor device <b>100</b> according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention when viewed from above will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a plan view showing an exemplary configuration of the semiconductor device <b>100</b> according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention, in which a plurality of resistance variable elements are formed in array. The cross-section taken in the direction of arrows along line A-A&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, and corresponds to a portion identical to that of the cross-section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Firstly, the planar configuration of the resistance variable element at the first terminal will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the plurality of (n+1)-th contact <b>116</b> are arranged on the (n&#x2212;1)-th wire <b>111</b><i>a </i>via the plurality of n-th contacts <b>113</b> and conductive rectangular patterns <b>114</b><i>a </i>defining the plurality of uppermost wires <b>114</b>. The lower electrode <b>118</b><i>a </i>of the resistance variable element is individually formed to cover the (n+1)-th contact <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Next, the planar configuration of the resistance variable element at the second terminal will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the plurality of (n+1)-th contacts <b>117</b> are arranged on the (n&#x2212;1)-th wire <b>111</b><i>b </i>individually formed, via the plurality of n-th contact <b>113</b> and conductive rectangular pattern <b>114</b><i>b </i>defining the plurality of uppermost wires <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Finally, the planar configuration of the resistance variable layers of the resistance variable elements will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">As shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, each of the resistance variable layers is formed to cover one lower electrode <b>118</b><i>a </i>and its adjacent one (n+1)-th contact <b>117</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> (plan view), a number of resistance variable elements which are basic units are arranged in array in a two-dimensional configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">As should be appreciated from the above, the semiconductor device <b>100</b> of this embodiment has a feature that the contacts <b>117</b> serve as the electrodes, and a single resistance variable element comprises one resistance variable layer <b>119</b>, one lower electrode <b>118</b><i>a </i>and one (n+1)-th contact <b>117</b>. In other words, each of the resistance variable elements does not share the resistance variable layer <b>119</b> with its adjacent resistance variable elements.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">As should be appreciated from the above planar configuration of the resistance variable elements, each of the plurality of resistance variable elements includes the first terminal, the resistance variable layer and the second terminal without sharing the resistance variable layer with other resistance variable elements. Therefore, each of the resistance variable elements of this embodiment is operable stably without being affected by writing for other adjacent resistance variable elements, and thus is able to operate effectively as a fuse element.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) to <b>2</b>(<i>d</i>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>3</b>(<i>b</i>) are cross-sectional views showing the manufacturing method of the major constituents which are the uppermost wire <b>114</b> and the following constituents of the semiconductor device <b>100</b> of Embodiment 1. The steps for forming the transistors and the lower wires are omitted. The manufacturing method of the major constituents of the semiconductor device <b>100</b> of Embodiment 1 will be described with reference to these Figures.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the manufacturing method of Embodiment 1 includes a step for forming the uppermost wire <b>114</b>, a step for forming the (n+1)-th contacts <b>116</b> and <b>117</b>, a step for forming the lower electrode <b>118</b><i>a</i>, a step for forming the resistance variable layer <b>119</b>, a step for forming the passivation layer <b>120</b>, and a step for forming the pad hole <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>), in the step for forming the uppermost wire <b>114</b>, the uppermost wire <b>114</b> are formed using a desired mask on the n-th interlayer insulating layer <b>112</b> covering the transistors and the lower wires. In this case, concurrently, pad metal for allowing signal transmission and reception between the semiconductor device <b>100</b> and the external device is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>), in the step for forming the (n+1)-th contacts <b>116</b> and <b>117</b>, the (n+1)-th interlayer insulating layer <b>115</b> is formed over the entire surface to cover the uppermost wire <b>114</b>, and then the (n+1)-th contacts <b>116</b> and <b>117</b> are formed to penetrate the (n+1)-th interlayer insulating layer <b>115</b> and to be connected to the upper most wire <b>114</b>. The contacts are filled with a filling material containing tungsten as a major component.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>c</i>), in the step for forming the lower electrode <b>118</b><i>a </i>of the resistance variable elements, the lower electrode <b>118</b><i>a </i>of the resistance variable element is formed by patterning using a desired mask on the (n+1)-th interlayer insulating layer <b>115</b> to cover the (n+1)-th contact <b>116</b>. In this case, the upper layer of the lower electrode <b>118</b><i>a </i>comprises platinum and the lower layer of the lower electrode <b>118</b><i>a </i>comprises titanium nitride. This is because platinum provides a stable resistance changing characteristic and titanium nitride improves adhesiveness to the interlayer insulating layer.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>d</i>), in the step of forming the resistance variable layer <b>119</b>, the resistance variable layer <b>119</b> is formed by patterning using a desired mask on the (n+1)-th interlayer insulating layer <b>115</b> to cover the lower electrode <b>118</b><i>a </i>and the (n+1)-th contact <b>117</b>. In this case, the resistance variable layer <b>119</b> comprises tantalum oxide, in order to provide a reversible and stable rewrite characteristic and a good resistance value retention characteristic as well as high-speed operability and to implement a manufacturing process which is highly compatible with a standard Si semiconductor process. In the above configuration, the (n+1)-th contact <b>116</b> and the lower electrode <b>118</b><i>a </i>serve as the first terminal, while the (n+1)-th contact <b>117</b> serves as the second terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>), in the step of forming the passivation layer <b>120</b>, the passivation layer <b>120</b> is formed to directly cover the entire surface (especially, upper surface of the resistance variable element) of the resistance variable element, including the resistance variable layer <b>119</b>. For example, if a highly moisture-resistant passivation layer such as silicon nitride is used, a thermal budget can be restricted to an amount of heat given at deposition temperature of 400 degrees C. or lower for a very short deposition time of several minutes or less.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>b</i>), in the step of forming the pad hole <b>121</b>, the pad hole <b>121</b> for allowing transmission and reception of electric signals between the semiconductor device <b>100</b> and the external device is formed by patterning using a desired mask such that the pad hole <b>121</b> penetrates the passivation layer <b>120</b> and the (n+1)-th interlayer insulating layer <b>115</b> and is connected to the uppermost wire <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In such a method, since the resistance variable layer is formed at the upper side of the uppermost wire and the electric potential is led out from the underlying layers, it is possible to manufacture the semiconductor device including a resistance variable memory stably without being affected by the post-process steps such as the wiring step.

<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in the semiconductor device <b>200</b> of Embodiment 2, on the uppermost wire <b>114</b>, the (n+1)-th interlayer insulating layer <b>115</b> is formed, and lower electrode <b>118</b><i>b </i>of the resistance variable element and the (n+1)-th contact <b>117</b> that penetrate the (n+1)-th interlayer insulating layer <b>115</b> and are connected to the uppermost wire <b>114</b> are formed.

<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Furthermore, the semiconductor device <b>200</b> has an advantage over the semiconductor device <b>100</b> in that the resistance variable layer is allowed to have a flat surface without unevenness, a thickness with a less variation, and a stable resistance changing characteristic.</p>

<p id="p-0109" num="0108">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the manufacturing method of Embodiment 2 includes a step for forming the uppermost wire <b>114</b>, a step for forming the (n+1)-th contact <b>117</b>, a step for forming the lower electrode <b>118</b><i>b</i>, a step for forming the resistance variable layer <b>119</b>, a step for forming the passivation layer <b>120</b>, and a step for forming the pad hole <b>121</b>.</p>

In the structure of Embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a horizontal axis indicates a voltage between the contact <b>116</b> and the contact <b>117</b>, while a vertical axis indicates a value of a current flowing through the resistance variable layer <b>119</b>. When a positive voltage is applied between the electrodes, the current increases substantially in proportion to the voltage and drastically decreases when the voltage exceeds a positive voltage at A point, which indicates that the element changes from a low-resistance state to a high-resistance state (attains high-resistance state). In contrast, in the high-resistance state, when a negative voltage is applied, a current drastically increases when the voltage exceeds a negative voltage at point B, which indicates that the element changes from the high-resistance state to the low-resistance state (attains low-resistance state).</p>

Similarly to the case shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the resistance value decreases to a low-resistance value Ra of 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>3 </sup>&#x3a9; by applying a negative voltage between the electrodes, whereas the resistance value increases to a high-resistance value Rb of 1.2&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>&#x3a9; by applying a positive voltage between the electrodes.

In this example, the larger resistance value Rb is allocated to data &#x201c;0&#x201d; and the smaller resistance value Ra is allocated to data &#x201c;1.&#x201d; As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, by applying a positive or negative pulse according to data to be stored, the resistance value, i.e., data of the resistance variable layer <b>119</b> can be rewritten reversibly as nonvolatile data.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">Hereinafter, the feature of the resistance variable materials used in the present invention and their characteristics which was discovered by the present inventors will be described briefly.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">Oxide of transition metal such as tantalum (Ta) or hafnium (Hf) changes its resistance by connecting the both sides of the transition metal oxide to electrodes made of metals different from the transition metal and applying electric signals, if it has an oxygen-deficient composition. Especially, the resistance changing characteristic is so-called a bipolar characteristic in which the transition metal oxide changes between the high-resistance state and the low-resistance state in response to bipolar voltages applied between the electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">For a specified transition metal oxide, there are an electrode material which easily causes resistance change and an electrode material which does not easily cause resistance change, when the specified transition metal oxide is combined with electrode materials. This is closely related to standard electrode potentials which are indicators indicating degree of easiness of oxidation. For example, if the transition metal oxide is combined with a platinum electrode which has a higher standard electrode potential than tantalum and is less easily oxidated, resistance change easily occurs, while if the transition metal oxide is combined with tungsten which has a lower standard electrode potential than tantalum, the resistance change does not easily occur.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">This is based on a mechanism in which oxygen ions in the transition metal oxide migrate toward the electrode to which a positive voltage is applied and stay there, and thereby oxidation reaction of transition metal in a region in the vicinity of the electrode is facilitated, allowing the transition metal oxide to change to the high-resistance state, while oxygen migrate away from the electrode by applying a voltage in a reverse direction, and reduction reaction of the transition metal oxide is facilitated, allowing the transition metal oxide to change to the low-resistance state. It was found out that a stable resistance changing characteristic is effectively produced by using an electrode material which does not easily react with oxygen ions.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">It is supposed that the above finding is applied to the semiconductor device having the structure of Embodiment 1 shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A resistance changing phenomenon stably occurs in a region of the resistance variable layer <b>119</b> which is in contact with the lower electrode <b>118</b><i>a </i>made of platinum, while the resistance changing phenomenon does not occur in a region of the resistance variable layer <b>119</b> which is in contact with the contact <b>117</b> made of the filling material containing tungsten as a major component. A specific operation occurs in such a manner that, when the positive voltage is applied to the contact <b>116</b> on the basis of the contact <b>117</b>, the resistance variable layer <b>119</b> changes to the high-resistance state when a voltage exceeding the voltage at the point A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is applied, while the resistance variable layer <b>119</b> changes to the low-resistance state when a voltage exceeding the threshold voltage at point B is applied in an opposite direction.</p>

<p id="p-0274" num="0273">As should be appreciated from the above, since data can be written and rewritten to the program elements in the application example at a high speed using a simple circuit and a control method, inspection and relieving of faulty bits in manufacturing process steps are easily carried out.
