<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method of treating a constricted sinus passageway of a patient includes traversing the canine fossa region of the patient so as to form a passageway in the sinus cavity. An elongate member is inserted through the passageway, the elongate member having an inflation member such as a balloon disposed thereon. The inflation member is positioned within the constricted passageway. The inflation member is expanded so as to expand at least a portion of the constricted sinus passageway.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The field of the invention generally relates to devices and methods for the treatment or amelioration of sinusitis.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Sinusitis is a condition affecting over 35 million Americans, and similarly large populations in the rest of the developed world. Sinusitis occurs when one or more of the four paired sinus cavities (i.e., maxillary, ethmoid, frontal, sphenoid) becomes obstructed. These paired cavities are located in the skull behind the face, as is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b>A. Normally the sinus cavities, each of which are lined by mucosa, produce mucous which is then moved by beating cilia from the sinus cavity out to the nasal cavity and down the throat. The combined sinuses produce approximately one liter of mucous daily, so the effective transport of this mucous is important to sinus health.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Each sinus cavity has an opening into the nasal passage called an ostium. When the mucosa of one or more of the ostia or regions near the ostia become inflamed, the egress of mucous is interrupted, setting the stage for an infection of the sinus cavity, i.e., sinusitis. Infections of the maxillary and/or ethmoid sinuses make up the vast majority of cases of sinusitis, with far fewer cases involving the sphenoids and frontals.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Though many instances of sinusitis may be treatable with antibiotics, in some cases sinusitis persists for months, a condition called chronic sinusitis. Some patients are also prone to multiple episodes of sinusitis in a given period of time, a condition called recurrent sinusitis.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Currently, patients experiencing chronic sinusitis are eligible to have a surgical procedure called functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). In this procedure, which almost always done in an operating room setting with the patient under general anesthesia, surgical cutting instruments are guided with an endoscopic visualization tool to the various sinus ostia and adjacent regions. Inflamed mucosa and underlying bony tissue are cut away in an effort to widen the outlet of the sinuses of interest. Once opened, the infected sinuses are able to drain and return to a relatively normal state.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">While this procedure is generally effective, it is a relatively invasive procedure to the nasal cavity and sinuses. There can be significant post-operative pain for the patient, and sometimes there are bleeding complications that require packing to be placed in the nasal cavity. Subsequent removal of this packing can be quite painful. Also, since the nasal and sinus tissue are significantly traumatized, it may take several days to weeks to know whether the surgery was successful. This is especially true if various healing agents such as MeroGel&#xae; (Medtronic/Xomed) were placed at the surgical site, as these often block the sinus drainage until they are flushed away or degrade away after several days.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additionally, in certain patients, the ostial regions of the surgically-treated sinuses can become re-obstructed with excess growth of scar tissue as a result of the tissue trauma. When the advantages and disadvantages of the surgery are considered for a patient with sinusitis, there are many patients in whom the surgery may not be appropriate. For example, their condition may not be considered &#x201c;chronic enough&#x201d; or extensive enough to warrant FESS surgery. In other situations, the patient may be fearful of the pain or other aspects of having FESS performed. Alternatively, the FESS procedure may be too costly for a particular patient.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">For these and other reasons, there is a clear need for better methods and devices for the treatment of sinusitis.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a frontal anatomical representation (parallel to the coronal plane) showing the sinuses FS, ES, MS located within a patient's head H. Above and behind the eyebrows are the frontal sinuses FS. Between the eyes are the ethmoid sinuses ES. Note that unlike the other sinuses, the ethmoids are typically formed as a &#x201c;honeycombed&#x201d; structure consisting of several individual air cells. Located behind the cheeks are the maxillary sinuses MS. The sphenoid sinuses are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, but are located further posterior to the ethmoid sinuses.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is another frontal view of the sinuses located within the skull bone SK showing additional features. The nasal septum NS divides the nasal cavity into left and right sides. Because the following described structures are generally symmetrical bilaterally, only one of the paired structures is illustrated for sake of convenience. Within the nasal cavity are the middle turbinate MT and the inferior turbinate IT. The middle turbinate MT is connected to the base of the skull SK, while the inferior turbinate IT is connected to the lateral wall of the sinus cavity. The turbinates MT, IT have an underlying bony structure, but are covered with a thick mucosa lining. When this lining swells (rhinitis), it can inhibit breathing through the nose, particularly the inferior turbinate IT. The ethmoid sinuses ES are depicted by a single air cell in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The uncinate process UP is a complex three-dimensional structure, projecting off of the lateral wall like a crescent shaped leaf (better seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 25B</figref>) The curved aspect of the medial bone defining the ethmoid sinuses ES is called the ethmoid bulla EB. The passageway between the ethmoid bulla EB and the uncinate process UP is referred to as the infundibulum I. The drainage path of the maxillary MS, frontal FS, and some of the ethmoid ES air cells runs into the infundibulum I. At the most inferior part of the maxillary sinus is a thin portion of skull bone referred to as the canine fossa CF. Though this is not a true opening, it is a relatively thin bone region, just above the root of the outer aspect of the canine teeth, inside the mouth. The relationship of the sinuses to the orbit O of the eye can also be seen. Note also that all of the sinus cavities have a mucosa lining (ML) disposed over the bone.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is a side view parallel to the sagittal plane, looking at the right lateral nasal wall. The right nostril N is seen. The sphenoid sinus SS and frontal sinus FS may also be seen in this view. The flap-like structures illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> are the inferior turbinate IT and middle turbinate MT. Other structures of the nasal cavity have been left out for clarification, e.g., the superior turbinate. Located underneath the middle turbinate MT (shown in a &#x201c;lifted&#x201d; state in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> and removed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25B</figref>) are the structures of the lateral nasal wall. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the ethmoid bulla EB is a rounded projection of the bony wall of the nasal cavity. Behind the wall of the ethmoid bulla EB are one or more of the individual air cells of the ethmoid sinus ES (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 25B</figref>). Anterior and inferior of the ethmoid bulla is the uncinate process UP. The uncinate process UP has essentially two edges to it including a free edge FE and a connected edge CE. The free edge FE stands out from the nasal wall, while the connected edge CE connects the structure to the nasal wall. The narrow space between the ethmoid bulla EB and the uncinate process UP is the infundibulum I. Thus, it can be appreciated the complexity of the anatomy involving the maxillary and ethmoid sinus structures MS, ES.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> illustrates the structure beneath or underneath the uncinate process UP. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the uncinate process UP has been removed for clarity purposes, leaving only the connected edge CE. Two ostia can be seen including the maxillary sinus ostium MO, and the frontal sinus ostium FO. Drainage from the frontal sinuses FS and maxillary sinuses MS emerges into the infundibulum I through the maxillary sinus ostium MO and the frontal sinus ostium FO. Also, some of the ethmoid air cells ES drain into the infundibulum I, but they are not shown as they are substantially smaller than the frontal and maxillary ostia FO, MO. Drainage problems can arise and/or extend from the ostia of one or more of these sinuses to the infundibulum I or vise versa. Consequently, conventional FESS surgical treatment of sinusitis typically involves widening one or more of the ostia FO, MO, as well as complete removal of the uncinate process UP. Incidentally, removal of the uncinate process UP is usually required even to just allow visualization of these sinus ostia FO, MO for the proper placement of the various surgical cutting instruments. Ethmoids are often treated with the FESS procedure by removing some of the wall of the ethmoid bulla EB and some of the &#x201c;honeycomb&#x201d; structure between the individual air cells.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a generic therapeutic approach contemplated by one embodiment of the invention. Rather than remove obstructing tissue associated with the sinus ostia FO, MO, a dilation balloon <b>10</b> is positioned in the narrowed region to dilate open the structure. Generally, the dilation balloon is carried on a distal end or region of elongate member <b>12</b> such as a balloon catheter. The balloon catheter <b>12</b> may include a proximal hub <b>14</b> that includes an inflation port <b>16</b> that is used inflate (and deflate) the dilation balloon <b>10</b>. For example, the inflation port <b>16</b> may connect to a syringe or the like (not shown) using, for instance, a Leur lock connection. The balloon catheter <b>12</b> may be disposed within a central lumen of a guide catheter <b>18</b>. The guide catheter <b>18</b> may include a flexible tip portion <b>18</b><i>b </i>as well as a curved portion <b>20</b> that is used to navigate the tortuous pathway around the uncinate process UP. The proximal end of the guide catheter <b>18</b> may include a hub <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a wire guide <b>24</b> is located within a central lumen in the balloon catheter <b>12</b>. The wire guide <b>24</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is introduced into the maxillary sinus MS with the aid of the guide catheter <b>18</b> and a steering device <b>26</b>. The wire guide <b>24</b> preferably has a curved tip <b>24</b><i>b </i>such as a &#x201c;J&#x201d; bend located at or adjacent to a distal tip <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the wire guide <b>24</b>. The steering device <b>26</b> connects to a proximal end of the wire guide <b>24</b> to allow rotation of the wire guide <b>24</b>, and subsequent rotation of the curved tip <b>24</b><i>b </i>to steer and direct the wire guide <b>24</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, there is a relatively sharp bend that the wire guide <b>24</b> and balloon catheter <b>12</b> must traverse to enter into the maxillary ostial MO region. It is contemplated that a guide catheter <b>18</b> may not be utilized at the time that the balloon catheter <b>12</b> is positioned in the ostium of interest, but rather the guide catheter <b>18</b> would be utilized just for placement of the wire guide <b>24</b>. In this case, the balloon catheter <b>12</b> would be advanced over the wire guide <b>24</b>. This helps to minimize the size of the &#x201c;hardware&#x201d; that is present in the nasal cavity at any one time by allowing use of a smaller diameter guide catheter <b>18</b>, and minimizes the amount of distortion required on various structures in the nasal cavity, such as the middle turbinate MT.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, dilation of the maxillary ostial MO region is accomplished by inflation of the balloon <b>19</b> via the inflation port <b>16</b> with an inflation apparatus (not shown) which may included, for example, a syringe. It is contemplated that a combination of remodeling the soft tissues as well as fracturing/crushing bony tissues will result in a more open drainage path for the sinus(es) being treated. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a balloon catheter <b>12</b> positioned in the maxillary sinus ostium (MO), it is contemplated that the balloon <b>10</b> could be positioned in any of the sinus ostia, either naturally occurring ostia, or ostia created intra-procedurally. In particular, treatment of the ethmoid air cells ES may be accomplished by creating one or more small passageways in the walls surrounding the air cells, for example with a needle, followed up by a dilation process using the dilation balloon catheter <b>12</b>. Moreover, reference to a particular ostium does not necessarily mean an opening or passageway per se. Rather, reference to ostium may include the general region or anatomical area surrounding or adjacent to the ostium of interest and is not limited to a single, discrete structure or location.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Access to the maxillary sinus ostium MO from within the nasal cavity is particularly challenging due in part to the anatomy of the uncinate process UP and infundibulum I. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> illustrate various embodiments of a guide catheter <b>18</b> used to facilitate access to the maxillary sinus from the nasal cavity. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the guide catheter <b>18</b> has a relatively tight curved portion <b>20</b> near the tip <b>18</b><i>b</i>, with a preferred inside radius of curvature between about 0.5 mm and about 10 mm, and more preferably between about 1 mm and about 5 mm. Such a radius of curvature will assist in the tip <b>18</b><i>b </i>of the guide catheter &#x201c;hooking&#x201d; around the uncinate process UP, to help direct the wire guide <b>24</b> and subsequently the balloon catheter <b>12</b> into the maxillary sinus ostium MO. The degree of bend of the curved portion of the guide catheter <b>18</b> is preferably between 90 degrees and 180 degrees from the longitudinal axis of the hub <b>22</b>, and more preferably between 120 and 160 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In one preferred aspect of the invention, the guide catheter <b>18</b> includes a shaft portion <b>18</b><i>a </i>and a flexible tip portion <b>18</b><i>b</i>. The tip portion <b>18</b><i>b </i>is preferably of a softer material than the shaft portion <b>18</b><i>a</i>. Tip portion <b>18</b><i>b </i>may formed of a polymer such as PEBAX (Arkema), polyurethane, NYLON (DuPont), HYTREL (DuPont), or silicone. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of one preferred embodiment of the shaft portion <b>18</b><i>b</i>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, a liner <b>34</b> of a lubricious material such as PTFE defines a central lumen <b>36</b>. The liner <b>34</b> is surrounded by a wire braid <b>32</b>. The wire braid <b>32</b> is encased in a polymeric material such as PEBAX (Arkema), polyurethane (DuPont), NYLON (DuPont), HYTREL (DuPont), or silicone. The wire braid <b>32</b> adds torsional strength to the shaft <b>18</b>, allowing the curved tip portion <b>18</b><i>b </i>to be controlled and directed by manipulations near the hub <b>22</b>. The tip portion <b>18</b><i>b </i>may be pre-formed by a suitable process such as heat forming.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Alternatively, as shown in <b>5</b>C, the guide catheter <b>18</b> shaft portion <b>18</b><i>a </i>and/or tip portion <b>18</b><i>b </i>may incorporate a shaping element <b>38</b>, such as a removable wire. The wire <b>38</b> is preferably axially slidable within a lumen <b>40</b> formed in the guide catheter <b>18</b>. For example, different pre-shaped wires <b>38</b> may be axially slid within the lumen <b>40</b> to impart the desired shape or bend in the guide catheter <b>18</b>. Alternatively, shaping element <b>38</b> could be a ductile non-removable wire that could be shaped and re-shaped to fit to a particular patient's anatomy. This feature advantageously allows the tip curvature or the curvature of any portion of the guide catheter <b>18</b> to be customized by the user prior to or during a procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Alternatively, the shaft portion <b>18</b><i>b </i>of the guide catheter <b>18</b> can be formed of a metallic tube rather than the braid and jacket construction. This embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</figref>. Preferably a liner <b>34</b> is inside the metallic tube. Such a construction would allow the shaft portion <b>18</b><i>b </i>to be shaped and reshaped to suit any particular anatomy.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The diameter of the guide catheter <b>18</b> is determined by the size of the devices that might pass through it. For example, if the guide catheter <b>18</b> is used only for the placement of a wire guide <b>24</b> of 0.014 inch diameter, then the guide catheter <b>18</b> may have an inner diameter of between 0.016 and 0.025 inches, and a total wall thickness of between 0.004 and 0.020 inches. However if the guide catheter <b>18</b> is used to assist in placement of a dilation balloon catheter <b>12</b>, the inner diameter is preferably between 0.040 and 0.100 inches, with a total wall thickness of between 0.005 and 0.030 inches. The outer diameter of the guide catheter shaft <b>18</b><i>a </i>and tip <b>18</b><i>b </i>is preferably uniform in diameter. The length of the guide catheter <b>18</b> is preferably between about 8 and about 25 cm, and more preferably between about 10 and about 20 cm.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> illustrates another embodiment of a guide catheter <b>18</b> that is particularly useful for cannulating the maxillary sinus ostium MO. In this embodiment, the curved portion <b>42</b> is of a substantially larger radius of curvature compared to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. Rather than take a &#x201c;direct&#x201d; path up to and around the uncinate process UP, the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> makes use of the significant anterior-posterior space in the nasal passage NP. The curvature <b>42</b> of the guide catheter <b>18</b> may be formed using a shaping element <b>38</b> of the type disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref> illustrates how the guide catheter <b>18</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> makes a more gradual sweeping turn in the nasal cavity to reach towards the maxillary sinus ostium MO. By possessing a larger radius of curvature, any devices used inside this guide catheter <b>18</b> are not forced to negotiate such a tight bend. In a preferred embodiment, the inside radius of curvature is preferably between about 1 cm and about 3 cm, and more preferably between about 1.5 and about 2.5 cm.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</figref>, <b>6</b>B, and <b>6</b>C show a preferred embodiment of a dilation balloon catheter <b>12</b> for dilation of a sinus ostium, particularly a maxillary sinus ostium MO. The balloon catheter <b>12</b> includes a balloon <b>10</b>, distal shaft portion <b>12</b><i>a</i>, proximal shaft portion <b>12</b><i>b</i>, and a hub <b>14</b> with an inflation port <b>16</b> for inflation of the balloon <b>10</b>. The balloon catheter <b>12</b> is formed using an inner tube <b>50</b> coaxially arranged within an outer tube <b>52</b> (described in more detail below). An inflation lumen <b>56</b> is formed between the inner tube <b>50</b> and the outer tube <b>52</b>. The balloon catheter <b>12</b> terminates at a distal tip <b>12</b><i>c </i>that projects distally from the balloon <b>10</b>. The balloon catheter <b>12</b> may be formed as an &#x201c;over the wire&#x201d; design (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6C</figref>), but it is contemplated that it could be a &#x201c;fixed wire&#x201d; design or a &#x201c;monorail&#x201d; design, as is known in the balloon catheter art, particularly the coronary angioplasty art. However, the length of the balloon catheter <b>12</b> shown is relatively short in comparison, preferably from about 10 to about 30 cm, and more preferably between about 15 and about 25 cm. The expanded diameter of the balloon <b>10</b> would depend on the initial and final desired size of the sinus ostium to be dilated. Preferred diameters would be from about 2 mm to about 10 mm, and most preferably from about 3 to about 7 mm. A preferred &#x201c;set&#x201d; of balloon catheters <b>12</b> would include a series of catheters having inflated balloon diameters of 2, 4, 6, and 8 mm. Alternatively, a series of catheters <b>12</b> having 3, 5, and, 7 mm expanded balloon diameters could be provided. The balloon <b>10</b> is preferably from about 5 mm to 40 mm in length (not including the conical portions), and more preferably from about 10 mm to about 20 mm in length.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the distal shaft portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the balloon catheter <b>12</b> is preferably of a coaxial construction, with an inner tube <b>50</b> located inside of an outer tube <b>52</b>. The inner tube defines the wire guide lumen <b>54</b> for passage of the wire guide <b>24</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>). The annular space formed between the inner and outer tubes <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> defines an inflation lumen <b>56</b>.

<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Because of the anatomic challenge of accessing the maxillary sinus ostium MO, a preferred embodiment of the balloon catheter <b>12</b> includes a kink-resisting structure in the shaft, particularly in the distal shaft portion <b>12</b><i>a</i>, as this is the portion of the catheter <b>12</b> that may be exposed to a particularly tight bend as it is advanced around the uncinate process UP. The kink resisting structure is preferably a coil <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> or braid (not shown) that is incorporated into the inner tube <b>50</b> and/or the outer tube <b>52</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> illustrates coils <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> incorporated in both the inner and outer tubes <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, respectively. If a coil <b>58</b> is incorporated in the inner tube <b>50</b>, it is preferably included in the entire distal portion <b>12</b><i>a</i>, including that portion that traverses the balloon <b>10</b>. It is contemplated that for other constructions such as &#x201c;fixed wire&#x201d; or &#x201c;rapid exchange&#x201d; that the kink resisting structure could also be incorporated.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Inner and outer tubes <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> are preferably formed of a suitable material such as polyethylene, PEBAX (Arkema), PTFE, NYLON (DuPont), HYTREL (DuPont), or a combination thereof.

<p id="p-0111" num="0110">To assist in positioning of the balloon catheter <b>12</b> to a target site, one or more shaft markers <b>62</b> may be provided at one or more locations along the shaft of the balloon catheter.

Additionally, one or more markers <b>64</b> on the balloon <b>10</b> may be provided. Both the shaft markers <b>62</b> and the balloon markers <b>64</b> are useful in positioning the balloon <b>10</b> relative to the wire guide <b>24</b> and/or guide catheter <b>18</b>, together with prior or continuous optical visualization using a visualization tool such as an endoscope. Although not shown, the wire guide <b>24</b> could also include markers spaced at predefined increments. Balloon markers <b>64</b>, shaft markers <b>62</b>, and/or wire guide markers (not shown) could make use of a color-coding system or some other recognizable pattern to facilitate endoscopic imaging. For instance, a certain color of marker could pertain to a certain distance from a particular location, such as the tip of the wire guide <b>24</b> or the center of the dilation balloon <b>10</b>. Alternatively, one or more radiopaque markers (not shown) could be provided on the shaft underneath the balloon <b>10</b> if fluoroscopic imaging is utilized.</p>

The stabilizing device <b>80</b> is used to assist in holding and stabilizing one or more of the various tools used in the treatment of a sinus ostium. Since at times many devices may be in use, it may be difficult for the physician to manage all such devices. Use of a stabilizing device can free the hands to manage fewer devices at any given time. For example, the stabilizing device <b>80</b> may be used to stabilize a guide catheter <b>18</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), a balloon catheter <b>12</b>, and/or an endoscope <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> utilizes a base member <b>84</b> which secures to various portions of the head H, such as the ears and/or top of the nose.

A support arm <b>90</b> is secured to the base member <b>84</b>. In one aspect of the invention, the support arm <b>90</b>, can preferably be manipulated or formed into any desired shape. For example, the support arm <b>90</b> may be formed from a flexible material. A securing member <b>92</b> such as a clamp is located on the free end of the support arm <b>90</b>. The securing member <b>92</b> may be removable and/or interchangeable via a tightening member. Support arm <b>90</b> and securing member <b>92</b> are held fast by a tightening member <b>94</b> such as a tightening nut. In this figure, a clamp <b>92</b> is shown stabilizing a guide catheter <b>18</b>, which allows the physician to use his or her hands on the endoscope <b>82</b> and the wire guide <b>24</b>, while the position of the guide catheter <b>18</b> is maintained. This may be helpful while the physician tries to advance the wire guide <b>24</b> into the desired sinus. It is contemplated that more than one securing member <b>92</b> and/or more than one support arm <b>90</b> could be mounted to the base member <b>84</b> to stabilize more than one device.</p>

<p id="p-0119" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A</figref>, <b>11</b>B, and <b>11</b>C illustrate a wire movement guide <b>130</b> that is used to facilitate one-handed movement of both the wire guide <b>24</b> and guide catheter <b>18</b>. The wire movement guide <b>130</b> may be formed as a recessed handle or the like. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>, during operation of the guide catheter <b>18</b>, a steering device <b>26</b> is secured to the wire guide <b>24</b>. The steering device <b>26</b> is able to slide axially and rotate in the movement path (as shown by arrows A and B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>). In a preferred embodiment, the recessed handle <b>130</b> includes a hub recess <b>132</b> that is sized to receive the hub <b>22</b> of the guide catheter <b>18</b>. For example, the hub recess <b>132</b> may be sized to frictionally secure the hub <b>22</b> within the same. Alternatively, one or more detents, tabs, or the like may be positioned on the hub recess <b>132</b> and/or hub <b>22</b> to releasably secure wire movement guide to the hub <b>22</b> of the guide catheter <b>18</b>. The wire movement guide <b>130</b> also includes a recess <b>134</b> for receiving the steering device <b>26</b>. The recess <b>134</b> is dimensioned to permit axial and rotational movement of the steering device <b>26</b> as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>. The wire movement guide <b>130</b> may also include a wire recess <b>136</b> for receiving the wire guide <b>24</b>. The wire recess <b>136</b> may be interposed between the two recesses <b>132</b>, <b>134</b>. In addition, a wire recess <b>136</b> may be located at a proximal end of the wire movement guide <b>130</b> to permit the wire guide <b>24</b> to exit the proximal end of the wire movement guide <b>130</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of the wire movement guide <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In an alternative aspect of the invention, the wire movement guide <b>130</b> could be formed integrally with the hub <b>22</b> or simply formed integrally on the proximal end of the guide catheter <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">With the use of a wire movement guide <b>130</b>, the physician can move the guide catheter <b>18</b> into a desired position (preferably with the use of endoscopic imaging, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</figref>), while simultaneously advancing and/or rotating the wire guide <b>24</b> with a single hand. For example, the fingers could be manipulating the wire movement guide <b>130</b> and therefore the guide catheter <b>18</b>, while the thumb is able to manipulate the wire guide <b>24</b> to a desired position in the nasal cavity or sinus. A portion of the exterior surface of the steering device <b>26</b> may be scored, roughened, or otherwise textured to aid the physician in manipulating the steering device <b>26</b>. The wire movement guide <b>130</b> advantageously permits the physician to use his or her other hand to independently manipulate another tool such as, for example, an endoscope <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">One preferred embodiment for positioning a wire guide <b>24</b> into the maxillary sinus ostium MO is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</figref>. In this embodiment, the guide catheter <b>18</b>, wire movement guide <b>130</b>, and wire guide <b>24</b> are manipulated under endoscopic visualization. Here, the endoscope <b>82</b> is a &#x201c;rigid&#x201d; endoscope, a standard tool in nasal surgery. The rigid endoscope generally has a forward looking viewing field &#x3b1; which may or may not be offset, a light port <b>82</b><i>a</i>, and a viewing port <b>82</b><i>b </i>through which an image is obtained (indicated with an eyeball symbol). The endoscope <b>82</b> is used to help identify the uncinate process UP, and the guide catheter <b>18</b> is &#x201c;hooked&#x201d; around the uncinate process UP. Additional tools such as a sinus &#x201c;seeker&#x201d; (not shown) can be utilized to help pull the uncinate process UP away from the opposite wall and make room for the tip <b>18</b><i>b </i>of the guide catheter <b>18</b>. Once the guide catheter tip <b>18</b><i>b </i>is positioned, the wire guide <b>24</b> is manipulated by tactile feedback until it is felt to have passed into the maxillary sinus ostium MO and into the maxillary sinus MS. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</figref> illustrates a simplified obstruction <b>138</b> located adjacent the uncinate process UP and maxillary sinus ostium MO. This obstruction <b>138</b> may include mucous, inflamed mucosa, scar tissue, abnormal bony structure, or other substances. In this manner, only conventional endoscopic imaging is utilized&#x2014;without the need for fluoroscopic imaging and/or other specialized &#x201c;image guidance&#x201d; technology. This same technique could be utilized for the other sinuses and their ostia as well. In addition, one or more of the stabilization devices <b>80</b>, <b>100</b>, <b>110</b> previously described could be utilized as would be useful in this or any of the subsequently described methods.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">During operation of the device, it may be desirable to have a way to independently confirm that the distal tip <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the wire guide <b>24</b> has been positioned in the desired sinus, and not inadvertently passed through some other structure, such as the orbital wall. Since the sinuses are difficult if not impossible to image with the standard rigid endoscopes, endoscopic imaging is not readily amenable for this confirmation. One such confirmation approach is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, after the wire guide <b>24</b> has been positioned in what is believed to be the desired location (maxillary sinus MS), a fiber optic catheter <b>140</b> is positioned over the wire guide <b>24</b> and advanced distally towards the tip of the wire guide <b>24</b>. The fiber optic catheter <b>140</b> may be positioned using a guide catheter <b>18</b> of the type illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The distal tip <b>140</b><i>a </i>of the fiber optic catheter <b>140</b> emits light <b>142</b> that is input into the fiber optic catheter <b>140</b> via a light port <b>144</b>. In one aspect of the invention, the emitted light <b>142</b> is bright enough such that it lights up or illuminates the sinus cavity and can be visualized externally. In this regard, the surrounding environment (e.g., physicians office) may need to have the level of ambient light reduced or turned off completely to aid in the visualization process.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">If a structure other than the desired sinus is illuminated, the physician or other operator knows that the wire guide <b>24</b> has been improperly positioned and can subsequently be repositioned into the proper location. Once the position of the wire guide <b>24</b> has been confirmed to be in the desired position, a balloon catheter <b>12</b> can then be confidently placed into the sinus ostium (e.g., MO) and dilated.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment for confirming the position of a wire guide <b>24</b>. In this embodiment, the wire guide <b>24</b> is fitted with a detection element <b>150</b> at or near the distal tip <b>24</b><i>a</i>. In one aspect, the detection element <b>150</b> can be made of a magnetic material. A magnetic detection device (not shown) which could be as simple as a floating magnetic needle such as a compass needle may then be positioned outside the patient's face near the sinus to confirm the position of the wire tip <b>24</b><i>a</i>. For example, in this case, the deflection of the magnetic needle would indicate the presence of the detection element <b>150</b> (and thus the distal tip <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the wire guide <b>24</b>) within the desired sinus cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Alternatively, the detection element <b>150</b> could be formed from a dense metallic material that can be detected with a metal detector device (not shown). For example, the metal detector device may include a probe or the like that can be manipulated near to patient's face near the sinus cavity of interest to detect the presence (or absence) of the metallic detection element <b>150</b>. In yet another aspect, the detection element <b>150</b> may emit a signal (e.g., radiofrequency pulse or the like) that can then be detected externally to confirm the presence or absence of the distal tip <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the wire guide <b>24</b> within the sinus cavity of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Independent confirmation methods and devices as described above may not be necessary if more versatile optical imaging techniques and devices are utilized in the placement of the various devices such as wire guides <b>24</b>, guide catheters <b>18</b>, and/or balloon catheters <b>12</b>. For instance, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates a method for placing a wire guide <b>24</b> across a sinus ostium (e.g., maxillary ostium MO) with the aid of a directable or steerable endoscope <b>152</b>. Directable endoscopes <b>152</b> make use of flexible fiber optic bundles which can be bent or curved to alter the direction of the viewing field <b>154</b>. A typical construction of a directable endoscope <b>152</b> includes multiple control wires (not shown) connected near the distal tip <b>152</b><i>a </i>and to a deflection knob <b>155</b>. In this method, the directable endoscope <b>152</b> is positioned superior to the uncinate process UP and then directed retrograde to allow direct viewing of the viewing field <b>154</b> where the guide catheter <b>18</b> and wire guide <b>24</b> are being manipulated. To further aid in the identification of the maxillary sinus ostium MO, particularly in the case of occlusion <b>156</b> associated with sinusitis, the maxillary sinus MO is illuminated with the placement of a small illumination member <b>158</b> into the sinus. The illumination member <b>158</b> may be formed as an elongate member having a light-emitting distal end <b>158</b><i>a </i>and a proximal end <b>158</b><i>b </i>that is typically connected or otherwise coupled to a light source <b>160</b>. In one aspect, the illumination member <b>158</b> is formed as a fiber optic light based device.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The illumination member <b>158</b> can be placed into the sinus cavity of interest (e.g., maxillary sinus MS) by using a piercing member <b>162</b> such as, for example, an introducer needle <b>162</b> that is introduced through the canine fossa CF region. It should be understood that reference to the canine fossa CF refers to the general region or anatomical area surrounding or adjacent to the canine fossa CF and is not limited to a single, discrete structure or location. The introducer needle <b>162</b> may include a hollow lumen or the like to permit the passage of the illumination member <b>158</b>. The canine fossa CF is a thin portion of the maxillary sinus wall located adjacent the root of the canine teeth. The canine fossa CF has been utilized for other intrasinus procedures. After the formation of a passageway <b>164</b> through the canine fossa CF, the illumination member <b>158</b> is advanced distally such that the distal tip <b>158</b><i>a </i>of the illumination member <b>158</b> is disposed inside the sinus cavity. The emitted light <b>162</b> in the maxillary sinus MS (or other sinus cavity) will be visible through the blockage <b>156</b> of the ostium MO using the directable endoscope <b>152</b>. This aids the physician or other user to direct the wire guide <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates a similar method to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the difference being the use of a rigid retrograde endoscope <b>170</b>. A rigid retrograde endoscope <b>170</b> is similar to a normal rigid endoscope, but the direction of viewing field <b>172</b> is in a retrograde direction. The rigid retrograde endoscope <b>170</b> has a substantially rigid shaft portion <b>173</b> and a retrograde viewing window <b>174</b> located at or near the distal tip <b>170</b><i>a</i>. Retrograde visualization is accomplished through the use of one or more mirrors and/or lenses located at or adjacent to the viewing window <b>174</b> to deflect the viewing field <b>172</b>. Since the viewing field <b>172</b> is retrograde, this endoscope <b>170</b> can assist in accessing the sinus ostium in a similar manner as described with respect to the method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. One difficulty with a rigid retrograde endoscope <b>170</b> is that it can be awkward to initially position it, since it cannot be used to see straight ahead. However, this difficulty is overcome by utilizing a normal rigid endoscope (not shown) alongside the retrograde rigid endoscope <b>170</b> to get it positioned initially in the nasal cavity. Again, an illumination member <b>158</b> in the sinus, placed via the canine fossa CF, can be further utilized to aid in accessing the sinus ostium.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Still other alternative methods for accessing the sinus ostium are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A</figref>, <b>16</b>B, and <b>16</b>C. In these embodiments, a flexible visualization scope <b>180</b> is utilized. The flexible visualization scope <b>180</b> includes an elongate flexible body <b>182</b> that contains a flexible fiber optic bundle <b>183</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C</figref>) for viewing around bends. Although not shown in the figures, the fiber optic bundle <b>183</b> includes both &#x201c;imaging&#x201d; fibers and &#x201c;illumination&#x201d; fibers for lighting up the viewing field <b>184</b>. The flexible visualization scope <b>180</b> is not directable like the endoscope <b>152</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Rather, the flexible visualization scope <b>180</b> includes a lumen or passageway <b>185</b> for the wire guide <b>24</b> and follows the wire guide <b>24</b> around bends as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>. Consequently, in this method, particularly for a maxillary sinus ostium MO, a guide catheter <b>18</b> having a curved distal portion <b>20</b> is positioned near or around the uncinate process UP. A conventional rigid endoscope (not shown) may be used to assist in this positioning. Next, the wire guide <b>24</b> is positioned near the tip <b>18</b><i>b </i>of the guide catheter <b>18</b>. Then the flexible visualization scope <b>180</b> is advanced over the wire guide <b>24</b>, curving back in a retrograde fashion, allowing the viewing field <b>184</b> to be directed towards the sinus ostium (MO in this case). A blockage is shown <b>186</b> positioned within the maxillary ostium MO. The wire guide <b>24</b> and guide catheter <b>18</b> may then be manipulated under visual observation to access the ostium MO. Again, as has been mentioned previously, additional tools or the use of a &#x201c;seeker&#x201d; can be used in addition to the visualization scope <b>180</b>, guide catheter <b>18</b> and wire guide <b>24</b>. In addition, the sinus cavity of interest may be illuminated using the canine fossa CF access method described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Another alternative device and method for accessing a sinus ostium is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A</figref>, <b>17</b>B, and <b>17</b>C. In this embodiment, a directable endoscope sheath <b>190</b> is provided that has a deflectable tip <b>190</b><i>a</i>. The directable endoscope sheath <b>190</b> is similar to the directable endoscope <b>152</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, but further includes a working channel or lumen <b>192</b>, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C</figref>, together with the deflection wires <b>194</b> and optical fibers <b>196</b> (which contain both imaging and illuminating fibers). In use, the directable endoscope sheath <b>190</b> can be introduced into the nasal cavity relatively straight, so as to see straight ahead. When the directable endoscope sheath <b>192</b> is near the uncinate process UP, the tip <b>190</b><i>a </i>is deflected retrograde using, for instance, a deflection knob <b>197</b>, so that the viewing field <b>198</b> is directed towards the sinus ostium MO which contains an obstruction <b>200</b>. At this point, a wire guide <b>24</b> is positioned in the working lumen <b>192</b> and the ostium MO is accessed under visual observation.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In one preferred embodiment, the directable endoscope sheath <b>190</b> has a large enough working channel <b>192</b> that a balloon catheter <b>12</b> can be advanced into the sheath <b>190</b> over the wire <b>24</b>. In this manner, a separate guide catheter <b>18</b> is not necessary. In yet another preferred embodiment, the working channel <b>192</b> is only large enough to accommodate the wire guide <b>24</b>. This allows for the sheath <b>190</b> to have a reasonably small outer diameter. Once the wire <b>24</b> is positioned in the sinus, the directable endoscope sheath <b>190</b> is removed from the wire <b>24</b>, leaving the wire <b>24</b> in position. Thereafter, a balloon catheter <b>12</b> can be installed over the wire <b>24</b> and into the sinus ostium MO for dilation.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref> illustrate a device <b>210</b> and method for accessing and dilating a sinus ostium (e.g., maxillary sinus ostium MO) via a direct sinus puncture technique, in contrast to a transnasal technique. This approach can generally be done with the frontal sinus FS and the maxillary sinus MS. While a description of the device <b>210</b> and process is provided for the maxillary sinus MS, it should be understood that similar access devices <b>210</b> can be used with the frontal sinus FS.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>, a trocar <b>212</b> is shown being advanced into the maxillary sinus MS via the canine fossa CF approach. The trocar <b>212</b> includes a hollow cannula <b>214</b> and a needle <b>216</b> contained within the lumen <b>218</b> of the cannula <b>214</b>. The needle <b>216</b> has a sharp tip <b>220</b> for penetrating the thin bone surrounding the sinus. The needle <b>216</b> may be a solid piece or having one or more lumens therein. Once the cannula <b>214</b> is inside the sinus, the needle <b>216</b> is then removed and the cannula <b>214</b> serves as a guide catheter for subsequent devices. As an alternative to a needle-cannula type of trocar <b>212</b>, a hollow sharpened needle could be used as well.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>, once the cannula <b>214</b> is in place, a wire guide <b>24</b> and an endoscope <b>222</b> can be introduced into the sinus. The cannula <b>214</b> is pointed towards the ostium MO, which points the viewing field <b>224</b> to the ostium MO. Manipulation of the wire guide <b>24</b> through use of a steering device <b>26</b> then delivers the wire guide <b>24</b> across the ostium MO which may contain a blockage <b>200</b> as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>. Optionally, an illumination member <b>226</b> can be placed in the nasal cavity to &#x201c;back-light&#x201d; the ostium MO and enhance the ability for the ostium MO to be seen, further aiding the ability to direct the wire guide <b>24</b> across the ostium MO. Alternatively, a bright light placed at the nostril may be adequate to perform this back-lighting.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">With the above-described &#x201c;direct sinus puncture&#x201d; technique such as through the canine fossa CF, various stabilization devices can be utilized to stabilize one or more of the various tools used for accessing and/or treating the ostium. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref>, a stabilization device <b>110</b> is shown stabilizing the cannula <b>214</b>. The stabilization device <b>110</b> could also be used to stabilize the wire guide <b>24</b>, the endoscope <b>222</b>, trocar <b>212</b>, and/or the balloon catheter <b>12</b>. Similarly, any of the previously described stabilization devices can be utilized with the direct sinus puncture techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A</figref>, <b>19</b>B, and <b>19</b>C illustrate various arrangements and types of endoscopes <b>222</b><i>a</i>, <b>222</b><i>b</i>, <b>222</b><i>c </i>that can be used with this canine fossa CF approach. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>, the endoscope <b>222</b><i>a </i>is a flexible visualization scope having a bundle of optical fibers <b>228</b>. The endoscope <b>222</b><i>a </i>further includes a lumen <b>230</b> through which the wire guide <b>24</b> is fed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref> shows a rigid endoscope <b>222</b><i>b </i>used next to the wire guide <b>24</b>, inside cannula <b>214</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref> illustrates a similar arrangement to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>, but with an additional dual lumen catheter <b>232</b> to better manage the positioning of the wire guide <b>24</b> relative to the rigid endoscope <b>222</b><i>c</i>. In all these approaches, the diameter of the endoscope <b>222</b><i>a</i>, <b>222</b><i>b</i>, <b>222</b><i>c </i>used is preferably small, about 0.5 mm to about 4 mm, and most preferably about 1 mm to about 2 mm. This allows for the use of a relatively small trocar and relatively small puncture size. Preferred trocar diameters are from 0.7 mm to 4.2 mm (depending on the size of the devices used with them), and more preferably from about 1 mm to 2.5 mm, and most preferably 1.2 to 2.0 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates the introduction of a balloon dilation catheter <b>12</b> into the cannula <b>214</b> and into the sinus ostium MO, dilating the ostium MO, and deforming and/or remodeling the uncinate process UP. To aid in the positioning of the balloon <b>10</b>, an optional endoscope <b>240</b> is placed in the nasal cavity may be used to visualize the catheter tip <b>12</b><i>c </i>relative to the uncinate process UP.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Alternatively, the position of the balloon <b>10</b> may not require &#x201c;real time&#x201d; visualization with an endoscope, if various markers on the wire guide and/or balloon catheter shaft as described earlier are utilized. For example, if the wire guide <b>24</b> includes markers, the marker that is seen at or near the ostium can be noted. Markers on the proximal portion of the wire guide <b>24</b> can then be used to determine the &#x201c;depth&#x201d; that the wire guide <b>24</b> has been advanced to reach the ostium. The balloon catheter <b>12</b> can then be advanced a distance over the wire guide <b>24</b> a predetermined distance on the wire guide <b>24</b>, such that the balloon <b>10</b> is positioned at a desired position relative to the noted marker on the wire guide <b>24</b>. Markers <b>62</b> on the shaft of the balloon catheter <b>12</b> can aid in this positioning. With this use of markers <b>62</b>, the balloon <b>10</b> can be confidently positioned in the desired region of the sinus ostium. The desired length of the balloon can be selected by viewing the computed tomography (CT) scans of the patient, which are part of a standard diagnostic workup of the patient prior to any intervention.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Though not shown, once the maxillary ostium MO has been treated, the ethmoids and/or frontal sinuses ES, FS can also be treated by this same canine fossa access. The wire guide <b>24</b> can be manipulated into the ethmoids and/or frontals, with subsequent dilation of the ostia of these sinuses. Similar endoscopic visualization techniques as described above can also be utilized to assist in placement of the various devices such as the wire guide <b>24</b> to these locations. In the case of the ethmoids, it may be desirable to use a sharpened wire in lieu of a wire guide <b>24</b> to puncture into the wall of the ethmoid sinus air cells, followed by balloon dilation of the puncture.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">As mentioned above, the frontal sinus FS can also be accessed directly from outside the skull, through the wall of the frontal sinus FS to facilitate treatment of the frontal sinus ostium FO. Rather than a trocar, the frontal sinus FS can be directly accessed through a mini trephination through the skin and the sinus wall, as is known in the art. With a mini-trephination, the access is performed with a drill tool. Once accessed, the frontal sinus ostium FO may be directly accessed with a wire guide <b>24</b>. A preferred location for accessing the frontal sinus FS is through the floor of the frontal sinus FS. Since the frontal sinus FS is relatively small, and there is only one outflow tract and its position can be approximated relative to the nose, visualization may not be required to pass the wire guide <b>24</b> through the frontal sinus ostium FO and into the nasal cavity. Standard endoscopic visualization could be performed in the nasal cavity via the nostrils to observe the wire guide <b>24</b> after it passes into the nasal cavity. Subsequent to passing the wire guide <b>24</b> into the frontal ostium FO, a balloon dilation catheter <b>12</b> can be positioned in the ostium FO to dilate it.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Although the maxillary sinus MS is easily accessible via the canine fossa CF, it is important to control the depth of the initial puncture so as to not inadvertently advance the needle <b>216</b> too far and potentially into the orbit O or elsewhere. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> illustrates a trocar <b>212</b> with a stop <b>250</b> secured to a portion of the trocar <b>212</b>. The stop <b>250</b> prevents the needle <b>216</b> from advancing too far into the sinus cavity. In one aspect, the stop <b>250</b> is clamped on to either the needle <b>216</b> or the cannula <b>214</b> at a predetermined position. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the stop <b>250</b> is adjustable and/or removable with respect to the fixation point (e.g., needle <b>216</b> or cannula <b>214</b>). For example, the stop <b>250</b> may include one or more tightening members <b>252</b> such as screws or the like that can be selectively tightened or loosen the stop <b>250</b>. Once the trocar <b>212</b> is inserted up to the stop <b>250</b>, the stop <b>250</b> is removed. The cannula <b>214</b> can then be advanced with little force, as the puncture site has already been made.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> shows an alternative trocar <b>212</b> arrangement for improving the control of the puncturing into the canine fossa CF. Here, the needle <b>216</b> includes needle threads <b>216</b><i>a </i>located on an exterior surface thereof. The threads <b>216</b><i>a </i>of the needle <b>216</b> engage with a threaded hub <b>254</b> in a threaded interface. The threaded hub <b>254</b> may be in the form of a &#x201c;clamshell&#x201d; of two treaded pieces or halves <b>254</b><i>a</i>, <b>254</b><i>b </i>that surround and engage the needle threads <b>216</b><i>a</i>. The position of the threaded hub <b>254</b> may be held fast by attachment to a stabilizing device such as the stabilizing devices <b>80</b>, <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 10</figref>. The needle <b>216</b> is then advanced into the canine fossa CF by controlled rotation of the needle <b>216</b>. Once the needle <b>216</b> has penetrated or traveled the desired amount, the threaded hub <b>254</b> is removed, and the cannula <b>214</b> is advanced to a desired position within the sinus. Alternatively, the threaded hub <b>254</b> could be attached to a stabilizing device <b>80</b>, <b>110</b> in a manner that allows rotation of the threaded hub <b>254</b> about the needle threads <b>216</b><i>a</i>, by utilizing a bearing surface (not shown) with the stabilizing device <b>80</b>, <b>110</b>. The threaded hub <b>254</b> when rotated would controllably advance the needle <b>216</b> into the sinus. In this manner, the needle <b>216</b> is not rotated.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Sometimes the desired direction and positioning for placing the trocar <b>212</b> in the canine fossa CF does not provide good alignment with the location of the sinus ostium. In this case, a trocar <b>212</b> having a flexible tip <b>260</b> can be used, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A and 23B</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref>, the cannula <b>214</b> has a somewhat flexible curved tip <b>260</b>, that, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref>, is maintained straight by the presence of the needle <b>216</b>. This trocar <b>212</b> is advanced into the sinus. Upon removal of the needle <b>216</b>, the flexible tip <b>260</b> takes on its curved shape, more oriented to the ostium MO. Thereafter a wire guide <b>24</b> is advanced across the ostium MO, preferably under the visual guidance of a flexible visualization scope <b>262</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref>. The visualization scope <b>262</b> is preferably dimensioned such that it can be slidably passed through the cannula <b>214</b>. The flexible visualization scope <b>262</b> includes a lumen or passageway <b>264</b> for the wire guide <b>24</b>. The flexible visualization scope <b>262</b> is able to be oriented to place the visualization field <b>266</b> within the vicinity of the ostium MO. Manipulation of the curved tip <b>260</b> of the cannula <b>214</b> can assist in directing the wire guide <b>24</b> to and through the ostium MO. Also as shown, the nasal cavity can be back-lit using an illumination member <b>268</b> to aid in seeing the ostium. Also, other tools and methods may be used as desired, such as, for example, the trocar <b>212</b> modifications illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> illustrates another device and method for accessing the maxillary sinus ostium MO via the canine fossa CF. In this embodiment, two small punctures <b>270</b>, <b>272</b> are made, side-by-side in the canine fossa CF region. A puncture device <b>210</b> like that disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref> may be used. For example, a rigid endoscope <b>274</b> is positioned in the cannula <b>214</b> of the first puncture site <b>270</b>. A wire guide <b>24</b> is then positioned in the cannula <b>214</b> of the second puncture site <b>272</b>. One or more of the cannulas <b>212</b> may have a curved tip <b>260</b> to better access the maxillary sinus ostium MO. The wire guide <b>24</b> may then be positioned across the ostium MO under the visualization of the rigid endoscope <b>274</b>. A balloon dilation catheter (not shown in FIG. <b>24</b>) may then be advanced over the wire <b>24</b> to dilate the sinus. The ostial region may be back-lit using an illumination member <b>276</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A and 25B</figref> illustrate a common anatomical characteristic present in patients with sinusitis associated with the maxillaries, ethmoids, and frontals. The uncinate process UP is shown in close association with the opposite wall, typically on the ethmoid bulla EB. This condition creates a narrow slit-like space called the infundibulum I. The maxillary sinus ostium MO is actually located below (i.e., inferior to) the infundibulum I. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25B</figref> more clearly shows the &#x201c;topography&#x201d; of the structures of the uncinate process UP and ethmoid bulla EB. It is believed that a narrowed infundibulum I may be part of the condition leading to the patient's sinusitis, as well as one or more narrowed ostia. In some patents, a narrowed infundibulum I may be the sole anatomical cause leading to sinusitis.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">The previously described approaches to dilating the maxillary sinus ostium MO may result in a widening of the infundibulum I by deforming or remodeling the uncinate process UP, as well as the widening of the ostium MO itself. However, in some patients, the uncinate process UP may not stay permanently deformed following removal of the dilation catheter <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">An alternative approach to widening the infundibulum I is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26A and 26B</figref>. One or more shim members <b>280</b> are placed in the gap of the infundibulum I to forcibly spread it away from the ethmoid bulla EB and improve drainage for the maxillary, frontal and portions of the ethmoid sinus. In one preferred aspect of the invention, the one or more shim members <b>280</b> are left in place after implantation. The shim members <b>280</b> may remain in place for a temporary period of time or permanently. The sinus ostium may still be dilated with the use of a balloon dilation catheter <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26B</figref> illustrates three such shim members <b>280</b> secured in the infundibulum I. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26B</figref>, the gap is widened to expose the maxillary sinus ostium MO.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A and 27B</figref> illustrate one preferred embodiment of a shim member <b>280</b>. The shim members <b>280</b> may be dimensioned such that one or more sides are longer than the remaining sides. For example, the shim member <b>280</b> may be longer than it is wide, with a length dimension preferably about 1 mm to about 6 mm in length, and more preferably about 2 mm to about 4 mm in length. The shim members <b>280</b> may include one or more gripping members <b>282</b> on all or a portion of an exterior surface. The gripping members <b>282</b> may be formed as a serrated surface or even a plurality of teeth or similar projections. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A and 27B</figref>, the gripping members <b>282</b> are located on opposing sides of the shim member <b>280</b> to allow for the shim member <b>280</b> to be rotated into position and held in place.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">The shim member <b>280</b> may include one or more engagement holes <b>284</b> that are used for the delivery of the shim member <b>280</b>. For example, the engagement holes <b>284</b> may be dimensioned to fit on the distal end of a tool as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>. The shim member <b>280</b> may be a permanent implant, or more preferably a degradable bioabsorbable implant. Suitable materials for a degradable shim member <b>280</b> include poly-lactic acid, poly-glycolic acid, poly-L-lactic acid or other materials such as those used in degradable sutures. It is believed that after the shim members <b>280</b> are implanted in the infundibulum I, the uncinate process UP will remodel over time to maintain a widened infundibulum.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> illustrates a delivery tool <b>290</b> for use in the delivery of the shim member(s) <b>280</b>. The delivery tool <b>290</b> includes an elongate torque driver <b>292</b> constructed of a multi-layer, multi-filar drive shaft similar to that used in speedometer cables. The torque driver <b>292</b> is dimensioned to be positionable within a guide catheter <b>18</b> or the like. The shim member <b>280</b> is connected to the torque driver <b>292</b> at its distal end <b>292</b><i>a</i>. The proximal end <b>292</b><i>b </i>of the torque driver <b>292</b> is coupled to a handle <b>294</b> or the like that is used to rotate the torque driver <b>292</b> (and attached shim member <b>280</b>) in the direction of the arrows shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The guide catheter <b>18</b> is used to place the shim member <b>280</b> over the uncinate process UP and in the narrowed infundibulum I, initially in a narrow or &#x201c;sideways&#x201d; orientation. The torque driver <b>292</b> is then rotated by rotation of the handle <b>294</b>. Rotation of about 60 to about 90 degrees will widen the infundibulum I as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26B</figref>. The connection between the torque driver <b>292</b> and the shim member <b>280</b> is disconnected. This could be done, for example, by reversing the rotational direction of the torque handle <b>294</b> and causing a weakened portion of the connection to break. Alternatively, the torque driver <b>292</b> may be frictionally engaged with the holes <b>284</b> of the shim member <b>280</b>. Retraction of the torque driver <b>292</b> in the proximal direction may disengage the torque driver <b>292</b> from the shim member <b>280</b>. Once place, the one or more shim members <b>280</b> will maintain the infundibulum I in a widened condition, while minimizing the interruption of the mucosa by the presence of the shim member(s) <b>280</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, the infundibulum I can be widened by delivery of an expandable stent <b>300</b>, oriented more or less in the infundibulum I. This stent <b>300</b> can be similar to that used in coronary stenting procedures, and can be either &#x201c;self-expanding&#x201d; or &#x201c;balloon expandable.&#x201d; The geometry of the stent <b>300</b> may be tubular as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. The stent <b>300</b> can be placed in the infundibulum I using a balloon catheter <b>12</b> and a wire guide <b>24</b>. As one example, the stent <b>300</b> may be positioned via a transnasal approach wherein the wire guide <b>24</b> is directed along the infundibulum I up towards the frontal sinus ostium FO (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>) and then deployed between the uncinate process UP and the ethmoid bulla EB.</p>
