<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates generally to software monitoring, tracking, and return on investment (ROI) analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Powerful trends are reshaping the way the software industry operates and the way software is being developed. The biggest trend is arguably the one toward running Information Technology (IT) as a business. The United States Department of Commerce estimates that 50% of all capital spending is spent on IT and software. According to published studies, a not-insignificant portion of this spending is wasted because of the lack of metrics regarding productivity and ROI, and because during the software development process developers lack the ability to gather feedback easily from users and customers. Without such feedback, developers and product managers cannot determine which features of an application are most popular, which features cause the most problems when the software is used, and the like. Decisions about where to optimally allocate and leverage development resources thus are uninformed. The problem is exacerbated as software development and testing activities become distributed around the world. In the past, developers and IT managers have attempted to ascertain and evaluate application usage information through various techniques including guess-estimation, user surveys and focus groups, but such techniques typically represent only a small sampling of a customer base, and they often contain inaccurate and untimely data.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is known in the prior art to provide methods and systems for centrally coordinating, collecting and storing error, trace, audit and other information in a computer network. A representative example is U.S. Pat. No. 6,470,388, issued to Niemi et al. In this patent, selected applications or processes running at various entities or hosts within the network instantiate one or more &#x201c;debug&#x201d; objects that collect given information. Each entity also includes at least one logging service layer that communicates with the application or process, and includes a communications resource and one or more state machine engines. In response to collecting error, trace, audit or other information, each debug object passes that data to the respective logging service layer, which decides whether to forward the data to a centralized logging facility disposed within the network. The forwarding of collected information depends on the state of the debug object. At the centralized logging facility, the information is time-stamped and appended to a log file along with the application's name and the name of the entity or host at which the application is running.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another representative patent is U.S. Pat. No. 6,591,228, issued to Hall et al. In this patent, a logging service logs to a centralized log diagnostic messages from applications executing in a computing environment in which a plurality of mainframes are coupled to data storage area. Each mainframe has one or more subsystems that execute applications. A logging service API writes diagnostic messages to the data storage and, depending on the type of problem, contacts an alert facility.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">While the above-described application logging techniques are generally useful, they work across homogeneous computer environments, using a relatively modest number of tracked systems, and they collect a relatively constrained set of information. There remains a need in the art to provide methods and systems that track application usage information independent of platform, location and number of deployed application instances, especially in the context of the software development process.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention addresses the need in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The subject matter herein relates to a software platform that delivers business value analytics for technology optimization, especially during the software development process. Generally, a tracking platform is run as a hosted (or managed) service to monitor, collect and aggregate application usage information. It is assumed that an application under test is being executed on a set of distributed machines, such as end user client machines. The application is instrumented to collect the usage information, which in one embodiment is then transported reliably to a central location, where it is aggregated and exported for viewing. By collecting and measuring detailed usage information about an application, the service helps software developers build high quality software applications more efficiently. The system preferably exports a web interface to enable users (e.g., IT managers, application developers and the like) to transact with the system over the Internet using conventional technologies (a computer having a web browser and network connectivity) and using standard communication techniques (HTTP, secure HTTP, SOAP-based web service, or the like). Alternatively, the system is implemented as an extranet, over a private network, or the like. Preferably, entities access the hosted solution on a subscription basis, although a given entity may also elect to access the service on a transaction-based basis.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to more specific aspects of this disclosure, the application under test is one of application software, a web application, or a rich internet application (RIA). During the development process, a usage monitoring API is integrated into the application and the application is deployed. As users interact with the application, a log file is generated, typically in one of two ways. If the application is able to write to a local file system (in the user's machine), usage information is gathered in a log file local to the deployed application and then dispatched to an upload server for processing in a batch manner. If the application is not able to write to the user machine's local file system (because, for example, it is a web application or RIA), the usage information is sent to a remote logging server, preferably on a just-in-time basis, and then the log file is generated on the logging server. In either case, preferably the usage information that is tracked comprises &#x201c;features,&#x201d; &#x201c;faults&#x201d; and &#x201c;failures&#x201d; of the application, independent of platform, location, and number of deployed application instances. As used herein, &#x201c;feature&#x201d; data refers generally to a collection of information such as which features were used, when, in what order, by whom, on what platform, and with what end-user environment. The &#x201c;fault&#x201d; data refers generally to which features caused programmatic errors (e.g., exceptions).

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a representative service provider or system architecture, which in the preferred embodiment is implemented in or across one or more data centers. A data center typically has connectivity to the Internet. In one embodiment, the system provides a web-based hosted solution through which application developers (or others such as IT personnel) create, manage and monitor application usage analytics in an online manner. Participants preferably interact with the platform as a hosted service. In an alternative embodiment, the system may be implemented over a private network, or as a product (as opposed to a hosted or managed service).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A user of the service has an Internet accessible machine such as a workstation or notebook computer. Typically, the user accesses the service provider architecture by opening a web browser on the machine to a URL associated with a service provider domain or sub-domain. The user then authenticates to the managed service in the usual manner, e.g., by entry of a username and password. The connection between the machine and the service provider infrastructure may be encrypted or otherwise secure, e.g., via SSL, or the like. Although connectivity via the publicly-routed Internet is typical, the user may connect to the service provider infrastructure over any local area, wide area, wireless, wired, private or other dedicated network. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the service provider architecture <b>100</b> comprises an IP switch <b>102</b>, a set of one or more web server machines <b>104</b>, a set of one more application server machines <b>106</b>, a database management system <b>108</b>, and a set of one or more administration server machines <b>110</b>. A representative web server machine <b>104</b> comprises commodity hardware (e.g., Intel-based), an operating system such as Linux, and a web server such as Apache 2.x. A representative application server machine <b>106</b> comprises commodity hardware, Linux, and an application server. The database management system <b>108</b> may be implemented as an Oracle database management package. In a high volume use environment, there may be several web server machines, several application server machines, and a number of administrative server machines. Although not shown in detail, the infrastructure may include a name service, other load balancing appliances, other switches, network attached storage, and the like. The system typically will also include connectivity to external data sources, such as third party databases. Each machine in the system typically comprises sufficient disk and memory, as well as input and output devices. Generally, the web servers <b>104</b> handle incoming business entity provisioning requests, and they export a display interface that is described and illustrated in more detail below. The application servers <b>106</b> manage the data and facilitate the functions of the platform. The administrator servers <b>110</b> handle all back-end accounting and reporting functions. The particular hardware and software implementation details described herein are merely for illustrative purposes are not meant to limit the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the basic operation of the logging service. In this example, application instances <b>200</b><i>a </i>and <b>200</b><i>b </i>have been instrumented with a usage monitoring API according to the invention. The usage monitoring API is sometimes referred to as a remote node. Thus, application instance <b>200</b><i>a </i>has associated therewith the remote node <b>202</b><i>a </i>and application instance <b>200</b><i>b </i>has associated therewith the remote node <b>202</b><i>b</i>. Of course, the use of two instances is merely illustrative, as the present invention is designed to provide a highly scalable distributed logging service wherein a large number of instances of the deployed application are instrumented and tracked. In operation, the remote node <b>202</b><i>a </i>generates usage data set <b>204</b><i>a</i>, and remote node <b>202</b><i>b </i>generates usage data set <b>204</b><i>b</i>. This usage data is transported in a highly efficient manner (as will be described below) to a central server (or to a set of servers), where the data sets are aggregated (reference numeral <b>206</b>) and processed within an analytics and reporting engine <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The present invention is useful in the context of software development and testing, although one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the invention is not limited to such use. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a representative business case. In this example, a web application developer <b>300</b> adds the usage monitoring API into the web application or rich Internet application under development. The application so instrumented is then made available from a web site or other publishing server <b>302</b>. An end user <b>304</b> navigates to the site and downloads and interacts with the application to generate usage data. This data is sent to the logging server <b>306</b>, which then uploads such data to the hosted service database <b>308</b>. A manager <b>310</b> (or the developer <b>300</b>) can then log into the hosted service web site <b>312</b> and access the logged data.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an operation of the hosted service in more detail. In this example, a large number of end users <b>400</b><i>a</i>-<b>400</b><i>n </i>use the application and generate usage data sets that are provided to the logging server <b>402</b>. The logging server <b>402</b> may comprise one or more servers. The logging server <b>402</b> periodically uploads the data sets through firewall <b>410</b> to an application server <b>404</b>, which stores the processed data in a database <b>406</b>. The user <b>405</b> of the hosted service logs into the service through server <b>412</b> and views the usage reports through server <b>414</b>, which accesses the usage data through the firewall <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Preferably, the application under test is one of: application software (such as a program written in Java, .Net, C++, C#, or the like), a script-enabled web application (such as a web page including Javascript, ActionScript or the like), or a rich Internet application (RIA) (e.g., Flash, AJAX-enabled, or the like). During the development process, a usage monitoring API is integrated into the application and the application is deployed. As users interact with the application, a log file is generated, typically in one of two ways. If the application is able to write to a local file system (in the user's machine), usage information is gathered in a log file local to the deployed application and then dispatched to an upload server for processing in a batch manner. If the application is not able to write to the user machine's local file system (because, for example, it is a web application or RIA), the usage information is sent to a remote logging server, preferably on a just-in-time basis, and then the log file is generated on the logging server. This is the technique used for Web browser-based logging. Preferably, such logging is accomplished by transmitting the data through http URL parameters to the logging server, which then translates the data into a log file. In either case, preferably the usage information that is tracked comprises &#x201c;features,&#x201d; &#x201c;faults&#x201d; and &#x201c;failures&#x201d; of the application, independent of platform, location, and number of deployed application instances. As noted above, &#x201c;feature&#x201d; data refers generally to a collection of information such as which features were used, when, in what order, by whom, on what platform, and with what end-user environment. Typically, features are exposed to end users. The &#x201c;fault&#x201d; data refers generally to which features caused programmatic errors (e.g., exceptions). The &#x201c;failures&#x201d; data identifies which features failed to complete successfully, for example, if data was entered into a field in an incorrect format.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Thus, according to one illustrative use of the invention, a user of the hosted service instruments an application under development with tracking modules to better understand its beta customers as well as the progress of their beta testing. As noted above, preferably the &#x201c;tracking modules&#x201d; are embedded in (or otherwise associated with) the software application to be tracked. Usage data is sent back in a lightweight proprietary manner to an aggregation and reporting server.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The following description provides additional details of an embodiment where an application has the ability to write a log file to an end user machine local file system. In this embodiment, the hosted service platform collects data from the end users through a number of components that are now described. The first component is the remote node, which is responsible for collecting feature tracking and configuration information. The second component is the server, which takes the results of the remote node and combines it with data collected from other remote nodes. These two components make it possible for a user of the present invention to collect feature tracking and configuration information from many simultaneous nodes. There are also three important goals that the remote node should have. The first is that it must be easy to integrate. The second is that it must run fast. The third is that the transfer of information must be fast and appear incidental to the application's normal execution. Integration is made simple by preferably requiring only one line of code to be added per feature. The second goal is met by the application running fast because this one line of code, and its resulting calls, only introduce several milliseconds of overhead to an application per feature call. The third goal is met because the log file format ensures that the file will always be very small even under the worst of conditions, leading to very fast transfer times and low CPU utilization at those times, thus ensuring that the user's application does not perform poorly while a transfer is in progress. The following describes the remote node and all of its parts and then moves on the relevant server components.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The remote node collects feature tracking and configuration information for one instance of a given application. At some user defined point, the remote node attempts to connect to the server component and dispatch a series of log files. The remote component relies on several sub-components that collect and transfer this information. Some of these components require the user to perform certain implementation tasks. Table 1 below describes each component.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">These components will be described below. First, the following describes the flow of data between the remote node and the server in a representative embodiment. Then, the process of integrating these components into an application so that a user can collect feature tracking information is described.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Preferably, data flows in a single direction from the remote node to the server and the server does not communicate with the remote node. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a representative process flow. The process for transmitting data is straightforward. The remote node waits for a dispatching event <b>500</b>, which causes the remote node to connect to a user defined URL. At step <b>502</b>, the remote attempts to connect to the logging server. A test at step <b>504</b> determines whether the remote node can connect to the server. If so, the remote node then transfers all log files, preferably by submitting them to an HTML form on an HTML page specified by the URL. Preferably, the remote node then deletes the successfully dispatched log files. Moreover, preferably the remote node stores the log files for a user-defined number of days if a connection cannot be made to the server. The remote node also preferably checks the date of each log file after a failed dispatch event. The remote node then deletes the files that are older than the maximum number of days.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In this embodiment, the server side simply serves an HTML form for the file transfer to work as shown in the code snippet illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The remote node parses the HTML page and finds the upload form, sets the file field, and then submits the information. The step of finding the form ensures that the system does not try to arbitrarily perform a file upload on a form that cannot accept the incoming file. Upon receipt, the server writes the incoming log file to an import directory. The server's log import component preferably scans this directory at regular intervals. The import component opens the new log file and adds the data to the database.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Preferably, there are two basic configurations for the logging server to make available the file upload form. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates the process flows for these configurations. The first configuration (type A) is shown in the top portion of the drawing. In this configuration, the server makes the form available and waits for remote nodes to connect. This is step <b>600</b>. At step <b>602</b>, a test is run to determine whether a remote node is attempting to connect. Upon receiving a connection, the server accepts the log file at step <b>604</b> and writes the log file to the import directory at step <b>606</b>. At step <b>608</b>, the new log file is imported into the service database. At step <b>610</b> the database is updated, after which the log file is deleted at step <b>612</b>. The server then returns to a state to await another upload. The second configuration (type B) is typically implemented with the logging server located in the DMZ of an enterprise web site. In this implementation, an arbitrary HTTP server <b>613</b> serves the file transfer form and waits for the remote node connections at step <b>614</b>. When a remote node connects, the server <b>613</b> processes the upload form request at step <b>616</b>, writes the log file to a local drive <b>618</b> and, at step <b>620</b>, copies the files to log import directory of the logging server <b>615</b> associated with the hosted service. The logging server <b>615</b> runs concurrently. In particular, logging server <b>615</b> scans the import directory at step <b>622</b>. If a new log file is present as indicated by the test at step <b>624</b>, the log file is imported at step <b>626</b>, the database is updated at step <b>628</b>, and the log file is deleted at step <b>630</b>. The configuration B is more secure and reliable (as compared to configuration A), as the HTTP server can be an existing corporate HTTP server, such as the one used to serve the company's web pages. Configuration B also is more secure in the sense that no critical log data is accessible from the outside world. Further, the second configuration is more reliable in that the corporate web server is implemented to handle a large number of simultaneous users, and it is constantly monitored so that it can be brought back up quickly in the event of a failure.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In this embodiment, a software developer typically performs a series of steps to facilitate the collection of the feature and configuration information. In particular, the following steps describe how the developer instruments the application to generate the log data (familiarity with Java is presumed in the following):</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">1. Implement a derivation of a MessageHandler class.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">2. Add a series of Messenger.store( . . . ) methods to the application's existing code. Each addition should be at the point in code that represents a given feature's entry point.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">3. Update the application installation tool such that it collects HTTP proxy information and generates a configuration file readable by the developer's application and that can forward this information to the MessageHandler.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Each of the above steps will now be described in more detail.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Step <b>1</b></p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The MessageHandler is a Java abstract class. Consequently, according to the invention, an integrator derives a concrete implementation of this class that is specific to his or her application. This message handler performs a series of tasks, which are now described.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In a representative embodiment, the MessageHandler class is responsible for filtering and dispatching log files. An instance of the class typically begins with initialization code that sets a series of variables necessary for creating and dispatching a log file. Creating a log file typically requires the name of the integrator's domain name, such as mycompany.com, a unique 32 character identifier provided by the service provider's server, and project and build names. The 32 character unique identifier may be provided by the server to a user working through a user interface, or through any other convenient means. The identifier is created and displayed when the user creates a new build for a particular project. The user then copies that 32 character unique identifier into his MessageHandler class implementation. The 32 character identifier is used to match the log file data to a particular project and build on the service provider's server. The read data from the log file is then put into the server's data repository. Project and build names preferably are also used to match data to a project and build in the event that the 32 character identifier fails, e.g., due to a typographic error on the part of the developer. The MessageHandler's dispatching mechanism preferably also requires a destination URL and may include other optional items such as a login name, password, proxy server configurations, and additional code to script the process of transmitting a log file back to an import server. The MessageHandler may dispatch a log file at the time the application starts, stops, during configuration data collection or after a feature has been executed. The developer's implementation of these methods simply returns a &#x201c;true&#x201d; response, and the MessageHandler then automatically dispatches all (or some subset of the) log files in the system. Upon getting a &#x201c;true&#x201d; response, the dispatcher typically uses the proxy information, if present or necessary, to pass through a first intervening firewall and make a connection to the server specified in the URL parameter. The URL may require special login information or expose additional scripting. At this point, the dispatcher executes the additional login information and code to get a file upload form. The dispatcher then sends the log files through this form.</p>

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The Messenger.storefeature ( . . . ) method tracks feature data. It takes two parameters. The first is an instance of the customized message handler. The second is a string containing the name of the feature. The resulting information about the number of executions of the feature indicates the value of that feature. Of course, a highly used feature is often more valuable than a rarely or never used feature.</p>

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The remotely running application may be behind a transparent or authenticating proxy server. The user's application installation component should find this out and collect the proxy server's address, port, user name and password if necessary and then write this information to a configuration file that the custom MessageHandler instance can read. The MessageHandler should then call the setProxyServerHost( ) setProxyServerPort( . . . ), setProxyUserName( . . . ), setProxyUserPassword methods with the configured information.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">These integration steps make it possible for the user's application to now collect and transfer feature-tracking information. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a representative process flow that occurs when a user executes a tracked feature. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the routine begins when a user executes a feature at step <b>700</b>. At step <b>702</b>, the feature tracking code is executed. A test is then run at step <b>704</b> to determine whether this is the first feature execution for the application run. If so, the MessageHandler startup method is called at step <b>706</b>. A test is then run at step <b>708</b> to determine whether the log files should be dispatched. If not, the MessageHandler's handle configuration message method is called at step <b>710</b>. The routine then calls the MessageHandler's handle message method at step <b>712</b>, which step is also reached when the outcome of the test at step <b>714</b> is positive. Step <b>714</b> tests whether a dispatch is due to a startup event. After step <b>712</b>, the feature statistics are updated at step <b>716</b>. A test is then performed at step <b>718</b> to determine whether the feature should be written to the log file. If so, the log file is written at step <b>720</b>. Following step <b>720</b>, or if the outcome of the test at step <b>718</b> is negative, a test is performed at step <b>722</b> to determine whether the log files should be dispatched. If so, the remote node collects all log files at step <b>724</b>, connects to the remote server at step <b>726</b>, and then tests at step <b>728</b> to determine whether it can connect to the server. If so, a test is performed at step <b>730</b> to determine whether the remote server has a file upload form. If not, or if the outcome of the test at step <b>728</b> is negative, a test is performed at step <b>734</b> to determine if the file is older than a user-defined maximum number of days. After a positive outcome of the test at step <b>730</b>, the file is uploaded at step <b>732</b>. After step <b>732</b> or a positive outcome to step <b>734</b>, the file is deleted at step <b>736</b> and control returns to the test at step <b>714</b> to complete the processing.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">A log file preferably is a binary file containing a series of specially formatted events. Preferably, the file comprises aggregated feature information rather than one entry per feature execution (as is common in traditional log files) to ensure that the file is smaller than traditional log files. The use of aggregated feature information is not a limitation of the invention, however.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The format can be read and integrated into a database very efficiently because each field is well defined. Traditional log files have to be read line by line and then the data must be parsed out of the text. This is often difficult to implement and consequently error prone and performs poorly. The formatting is described in terms of number of unsigned bytes. The following key describes the nomenclature as defined by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) Specification. In particular, U followed by a number is an unsigned 8-bit byte of the given length. U1 is a single unsigned while U4 represents 4 unsigned bytes. U followed by [ ] indicates that it is an array of bytes. A [ ] enclosing another field name indicates that that field name specifies the length of the array.</p>

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The following provides additional details regarding a preferred technique by which log files are processed and transported according to the invention. As noted above, preferably log files track features, faults and/or failures of a software application, and they are transported in a highly compact footprint to allow for high performance, lightweight processing in a scalable manner. To this end, a preferred log file format according to the invention is highly efficient, sequential, relative, and referential. Efficiency is achieved by using small messages, preferably in a binary file (as opposed to, say, XML or other human readable text), and by compressing whole numbers to save log file space. Preferably, all messages are written in order of their real world occurrence. Timestamps for messages preferably are relative to a first time-stamped message. Thus for example, assume a first message indicates that an event occurred at 12:00 and that a second message occurred at 12:01. The first message stores 12:00 in milliseconds from the UTC epoch date, and the second message is stored with the number of milliseconds between the first event and the second event. Once again, this encoding technique saves log file space. The reporting mechanism uses the time data to provide detailed information about when a user took a given action with respect to the application or when the application responded in a certain way. The reporting mechanism can segment the data so that feature usage information can be examined per hour, per day, per week, per month, or any other time scale. The log file format preferably is also referential, as some messages (e.g., like feature execution messages), reference standard feature messages. Moreover, preferably a feature message creates an index for a feature name and uses this index to count the number of feature invocations.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In a representative embodiment, there are several different scenarios that are tracked. In a first scenario, the code logs a first feature extraction. In such case, the feature logging code preferably opens a new log file and the logging code writes the following messages, preferably in order: project, configuration, node type and feature. In a second scenario, the code logs follow on feature executions. In this scenario, the logging code preferably adds just one message, indicating feature execution. In a third scenario, the logging code logs a feature failure. In this scenario, the logging code preferably adds just one message, indicating feature failure. Finally, in a last scenario, the logging code logs a feature fault. Just one message is created again, indicating a feature fault. Sample logging code with the associated logging statements is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Preferably, each log file is made up of a series of messages. Each message typically has some common formatting and then become message type specific. The following are illustrative message types:

<p id="p-0073" num="0099">To capture the desired information while still maintaining high performance goals for the feature tracking system, the log files preferably use a binary file format, which is now described in more detail. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a representative file format (with bytes represented as hexadecimal).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0100">The following describes an encoding method for generating the binary file format and, in particular, that takes in a number and compresses it down to a smallest number of bytes possible. The method begins by initializing a buffer to a base value that represents zero, the smallest non-negative whole number. The most significant bit (MSB) for each byte in the buffer is reserved to indicate whether the byte is a part of a number or the end of a number. This means that only 7 bits of a byte actually contain a numeric value while the most significant bit is an indicator. The encoding process then goes on to break the number from 8 to 7 bits across the buffer, shifting the bits <b>7</b> places to the right. The MSB portions of the number are encoded within each byte of the buffer with the MSB set to 1. The final bits of the number are encoded with a 0 at the MSB. Decoding the number is a process of checking if the buffer's MSB bit is set to 1. If so, the routine reads 7 bits and then shifts the values left for seven bits into a target data type, such as a 32 or 64 bit data type. When the MSB is set to 0, the routine reads the remaining 7 bits, performs the same shift operation and terminates the read process. The result is the number used as the input for the encoder.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0101">Thus, according to an embodiment of the invention, a data type represents a whole number that is compressed to fit into a smallest number of necessary bits. The scheme preferably works by breaking numbers across a series of bytes. The first N bytes have the most significant bit (MSB) set to 1xxx xxxx where x are the bits that represent the actual number. The last byte has its MSB set to 0xxx xxxx. How the scheme operates is best seen by example.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0102">For example, the number 1 is stored according to the present scheme as 0000 0001. Normal encoding would be 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001, taking up 4 bytes; as can be seen, the present scheme uses just 1 byte. As another example, the number 1,000 is stored as 1000 0111 0110 1000. Normal encoding would be 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1110 1000, taking up 4 bytes, whereas the present scheme uses just 2 bytes. The number 100,000 is stored as 1000 0110 1000 1101 0010 0000. Normal encoding would be 0000 0000 0000 0001 1000 0110 1010 0000, once again taking up 4 bytes, wherein the present scheme uses just 3 bytes. This technique substantially reduces the log file size, especially as compared to human readable (e.g., XML) or even conventional binary number (4 byte) encoding.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0103">The above-described log file format and the compressed data type enable the system to track very advanced software application usage data about features, failures and faults in a high performance manner that is transparent for the end user. Most of the log data, which are mostly numbers, are directly mapped from a disk representative to an in-memory representation. As a result, the data is very compact and can be loaded and transported very efficiently. Moreover, preferably, the location of the data is very specific and ordered, which facilitates reducing the overall size of the log file. Thus, in an illustrative embodiment, a log file comprises a series of messages. Each message represents some interesting event, such as a feature execution or failure. The messages are preferably formatted with specific formats and field lengths. Variable length fields preferably are prefixed with a field indicating the length of the following field. Numeric fields preferably are variable length but use the above-described data type. As described above, the encoding scheme enables a number to be stored within a binary field.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0104">As previously noted, the hardware and software systems in which the invention is illustrated are merely representative. The invention may be practiced, typically in software, on one or more machines. Generalizing, a machine typically comprises commodity hardware and software, storage (e.g., disks, disk arrays, and the like) and memory (RAM, ROM, and the like). The particular machines used in the network are not a limitation of the present invention. A given machine includes network interfaces and software to connect the machine to a network in the usual manner. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the present invention may be implemented as a managed service (e.g., in an ASP model) using the illustrated set of machines, which are connected or connectable to one or more networks. More generally, the service is provided by an operator using a set of one or more computing-related entities (systems, machines, processes, programs, libraries, functions, or the like) that together facilitate or provide the inventive functionality described above. In a typical implementation, the service comprises a set of one or more computers. A representative machine is a network-based server running commodity (e.g. Pentium-class) hardware, an operating system (e.g., Linux, Windows, OS-X, or the like), an application runtime environment (e.g., Java, .ASP), and a set of applications or processes (e.g., Java applets or servlets, linkable libraries, native code, or the like, depending on platform), that provide the functionality of a given system or subsystem. As described, the service may be implemented in a standalone server, or across a distributed set of machines. Typically, a server connects to the publicly-routable Internet, a corporate intranet, a private network, or any combination thereof, depending on the desired implementation environment.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0105">The hosted service may be implemented in a multi-server cluster environment that is designed to scale efficiently. Each server is designated with a primary and secondary series of tasks. Preferably, one server is dynamically set to be a master server, which server determines the secondary tasks to be performed by all servers. All servers update their existence within a database, and the servers cooperate to determine which server will be the master. The servers in the cluster are assigned tasks (such as log import and event processing) by the master server.</p>
