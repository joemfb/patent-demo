<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present specification generally relates to optical fiber assemblies, and more particularly to optical fiber assemblies including ferrule assemblies and methods of fabricating optical fiber assemblies.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Optical fiber communication systems typically include optical fiber connectors. For instance, one or more optical fiber connectors can be used to join adjacent segments of optical fiber together for creating optical connections that can be connected, disconnected, and/or reconfigured as desired. For instance, one or more optical fiber connectors can be used for joining an optical fiber segment to an optical device or joining two optical fiber segments. Typical optical fiber connectors include a conventional ferrule designed to hold an optical fiber in an appropriate orientation for optically joining the end of the optical fiber segment to an optical interface of an optical device or another optical fiber segment.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional optical ferrule assemblies include one or more optical fibers that typically extend to a front face of a conventional ferrule and may protrude an appropriate distance from the face of the ferrule as desired. In order to provide the desired alignment, the ferrules define a pair of elongate alignment holes that receive and cooperate with respective alignment members, such as guide pins, to accurately align opposing ferrules, and in turn, the optical fibers mounted within the multifiber ferrules. In other words, the ferrule have alignment structure for precisely mating the optical fibers secured with ferrule with a complimentary device for the transmission of optical signals.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Optical fibers have also been arranged into fiber arrays for ease of installation into the optical fiber connectors. One known process of arranging optical fibers into optical fiber arrays is commonly referred to as ribbonization. One common approach for the ribbonization of optical fibers includes the use of tape that is applied along a suitable short length at the ends of the loose optical fibers for maintaining the optical fibers in a desired sequence. In other words, the optical fibers are arranged in the desired sequence at the ends of the fibers and a short piece of tape is applied to the fibers to maintain their position and aid the insertion of the plurality of fibers into the ferrule. By way of example, the ribbonized length maybe about one inch or longer as desired and trimming of the optical fibers and tape may be required to remove any excess length of the ribbonized portion. Such ribbonization of optical fibers can be labor intensive and time-consuming. Thus, there is an unresolved need to quickly and easily arrange optical fibers for insertion into a ferrule of an optical fiber assembly.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one embodiment, a ferrule assembly includes a ferrule comprising a ferrule boot insertion end and a ferrule boot defining an optical fiber channel. A ferrule boot includes an outer shell defining an outer shell channel extending therethrough. The outer shell includes an inner surface, an outer surface, an optical fiber insertion end, and a ferrule insertion end. A heat-activated adhesive liner is positioned within the outer shell channel and coupled to the inner surface of the outer shell. The outer shell is sized to be at least partially inserted into the ferrule boot insertion end. The optical fiber channel is shaped to receive a plurality of optical fibers. The outer shell has a thermal melting point that is greater than a thermal melting point of the heat-activated adhesive liner such that the heat-activated adhesive liner melts to adhere the plurality of optical fibers to the outer shell upon receipt of thermal energy.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another embodiment, an optical fiber assembly includes a plurality of optical fibers, the optical fibers each having an insertion end. A ferrule boot defines an optical fiber channel and includes an outer shell defining an outer shell channel extending therethrough. The outer shell includes an inner surface, an outer surface, an optical fiber insertion end, and a ferrule insertion end. A heat-activated adhesive liner is positioned within the outer shell channel and coupled to the inner surface of the outer shell. The plurality of optical fibers is positioned within the optical fiber channel. The outer shell has a thermal melting point that is greater than a thermal melting point of the heat-activated adhesive liner such that the heat-activated adhesive liner melts to adhere the plurality of optical fibers to the outer shell upon receipt of thermal energy. A ferrule includes a ferrule channel therein and a ferrule boot insertion end. The ferrule insertion end of the ferrule boot is positioned within the ferrule channel at the ferrule boot insertion end of the ferrule. The plurality of optical fibers is secured within the ferrule channel of the ferrule such as by an epoxy or the like. The ferrule boot inhibits epoxy from escaping the ferrule channel of the ferrule.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another embodiment, a method of fabricating an optical fiber assembly is provided. The method includes aligning a plurality of optical fibers in a desired sequence. The plurality of optical fibers is positioned through a ferrule boot. The ferrule boot includes an outer shell defining an outer shell channel extending therethrough. The outer shell includes an inner surface and an outer surface. A heat-activated adhesive liner is positioned within the outer shell channel and coupled to the inner surface of the outer shell. The outer shell has a thermal melting point that is greater than a thermal melting point of the heat-activated adhesive liner. Heat is applied to the ferrule boot such that the heat-activated adhesive liner adheres to the plurality of optical fibers to the outer shell. The plurality of optical fibers is positioned into a ferrule comprising a ferrule boot insertion end such that at least a portion of the outer shell of the ferrule boot is positioned within the ferrule at the ferrule boot insertion end. The plurality of optical fibers is secured in the ferrule.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Embodiments described herein generally relate to optical fiber assemblies that include a ferrule boot that, itself, holds loose optical fibers in place relative to each other during assembly of the optical fiber assembly. The ferrule boot may comprise a preformed, multi-layer construction including an outer shell formed of a non-adhesive material and an adhesive liner positioned within the outer shell that, upon application of thermal energy, melts to adhere the optical fibers to the outer shell thereby holding the optical fibers in an array of optical fibers. The ferrule boot with the optical fibers held in the array may then be inserted or otherwise connected to a ferrule.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an exploded perspective view of an exemplary optical fiber assembly <b>10</b> includes a multifiber ferrule assembly <b>12</b> including a ferrule <b>14</b> and a ferrule boot <b>25</b> that can be connected to the ferrule <b>14</b>. A spring push assembly <b>27</b> can exert a biasing force through the ferrule boot <b>25</b> and on the ferrule <b>14</b>, for example, when a pair of ferrule assemblies are brought into physical contact and mated together. The optical fiber assembly <b>10</b> can comprise various configurations and the concepts disclosed herein are applicable to other suitable optical fiber assemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The multifiber ferrule assembly <b>12</b> includes the ferrule <b>14</b>, which maybe an MT-type multifiber ferrule having a ferrule body <b>16</b> that is generally rectangular in lateral cross-section. Although an MT-type ferrule is illustrated and described herein, the ferrule <b>14</b> need not be an MT-type ferrule and may be any other type of multifiber ferrule. Regardless of the type, the ferrule <b>14</b> extends lengthwise within the multifiber ferrule assembly <b>12</b> between an end face <b>18</b> and an opposed rear face <b>20</b>. In addition, the ferrule body <b>16</b> defines a plurality of bores <b>22</b> exposed through the end face <b>18</b>. The bores <b>22</b> are arranged in a laterally extending linear row for receiving the end portions of respective optical fibers. Although the embodiments of the ferrule <b>14</b> illustrated herein define a total of twelve bores <b>22</b> such that the multifiber ferrule <b>14</b> can be mounted upon the end portions of twelve individual optical fibers, the end face <b>18</b> may have any number of bores, such as 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 or more. In addition, the ferrule <b>14</b> may include more than a single linear row of bores <b>22</b>, such as two or more rows of bores <b>22</b> (e.g., of 12 bores per row). Furthermore, the bores <b>22</b> need not be arranged in one or more laterally extending linear rows. For example, any number of bores <b>22</b> may be arranged in any predetermined pattern on the end face <b>18</b> of the ferrule <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The ferrule body <b>16</b> may also have at least one elongate guide pin hole <b>24</b> also referred to as an alignment hole. The guide pin hole <b>24</b> opens through the end face <b>18</b> and is adapted to receive a respective guide pin <b>26</b> to align the ferrule <b>14</b> with an opposing ferrule of a mating connector. In the exemplary embodiments shown herein, the ferrule body <b>16</b> at least partially defines at least one or a pair of guide pin holes <b>24</b> for receiving respective guide pins <b>26</b>. Each elongate guide pin hole <b>24</b> defined by the ferrule body <b>16</b> may, in turn, define a longitudinal axis extending through the center of the guide pin hole <b>24</b>. The ferrule <b>14</b> is manufactured such that the longitudinal axis of each guide pin hole <b>24</b> is parallel to the bores <b>22</b> extending lengthwise through the ferrule body <b>16</b> and perpendicular to the end face <b>18</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the multifiber ferrule assembly <b>12</b> has a male configuration because the ferrule <b>14</b> is provided with the pair of guide pins <b>26</b> and a guide pin retainer, or pin keeper <b>32</b>. The pin keeper <b>32</b> is positioned adjacent the rear face <b>20</b> of the ferrule body <b>16</b> to secure the guide pins <b>26</b> within the guide pin holes <b>24</b>. In other embodiments, the pin keeper <b>32</b> may not be provided and thus form a female configuration. The guide pins <b>26</b> are secured such that their free ends protrude forwardly from the end face <b>18</b> of the ferrule body <b>16</b> a sufficient distance to engage the guide pin holes of the ferrule of a mating connector, thereby aligning the optical fibers mounted within the respective bores <b>22</b> of the opposing ferrules. The free ends of the guide pins <b>26</b> may be tapered and/or the guide pin holes <b>24</b> may be provided with a lead-in chamfer to facilitate insertion of the guide pins <b>26</b> into the guide pin holes <b>24</b> and to reduce pin stubbing and/or damage to the end face <b>18</b> during mating of the opposing ferrules.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The optical fiber assembly <b>10</b> further includes the ferrule boot <b>25</b> that includes a spring seat <b>34</b> at an optical fiber insertion end <b>35</b> and an optical fiber channel <b>36</b> that extends from the optical fiber insertion end <b>35</b> to a ferrule insertion end <b>37</b> for receiving a plurality of optical fibers. The ferrule boot <b>25</b> includes an outer shell <b>38</b> that is sized to be at least partially inserted into the ferrule <b>14</b> and a liner <b>40</b> positioned within the outer shell <b>38</b>, which may be coupled to an inner surface of the outer shell <b>38</b>, for example, during formation of the ferrule boot <b>25</b>, which will be described in greater detail below. The ferrule boot <b>25</b> may maintained within the ferrule <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) using any suitable connection such as by a snap fit, an interference fit, an adhesive or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The ferrule boot <b>25</b> is positioned adjacent the rear face <b>20</b> of the ferrule body <b>16</b>, between the ferrule <b>14</b> and a coil spring <b>42</b> (or other suitable biasing member) of the spring push assembly <b>27</b>. In some embodiment the ferrule <b>14</b> may include a ferrule boot insertion stop that locates the ferrule boot <b>25</b> in the ferrule <b>14</b>. The optical fiber channel <b>36</b> extending through the ferrule boot <b>25</b> allows end portions of the optical fibers to pass through the ferrule boot <b>25</b> to the rear face <b>20</b> of the ferrule <b>14</b>. In some embodiments, the ferrule boot <b>25</b> includes a forward portion <b>44</b> that engages and retains the pin keeper <b>32</b> between the ferrule boot <b>25</b> and the ferrule <b>14</b>, and thereby securing the guide pins <b>26</b> within the guide pin holes <b>24</b> of the ferrule <b>14</b>. The plurality of optical fibers is secured within a ferrule channel of the ferrule <b>14</b> by an epoxy or the like. The ferrule boot <b>25</b> can inhibit the epoxy from escaping the ferrule channel of the ferrule <b>14</b>. The spring seat <b>34</b> may engage the forward-most coil of the coil spring <b>42</b>. A force centering element <b>45</b> may be provided at the spring seat <b>34</b> that is used to engage the coil spring <b>42</b>. The force centering element <b>45</b> may also include a spring cup interface portion that facilitates alignment of the coil spring <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The coil spring <b>42</b> is positioned between the spring seat <b>34</b> of the ferrule boot <b>25</b> and a spring push <b>46</b>. An opening <b>48</b> extending lengthwise through the coil spring <b>42</b> permits a lead-in tube <b>50</b> and/or portions of the optical fibers (not shown) to pass through the coil spring <b>42</b> toward the rear face <b>20</b> of the ferrule <b>14</b>. The coil spring <b>42</b> may be a conventional helical spring having dead coils with ground ends in certain embodiments and open coils in other embodiments. The compressive force of the coil spring <b>42</b> may vary depending on the type of fiber optic connector and multifiber ferrule, but preferably is in the range of about 9-11 Newtons. The spring push <b>46</b> comprises a forward portion <b>52</b> for engaging the rearward most coil of the coil spring <b>42</b>, and thereby retaining the coil spring <b>42</b> against the force of the spring seat <b>34</b>. The spring push <b>46</b> further includes a rearward portion <b>54</b> that defines a crimp body <b>56</b> for securing the strength members of a fiber optic cable (not shown) to the spring push <b>46</b>. The lead-in tube <b>50</b> may be positioned within an opening <b>58</b> of the spring push <b>46</b>, the opening <b>48</b> of the coil spring <b>42</b> and/or the optical fiber channel <b>36</b> of the ferrule boot <b>25</b>. In other embodiments, a lead-in tube <b>50</b> may not be provided. An opening <b>60</b> extending lengthwise through the lead-in tube <b>50</b>, when provided, receives and guides the optical fibers into the respective bores <b>22</b> of the ferrule <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the ferrule <b>14</b> and guide pins <b>26</b>, the pin keeper <b>32</b>, the ferrule boot <b>25</b>, the coil spring <b>42</b>, the forward portion <b>52</b> of the spring push <b>46</b> and the lead-in tube <b>50</b> may be positioned within a connector housing <b>62</b>. Flexible arms <b>63</b> provided on spring push <b>46</b> depend lengthwise from the forward portion <b>52</b> to engage openings <b>64</b> formed in the connector housing <b>62</b> to secure the spring push <b>46</b> to the connector housing <b>62</b>. A forward mechanical stop (not visible) is provided on the interior surface of the connector housing <b>62</b> so that the ferrule <b>14</b> is movably disposed within the connector housing <b>62</b>, but is biased in the forward direction by the coil spring <b>42</b> and the ferrule boot <b>25</b>. The ferrule boot <b>25</b> may stop against an internal geometry location <b>65</b> within the ferrule <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the forward portion <b>44</b> of the exemplary ferrule boot <b>25</b> is shown in isolation. The ferrule boot <b>25</b> has a generally rectangular cross-section and includes an upper wall <b>66</b>, a lower wall <b>68</b> and sidewalls <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> that together form the outer shell <b>38</b> and an outer shell channel <b>74</b>, but other cross-sectional shapes are possible. The liner <b>40</b> extends along the inner surface <b>41</b> of the outer shell <b>38</b> and along each of the upper wall <b>66</b>, lower wall <b>68</b> and sidewalls <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> defining the optical fiber channel <b>36</b>. In other embodiments, the liner may extend along only some of the walls, such as only the upper wall <b>66</b> and the lower wall <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the ferrule boot <b>25</b> may be formed using any suitable process, such as a co-extrusion process <b>80</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a tank <b>82</b> contains a hot melt adhesive product that will be used to form the liner <b>40</b> of the ferrule boot <b>25</b>. The adhesive product may be added to the tank <b>82</b> in any suitable form, such as granules, powder, etc. and can be liquefied there using a heating device <b>84</b>. The adhesive product may also be added to the tank <b>82</b> already in liquid form and maintained in liquid form using the heating device <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The liquefied adhesive product may be transferred from the tank <b>82</b> to a metering pump <b>86</b>. From the metering pump <b>86</b>, the adhesive product may be transferred to an extrusion device <b>88</b>, which can have any suitable configuration, such as a single or double screw extruder.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Another tank <b>90</b> contains a non-adhesive material that will be used to form the outer shell <b>38</b> of the ferrule boot <b>25</b>. The non-adhesive material can be added to the tank <b>90</b> in the form of granules, powder, etc., and can be liquefied there by means of a heating device <b>92</b>. The non-adhesive material also can be added to the tank <b>90</b> already in liquid form and kept there in a liquid state using the heating device <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The liquefied non-adhesive product may be transferred from the tank <b>90</b> to a metering pump <b>93</b>. From the metering pump <b>93</b>, the non-adhesive product may be transferred to the extrusion device <b>88</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The extruded product <b>94</b> may continuously issue from the extrusion device <b>88</b> and consists of the adhesive product from the tank <b>82</b> and the non-adhesive outer shell <b>38</b> from the tank <b>90</b> enveloping the adhesive product. The co-extruded product may then be conveyed to a cooling device <b>96</b>, for example, composed of a passage containing water or other cooling material. The extruded product <b>94</b> may then be dried and cut to a desired length at a cutting device <b>98</b> to form the ferrule boot <b>25</b>. Any other suitable work or secondary processing may be done to the extruded product, such as machining to form various features.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The adhesive material may be a hot melt adhesive and the outer shell <b>38</b> maybe formed of any suitable material such as flexible polyolefin, modified fluoroelastomer, or PVC. The outer shell <b>38</b> may be formed of a material having a thermal melting point that is greater than a thermal melting point of the material forming the heat-activated adhesive liner <b>40</b> such that the heat-activated adhesive liner <b>40</b> melts to adhere the plurality of optical fibers to the outer shell <b>38</b> of ferrule boot <b>25</b> upon receipt of thermal energy. The term &#x201c;hot melt adhesive&#x201d; is used herein generically to refer to both conventional and low application temperature hot melt adhesive, unless otherwise indicated. Low temperature hot melt adhesive and low application temperature hot melt adhesive are used interchangeably herein and refer to an adhesive which can be processed at temperatures below about 350&#xb0; F. to as low as about 150&#xb0; F. Various exemplary hot melt adhesives include those adhesives prepared from polymers and copolymers of synthetic resins, rubbers, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyurethane, acrylics, vinyl acetate, ethylene vinyl acetate and polyvinyl alcohol. More specific examples include hot melt adhesives prepared from rubber polymers such as block copolymers of monovinyl aromatic hydrocarbons and a conjugated diene, e.g., styrene-butadiene, styrenebutadiene-styrene, styrene-isoprene-styrene, styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene and styrene-ethylene propylene-styrene; ethylene-vinyl acetate polymers, other ethylene esters and copolymers, e.g., ethylene methacrylate, ethylene n-butyl acrylate and ethylene acrylic acid; polyolefins such as polyethylene and polypropylene; polyvinyl acetate and random copolymers thereof; polyacrylates; polyamides; polyesters; polyvinyl alcohols and copolymers thereof; polyurethanes; polystyrenes; polyepoxides; graft copolymers of vinyl monomer(s) and polyalkylene oxide polymers; and aldehyde containing resins such as phenol-aldehyde, urea-aldehyde, melamine-aldehyde and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Adhesives may be formulated with tackifying resins in order to improve adhesion and introduce tack into the adhesive. Such resins include, among other materials, natural and modified rosins, polyterpene resins, phenolic modified hydrocarbon resins, coumarone-indene resins, aliphatic and aromatic petroleum hydrocarbon resins, phthalate esters and hydrogenated hydrocarbons, hydrogenated rosins and hydrogenated rosin esters.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Optional ingredients include diluents, e.g., liquid polybutene or polypropylene, petroleum waxes such as paraffin and microcrystalline waxes, polyethylene greases, hydrogenated animal, fish and vegetable fats, mineral oil and synthetic waxes as well as hydrocarbon oils such as naphthionic or paraffinic mineral oils, stabilizers, colorants and fillers.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, once the ferrule boot <b>25</b> is formed, a plurality of optical fibers <b>100</b>, each having an insertion end <b>102</b> maybe inserted through the optical fiber channel <b>36</b> of the ferrule boot <b>25</b>. Prior to inserting the optical fibers <b>100</b>, the methods may further include the step of processing the plurality of optical fibers <b>100</b>. Processing can include cutting and/or polishing end portions of the optical fibers <b>100</b>. In one example, the step of processing end portions includes cutting and polishing the plurality of optical fibers <b>100</b> with a laser beam of a laser in one or more steps. For instance, separate steps may be used for cutting and polishing optical fibers <b>100</b> with a laser, but cutting and polishing may also occur in one step with the laser. Any suitable type of laser and/or mode of operation for the laser is possible. By way of example, the laser may be a CO<sub>2 </sub>laser operating in the pulse, continuous, or other suitable mode. The angle between the laser beam and optical fibers <b>100</b> may also be adjusted to produce the desired angle on the ends of optical fibers <b>100</b> such as 12 degrees, 8 degrees, or flat. Of course, mechanical methods for cutting and/or polishing optical fibers are also possible.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A work holder or alignment track fixture (not shown) may be used for proper placement of the plurality of optical fibers <b>100</b> into the optical fiber channel <b>36</b>. In some embodiments, another work holder may be used to fix the position of the ferrule boot <b>25</b> as the optical fibers <b>100</b> are inserted. Once the plurality of optical fibers <b>100</b> are positioned in the optical fiber channel <b>36</b>, heat may be applied (e.g., to the outside of the ferrule boot <b>25</b>) to activate the adhesive liner <b>40</b>. The adhesive material then encapsulates the optical fibers <b>100</b> and solidifies, holding the optical fibers <b>100</b> in the correct orientation in the array. In some embodiments, cladding <b>104</b> of the optical fibers <b>100</b> may be removed at the ferrule boot <b>25</b> (e.g., at a location within, and/or before the ferrule boot before or after the heating process) thereby exposing cores <b>106</b> of the optical fibers <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Other variations of ferrule boots employing the concepts disclosed herein are also possible. While a rectangular-shaped ferrule boot <b>25</b> is described above, other ferrule boot shapes and features may be provided. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, another embodiment of a ferrule boot <b>110</b> having a generally round cross-section. The ferrule boot <b>110</b> includes an outer shell <b>112</b> and an adhesive liner <b>114</b> formed along an inner surface <b>116</b> of the outer shell <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Beside different shapes ferrule boots can also include other suitable structures. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, another embodiment of a ferrule boot <b>120</b> is rectangular in cross-section and includes one or more stop structures or pins <b>122</b> extending upwardly from its upper wall <b>124</b>. In some embodiments, pins <b>122</b> may be provided at any of the walls <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> and <b>130</b>. The pins <b>122</b> may mate in corresponding slots in the ferrule to locate and position the ferrule boot <b>120</b> in the ferrule. The pins may be formed using any suitable secondary process, such as machining, molding, bonding, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, another embodiment of a ferrule boot <b>140</b> includes stop structures <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> for controlling the insertion depth of the ferrule boot into the ferrule. In this embodiment, the stop structures <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> are located at an upper wall <b>146</b> and at a lower wall <b>148</b>. The stop structures <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> may extend the entire or only a portion of the width of the ferrule boot <b>140</b>. The stop structures <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> may be used to locate the ferrule boot <b>140</b> within the ferrule, to provide a seating location for the spring <b>42</b> and/or to provide a seating location for the pin keeper <b>32</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates another embodiment of a ferrule boot <b>150</b> where stop structures <b>152</b> and <b>154</b> are located at sidewalls <b>156</b> and <b>158</b>. The stop structures may be formed using any suitable secondary process, such as machining, molding, bonding, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, in another embodiment, a ferrule boot <b>160</b> includes a forward extending portion <b>162</b> having an outer dimension that is less than an outer dimension of a rearward extending portion <b>164</b>. This can provide a step down surface <b>166</b> that can be used in positioning the ferrule boot <b>160</b> in the ferrule. For example, the optical fiber insertion end of the rearward extending portion <b>164</b> of outer shell <b>168</b> may contact the ferrule boot insertion end of the ferrule (e.g., at the step down surface <b>166</b>) when the ferrule boot <b>25</b> is positioned within the ferrule.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As mentioned above, the adhesive liner of the ferrule boot, as formed, may not extend over all of the walls of the outer shell. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, another exemplary ferrule boot <b>170</b> includes an outer shell <b>172</b> formed of the non-adhesive material as described above and an adhesive liner <b>174</b>. In this embodiment, the adhesive liner <b>174</b> extends along inner surface <b>176</b> of an upper wall <b>178</b> and along inner surface <b>180</b> of a lower wall <b>182</b>. Sidewalls <b>184</b> and <b>186</b> have no adhesive liner material, as formed and prior to the application of heat to melt the adhesive liner <b>174</b>. In these embodiments, a width of the outer shell channel may be sized such that the sidewalls <b>184</b> and <b>186</b> substantially contact one or more of the plurality of optical fibers <b>100</b> inserted into the optical fiber channel.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The above-described ferrule boots can hold optical fiber arrays together, which can reduce any reworking need and scrap due to delamination. The ferrule boots can eliminate the use of tapes and other bonding substrates commonly used to ribbonize the array of optical fibers by providing a preformed adhesive liner within the ferrule boots that can be melted upon application of thermal energy. Additionally, there is no need for use of razor blades or other sharp objects in removing excess tape. The ferrule boots can work for a variety of fiber arrays such as between 2 and 24 optical fibers and multiple fiber rows. The ferrule boots can also serve as a reference point for downstream processes such as stripping cladding.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the embodiments described herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the claimed subject matter. Thus, it is intended that the specification cover the modifications and variations of the various embodiments described herein, provided such modification and variations come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
