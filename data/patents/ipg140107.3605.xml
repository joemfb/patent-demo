<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a) to Korean patent application Serial No. 10-2010-0117855, which was filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Nov. 25, 2010, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to a Digital Pre-Distorter (DPD) of a power amplifier, and more particularly, to a method and an apparatus for improving stability and performance of a DPD by adding a Saturation Level Limiter (SLL) to the DPD and preventing saturation of an output peak signal of a power amplifier.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a conventional digital pre-distortion system utilizing a digital linearization.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a Digital Pre-Distorter (DPD) <b>110</b> of a digital unit <b>100</b> compares an input signal with an output signal in order to linearize an output of a power amplifier <b>120</b>, minimizes a distortion component of an output signal, and allows an input modulation signal to be linearly amplified.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To perform extraction of a distortion component of the power amplifier <b>120</b> and perform a correction algorithm of a corrector <b>135</b> for an operation of the DPD <b>110</b>, an input signal representing an entire signal and an output signal thereto are required. That is, the corrector <b>135</b> receives an input signal and an output signal of a down-converter <b>130</b>, and provides a coefficient for digital pre-distortion to the DPD <b>110</b>. Basically, the coefficient sets the DPD <b>110</b> gain such that the overall combination response of the power amplifier <b>120</b> and the DPD <b>110</b> becomes a linear system. This means that the DPD <b>110</b> is actually acting as an inverse power amplifier non-linearity pre-equalizer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An up-converter <b>115</b> up-converts an output signal of the DPD <b>110</b> to provide the up-converted signal to the power amplifier <b>120</b>, and the down-converter <b>130</b> down-converts an output signal of an attenuator <b>125</b>, which attenuates an output signal of the power amplifier <b>120</b> by a predetermined level, to provide the down-converted signal to the corrector <b>135</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a conventional power amplifier and a conventional power amplifier in a digital pre-distortion transmission system. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a conventional power amplifier <b>150</b> with no digital pre-distortion operation applied to the input thereof and a power amplifier <b>120</b> with digital a digital pre-distortion operation applied to the input thereof by DPD <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">When the gains of power amplifiers <b>150</b> and <b>120</b> are normalized to 1, input/output characteristics for ports <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a graph illustrating input/output characteristics of the conventional digital amplifiers illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a solid line A represents the input/output characteristics ([1]:[2] before linearization, [3]:[4] after linearization) of the power amplifiers <b>150</b> and <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">When an inverse function of these input/output characteristics is determined, a curve like a dotted line C is obtained. This curve represents input/output characteristics ([1]:[3]) of the DPD. When an input signal [1] is applied, an output signal of the DPD becomes [3]. An output signal of the power amplifier to which the signal [3] has been input becomes a signal [4] that has been linearized for the signal [1].</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A solid line B represents an input/output characteristic [1]:[4] of a system after linearization. A saturation power level P<sub>OUT</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>sat </sub>of the power amplifier may be known via a power amplifier input/output signal [3]:[4] after linearization.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The saturation power level P<sub>OUT</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>sat </sub>of the power amplifier is a value whose gain has dropped down by G<sub>comp </sub>(gain compression) compared to an output value when distortion of the power amplifier does not exist.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Examination of X-axis of a solid line B via the saturation power level P<sub>OUT</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>sat </sub>of the power amplifier shows a system linearization input threshold P<sub>IN</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>th </sub>(input power threshold value) that can be linearized. In a system input value of more than the P<sub>IN</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>th</sub>, an output after linearization is saturated like the solid line B.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Upon occurrence of a saturation phenomenon, when linearization iteration time of the DPD is increased, a saturation phenomenon of the power amplifier increases like a dotted line of the end portion of the solid line A.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Due to this, the DPD obtains a more accurate inverse function and so has a steeper slope in a region exceeding P<sub>IN</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>th </sub>as in the dotted line C (DPD input/output characteristics) of the drawing.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a graph illustrating input/output characteristics of the conventional digital amplifiers illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when a system input value of P<sub>IN</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>th </sub>or more is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when the system input value P<sub>IN </sub>becomes a linearization input threshold value P<sub>IN</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>th</sub>, an input greater than or equal to a saturation input power level P<sub>IN</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>PA</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>sat </sub>is applied to the power amplifier by an output of the DPD. Accordingly, an output of the power amplifier after the linearization is saturated.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">When an inverse function is determined via input/output characteristics of the saturated power amplifier, DPD output values steeply rise in a region exceeding P<sub>IN</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>th</sub>, as illustrated in the dotted line C of the drawing.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Accordingly, an input value of the power amplifier increases again, and this process iterates, such that a saturation region of the amplifier continues to expand.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">When an input value of the amplifier continues to rise, an average input power of the amplifier increases, and consequently, an average output power of the amplifier increases and a divergence phenomenon is caused, creating instability in the digital pre-distortion transmission system.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As described above, in a conventional digital pre-distortion system, when an input greater than a predetermined level is given, an input peak level of a power amplifier gradually increases, when saturation occurs at the power amplifier. Consequently, an average output power rises, causing a divergence phenomenon.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The divergence phenomenon has a very bad influence on the stability and performance of a secure transmission system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A digital unit <b>200</b> includes a Peak Level Detector (PLD) <b>214</b> that detects a peak level of an output signal of the power amplifier <b>220</b>. To prevent saturation of the power amplifier <b>220</b> via the PLD <b>214</b>, a Saturation Level Limiter (SLL) <b>215</b> is added the DPD <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">When rated power is applied to the system, the PLD <b>214</b> operates.

<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a digital pre-distortion operation according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when a system operation starts, an input signal is applied to a DPD in step <b>410</b>. The DPD captures an input/output signal required for digital pre-distortion adaptation in step <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The DPD determines an output power P<sub>OUT </sub>via the captured signal in step <b>430</b>. When the output power P<sub>OUT </sub>is equal to or greater than a desired rated level in step <b>440</b>, a PLD and an SLL are operated.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">More specifically, when the output power P<sub>OUT </sub>is greater than or equal to a desired rated level in step <b>440</b>, the PLD sets a captured peak value of an output power as P<sub>out</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>sat</sub>, and determines a gain reduction G<sub>comp </sub>upon saturation for this value in step <b>450</b>. The gain reduction G<sub>comp </sub>upon saturation may be easily determined via a ratio of an input/output gain upon P<sub>out</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>sat </sub>output over an average input/output gain. P<sub>out</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>sat </sub>continues to increase as iteration time of the DPD increases, and has a constant value when saturation occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In step <b>460</b>, the PLD determines a limiting threshold value V<sub>th </sub>to be used by the SLL, based on P<sub>out</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>sat </sub>and G<sub>comp</sub>. When the limiting threshold value V<sub>th </sub>is determined, in step <b>470</b>, the DPD operates the SLL to prevent saturation of a power amplifier by limiting an input of the power amplifier to be no greater than the threshold value. That is, when a peak signal for an output signal of the power amplifier is detected by the PLD, and the SLL is operated using a value obtained by dividing the peak signal by G<sub>comp </sub>(gain reduction upon saturation), i.e., P<sub>out</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>sat</sub>/G<sub>comp </sub>P as the limiting threshold value V<sub>th</sub>, a value of no greater than V<sub>th </sub>is applied to the power amplifier.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">An adaptive control operation of the DPD is performed in step <b>480</b>, and the above operation iterates until the procedure ends in step <b>490</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Using the method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a power transmission system may perform stable linearization without divergence by saturation and input.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Alternatively, the limiting threshold value may be an arbitrary value.</p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a graph illustrating input/output characteristics of the amplifiers illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, when a saturation level limiter is used, according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, when a peak signal for an output signal of a power amplifier is detected by a PLD, and an SLL is operated using a value obtained by dividing the peak signal by G<sub>comp </sub>(gain reduction upon saturation), i.e., P<sub>out</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>sat</sub>/G<sub>comp </sub>as the limiting threshold value V<sub>th</sub>, a value no greater than V<sub>th </sub>is applied to the power amplifier.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Consequently, a saturation state operation of the power amplifier may be prevented, and because the DPD does not use a saturation value as an inverse function, a phenomenon that an input value of the power amplifier increases may be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Through this operation, application of an input of the amplifier to a non-linear region may be prevented as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, such that a stable digital pre-distortion power transmission system without a saturation operation may be realized.</p>
