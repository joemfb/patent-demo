<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a National Stage of International Application No. PCT/JP2010/000853 filed Feb. 12, 2010, claiming priority based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-042210 filed Feb. 25, 2009, the contents of all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to capacitor producing methods for producing thin-film capacitors, capacitor producing devices, capacitor producing programs and recording media.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Printed circuit boards mounting semiconductor elements are fabricated with numerous capacitors on the periphery of each LSI (Large Scale Integration) chip to prevent noise. When a rapid load i is imparted to an LSI chip due to a clock operation, a voltage drop &#x394;V occurs owing to resistance R and inductance L, which exist in lines between the power source and the LSI chip, in accordance with Equation (1) as follows.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x394;<i>V=R&#xd7;i&#x2212;L&#xd7;di/dt</i>&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The reason why the sign of L is minus (&#x2212;) is that an induced electromotive force occurs to cancel out a current instantly occurred. Therefore, the voltage drop &#x394;V increases as R and L of lines and a load fluctuation di increase, or as a varying time dt decreases. Recently, LSI chips have advanced so that they can operate at high-speed clock frequencies, which exceed several hundreds Mega-hertz. That is, the voltage drop &#x394;V increases when a rise time tr decreases as the clock frequency increases since the rise time tr of a pulse waveform in a digital circuit is equivalent to the load varying time dt.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As a measure to reduce the voltage drop &#x394;V, it is an effective measure to juxtapose capacitors between the power line and the ground line of an LSI chip. These capacitors are generally called decoupling capacitors. Since an increased clock frequency of an LSI chip makes it difficult to timely compensate for a temporary voltage drop due to load fluctuation by way of the power source, decoupling capacitors, juxtaposed with an LSI chip, are used to supply electric charge so as to compensate for a voltage drop of the LSI chip. However, &#x394;V according to Equation (1) has still occurred under influences of equivalent series resistance (ESR) and equivalent series inductance (ESL) of capacitors, wiring resistance R and wiring inductance L between each capacitor and each LSI chip.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Recently, high clock frequencies increased in the GHz order leads to a problem in that inductance L of wiring between decoupling capacitors and an LSI chip cannot be ignored. To solve this problem, some documents (e.g. Patent Documents 1 to 6) disclose interposer capacitors as techniques of reducing L. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows the structure of an interposer capacitor disclosed in Patent Document 3.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a silicon substrate <b>100</b> includes a first through-hole <b>120</b><i>a </i>whose inside space is filled with a conductor. On a support member <b>110</b> composed of the substrate <b>100</b>, a bottom electrode <b>140</b>, a high dielectric film <b>160</b>, and a top electrode <b>180</b> are laminated together to form a capacitor. The bottom electrode <b>140</b> of the capacitor is connected to an electrode pad <b>240</b><i>a </i>and a bump electrode <b>280</b><i>a </i>via the conductor of the through-hole <b>120</b><i>a</i>. The bump electrode <b>280</b><i>a </i>is connected to a power line of a circuit board. Additionally, the bottom electrode <b>140</b> is connected to a power line of an LSI chip via an electrode pad <b>210</b><i>a</i>. The top electrode <b>180</b> of the capacitor is connected to an electrode pad <b>240</b><i>b </i>and a bump electrode <b>280</b><i>b </i>via a conductor filled in the inside space of a through-hole <b>120</b><i>b</i>. The bump electrode <b>280</b><i>b </i>is connected to a ground line of the circuit board. Additionally, the top electrode <b>180</b> is connected to the ground line of the LSI chip via an electrode pad <b>210</b><i>b</i>. The electrode pads <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b</i>, <b>240</b><i>a</i>, <b>240</b><i>b </i>are formed on protective films <b>200</b> and <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Capacitors with the &#x3bc;F order of high capacitance, which meet the GHz order of high-speed processing of LSI chips, need large areas equivalent to areas of LSI chips; however, a problem arises owing to difficulty in forming large-area capacitors using thin films. This is because large-area capacitors, equivalent to the size of an LSI chip, suffer from a problem in that short-circuits may occur due to defects of dielectric films when particles occur in deposition processes. To solve this problem, some documents (e.g. Patent Document 7) disclose specific techniques regarding capacitors whose dielectric layers are composed of anodic oxidation films easily facilitating large-area capacitors. However, another problem arises in the technique of Patent Document 7 in that capacitance of capacitors cannot be increased due to a small dielectric constant of an anodic oxidation film than a dielectric constant of an oxidation thin film having a perovskite structure.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As the method of detecting defects in wires and diffused layers of semiconductor devices, some documents (e.g. Patent Document 8) disclose a method of measuring resistance variation, wherein they refer to the actual utilization of OBIRCH (Optical Beam Induced Resistance Change) analysis. OBIRCH analysis has been used for defects analysis on semiconductor devices and finished products of capacitors, whereas it can be used to detect short-circuits between top electrodes and bottom electrodes of capacitors.</p>

<heading id="h-0011" level="1">MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Hereinafter, various embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the drawings. Herein, the same elements are designated by the same reference numerals; hence, descriptions thereof will be omitted here.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">(Embodiment 1)</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a method for producing a thin-film capacitor according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention. In this illustration, the thin-film capacitor of the present embodiment includes a top electrode <b>1</b>, a thin-film dielectric <b>2</b>, a bottom electrode <b>3</b>, and a substrate <b>4</b>. For instance, it is preferable that material of the top electrode <b>1</b> be selected from among Pt, Ru, TiN and Au. However, the top electrode is not restricted to these materials.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">For instance, it is preferable that the material of the thin-film dielectric <b>2</b> be selected from compounds including a perovskite structure with a high dielectric constant. As a compound including a perovskite structure, it is preferable to employ a composite perovskite compound, having an average valence of two in an A site, in which a Pb, Ba site (A site) is partly replaced with Sr, Ca or La in a skeletal structure composed of SiTiO3, (Sr, Ba)TiO3 partly replacing Sr with Ba in SrTiO3, PbTiO3, or BaTiO3. Additionally, it is possible to employ a composite perovskite compound, having an average valence of four in a B site, in which Ti (B site) is partly replaced with Mg, W, Nb, Zr, Ni or Zn in the foregoing compound. However, material of the thin-film dielectric <b>2</b> is not necessarily limited to these materials. A producing method of the thin-film dielectric <b>2</b> is not necessarily limited to a specific method, wherein it is preferable to adopt a sputtering method, a CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) method, or a sol-gel method.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It is preferable that material of the bottom electrode <b>3</b> be selected from among metals or alloys with a high adhesion with the substrate <b>4</b> and with a low diffusion into the thin-film dielectric <b>2</b>. For instance, it is preferable to sequentially deposit active metals such as Ti, Cr, Ta, and Mo or high-barrier metals such as Pt, Ru, TiN, Au on an insulating substrate. However, the material is not restricted thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Preferably, the substrate <b>4</b> should be composed of a substrate with a high surface fineness facilitating deposition of a thin-film capacitor. It is preferable to employ a semiconductor substrate composed of Si, GaAs or an insulating substrate composed of sapphire, ceramic, or resins. When the substrate <b>4</b> is made using a semiconductor substrate composed of Si, and GaAs, it is preferable to form an insulating layer on the surface of the substrate <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The present embodiment will be described with respect to a method of producing a thin-film capacitor with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>), the bottom electrode <b>3</b>, the thin-film dielectric <b>2</b>, and the top electrode <b>1</b>, which are assembled into an MIM (Metal Insulation Metal) structure, are deposited on the substrate <b>4</b>. Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>c</i>), it is determined whether or not a particle <b>5</b> or a defect, such as electrical short-circuit between the top electrode <b>1</b> and the bottom electrode <b>3</b>, exists on the entire surface of a wafer. Detection methods are not specifically limited, but OBIRCH or the like is preferable. Optical detection can be adopted on particles; however, as a detection method of electrical short-circuit, it is preferable to employ a resistance variation measuring method using laser scanning with OBIRCH analysis or the like. As show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>b</i>), an exposed portion of the bottom electrode <b>3</b> needs to be formed at an edge of a wafer for the purpose of probing in resistance measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>d</i>), the particle <b>5</b> or a defect such as electrical short-circuit between the top electrode <b>1</b> and the bottom electrode <b>3</b>, which is specified in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>c</i>), is locally removed from the wafer. Removing methods are not specifically limited, but it is possible to employ laser, ion beam, electron beams, and wet etching as well as mechanical processing such as drilling and sand-blasting. Particularly, it is preferable to employ laser processing. Through the foregoing processes, it is possible to produce the capacitor shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>e</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Local removal of a defect shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>d</i>) will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a method of producing a thin-film capacitor of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the MIM deposition processing shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a decision is made as to whether or not probing needs to be performed (step S<b>201</b>). In order to perform probing (YES in step S<b>201</b>), a wafer edge is processed to expose the bottom electrode <b>3</b> (step S<b>202</b>). When probing is not needed (NO in step S<b>201</b>), or after the wafer edge is processed in step S<b>202</b>, an inspection is performed to detect defects in capacitors (step S<b>203</b>). For instance, defects of capacitors are detected in accordance with a resistance variation measurement technique adopting laser scanning such as OBIRCH analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Next, a decision is made as to whether or not defects are included in capacitors based on the detection result of step S<b>203</b> (step S<b>204</b>). When defects are found in capacitors (YES in step S<b>204</b>), defects are locally removed via etching (step S<b>205</b>). After that, the flow proceeds to step S<b>203</b>; subsequently, the foregoing steps S<b>203</b> to S<b>205</b> are repeated until no defect is left in capacitors. On the other hand, when no defect is found in capacitors (NO in step S<b>204</b>), the flow proceeds to capacitor cell production.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The foregoing description refers to an example of local removal processing for locally removing defects from capacitors, in which the local removal processing is carried out every time defects are detected in capacitors. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows another method in which detected defects are temporarily stored in memory, and then all the defects stored in memory are collectively subjected to the local removal processing.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the MIM deposition processing shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a decision is made as to whether or not probing needs to be performed (step S<b>301</b>). In order to perform probing (YES in step S<b>301</b>), a wafer edge is processed to expose the bottom electrode <b>3</b> (step S<b>302</b>). When probing is not needed (NO in step S<b>301</b>), or after the wafer edge is processed in step S<b>302</b>, an inspection is performed to detect defects in capacitors. For instance, defects of capacitors are detected in accordance with a resistance variation measurement method adopting laser scanning such as OBIRCH. The defect detection of step S<b>303</b> differs from the foregoing defect detection of step S<b>202</b> in that all the defects included in capacitors are collectively detected, so that defects information representing positional data of defects is saved in the memory (step S<b>304</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">After completion of the defect detection of step S<b>303</b>, defects are locally removed via etching (step S<b>305</b>) based on the defects information, which is saved in memory in step S<b>304</b>. Subsequently, the flow proceeds to capacitor cell production.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The present embodiment makes it possible to locally remove defects, whereby capacitors, whose defects have been already removed, are formed at desired positions, so that it is possible to form non-defective capacitors. Even when defects such as short-circuits remain on a wafer after MIM deposition, it is possible to locally remove those defects before capacitors are divided into capacitor cells, whereby it is possible to produce thin-film capacitors at a good production yield in the subsequent formation of capacitor cells.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">(Embodiment 2)</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an example of defects analysis on a wafer with a thin-film capacitor subjected to MIM deposition according to Embodiment 2 of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> show exemplary layouts for forming thin-film capacitors in accordance with the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a method of producing thin-film capacitors according to the present embodiment. Next, the method of producing thin-film capacitors according to the present embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an MIM capacitor formed on the entire surface of a wafer, in which electrical short-circuits <b>6</b> are detected between the top electrode <b>1</b> and the bottom electrode <b>3</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows positioning of capacitor cells produced using a mask, whose center is placed to match the center of a wafer having the MIM capacitor shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> with reference to a predetermined position <b>9</b> for forming an alignment mark. In this figure, the short-circuits <b>6</b> are detected inside predetermined positions <b>8</b> for forming capacitor cells surrounded by capacitor-chip peripheral positions <b>7</b>, and they act as defectiveness after formation of capacitor cells.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">For this reason, the method of producing thin-film capacitors according to the present embodiment is designed to optimize positions of capacitor cells formed based on positions of the short-circuits <b>6</b> detected in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, whereby capacitor cells are produced using a mask which is placed to match optimized positions thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an exemplary layout for forming capacitor cells using a mask which is placed to match optimized positions. Unlike the layout of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, capacitor cells are formed using a mask which is placed to match optimized positions with reference to an alignment mark <b>12</b>, wherein none of the short-circuits <b>6</b> exists in modified capacitor-cell forming positions <b>11</b>. The present embodiment is described such that none of the short-circuits <b>6</b> exist in the capacitor-cell forming positions <b>11</b> (or capacitor cells) surrounded by capacitor-chip peripheral positions <b>10</b> after optimization of the positioning of a mask. Even when short-circuits remain in capacitor-cell forming positions, it is possible to reduce (minimize) the number of short-circuits left in capacitor cells; hence, it is possible to improve a yield in producing capacitors. In the foregoing capacitor producing method, it is effective to form the alignment mark <b>12</b>, which makes it possible to easily adjust the positioning of a mask after optimization.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The foregoing capacitor producing method will be further described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In the MIM deposition, a decision is made as to whether or not probing needs to be performed (step S<b>701</b>). In order to perform probing (YES in step S<b>701</b>), a wafer edge is processed to expose the bottom electrode <b>3</b> (step S<b>702</b>). When probing is not needed (NO in step S<b>701</b>), or after the wafer edge is processed in step S<b>702</b>, an inspection is performed to detect defects in capacitors (step S<b>703</b>), so that defects information representing positional data of detected defects is saved in memory (step S<b>704</b>). For instance, defects of capacitors are detected in step S<b>703</b> in accordance with a resistance variation measurement method adopting laser scanning such as OBIRCH analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">After completion of defect detection in step S<b>703</b>, positions of capacitor cells are optimized in a wafer (step S<b>705</b>) so that no defect will exist in capacitor cells. Then, the flow proceeds to capacitor cell production.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">That present embodiment is designed to specify defects after MIM deposition on a wafer and to thereby optimize positions of capacitor cells, i.e. positions at which capacitor cells are to be formed, thus making it possible to form non-defective capacitors. Thus, it is possible to improve a yield in producing thin-film capacitor cells.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">(Embodiment 3)</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows Embodiment 3 of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows an example in which short-circuits still remain in capacitor cells after optimization of the positioning of a mask based on optimized positions of capacitor cells like Embodiment 2. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a capacitor producing method adapted to the situation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The capacitor producing method, adapted to the situation in which defects still remain in capacitor-cell forming positions irrespective of optimization of the positioning of a mask, will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the MIM deposition, a decision is made as to whether or not probing needs to be performed (step S<b>901</b>). In order to perform probing (YES in step S<b>901</b>), a wafer edge is processed to expose the bottom electrode <b>3</b> (step S<b>902</b>). When probing is not needed (NO in step S<b>901</b>), or after the wafer edge is processed in step S<b>902</b>, an inspection is made to detects defects in capacitors (step S<b>903</b>), so that defects information representing positional data of detected defects is saved in memory (step S<b>904</b>). In step S<b>903</b>, defects of capacitors are detected in accordance with a resistance variation measurement method adopting laser scanning such OBIRCH analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">After completion of defects detection in step S<b>903</b>, positions of capacitor cells are optimized in a wafer (step S<b>905</b>) based on the defects information, which is saved in memory in step S<b>904</b>, such that practically no defect will exist in capacitor cells or such that the number of defects will decrease.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Next, a decision is made as to whether or not defects remain in capacitor-cell forming positions (step S<b>906</b>). When defects are found in capacitor cells (YES in step S<b>906</b>), defects are locally removed by etching (step S<b>907</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a defect <b>13</b> which will be removed by etching. Thereafter, the flow proceeds to capacitor cell production. On the other hand, when no defect is found in capacitor cells (NO in step S<b>906</b>), the flow proceeds to capacitor cell production as similar to Embodiment 2. Thus, it is possible to eliminate defective capacitor cells since partial removal of short-circuits shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is performed with respect to the internal areas of capacitor cells.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The present embodiment is designed to specify defects on a wafer after the MIM deposition, optimize positions of capacitor cells, and remove defects still left in capacitor cells after optimization of positions of capacitor cells, whereby it is possible to form non-defective capacitors with ease. Thus, it is possible to improve a yield in producing thin-film capacitors.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">(Embodiment 4)</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Next, a capacitor producing method according to Embodiment 4 of the present invention will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> show configurations of capacitor producing devices according to the present embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a capacitor producing device <b>20</b> of the present embodiment including a defects detector <b>21</b> and an etching unit <b>22</b>. The defects detector <b>21</b> detects defects such as short-circuits and particles. The etching unit <b>22</b> is a defect removal unit that removes defects, which are detected by the defects detector <b>21</b>, by local etching. As described above, the capacitor producing device <b>20</b> of the present embodiment is a device equipped with a defects detector and a defects removal unit.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The capacitor producing device <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> further includes a defects information storage unit <b>23</b> and an information processing unit <b>24</b> in addition to the constituent elements of the capacitor producing device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The defects information storage unit <b>23</b> stores information representing positional data of defects detected by the defects detector <b>21</b>. The information processing unit <b>24</b> optimizes capacitor forming positions based on defects information stored in the defects information storage unit <b>23</b>. In the capacitor producing device <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, all pieces of defects information detected by the defects detector <b>21</b> are temporarily stored in the defects information storage unit <b>23</b>, so that the information processing unit <b>24</b> optimizes capacitor forming positions based on the stored information. Next, when defects still remain in capacitor-cell forming positions irrespective of optimization of the positioning of a mask based on optimized capacitor-cell forming positions, the capacitor producing device <b>20</b> locally removes detects by etching with the etching unit <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In any one of the capacitor producing devices <b>20</b>, the defects detector <b>21</b> is not necessarily limited in configuration; hence, it is possible to employ an optical inspection method, but it is preferable to specify positions of defects such as short-circuits in accordance with a resistance variation measurement method adopting OBIRCH analysis. Additionally, the etching unit <b>22</b> is not necessarily limited in configuration, wherein it is preferable to employ laser processing. Although these devices can be utilized to detect and remove defects after the formation of capacitor cells, it is preferable to repair defects on a wafer owing to a reduced time of processing.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The present embodiment makes it possible to produce non-defective capacitors in a short production time.

The capacitor producing device <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> includes the defects detector <b>21</b>, the defects information storage unit <b>23</b>, the information processing unit <b>24</b>, and a marker unit <b>25</b>.

Thus, it is possible to remove defects, which still remain in capacitor cells after optimization of positions of capacitor cells.

<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The present embodiment is designed to automatically optimize positions of capacitor cells based on defects of thin-film capacitors which are specified after MIM deposition on a wafer and then form an alignment mark, thus improving a yield of producing thin-film capacitors. Based on defects of thin-film capacitors which are specified after MIM deposition on a wafer, the present embodiment automatically optimizes positions of capacitor cells, forms an alignment mark, and locally removes defects inside capacitor cells, whereby it is possible to substantially eliminate defects of thin-film capacitors. Thus, it is possible to improve the yield of producing large-area capacitors on a wafer containing particles or defects such as electrical short-circuits between top electrodes and bottom electrodes.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">WORKING EXAMPLE</heading>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Hereinafter, working examples will be described in detail, wherein the present invention is not necessarily limited to the working examples described below.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">A 4-inch silicon wafer, in which a thermal oxidation film is formed on the surface with a 200 nm thickness, is used as the substrate <b>4</b>, whilst the bottom electrode <b>3</b> is produced by sequentially depositing Ti and Ru on the wafer via DC magnetron sputtering at a room temperature. Thicknesses of films composed of Ti and Ru are set to 50 nm and 100 nm respectively. Subsequently, SrTiO<sub>3</sub>(STO), added with 5% of Mn, is subjected to RF sputtering at 400&#xb0; C., thus depositing the thin-film dielectric <b>2</b> with a 100 nm thickness. Next, Ru is subjected to DC magnetron sputtering at a room temperature, thus depositing the top electrode <b>1</b> with a 100 nm thickness. Herein, the room temperature indicates the temperature of a room in which no machine is driven.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Next, the top electrode <b>1</b> and the thin-film dielectric <b>2</b> are each etched with a size of 1 mm<sup>2 </sup>on a wafer edge, thus forming a probing terminal. Additionally, probing and OBIRCH analysis are performed on a gap between the bottom electrode <b>3</b> and the top electrode <b>1</b> on the entire surface of a wafer so as to specify short-circuits between the bottom electrode <b>3</b> and the top electrode <b>1</b>, thus locally removing specified short-circuits using laser. It is considered that particles may exist in short-circuits, whereas removal of the top electrode <b>1</b> and the thin-film dielectric <b>2</b> and damage of the bottom electrode have been confirmed by observation after laser processing. Laser processing is performed on eighteen points. Resistance measurement is conducted again between the bottom electrode and the top electrode after laser processing, whereby it is confirmed that short-circuits are eliminated from the entire surface of a wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Sixteen capacitor cells with a size of 15 mm<sup>2 </sup>are produced using capacitors after laser processing. As a result, it is confirmed that capacitors cells have a high capacitance ranging from 9 &#x3bc;F to 3.1 &#x3bc;F.</p>

As the defects detector <b>21</b> included in the capacitor producing device illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the capacitor producing device <b>20</b> adopts the OBIRCH analysis. The MIM deposition, equivalent to the MIM deposition employed in the foregoing embodiments, is performed on a 4-inch wafer, which is then subjected to alignment optimization and defect repairing by use of the device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. As a result, the OBIRCH analysis detects fifteen short-circuits, whilst laser processing is performed on two points in order to optimize positions of capacitor cells and repair detects, wherein an alignment mark is formed using a laser marker after optimization of positions of capacitor cells.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Next, similar to the foregoing embodiments, sixteen capacitor cells with a size of 15 mm<sup>2 </sup>are produced using an alignment mark. As a result, it is possible to eliminate defective cells and produce capacitor cells whose capacitance ranges from 3.0 &#x3bc;F to 3.1 &#x3bc;F.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In this working example, the capacitor producing device <b>20</b> includes the infrared scanning unit <b>26</b> and the current measurement unit <b>27</b> collectively serving as the defects detector <b>21</b>, the laser processing unit <b>28</b> serving as the etching unit <b>22</b>, and the laser marker unit <b>29</b> serving as the marker unit <b>25</b>. This working example is designed to produce capacitor cells such that the control unit <b>30</b> controls the defects information storage unit <b>23</b>, the information processing unit <b>24</b>, the infrared scanning unit <b>26</b>, the current measurement unit <b>27</b>, the laser processing unit <b>28</b>, and the laser marker unit <b>29</b>; but this is not a restriction.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In this connection, the processing of flowcharts shown in drawings can be implemented using a program with a CPU. As a computer-readable recording medium storing this program, it is possible to employ a semiconductor storage device or an optical/magnetic storage device. This program and recording medium can be implemented using a system whose configuration differs from configurations of the foregoing embodiments, wherein its CPU executes the program so as to achieve substantially the same effects as the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Heretofore, preferred embodiments have been described in details, whereas the present invention is not necessarily limited to the foregoing capacitor producing methods, capacitor producing devices, programs and recording media; hence, it is needless to say that various modifications can be implemented without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
