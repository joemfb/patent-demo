<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to devices, systems, and methods for evaporating and separating water vapor from wastewater.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Industrial processes often create and use a significant amount of thermal energy to heat various processes and also use significant amounts of water for many varied processes. Common byproducts of these industrial processes are, among other things, significant amounts of exhaust heat and contaminated liquids and/or contaminated water, or simply wastewater. The exhaust heat is commonly exhausted to the surrounding atmosphere, which frequently results in a significant waste in thermal energy. Wasting such thermal energy is both monetarily a net loss from the industrial process and usually increases the so-called &#x201c;carbon footprint&#x201d; or energy usage profile of the industrial process.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Further, the wastewater usually needs to be treated at some point, either at the site of the industrial process or at a location remote from the industrial process, to remove the contaminants from the water and/or other liquids. To treat wastewater, for example, it is common to separate the water from the contaminants to meet various purity targets or to reduce the volume of liquid water within a reservoir of wastewater. Such contaminants may include, for example, salts, sulfur, heavy metals, suspended soils, human or animal waste, oils, fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, acid and any other undesirable matter as would be apparent to a person of skill in the art. This treatment of the wastewater takes additional energy, further adding to the energy usage profile of the industrial process.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Outdoor open liquid reservoirs, such as retention ponds, aeration reservoirs, dry ponds, open-topped tanks, and the like, are often used to temporarily store wastewater that contains undesirable levels of contaminants until the wastewater can be treated to separate the contaminant from the water. After separation, the cleaned water can be released to the environment or otherwise used as desired, and the contaminants and/or concentrated wastewater can be further processed, recycled, transported to an appropriate landfill, and/or otherwise disposed of.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One commonly used method of at least initially separating non-volatile contaminants from the water is to evaporate the water from the wastewater, thereby releasing relatively clean water into the atmosphere in the gaseous state in the form of water vapor while the contaminants are retained and/or re-captured in the reservoir. Depending on the circulation of wastewater into the reservoir, after some period of time the water is either completely evaporated, thereby leaving the contaminants remaining in the reservoir for easy collection and disposal, or the concentration of contaminants is elevated to a point, which may exceed saturation in terms of the solubility of one or more contaminants, where it becomes economically advantageous to further process and/or separate the highly concentrated wastewater in other ways.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Although the water evaporates naturally at the surface of a pond or other open reservoir, it is often desirable to increase the rate of evaporation to decrease the processing time of the wastewater in order to increase economic efficiencies. Thus, it is common to place a reservoir evaporator system directly in the reservoir that effectively accelerates evaporation of the water to the surrounding environment by, for example, increasing the surface area to volume ratio of the wastewater to the surrounding air. There are many ways to accomplish this, and of course, the efficacy of this evaporative treatment method is highly dependent on many variables other than the evaporator system, including flow rate of wastewater into or through the reservoir, humidity levels of the surrounding environment, the liquid to be evaporated, and temperature, to name a few.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">One known type of reservoir evaporator system uses nozzles to spray a fine mist of droplets of the wastewater up into the air above the top surface of the reservoir. Under ideal conditions, the water in the droplets evaporates into the surrounding atmosphere more quickly than from the top surface because of the increased surface area to volume ratio, and the contaminants and any un-evaporated droplets fall back into the reservoir. An exemplary reservoir evaporation system generally incorporating this design is disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2010/0139871 to Rasmussen et al.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another known type of reservoir evaporator system floats on the top surface of the reservoir and includes a spinning agitator for scooping wastewater from the top surface and sprinkling it into the air. The agitator is connected to a source of high pressure air that spins the agitator by means of thrust nozzles, and the exhaust from the thrust nozzles may be directed to further impact the wastewater sprinkled into the air to further accelerate evaporation. An exemplary reservoir evaporation generally incorporating this design is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,001,077 to Kemper.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A further known type of reservoir evaporator system that dispenses with the use of high pressure air exposes evaporation surfaces that have been wetted with the wastewater to the air and wind. One exemplary reservoir evaporation system generally incorporating this design is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,166,188 to Kadem et al.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Although these known systems do accelerate the evaporation and therefore separation of water from a reservoir of wastewater, among other significant limitations, they frequently use a large amount of energy to do so.</p>

The heat exchanger may be arranged to heat the wastewater with heat from the waste heat source. The pump may be arranged to and pump the heated wastewater from the heat exchanger to the reservoir.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some optional preferred arrangements, the waste heat may be transferred from a source of the waste heat to the heat exchanger directly and/or indirectly. A direct heat transfer system may include a fluid line that is arranged to transfer heated process fluid, such as turbine exhaust steam or hot water or oil, directly to the heat exchanger. An indirect heat transfer system may include a heat transfer circulation loop adapted to collect heat from a waste heat source. The heat transfer circulation loop may include a second heat exchanger to collect waste heat from combustion exhaust gases near the source of the combustion exhaust gases in heat exchange liquid, and a closed loop hydraulic line to circulate the heat exchange liquid between the first and second heat exchangers.

The vapor compression loop may include an evaporator arranged to collect heat from the low pressure steam turbine exhaust or low temperature combustion exhaust gas, a compressor to compress vapor from the evaporator, a condenser connected to the compressor and formed as part of the reservoir heater to heat the wastewater, and an expansion valve to cool vapor from the condenser and supply liquid to the evaporator.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some optional preferred arrangements, other industrial processes and waste heat sources may be used; preferably processes that generate and/or use large amounts of heat, such as from burning hydrocarbon fuels or use of nuclear fuels. Some additional and non-limiting exemplary industrial processes include petrochemical refining facilities, steel and other metal production facilities, chemical processing facilities, manufacturing facilities, and solid waste processing and/or decomposition facilities. The waste heat may be generated by or captured from, for example, boilers, heaters, cooling liquids, ovens, furnaces, chemical reactions, and so on. The industrial process may include a power generation plant. The power generation plant may include an internal combustion engine and/or a gas fired jet turbine and/or boiler.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The liquid evaporator preferably includes a direct contact adiabatic evaporator or evaporation system that directly contacts air and/or other gases and liquids such that water vapor is evaporated into the gases. The liquid evaporator may have other forms and/or components and/or principles of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some optional preferred arrangements, the liquid evaporator includes a draft tube evaporator. The draft tube evaporator vigorously mixes a discontinuous mass of air in a continuous mass of wastewater, such as by injecting air from the draft tube into a mass of wastewater, thereby forming a discontinuous mass of air bubbles within the continuous mass of wastewater. The draft tube evaporator preferably includes an air injection tube that disperses the gas into a liquid, such as a downcomer, and a weir forming a generally vertical channel open at both a top end and a bottom end. The weir extends from beneath the top surface of the liquid upwardly toward the top surface. Preferably, the top end of the weir is disposed at or a short distance below the top surface of the liquid. A confined space is formed between the weir and the outer surface of the downcomer. The confined space may be an annular confined space between a cylindrical downcomer and a cylindrical weir.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some optional preferred arrangements, the draft-tube evaporator includes a partially enclosed vessel arranged to be disposed within an open reservoir of the wastewater, such as an open tank. The vessel is preferably arranged to be disposed in an operative position at the top surface of the wastewater in the reservoir. The vessel may be arranged to float in a non-fixed operative position at the top surface of the wastewater. The vessel may be supported in a fixed operative position at the top surface of the wastewater, for example with one or more rigid supports, such as braces or legs. The vessel defines a confined space. The vessel optionally includes an air dispersion chamber inside the confined space for directly mixing the air into the wastewater. The vessel may include an air duct and/or a downcomer for operatively connecting the air blower with the air dispersion chamber. The air dispersion chamber may be defined by a weir that allows vertical circulation of the wastewater. The vessel include an exhaust port arranged to allow water vapor to exhaust from the vessel. A tortuous pathway may connect the air dispersion chamber to the exhaust port. The vessel may have a top portion to be disposed above the top surface and a bottom portion to be disposed in the wastewater in the operative position. The liquid evaporator may be secured to the reservoir or may be separate from the reservoir.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some optional preferred arrangements, the draft-tube evaporator may include an enclosed aeration tank arranged to receive and hold the wastewater. The aeration tank preferably includes a shell defining an interior, an inlet for allowing wastewater to be supplied into the interior, a downcomer that extends into the interior, a weir adjacent the downcomer, an exhaust outlet to allow exhaust gases and water vapor to exhaust from the interior, and/or a discharge outlet to allow wastewater to be removed from the tank. The draft tube preferably extends downwardly into the interior and has an air discharge outlet to be disposed under the top surface of the wastewater inside the aeration tank. The weir is disposed adjacent the air discharge outlet. The weir may be arranged to allow vertical circulation of the wastewater around the weir. The weir may have the form of a vertically oriented wall that encircles or surrounds the outlet of the draft tube and defines the air dispersion chamber. The weir may be a cylindrical wall. The weir preferably has a bottom edge spaced above a bottom wall of the tank and below the outlet of the draft tube. The weir also preferably has a top edge spaced above the outlet of the draft tube and below the top surface of the water.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Air may be drawn through the liquid evaporator under either or both of positive pressure or negative pressure. For example, the air blower may be arranged to push the air under positive pressure through the downcomer into the air dispersion chamber. In other arrangements, the air blower may be arranged to pull the air under negative pressure out of the air dispersion chamber, thereby forming a vacuum in the dispersion chamber that pulls air through the downcomer. Optionally, a first air blower may be arranged to push the air through the downcomer and a second air blower may be arranged to pull the air out of the air dispersion chamber. The air blower may be any mechanism capable of moving air, such as a fan, pump, positive or negative displacement pump, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some optional preferred arrangements, the liquid evaporator includes one or more demisters arranged to separate entrained water from the water vapor and gases before being exhausted from the liquid evaporator.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some optional preferred arrangements, the system may include one or more liquid evaporators arranged to evaporate water vapor from the wastewater. Two or more of the liquid evaporators may be connected in parallel. Two or more of the liquid evaporators may be connected in series.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Each of the optional features and/or aspects disclosed herein may be operatively combined with any one or more of the other optional features disclosed herein in any manner that would be apparent to one or ordinary skill. Each such combination is specifically contemplated and included herein as an optional arrangement of this disclosure</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a liquid evaporation system <b>10</b><i>a </i>exemplifying some teachings of the present application is arranged for evaporating water vapor from heated wastewater by intensely mixing air with a volume of hot wastewater <b>12</b>. The air may be ambient temperature or heated above ambient temperature. The term &#x201c;ambient temperature&#x201d; refers to air that is substantially the same temperature as the surrounding external environment without being substantially heated or cooled by additional processes or devices. The term &#x201c;heated&#x201d; means actively and/or intentionally heated above ambient temperature. The term &#x201c;hot wastewater&#x201d; refers to wastewater that has a temperature that is significantly higher than the surrounding external environment. The air and the hot wastewater are mixed such that water vapor evaporates from the wastewater into the air. Preferably, the air is humidified with water vapor from the wastewater to near 100% saturation at a temperature close to the temperature of the hot wastewater. In order to promote and/or increase the evaporation of water vapor into the air, heat energy is added to the volume of wastewater <b>12</b>. The liquid evaporation system <b>10</b><i>a </i>preferably operates with temperatures of the volume of wastewater <b>12</b> being between approximately 100&#xb0; F. and 170&#xb0; F., although other temperature ranges above and/or below the preferred temperature range may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The liquid evaporation system <b>10</b><i>a </i>includes a liquid evaporator <b>14</b>, an air blower <b>16</b>, such as a fan, arranged to blow air and/or other gases into the liquid evaporator <b>14</b>, and a wastewater heating system <b>18</b>, such as any one of the heating systems disclosed herein, arranged to heat the volume of wastewater <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The liquid evaporator <b>14</b> may be any liquid evaporation system arranged to accelerate evaporation of water vapor from wastewater to separate the water from the wastewater. Preferably, the liquid evaporator <b>14</b> includes a direct contact adiabatic evaporation system that increases the rate of evaporation of liquid from the wastewater by forcing air into wastewater within the confines of the liquid evaporator and allowing controlled release of moist exhaust air containing water vapor after mixing with the wastewater to reduce, control, and/or eliminate dispersion of entrained wastewater with the exhaust air into the surrounding atmosphere. This separates water in the wastewater from the contaminants by evaporating the water to the surrounding environment with the moist exhaust air while leaving contaminants, such as sulfur, salts, and suspended solids, in the wastewater. Some possible exemplary liquid evaporators may include any of the exemplary liquid evaporators described herein in the detailed description or in the background, or liquid evaporation systems that may be found elsewhere. The liquid evaporator <b>14</b> preferably is or includes a draft tube evaporator that vigorously mixes air as a discontinuous mass in a continuous mass of wastewater, such as by injecting air through the draft tube into the mass of wastewater <b>12</b>, thereby forming a discontinuous mass of air bubbles within the continuous mass of wastewater. The wastewater <b>12</b> may be in an open reservoir, such as an open tank <b>12</b><i>a </i>or pond, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref> and <b>5</b>; however, the wastewater <b>12</b> may be in an enclosed reservoir, such as an enclosed tank <b>12</b><i>c </i>or vessel, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Thus, the liquid evaporator <b>14</b> may include a partially enclosed vessel arranged to be disposed within an open reservoir of the wastewater, such as an open tank. The liquid evaporator <b>14</b> may include an enclosed aeration tank arranged to receive and hold the wastewater. The liquid evaporator <b>14</b> operatively receives the wastewater <b>12</b> and is arranged to evaporate and separate water vapor from the wastewater. Air supplied from the air blower <b>16</b> is intimately mixed with wastewater inside the liquid evaporator, and the water vapor travels through an enclosed exhaust pathway through the liquid evaporator <b>14</b> from the surface of the wastewater to an exhaust port. As the exhaust air travels along the exhaust pathway, entrained wastewater droplets or contaminants are removed from the exhaust air by contacting and collecting on the walls of the exhaust pathway and/or demister structures, such as baffles, screens, and/or other collection structures. Thus, the exhaust pathway preferably follows a tortuous path through the liquid evaporator between the top surface of the wastewater inside the liquid evaporator <b>14</b> to the exhaust port to increase contact of the exhaust air with collection surfaces and/or demister structures before the exhaust air escapes from the liquid evaporator. The liquid evaporator <b>14</b> in some arrangements may have any one or more features and arrangements of the exemplary liquid evaporators shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-5</figref> and described in additional detail hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The air blower <b>16</b> is operatively connected to the liquid evaporator <b>14</b> with an air supply line <b>20</b>, such as a pipe or hose, to force air and/or other gases into the liquid evaporator <b>14</b>. The air blower <b>16</b> preferably blows ambient temperature air, such as air at a temperature below approximately 100-110&#xb0; F., which generally allows use of less expensive materials of construction, such as PVC, plastic, and other engineered materials, for the construction of the air supply line <b>20</b> and/or the liquid evaporator <b>14</b>. Blowing ambient temperature air may also reduce energy requirements in comparison to a heated air blower. Alternatively, the air blower may operatively supply heated air to the liquid evaporator, such as heated exhaust or other heated air from a waste heat source in the industrial plant. Preferably, the air blower <b>16</b> is located remote from the liquid evaporator <b>14</b>, and the air supply line <b>20</b> is or includes a flexible hose or pipe that allows the liquid evaporator <b>14</b> to be placed remote from the air blower <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The wastewater heating system <b>18</b> is arranged to heat the wastewater <b>12</b>, preferably by capturing heat energy from exhaust heat from a separate source and transferring the exhaust heat into the wastewater <b>12</b>. The wastewater heating system <b>18</b> may provide heat energy, for example, by circulating heated water and/or wastewater to the liquid evaporator <b>14</b> at a temperature above approximately 115&#xb0; F. The wastewater heating system <b>18</b> includes a heating loop that circulates water and/or wastewater in the liquid evaporator <b>14</b> through a heat exchanger <b>22</b>. The heat exchanger <b>22</b> is connected with a heat source, such as an exhaust or other waste heat source <b>23</b> from a nearby industrial process, flare stack, engine, or other source of combustion energy. Some exemplary waste heat sources <b>23</b> that may be connected with the heat exchanger <b>22</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref> and discussed in further detail hereinafter. The wastewater heating system <b>18</b> includes a circulation line <b>24</b>, such as a pipe configured in a loop having an outlet <b>26</b> arranged to collect wastewater from the liquid evaporator <b>14</b> and returning to an inlet <b>28</b> arranged to return wastewater into the liquid evaporator <b>14</b>. The circulation line <b>24</b> is operatively connected with the heat exchanger <b>22</b> such that heat from the waste heat source <b>23</b> heats the wastewater as it flows through the heat exchanger <b>22</b> and the heated wastewater is returned to the inlet <b>28</b> at a greater temperature than the wastewater entering the line <b>24</b> at the outlet <b>26</b>. A pump <b>30</b> preferably is operatively disposed along the line to circulate the wastewater from the outlet <b>26</b> to the inlet <b>28</b> and through the heat exchanger <b>22</b>. The heat exchanger <b>22</b> and the pump <b>30</b> may take any form appropriate for a given set of variables as would be readily understood by a person of ordinary skill.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The wastewater <b>12</b> is supplied to the liquid evaporator <b>14</b> by any suitable mechanism, such as a supply pipe <b>15</b><i>a</i>. The wastewater may be collected, for example, from a source of wastewater within an industrial plant. However, the wastewater <b>12</b> may be supplied from any suitable source. The supply pipe <b>15</b><i>a </i>may connect to a supply inlet into the liquid evaporator <b>14</b> separate from the heating system <b>18</b>. The supply pipe <b>15</b><i>a </i>may connect into the circulation line <b>24</b> of the heating system <b>18</b>. Other arrangements, for operatively supplying the wastewater <b>12</b> to the liquid evaporator <b>14</b> are also possible and contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In operation, the air blower <b>16</b> forces air through the air supply line <b>20</b> into the liquid evaporator <b>14</b>. As air from the air blower <b>16</b> circulates through the liquid evaporator <b>14</b>, the air and wastewater vigorously mix together, preferably within the interior of a confined chamber, and water vapor evaporates out of the wastewater <b>12</b> in the confined chamber to rapidly evaporate relatively clean water from the wastewater into the gas. Preferably, use of the confined chamber prevents gas from carrying entrained droplets of wastewater and/or entrained particles away from the liquid evaporator <b>14</b>. The liquid evaporator <b>14</b> separates the air and water vapor from the wastewater and exhausts the water vapor and gas, preferably to the surrounding atmosphere. Preferably, any wastewater and/or particles removed from the gas and water vapor is returned to the wastewater <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As air is blown through the liquid evaporator <b>14</b>, the wastewater heating system <b>18</b> heats the wastewater in the liquid evaporator <b>14</b>, thereby causing more rapid evaporation of water from the wastewater in the liquid evaporator <b>14</b> than with ambient temperature wastewater. The pump <b>30</b> pumps the wastewater through the circulation line <b>24</b> from the outlet <b>26</b> to the inlet <b>28</b>. The wastewater flows out of the liquid evaporator <b>14</b> from the outlet <b>26</b>, through the heat exchanger <b>22</b>, and back to the liquid evaporator at the inlet <b>28</b>. Heat from the waste heat source <b>23</b> is transferred into the wastewater at the heat exchanger <b>22</b>, and thereby transferred into the wastewater <b>12</b> when the wastewater returns through the inlet <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, another liquid evaporation system <b>10</b><i>b </i>has a large reservoir <b>13</b><i>a </i>of wastewater. The wastewater in the large reservoir <b>13</b><i>a </i>may be at ambient temperature or above or below ambient temperature. The large reservoir <b>13</b><i>a </i>holds a large enough volume of wastewater that it would be very difficult to efficiently or effectively heat all of the wastewater directly within the reservoir and evaporate the wastewater directly within the reservoir. In this example, the large reservoir <b>13</b><i>a </i>may be tens of thousands of gallons or hundreds of thousands of gallons or more of wastewater. To overcome the difficulty of heating such a large volume of the wastewater, the liquid evaporation system <b>10</b><i>b </i>separates the liquid evaporator <b>14</b> from the large reservoir <b>13</b><i>a </i>of ambient wastewater to allow smaller volumes of the wastewater <b>12</b> to be heated apart from the large reservoir <b>13</b><i>a </i>before being supplied to the liquid evaporator.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The liquid evaporation system <b>10</b><i>b </i>includes a thermal holding tank <b>13</b><i>b</i>, the liquid evaporator <b>14</b>, the air blower <b>16</b>, and the wastewater heating system <b>18</b>. Wastewater is supplied from the large reservoir <b>13</b><i>a </i>to the thermal holding tank <b>13</b><i>b </i>by way of a conduit, such as supply pipe <b>15</b><i>a</i>, that operatively connects the large reservoir <b>13</b><i>a </i>to the thermal holding tank <b>13</b><i>b</i>. A pump <b>15</b><i>b </i>is optionally operatively disposed along the supply pipe <b>15</b><i>a </i>to pump wastewater through the conduit from the large reservoir <b>13</b><i>a </i>to the thermal holding tank <b>13</b><i>b</i>. The thermal holding tank <b>13</b><i>b </i>is preferably significantly smaller than the large reservoir <b>13</b><i>a</i>. The chosen size of the holding tank <b>13</b><i>b </i>is dependent on many different variables, which may include, for example, the desired rate of evaporation from the liquid evaporator <b>14</b>, the temperature of the waste heat source <b>23</b>, the rate of recirculation through the wastewater heating system <b>18</b>, the size and efficiency of the heat exchanger <b>22</b>, and the temperature/humidity of the ambient air. For example, the holding tank <b>13</b><i>b </i>may be quite small if the rate and/or efficiency of heat exchange at the heat exchanger <b>22</b> is large, and the holding tank <b>13</b><i>b </i>may be eliminated entirely if the rate of heat exchange at the heat exchanger <b>22</b> is large enough. Preferably, the thermal holding tank <b>13</b><i>b </i>has a holding capacity of between about ten gallons and about ten thousand gallons. The thermal holding tank <b>13</b><i>b </i>is operatively connected to the wastewater heating system <b>18</b>. For example, the circulation line <b>24</b> connects the thermal holding tank <b>13</b><i>b</i>, the liquid evaporator <b>14</b>, the pump <b>30</b>, and the heat exchanger <b>22</b> in a heating loop. The pump <b>30</b> is arranged to pump wastewater from the thermal holding tank <b>13</b><i>b </i>to the inlet <b>28</b> of the liquid evaporator, from outlet <b>26</b> of the liquid evaporator <b>14</b> to the heat exchanger <b>22</b>, and from the heat exchanger <b>22</b> back to the thermal holding tank <b>13</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The wastewater heating system <b>18</b> is operatively connected to the waste heat source <b>23</b> for heating the wastewater <b>12</b>. Specifically, heat from the waste heat source <b>23</b> is transferred to the heat exchanger <b>22</b> by appropriate conduits <b>23</b><i>a </i>to heat the wastewater flowing through the heat exchanger <b>22</b>. Any residual heat from the heat exchanger may optionally be returned to the waste heat source <b>23</b> by appropriate conduits <b>23</b><i>b</i>. Heated wastewater then cycles from the heat exchanger <b>22</b> into the thermal holding tank <b>13</b><i>b </i>where it is held until it is delivered to the liquid evaporator <b>14</b> or, alternately is recirculated back to heat exchanger <b>12</b> through pump <b>30</b> if additional heat is to be added to the wastewater. Heated wastewater from the thermal holding tank is then supplied to a liquid evaporator <b>14</b> through the circulation line <b>24</b> into the inlet <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The thermal holding tank <b>13</b><i>b </i>optionally is insulated to retain as much heat within the wastewater as practicable. For example, the thermal holding tank <b>13</b><i>b </i>is surrounded and/or enveloped with thermal insulation <b>27</b>, such as foam, fiberglass, earth, wood, etc., as is understood in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The liquid evaporator <b>14</b> is operatively connected to the air blower <b>16</b> to force air and/or other gases into the liquid evaporator to rigorously mix the air directly with the wastewater to evaporate water vapor from the wastewater as described elsewhere herein. Water vapor is exhausted from the liquid evaporator <b>14</b>. As with the liquid evaporation system <b>10</b><i>a</i>, the liquid evaporator <b>14</b> may have any of the various forms disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Optionally, discharge of more concentrated wastewater is selectively removed from the liquid evaporator <b>14</b> to maintain the level of total dissolved solids in the wastewater in liquid evaporator <b>14</b> at or below a pre-selected level. Thus, a blowdown line, such as discharge line <b>29</b>, is operatively connected to the circulation loop <b>24</b> to allow wastewater to be discharged. The discharge line <b>29</b> is preferably operatively disposed between the liquid evaporator <b>14</b> and the heat exchanger <b>22</b> but may be operatively located at the liquid evaporator <b>14</b>, at the thermal holding tank <b>13</b><i>b</i>, and/or elsewhere along the heating loop. A flow control valve <b>25</b><i>d </i>is preferably operatively arranged to stop or allow flow of concentrated wastewater through the discharge line <b>29</b>. The blowdown line allows the liquid evaporation system <b>10</b><i>b </i>to run continuously by providing a way to transfer concentrated wastewater out of the system while controlling equilibrium levels of total solids within the liquid evaporator <b>14</b> without having to add another pump to the system. That is, the pump <b>30</b> preferably provides for both recirculation of the wastewater <b>12</b> through the heat exchanger <b>22</b> and also transfers concentrated wastewater away from the liquid evaporation zone in the liquid evaporator <b>14</b>. The liquid evaporation system <b>10</b><i>a </i>may also be provided with a blowdown line in the same or similar arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Optionally, the wastewater heating system <b>18</b> may include an evaporator bypass line <b>24</b><i>a </i>that optionally and selectively allows wastewater in the circulation loop to bypass the liquid evaporator <b>14</b>. The bypass line <b>24</b><i>a </i>has a first end that is operatively connected to the circulation line <b>24</b> between the thermal holding tank <b>13</b><i>b </i>and the liquid evaporator <b>14</b> and a second end that is operatively connected to the circulation line <b>24</b> between the liquid evaporator <b>24</b><i>a </i>and the heat exchanger <b>22</b>. Flow control valves <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b</i>, and <b>25</b><i>c </i>are optionally operatively located along the circulation line and the bypass line <b>24</b><i>a </i>to allow selectively directing the wastewater to circulate through the liquid evaporator <b>14</b> and/or to bypass the liquid evaporator <b>14</b> through the bypass line <b>24</b><i>a</i>. The flow control valve <b>25</b><i>a </i>is operatively located on the inlet side of the liquid evaporator <b>14</b> to selectively stop or allow flow of wastewater into the liquid evaporator from the thermal holding tank <b>13</b><i>b</i>. The flow control valve <b>25</b><i>b </i>is operatively located along the bypass line <b>24</b><i>a </i>to selectively stop or allow flow of wastewater through the bypass line <b>24</b><i>a</i>.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the exemplary arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the liquid evaporator <b>14</b><i>a </i>has a body defining a partially enclosed vessel <b>40</b> that floats on or is otherwise maintained in an operative position in and at a top surface of the wastewater <b>12</b>. The top surface of the wastewater is located between a top portion of the vessel <b>40</b> disposed above the wastewater and a bottom portion of the vessel <b>40</b> disposed in the wastewater. The wastewater <b>12</b> is preferably contained within an open reservoir, such as a tank <b>12</b><i>a </i>having an open top <b>12</b><i>b</i>. The vessel <b>40</b> defines an interior space <b>41</b> that is confined by the walls of the vessel. An opening <b>42</b> through a submerged portion of the vessel <b>40</b> allows wastewater to enter into the bottom portion of the interior space <b>41</b>. The bottom portion of the interior space <b>41</b> is in fluid communication with the upper portion of the interior space <b>41</b> such that water vapor may travel from the bottom portion into the top portion. The top portion of the interior space <b>41</b> at least partly defines an exhaust path A from the top surface of the wastewater to one or more exhaust ports <b>44</b> to the surrounding environment. The exhaust ports <b>44</b> are operatively located above the top surface of the wastewater. An air downcomer <b>46</b>, which is arranged to be connected to the air supply line <b>20</b>, has a discharge outlet <b>48</b> disposed inside the bottom portion of the confined space <b>41</b>. The discharge outlet <b>48</b> includes an open bottom end <b>48</b><i>a </i>of the air downcomer <b>46</b> and a plurality of sparge ports <b>48</b><i>b </i>through the sidewall of the air downcomer <b>46</b> adjacent the open bottom end <b>48</b><i>a</i>. The area where the discharge outlet <b>48</b> is located in the bottom portion of the confined space <b>41</b> forms an air dispersion chamber <b>43</b> during operation of the liquid evaporator. Thus, in the operative position, the air pump <b>16</b> forces air through the air supply line <b>20</b> into the air dispersing chamber <b>43</b>, where the air mixes vigorously with the wastewater. The air then moves naturally to the top surface of the wastewater inside the interior space <b>41</b> and travels through the exhaust pathway A to be exhausted out of the vessel <b>40</b> out through the exhaust ports <b>44</b> as moist exhaust air containing water vapor, while concentrated wastewater and contaminants are trapped within the vessel <b>40</b> and returned to the wastewater. In this manner, water vapor is evaporated and separated out from the wastewater without allowing uncontrolled dispersion of the wastewater into the surrounding environment. The liquid evaporator <b>14</b><i>a </i>may be maintained in the operative position at the top surface of the wastewater <b>12</b> by any convenient mechanism, such as support legs, a suspension structure, and/or flotation.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In one optional arrangement, the interior space <b>41</b> of the vessel <b>40</b> includes an upper chamber <b>50</b>, a middle chamber <b>52</b>, and a lower chamber <b>54</b>, which are in fluid communication with each other. An open bottom end of the lower chamber <b>54</b> defines the opening <b>42</b>. An open top end of the lower chamber <b>54</b> connects with an opening at the bottom of the middle chamber <b>52</b>. In the operative position, the top level of the wastewater extends through the middle chamber <b>52</b>, such that the lower chamber <b>54</b> and a lower portion of the middle chamber <b>52</b> are disposed in the wastewater and the upper chamber <b>50</b> and the upper portion of the middle chamber <b>52</b> are disposed above the wastewater <b>12</b>. The air dispersion chamber <b>43</b> is defined inside the lower chamber <b>54</b>. Floats <b>56</b> carried by the vessel <b>40</b> are located so as to maintain the liquid evaporator <b>14</b><i>a </i>in the operative position. The exhaust ports <b>44</b> are directed downwardly toward the top surface of the wastewater <b>12</b>. The downcomer <b>46</b> extends down through the top of the vessel <b>40</b>, into and through the upper chamber <b>50</b> and the middle chamber <b>52</b>, and into the lower chamber <b>54</b>. The discharge outlet <b>48</b> is spaced above the opening <b>42</b> a space sufficient to ensure that air discharged through the discharge outlet <b>48</b> does not exit through the opening <b>42</b> under normal operating conditions. A baffle <b>58</b> separates the upper chamber <b>50</b> from the middle chamber <b>52</b>. Openings <b>60</b> through the baffle <b>58</b> allow water vapor to pass from the middle chamber <b>52</b> to the upper chamber <b>50</b>. Demisting structures <b>62</b> are disposed in the upper chamber in and/or across the exhaust path A to form a tortuous path from the openings <b>60</b> to the exhaust ports <b>44</b>. Liquid discharge tubes <b>64</b><i>a</i>, <b>64</b><i>b </i>extend down from the middle chamber <b>52</b> on opposite sides of the lower chamber <b>54</b>. The liquid discharge tubes <b>64</b><i>a</i>, <b>64</b><i>b </i>merge into a single discharge riser <b>64</b><i>c </i>below the vessel <b>40</b>. An air vent tube <b>64</b><i>d </i>is located at the top of the discharge ricer <b>64</b><i>c </i>at the junction of the discharge pipes <b>64</b><i>a </i>and <b>64</b><i>b</i>. The air vent tube <b>64</b><i>d </i>is substantially smaller than the liquid discharge tubes <b>64</b><i>a</i>, <b>64</b><i>b </i>or discharge riser <b>64</b><i>c</i>. The discharge riser <b>64</b><i>c </i>extends downwardly toward the bottom of the tank <b>12</b><i>a</i>. The liquid evaporator <b>14</b><i>a </i>is preferably fabricated almost entirely from plastics, such as polyvinyl chloride, and functions in a manner understood in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the exemplary arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the liquid evaporator <b>14</b><i>b </i>is adapted for use in a multi-stage system that uses the evaporator <b>14</b><i>b </i>as an intermediate in-line unit with a connection for transferring the exhaust water vapor to another processing step, such as another liquid evaporator, or to a remote exhaust location. As with the liquid evaporator <b>14</b><i>a</i>, the wastewater <b>12</b> is preferably contained within an open reservoir, such as the tank <b>12</b><i>a </i>(not shown). The liquid evaporator <b>14</b><i>b </i>is substantially similar to the liquid evaporator <b>14</b><i>a </i>with the exception that, in the upper chamber <b>50</b>, the liquid evaporator <b>14</b><i>b </i>has only a single exhaust port <b>44</b> for connection to another transfer conduit instead of a plurality of exhaust ports <b>44</b>, and the liquid evaporator <b>14</b><i>b </i>has a single bustle <b>70</b> instead of the baffles <b>62</b>. The vessel <b>40</b>, the downcomer <b>46</b>, and the exhaust path A are preferably arranged symmetrically about a vertical axis Z, and the exhaust port <b>44</b> is non-symmetrically arranged about the vertical axis Z at a single location on one side of the top chamber <b>50</b>. All other portions of the evaporator <b>14</b><i>b </i>are preferably the same as the corresponding portions on the evaporator <b>14</b><i>a </i>and will not be described again for the sake of brevity. The bustle <b>70</b> is arranged to allow the non-symmetrically located exhaust port <b>44</b> to draw off air and water vapor from inside the top chamber <b>50</b> so as to maintain radially symmetrical flow of air upwardly from the sparge ports <b>48</b><i>b </i>and through the lower and middle chambers <b>54</b> and <b>52</b>. Thus, the bustle <b>70</b> is arranged to cause uniform radially outwardly mass flow of air at all circumferential locations around the bustle <b>70</b> from a region inside the bustle <b>70</b> to a region outside of the bustle <b>70</b> to the exhaust port <b>44</b>. The bustle <b>70</b> is formed of a circumferential wall <b>72</b>, preferably a cylindrical wall, extending upwardly from the baffle <b>58</b> part way to the top interior wall of the upper chamber <b>50</b>. The circumferential wall <b>72</b> is spaced radially between the outer peripheral wall of the upper chamber <b>50</b> and the openings <b>60</b>, thereby forming an inner volume encompassed by the bustle <b>70</b> and an outer peripheral volume between the bustle <b>70</b> and the outer peripheral wall. The circumferential wall <b>72</b> defines a gap <b>74</b> between the inner volume and the outer peripheral volume. The gap <b>74</b> has a continuously variable width W along the length of the wall <b>72</b>. The gap <b>74</b> has a smallest width W (e.g., the wall <b>72</b> is tallest) immediately adjacent the location of the exhaust port <b>44</b>. The gap <b>74</b> has a largest width W diametrically opposite the location of the exhaust port <b>44</b>. In the present example, the circumferential wall <b>72</b> is cylindrical and has a top edge that defines an inclined plane with its highest point adjacent the exhaust port <b>44</b> and its lowest point diametrically opposite from the exhaust port <b>44</b>. Preferably, each of the gap <b>74</b>, the downcomer <b>46</b>, and the exhaust port <b>44</b> defines the same cross-sectional air flow area. Other bustle designs capable of providing or improving uniform radial mass flow of the air outwardly from the inner volume <b>24</b><i>b </i>are also possible, such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,442,035, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The exhaust port <b>44</b> is optionally connected to a conduit <b>76</b> that is operatively connected to another instrument, such as another evaporator. The exhaust port <b>44</b> may alternatively exhaust to air or be connected to some other device.</p>

Further, the outer annular periphery of the lower chamber <b>54</b> is spaced radially inwardly from the discharge tubes <b>64</b><i>a,b,e,f </i>rather than being located immediately adjacent the discharge tubes as shown for the liquid evaporators <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>a</i>. Preferably, remaining features of the partially enclosed vessel <b>40</b> are identical to corresponding features in either of the liquid evaporators <b>14</b><i>a </i>or <b>14</b><i>b </i>and can be understood with reference to the prior descriptions thereof. The adjustable stabilization system <b>80</b> is arranged to help stabilize the liquid evaporator <b>14</b><i>c </i>in an upright operative position, i.e., with the axis Z aligned generally vertically, the lower chamber <b>26</b> disposed in the wastewater <b>12</b>, and the upper chamber disposed above the wastewater <b>12</b> while air is being forced through the air supply downcomer <b>44</b> into the lower chamber <b>26</b>. The stabilization system <b>80</b> includes floatation devices <b>82</b> operatively secured to the vessel <b>40</b> by outriggers <b>84</b>. The position of the floatation devices <b>82</b> may be adjusted axially and/or radially to cause the vessel <b>40</b> to sit higher or lower in the wastewater. The flotation devices <b>82</b> are disposed diametrically opposite each other on opposite sides of the vessel <b>40</b>. Each flotation device <b>82</b> is spaced radially from the outer annular periphery of the vessel and sized to provide sufficient buoyancy to hold the upper chamber <b>50</b> spaced above the top surface of the wastewater <b>12</b>. The outriggers <b>84</b> are formed by two struts arranged in parallel on opposite sides of the downcomer <b>44</b> and connected to the top of the vessel.

One or more hinges <b>86</b> in the struts are spaced from the outer annular periphery of the upper chamber <b>50</b> and arranged to allow the flotation devices <b>82</b> to be selectively raised and/or lowered by pivoting the ends of the struts around the respective hinges. The flotation devices <b>82</b> are preferably disposed spaced along an axis of the air supply line <b>20</b> over the top of the vessel <b>40</b> approaching the downcomer <b>46</b>.

The top edge <b>91</b><i>a </i>is spaced above the outlet <b>48</b> of the downcomer <b>46</b> and below the top surface of the wastewater <b>12</b>. The weir <b>91</b> forms an air dispersion chamber <b>43</b> surrounding the lower portion of the downcomer <b>46</b> where air discharged from the air discharge outlet <b>48</b> vigorously mixes with the wastewater <b>12</b> to evaporate the water vapor.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Supports <b>93</b> are arranged to support the weir <b>91</b> in a fixed location within the aeration tank <b>12</b><i>c</i>.

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The liquid evaporation systems <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>may include any number of liquid evaporators <b>14</b> operatively connected together to evaporate the wastewater faster. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, for example, the liquid evaporation system <b>10</b><i>a </i>is shown in an arrangement in which a plurality of liquid evaporators <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b</i>, and/or <b>14</b><i>c </i>are operatively disposed in an open reservoir, such as an open tank <b>12</b><i>a</i>, of the wastewater <b>12</b>. In this arrangement, the air pump <b>16</b> is located at the edge of the tank <b>12</b><i>a</i>, remote to each of the liquid evaporators <b>14</b><i>a/b/c</i>. Each liquid evaporator <b>14</b> <i>a</i>/b/c is operatively connected to the air pump <b>16</b> by means of one or more of the air supply lines <b>20</b>. Some of the liquid evaporators <b>14</b><i>a/b/c </i>are connected in series by the air supply lines <b>20</b> forming a multi-stage evaporation system. Others of the liquid evaporators <b>14</b><i>a/b/c </i>are connected in parallel by the air supply lines <b>20</b>. In other arrangements, a plurality of the liquid evaporators <b>14</b><i>d </i>may be similarly connected in parallel and/or in series to increase the evaporative capacity of the overall liquid evaporation system.</p>

In this arrangement, the waste heat source is low pressure steam exhausted from a turbine. Very generally, the power plant <b>90</b> uses a Rankin cycle that includes one or more boilers <b>92</b> that heat water to produce high pressure steam, one or more turbines <b>94</b> that use the high pressure steam to produce electricity, one or more condensers <b>96</b> that condense steam exiting the turbine(s) <b>94</b> back into liquid water, and one or more pumps <b>98</b> that pump the water to a higher pressure and send the water back to the boiler <b>92</b> to repeat the cycle. In this exemplary arrangement, low pressure steam exhausted from the turbine(s) <b>94</b> is also or alternatively conducted directly to the heat exchanger <b>22</b>, for example by supply pipes <b>100</b><i>a</i>. The exhaust steam is cycled through the heat exchanger <b>22</b> at the same time as the wastewater from the reservoir <b>12</b>. The exhaust steam warms the wastewater cycling through the heat exchanger. Water formed through condensation of the exhaust steam in the heat exchanger <b>22</b> is returned to the heater boiler <b>92</b>, for example through return pipes <b>100</b><i>b </i>that are operatively connected to the pump(s) <b>98</b>. Alternatively or additionally, low pressure steam used for other operations in the power plant <b>90</b> may be routed through the heat exchanger <b>22</b> to warm the wastewater cycling therethrough from the reservoir <b>12</b>.</p>

In this arrangement, a waste heat transfer circulation loop <b>110</b> operatively connects waste heat in the form of the exhaust of the boiler <b>92</b> with the heat exchanger <b>22</b> to circulate a heat transfer fluid, such as water, oil, and/or glycol, between the boiler <b>92</b> and the heat exchanger <b>22</b>. The waste heat transfer circulation loop <b>110</b> includes a heat exchanger <b>111</b> to collect heat energy from the combustion exhaust gases from the boiler <b>92</b>, supply piping <b>112</b><i>a </i>to pipe heated water from the heat exchanger <b>111</b> to the heat exchanger <b>22</b>, return piping <b>112</b><i>b </i>to return cooled water from the heat exchanger <b>22</b> back to the heat exchanger <b>111</b>, and one or more pumps <b>114</b> to circulate the heat transfer fluid through the loop <b>110</b>. The heat exchanger <b>111</b> may be located at any of many different process locations near the boiler <b>92</b> that produce waste heat at different temperatures, for example, ranging from approximately 250&#xb0; F. to approximately 800&#xb0; F., or higher or lower temperatures. Waste heat energy is transferred from the boiler <b>92</b> to the heat exchanger <b>22</b> by circulating the heat transfer fluid through the supply piping <b>112</b><i>a </i>and return piping <b>112</b><i>b </i>with the pump <b>114</b> in any sufficient manner.</p>

The vapor compression loop <b>120</b> includes a refrigerant that is directed along a piping loop <b>122</b> through an evaporator <b>124</b>, a compressor <b>126</b>, the heat exchanger <b>22</b>, an expansion valve <b>128</b>, and returning to the evaporator <b>124</b>. The evaporator <b>124</b> is arranged to transfer heat from the low pressure steam discharged from the turbine <b>94</b> and change the refrigerant from a liquid into a vapor. The compressor <b>126</b> is arranged to compress the heated refrigerant vapor to a higher pressure. The heat exchanger <b>22</b> is in the form of a condenser where heat from the compressed heated refrigerant vapor is transferred to the heating loop of the reservoir heater <b>18</b> and from thence to the reservoir <b>12</b>. After leaving the heat exchanger <b>22</b>, the cooled high pressure refrigerant is passed through the expansion valve <b>128</b> where the refrigerant is cooled and changes back to the liquid state. The cooled liquid refrigerant is then returned to the evaporator <b>124</b>, where the cycle is repeated. This arrangement allows the use of waste energy available at lower temperatures to heat the reservoir <b>12</b>. A similar arrangement may be used to recover waste heat energy from a low temperature combustion gas.</p>
