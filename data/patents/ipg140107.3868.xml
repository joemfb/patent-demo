<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method is performed at a multifunction device with a touch screen display. The method includes displaying a text entry interface with a soft keyboard in a first area and a viewing area with a first size to display scrollable information. The method detects a finger gesture on the viewing area, and responds to the gesture. When the viewing area displays only a portion of the information, the response includes: (1) ceasing to display the soft keyboard, (2) expanding the viewing area to a second size, including at least some of the first area, and (3) scrolling the information in the expanded viewing area. When the viewing area with the first size displays all of the information, the response includes: (1) maintaining display of the soft keyboard, (2) keeping the viewing area at the first size, and (3) moving the information in the viewing area based on the finger gesture.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosed embodiments relate generally to electronic devices with touch screen displays that present soft keyboards on the touch screen display. More particular, the disclosed embodiments relate to management of when a soft keyboard is displayed.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Multifunction devices with touch screen displays may utilize a soft keyboard on the display to facilitate text entry. A typical soft keyboard is an image on the display showing letters or other symbols, and may be arranged like the keys of an ordinary keyboard or typewriter. A user may use a finger to &#x201c;press&#x201d; the buttons on a soft keyboard, thus entering text or performing other actions.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One difficulty with a soft keyboard is that it occupies space on the display. This is particularly problematic when the touch screen is small, such as the screen on some portable handheld devices. The space occupied by the soft keyboard is not available for other objects or applications, such as information content, graphics, or interactive controls (e.g., buttons).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When a touch screen display has scrollable information, the presence of a soft keyboard can increase the time it takes to scroll to desired information. For example, each swipe to scroll the information is smaller, thus requiring more swipes to scroll the necessary amount.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, there is a need for multifunction devices that optimize a touch screen display by displaying or hiding a soft keyboard based on user actions. Such methods and interfaces may complement or replace conventional methods for displaying or hiding a soft keyboard. Such methods and interfaces reduce the cognitive burden on a user and produce a more efficient human-machine interface. For battery-operated multifunction devices, such methods and interfaces conserve power and increase the time between battery charges.</p>

In some embodiments, information is displayed on the touch screen display in a portrait view or a landscape view based on an analysis of data received from the one or more accelerometers.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments, the software components stored in memory <b>102</b> may include an operating system <b>126</b>, a communication module (or set of instructions) <b>128</b>, a contact/motion module (or set of instructions) <b>130</b>, a graphics module (or set of instructions) <b>132</b>, a text input module (or set of instructions) <b>134</b>, a Global Positioning System (GPS) module (or set of instructions) <b>135</b>, and applications (or set of instructions) <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The operating system <b>126</b> (e.g., Darwin, RTXC, LINUX, UNIX, OS X, WINDOWS, or an embedded operating system such as VxWorks) includes various software components and/or drivers for controlling and managing general system tasks (e.g., memory management, storage device control, power management, etc.) and facilitates communication between various hardware and software components.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The communication module <b>128</b> facilitates communication with other devices over one or more external ports <b>124</b> and also includes various software components for handling data received by the RF circuitry <b>108</b> and/or the external port <b>124</b>. The external port <b>124</b> (e.g., Universal Serial Bus (USB), FIREWIRE, etc.) is adapted for coupling directly to other devices or indirectly over a network (e.g., the Internet, wireless LAN, etc.). In some embodiments, the external port is a multi-pin (e.g., 30-pin) connector that is the same as, or similar to and/or compatible with the 30-pin connector used on iPod (trademark of Apple, Inc.) devices.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The contact/motion module <b>130</b> may detect contact with the touch screen <b>112</b> (in conjunction with the display controller <b>156</b>) and other touch sensitive devices (e.g., a touchpad or physical click wheel). The contact/motion module <b>130</b> includes various software components for performing various operations related to detection of contact, such as determining if contact has occurred (e.g., detecting a finger-down event), determining if there is movement of the contact and tracking the movement across the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., detecting one or more finger-dragging events), and determining if the contact has ceased (e.g., detecting a finger-up event or a break in contact). The contact/motion module <b>130</b> receives contact data from the touch-sensitive surface. Determining movement of the point of contact, which is represented by a series of contact data, may include determining speed (magnitude), velocity (magnitude and direction), and/or an acceleration (a change in magnitude and/or direction) of the point of contact. These operations may be applied to single contacts (e.g., one finger contacts) or to multiple simultaneous contacts (e.g., &#x201c;multitouch&#x201d;/multiple finger contacts). In some embodiments, the contact/motion module <b>130</b> and the display controller <b>156</b> detects contact on a touchpad. In some embodiments, the contact/motion module <b>130</b> and the controller <b>160</b> detects contact on a click wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The contact/motion module <b>130</b> may detect a gesture input by a user. Different gestures on the touch-sensitive surface have different contact patterns. Thus, a gesture may be detected by detecting a particular contact pattern. For example, detecting a finger tap gesture comprises detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting a finger-up event at the same position (or substantially the same position) as the finger-down event (e.g., at the position of an icon). As another example, detecting a finger swipe gesture on the touch-sensitive surface comprises detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting one or more finger-dragging events, and subsequently followed by detecting a finger-up event.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The graphics module <b>132</b> includes various known software components for rendering and displaying graphics on the touch screen <b>112</b> or other display, including components for changing the intensity of graphics that are displayed.

Some operations in method <b>600</b> may be combined and/or the order of some operations may be changed.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0152">As described below, the method <b>600</b> efficiently combines a soft keyboard for data entry on a touch screen device and a larger viewing area for faster scrolling of information on the touch screen display. Method <b>600</b> uses various criteria to determine when to display the soft keyboard and when to hide the soft keyboard for faster scrolling, thus enabling a user enter data and scroll to desired information more quickly. The method reduces the cognitive burden on a user during data entry and scrolling, thereby creating a more efficient human-machine interface. For battery-operated computing devices, enabling a user to scroll information more quickly and efficiently conserves power and increases the time between battery charges.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0153">The device displays a text entry interface on the touch screen display (<b>602</b>). The text entry interface includes a soft keyboard in a first area of the touch screen display, and a viewing area configured to display scrollable information (<b>602</b>).

The viewing area may display text input by a user with the soft keyboard as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5H-5N</figref>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5L</figref> shows a grocery list that has been entered by a user. The viewing area may display search results as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5G</figref>.

For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> a user has entered the letter &#x201c;A&#x201d; <b>506</b> in text input area <b>504</b>, and the multifunction device is displaying responsive search results. E.g., search results <b>508</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>508</b>-<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. In some embodiments, the scrollable information comprises instant messages (<b>608</b>). In some embodiments, the scrollable information comprises notes (<b>610</b>). For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5H</figref> illustrates a viewing area <b>548</b> with a grocery list. A grocery list is one example of a note. In some embodiments, the scrollable information comprises an email message (<b>612</b>) or other electronic document.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0155">The device detects (<b>614</b>) a first finger gesture on the viewing area. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows viewing area <b>508</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> displays a first finger gesture <b>512</b>, beginning with the finger at location <b>510</b>. In some embodiments, the finger gesture is a swipe gesture (<b>616</b>). In some embodiments, the finger gesture is a vertical swipe gesture (<b>618</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0156">The device responds (<b>620</b>) to the first finger gesture by performing several operations. First, the device ceases to display the soft keyboard. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> illustrates an embodiment with the soft keyboard <b>502</b> displayed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> illustrates a finger gesture <b>512</b> beginning at location <b>510</b>. In response to the finger gesture, the soft keyboard <b>502</b> has been hidden in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. In some embodiments, the device ceases to display the soft keyboard <b>502</b> as soon as a finger gesture has been detected. In some embodiments, the device ceases to display the soft keyboard a predetermined amount of time after a finger gesture has been detected (e.g., 10 milliseconds, 50 milliseconds, 40 milliseconds to 250 milliseconds, sec.).</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0157">The device further responds (<b>620</b>) to the first finger gesture by expanding the viewing area to a second size. The expanded viewing area includes at least part of the first area (i.e., the area originally occupied by the soft keyboard). For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows expanded viewing area <b>546</b>, expanding from viewing area <b>508</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. The expanded viewing area <b>546</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> includes all of the first area that was originally occupied by the soft keyboard <b>502</b>. Similarly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5I</figref> illustrates expanded viewing area <b>520</b>, which includes the viewing area <b>548</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5H</figref> and the first area that was previously occupied by the soft keyboard <b>502</b>. In some embodiments, the expanded viewing area does not include all of the first area.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0158">The device further responds (<b>620</b>) to the first finger gesture by scrolling the information in the expanded viewing area. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> shows the search results after scrolling the information displayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. As a result of the scrolling, the search results shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> are further in the alphabetical list. Similarly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5J</figref> illustrates an example of scrolling the grocery list partially shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5I</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0159">In some embodiments, the device redisplays the soft keyboard and shrinks the expanded viewing area from the second size back to the first size when the information in the expanded viewing area stops scrolling (<b>622</b>). In some embodiments, the device redisplays the soft keyboard and shrinks the expanded viewing area from the second size back to the first size when the information in the expanded viewing area stops scrolling for a predefined time (<b>624</b>). For example, the predefined time may be 0.2 seconds, 0.5 seconds, or 1.0 seconds. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5D and 5K</figref> illustrate redisplay of the soft keyboard <b>502</b> after the information stops scrolling (or stops scrolling for a predefined time). Further, the transition from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5J</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5K</figref> illustrates how the device shrinks the expanded viewing area <b>550</b> back to the viewing area <b>530</b> when the information stops scrolling (or stops scrolling for a predefined time).</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0160">In some embodiments, the text entry interface further comprises (<b>626</b>) a text input area on the touch screen display. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows exemplary text input area <b>504</b>, which shows the input &#x201c;A&#x201d; <b>506</b> entered by a user. In some embodiments, the device responds to detecting the first finger gesture by maintaining (<b>628</b>) display of the text input area on the touch screen display. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5E-5G</figref> illustrate maintaining display of text input area <b>552</b>. The text input area <b>552</b> is displayed in each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5E-5G</figref>, even though there has been a first finger gesture that scrolls the information in the viewing area. Similarly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5D</figref> illustrate maintaining display of the text input area <b>504</b> on the touch screen display. The text input area <b>504</b> is displayed in each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5D</figref>, even though there has been a first finger gesture, scrolling of information in the viewable area, and the soft keyboard was not displayed while the information was scrolling in the viewing area.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0161">In some embodiments, with a text input area, the device detects (<b>630</b>) a second finger gesture after scrolling information in the expanded viewing area. For example, the second finger gesture could be a finger tap gesture. For example, a finger tap gesture could be made in the text input area <b>504</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>. In some embodiments, with a text input area, the device responds (<b>632</b>) to the second finger gesture by redisplaying the soft keyboard and shrinking the expanded viewing area from the second size to the first size. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5C and 5D</figref> illustrate method <b>600</b> responding to a second finger gesture <b>562</b> in text input area <b>504</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>. In response to the second finger gesture, method <b>600</b> redisplays soft keyboard <b>502</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, and the expanded viewing area <b>554</b> with the second size shrinks back to the viewing area <b>556</b> with the first size.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0162"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7B</figref> are flow diagrams illustrating a method of scrolling employing smart keyboard management in accordance with some embodiments. The method <b>700</b> is performed at a multifunction device (e.g., device <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) with a touch screen display. Some operations in method <b>700</b> may be combined and/or the order of some operations may be changed.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0163">As described below, the method <b>700</b> efficiently combines a soft keyboard for data entry on a touch screen device and a larger viewing area for faster scrolling of information on the touch screen display. Method <b>700</b> uses various criteria to determine when to display the soft keyboard and when to hide the soft keyboard for faster scrolling, thus enabling a user enter data and scroll to desired information more quickly. The method reduces the cognitive burden on a user during data entry and scrolling, thereby creating a more efficient human-machine interface. For battery-operated computing devices, enabling a user to scroll information more quickly and efficiently conserves power and increases the time between battery charges.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0164">The device displays a text entry interface on the touch screen display (<b>702</b>). The text entry interface includes a soft keyboard in a first area of the touch screen display, and a viewing area configured to display scrollable information (<b>702</b>). The viewing area has a first size when the soft keyboard is being simultaneously displayed (<b>702</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows an exemplary soft keyboard <b>502</b>, which includes the letters of the alphabet, a space bar, and some function keys. The viewing area may display text input by a user with the soft keyboard as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5H-5N</figref>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5L</figref> shows a grocery list that has been entered by a user. The viewing area may display search results as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5G</figref>. For example, the contact lists in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5E</figref> are search results from a user query. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> has viewing area <b>508</b> displaying contacts <b>508</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>508</b>-<b>2</b>, and others. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref> has viewing area <b>532</b> displaying two contacts.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0165">In some embodiments, the viewing area is adjacent to the first area (<b>704</b>). For example, viewing area <b>508</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> is adjacent to the soft keyboard <b>502</b>, which is displayed in a first area. In some embodiments, the scrollable information comprises search results (<b>706</b>). For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> a user has entered the letter &#x201c;A&#x201d; <b>506</b> in text input area <b>504</b>, and the multifunction device is displaying responsive search results. In some embodiments, the scrollable information comprises instant messages (<b>708</b>). In some embodiments, the scrollable information comprises notes (<b>710</b>). For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5H</figref> illustrates a viewing area <b>548</b> with a grocery list. A grocery list is one example of a note. In some embodiments, the scrollable information comprises an email message (<b>712</b>) or other electronic document.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0166">The device detects (<b>714</b>) a first finger gesture on the viewing area. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows viewing area <b>508</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> displays a first finger gesture <b>512</b>, beginning with the finger at location <b>510</b>. In some embodiments, the finger gesture is a swipe gesture (<b>716</b>). In some embodiments, the finger gesture is a vertical swipe gesture (<b>718</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0167">The device responds to the first finger gesture in different ways depending on whether all of the scrollable information is displayed in the viewing area with the first size.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0168">When the viewing area with the first size displays only a portion of the scrollable information, the device responds (<b>720</b>) to the first finger gesture by performing several operations. First, the device ceases to display the soft keyboard. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> illustrates an embodiment with the soft keyboard <b>502</b> displayed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> illustrates a finger gesture <b>512</b> beginning at location <b>510</b>. In response to the finger gesture, the soft keyboard <b>502</b> has been hidden in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. Similarly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5H</figref> illustrates an embodiment with the soft keyboard <b>502</b> displayed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5I</figref> illustrates a finger gesture <b>524</b> beginning at location <b>522</b>. In response to the finger gesture, the soft keyboard <b>502</b> has been hidden in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5I</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0169">In some embodiments, the device ceases to display the soft keyboard <b>502</b> as soon as a finger gesture has been detected. In some embodiments, the device ceases to display the soft keyboard a predetermined amount of time after a finger gesture has been detected (e.g., 10 milliseconds, 50 milliseconds, or 40-250 milliseconds, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0170">The device further responds (<b>720</b>) to the first finger gesture by expanding the viewing area to a second size. The expanded viewing area includes at least part of the first area (i.e., the area originally occupied by the soft keyboard). For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows expanded viewing area <b>546</b>, expanding from viewing area <b>508</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. The expanded viewing area <b>546</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> includes all of the first area that was originally occupied by the soft keyboard <b>502</b>. Similarly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5I</figref> illustrates expanded viewing area <b>520</b>, which includes the viewing area <b>548</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5H</figref> and the first area that was previously occupied by the soft keyboard <b>502</b>. In some embodiments, the expanded viewing area does not include all of the first area.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0171">The device further responds (<b>720</b>) to the first finger gesture by scrolling the information in the expanded viewing area. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> shows the search results after scrolling the information displayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. As a result of the scrolling, the search results shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> are further in the alphabetical list. Similarly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5J</figref> illustrates an example of scrolling the grocery list partially shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5I</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0172">In some embodiments, the device redisplays the soft keyboard and shrinks the expanded viewing area from the second size back to the first size when the information in the expanded viewing area stops scrolling (<b>722</b>). In some embodiments, the device redisplays the soft keyboard and shrinks the expanded viewing area from the second size back to the first size when the information in the expanded viewing area stops scrolling for a predefined time (<b>724</b>). For example, the predefined time may be 0.2 seconds, 0.5 seconds, or 1.0 seconds. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5D and 5K</figref> illustrate redisplay of the soft keyboard <b>502</b> after the information stops scrolling (or stops scrolling for a predefined time). Further, the transition from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5J</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5K</figref> illustrates how the device shrinks the expanded viewing area <b>550</b> back to the viewing area <b>530</b> when the information stops scrolling (or stops scrolling for a predefined time).</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0173">In some embodiments, the text entry interface further comprises (<b>726</b>) a text input area on the touch screen display. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows exemplary text input area <b>504</b>, which shows the input &#x201c;A&#x201d; <b>506</b> entered by a user. In some embodiments, the device responds to detecting the first finger gesture by maintaining (<b>728</b>) display of the text input area on the touch screen display. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5E-5G</figref> illustrate maintaining display of text input area <b>552</b>. The text input area <b>552</b> is displayed in each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5E-5G</figref>, even though there has been a first finger gesture that scrolls the information in the viewing area. Similarly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5D</figref> illustrate maintaining display of the text input area <b>504</b> on the touch screen display. The text input area <b>504</b> is displayed in each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5D</figref>, even though there has been a first finger gesture, scrolling of information in the viewable area, and the soft keyboard was not displayed while the information was scrolling in the viewing area.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0174">In some embodiments, with a text input area, the device detects (<b>730</b>) a second finger gesture after scrolling information in the expanded viewing area. For example, the second finger gesture could be a finger tap gesture. For example, a finger tap gesture could be made in the text input area <b>504</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>. In some embodiments, with a text input area, the device responds (<b>732</b>) to the second finger gesture by redisplaying the soft keyboard and shrinking the expanded viewing area from the second size to the first size. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5C and 5D</figref> illustrate the device responding to a second finger gesture <b>562</b> in text input area <b>504</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>. In response to the second finger gesture, the device redisplays soft keyboard <b>502</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, and the expanded viewing area <b>554</b> with the second size shrinks back to the viewing area <b>556</b> with the first size.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0175">When the viewing area with the first size displays all of the scrollable information, the device responds (<b>734</b>) to the first finger gesture (e.g., contact <b>514</b> plus movement <b>516</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref> or contact <b>538</b> plus movement <b>540</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5L</figref>) by performing several operations. First, the device maintains (<b>734</b>) display of the soft keyboard. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5L</figref> the scrollable information (the grocery list) is all displayed in the viewable area <b>518</b> with the first size. Because all of the scrollable information is displayed in the viewable area with the first size, the soft keyboard <b>502</b> remains displayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5M</figref> as a user scrolls the grocery list. The soft keyboard further remains displayed after the scrolling is complete, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5N</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0176">Additionally, the device responds to the first finger gesture by keeping (<b>734</b>) the viewing area at the first size. For example, the viewing area <b>558</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5M</figref> is the first size (i.e., the size of viewing area <b>518</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5L</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0177">Additionally, the device responds to the first finger gesture by translating (<b>734</b>) all of the scrollable information in the viewing area in accordance with the first finger gesture on the viewing area. The transition from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5L</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5M</figref> shows an exemplary translation of the scrollable information. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5L</figref>, the grocery list is near the top of the viewing area <b>518</b>. Finger gesture <b>540</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5L</figref> caused the grocery list to translate downward in the viewing area in accordance with the finger gesture, as shown in viewing area <b>558</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5M</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5M</figref>, the user's finger lifts off the viewing area at location <b>542</b>, thus completing the finger gesture.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0178">In some embodiments, the device translates (<b>736</b>) all of the scrollable information in the viewing area in a first direction while the first finger gesture is detected on the touch screen display. As explained above, the transition from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5L</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5M</figref> shows the grocery list translated downward (a first direction) in accordance with the finger gesture <b>540</b> on the viewing area <b>518</b>. The device undoes the translation of all of the scrollable information in the viewing area in the first direction by translating all of the scrollable information in the viewing area in a direction opposite the first direction when the finger gesture is no longer detected on the touch screen display. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5L-5N</figref> illustrate an exemplary series of operations: the device translates the scrollable information in viewing area <b>518</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5L</figref> downward in accordance with finger gesture <b>540</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5L</figref>; then, after the finger lifts off at <b>542</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5M</figref>, the finger gesture is no longer detected, so the scrollable information in viewing area <b>558</b> is translated upward (opposite the first direction) as shown in the viewing area <b>560</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5N</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0179">Similarly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5E-5G</figref> illustrate an exemplary series of operations: the device translates the scrollable information in viewing area <b>532</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref> downward in accordance with finger gesture <b>516</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref>; then, after the finger lifts off at <b>534</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</figref>, the finger gesture is no longer detected, so the scrollable information in viewing area <b>532</b> is translated upward <b>536</b> (opposite the first direction) as shown in the viewing area <b>532</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5G</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0180">The steps in the information processing methods described above may be implemented by running one or more functional modules in information processing apparatus such as general purpose processors or application specific chips. These modules, combinations of these modules, and/or their combination with general hardware (e.g., as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B and <b>3</b>) are all included within the scope of protection of the invention.</p>
