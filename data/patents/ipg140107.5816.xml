<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One embodiment of the present disclosure can entail a computer-readable storage medium comprising computer instructions to receive a request from a client server for computing resources associated with a processor, determine an estimated completion time associated with previous requests associated with the processor, determine if a self-priority is assigned to the request by the client server where the self-priority designates an order of processing among requests from the client server to the processor, calculate a priority value for the request based on the estimated completion time and the self-priority, establish a processing schedule for the request and other requests associated with the processor based on the priority value, provide the request to the processor according to the processing schedule, receive a response from the processor where the response comprises information generated according to the request, and provide the response to the client server.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another embodiment of the present disclosure can entail a server having a controller to receive a request from a client server for computing resources associated with a processor, determine an estimated completion time associated with previous requests associated with the processor, calculate a priority value for the request based on the estimated completion time, establish a processing schedule for the request and other requests associated with the processor based on the priority value, and provide the request to the processor according to the processing schedule.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Yet another embodiment of the present disclosure can entail a method including generating a request at a client server for computing resources associated with a processor, transmitting the request to a scheduling server for prioritization of the request with respect to one or more other requests associated with the processor where the prioritization is based on an estimated completion time associated with previous requests associated with the processor, and receiving at the client server a response to the request from the scheduling server, where the response is generated by the processor based on the request.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The exemplary embodiment can include mediating requests to processor resources and an algorithm for providing scheduling of those requests. In one embodiment, the algorithm can take into account the client requested priority as well as the performance of the processor at processing the request. The performance can be adjusted in real-time. The mediating component can be tunable in a number of ways including by allowing a limited number of in-flight requests and a limited number of requests, per client, of a given priority.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts an illustrative embodiment of a first communication system <b>100</b> for delivering media content. The communication system <b>100</b> can represent an Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) broadcast media system. The IPTV media system can include a super head-end office (SHO) <b>110</b> with at least one super headend office server (SHS) <b>111</b> which receives media content from satellite and/or terrestrial communication systems. In the present context, media content can represent audio content, moving image content such as videos, still image content, or combinations thereof. The SHS server <b>111</b> can forward packets associated with the media content to video head-end servers (VHS) <b>114</b> via a network of video head-end offices (VHO) <b>112</b> according to a common multicast communication protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The VHS <b>114</b> can distribute multimedia broadcast programs via an access network <b>118</b> to commercial and/or residential buildings <b>102</b> housing a gateway <b>104</b> (such as a common residential or commercial gateway). The access network <b>118</b> can represent a group of digital subscriber line access multiplexers (DSLAMs) located in a central office or a service area interface that provide broadband services over optical links or copper twisted pairs <b>119</b> to buildings <b>102</b>. The gateway <b>104</b> can use common communication technology to distribute broadcast signals to media processors <b>106</b> such as Set-Top Boxes (STBs) which in turn present broadcast channels to media devices <b>108</b> such as computers or television sets managed in some instances by a media controller <b>107</b> (such as an infrared or RF remote control).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The gateway <b>104</b>, the media processors <b>106</b>, and media devices <b>108</b> can utilize tethered interface technologies (such as coaxial or phone line wiring) or can operate over a common wireless access protocol. With these interfaces, unicast communications can be invoked between the media processors <b>106</b> and subsystems of the IPTV media system for services such as video-on-demand (VoD), browsing an electronic programming guide (EPG), or other infrastructure services.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Some of the network elements of the IPTV media system can be coupled to one or more computing devices <b>130</b> a portion of which can operate as a web server for providing portal services over an Internet Service Provider (ISP) network <b>132</b> to wireline media devices <b>108</b> or wireless communication devices <b>116</b> by way of a wireless access base station <b>117</b> operating according to common wireless access protocols such as Wireless Fidelity (WiFi), or cellular communication technologies (such as GSM, CDMA, UMTS, WiMAX, Software Defined Radio or SDR, and so on).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It will be appreciated by an artisan of ordinary skill in the art that a satellite broadcast television system can be used in place of the IPTV media system. In this embodiment, signals transmitted by a satellite <b>115</b> supplying media content can be intercepted by a common satellite dish receiver <b>131</b> coupled to the building <b>102</b>. Modulated signals intercepted by the satellite dish receiver <b>131</b> can be submitted to the media processors <b>106</b> for generating broadcast channels which can be presented at the media devices <b>108</b>. The media processors <b>106</b> can be equipped with a broadband port to the ISP network <b>132</b> to enable infrastructure services such as VoD and EPG described above.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In yet another embodiment, an analog or digital broadcast distribution system such as cable TV system <b>133</b> can be used in place of the IPTV media system described above. In this embodiment the cable TV system <b>133</b> can provide Internet, telephony, and interactive media services.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one embodiment, the servers <b>130</b> can be network components or appliances that control access to computing resources. For example, the servers <b>130</b> can be placed between a requestor and a resource in order to provide throttling and queuing algorithms to control access to that resource. Requests to a resource can be queued by priority and the average time-of-flight for previous requests to that resource. This enables the request to be throttled based on near real-time information about the responsiveness of that resource. The servers <b>130</b> also allow user control through the use of user set priority. The servers <b>130</b> can manage access to a limited resource by a variety of requestors. In one embodiment, the servers <b>130</b> can provide for a single control point to that resource, such that access to the resource can be tuned based on traffic and required performance. Often each individual requestor application is responsible for queuing and throttling of requests, but each requestor does not have knowledge of other requestors. Alternately, the resource itself may be responsible for handling a large number of concurrent requests from a variety of requestors. Some resources are too low-level or specialized to adequately provide those services internally. The servers <b>130</b> can provide those services transparent to the resource as an external device placed between the requestors and the resource.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The servers <b>130</b> provide an external/decoupled method of providing throttling and queuing to a low-level or specialized resource that lacks those capabilities. The algorithm used allows user control of queuing through user defined priorities, but also take into account the near real-time behavior of the resource. If the resource is busy, requests to the resource can be throttled downward.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts an illustrative embodiment of a portal <b>202</b> which can operate from the computing devices <b>130</b> described earlier of communication system <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The portal <b>202</b> can be used for managing services of communication system <b>100</b>. The portal <b>202</b> can be accessed by a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) with a common Internet browser such as Microsoft's Internet Explorer&#x2122; using an Internet-capable communication device such as those described for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The portal <b>202</b> can be configured, for example, to access a media processor <b>106</b> and services managed thereby such as a Digital Video Recorder (DVR), a VoD catalog, an EPG, a personal catalog (such as personal videos, pictures, audio recordings, etc.) stored in the media processor, provisioning IMS services described earlier, provisioning Internet services, provisioning cellular phone services, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts an exemplary embodiment of a system <b>300</b> that can perform a number of functions, such as delivering media content, although the present disclosure is not intended to be limited thereto. System <b>300</b> can be overlaid or operably coupled with communication system <b>100</b> as another representative embodiment of said communication systems. System <b>300</b> can include a first server or client <b>310</b>, a second server or appliance <b>130</b> (e.g., a scheduling server) and a third server or source <b>350</b>. The client <b>310</b> can generate a request for a resource to be provided by the source <b>350</b>. For example, the source can be one or more of routers, switches, multiplexers and other components where sharing of limited resources is desired, without the risk of starvation.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">When an incoming resource request is received by the server <b>130</b>, it can be placed in the buffer (such as a database). The type of request and the target can be classified as R<sub>TX</sub>. The requested priority can also be recorded. The availability of the requested priority can be compared against the maximum number allowed in-flight for that client <b>310</b> and, based on that availability, assignment of the priority P&#x2032; can be performed. The value of t<sub>e </sub>(R<sub>TX</sub>) can then be calculated for the request. Concurrently, for each source server <b>350</b>, the buffer can be searched for requests targeted to that source server <b>350</b> with the minimum priority value. In one embodiment, requests can be sent while the number of in-flight requests for that source server <b>350</b> is less than the maximum defined for that source server <b>350</b>. The request can be received by the source server <b>350</b>, processed and returned to the server <b>130</b>. The server <b>130</b> can record the actual completion time (the time it was in-flight) and the response (e.g., the resulting data or resource) can then be returned to the client <b>310</b>. The estimated completion value can be adjusted dynamically based on the recent response for the given request type and source server <b>350</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts an illustrative method <b>400</b> operating in portions of communication systems <b>100</b> and <b>300</b>. Method <b>400</b> can begin with step <b>402</b> in which a first server generates a request for use of a computing resource. In step <b>406</b>, the request can be forwarded to an intermediate server or appliance by the first server. In step <b>408</b>, the intermediate appliance can process the request among a group of requests directed to the same computing resource as well as other computing resources.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, each dataflow can be weighted by its priority. For instance, P can be a Priority where P[0,9] and which follows the scheme of 0 being low priority with 9 being high priority. P&#x2032; can equal P<sub>max</sub>&#x2212;P (in this case 9&#x2212;P). For a particular request of type T, targeting Processor X, defined as R<sub>TX</sub>, we can calculate the estimated completion time, t<sub>e </sub>(R<sub>TX</sub>) as the average of the actual completion time of previously processed R<sub>TX</sub>. A window of time (previous 10 minutes, for example) or number of completed requests (only include previous 3, for example), can be established to include in this average, to allow a more real-time estimate of t<sub>e</sub>(R<sub>TX</sub>). The request can then be selected which has the minimum P&#x2032;t<sub>e</sub>(R<sub>TX</sub>) as the next request to be serviced by processor X.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Considering requests targeting a particular processor, X; since the highest priority, P<sub>max</sub>, will result in P&#x2032;t<sub>e</sub>(R<sub>TX</sub>)=0, requests with P<sub>max </sub>can be processed first (if there are multiple such requests, they can be serviced FIFO). Long running tasks, where previous requests have taken a long time to complete relative to other requests in the buffer, can be serviced after shorter running tasks of the same priority. In one embodiment, for requests targeting a particular processor all with priority P, Fair Queuing can be utilized, and if these requests are of the same type and arrive simultaneously, FIFO can be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Once the prioritization is determined then in step <b>410</b> the request can be forwarded to the source server. In step <b>412</b>, a response based on the request can be returned from the source server to the intermediate appliance. The response can be the data resulting from use of the computing resource. The response or result of the resource can then be provided to the requesting client in step <b>414</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The present disclosure can include external clients seeking to send requests to targeted processors, which will process the request and return it to the client. Requests can be mediated through the intermediate appliance to achieve efficient utilization of the limited resources provided by the processors. The data flow can include requests being generated from the clients, targeted to a particular, external processor; the request can be sent to the intermediate appliance; the intermediate appliance can forward requests to the processor that is specified in the request; the processors can process the request and return the response to the intermediate appliance; and the intermediate appliance can forward the response back to the clients.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The intermediate appliance can prioritize the requests such that a single processor is processing the most urgent requests in a timely manner, but also such that each client has a chance of utilizing the processor. It is worth noting that since responses are passed back through the intermediate appliance, calculation of an accurate time of completion of each request is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Upon reviewing the aforementioned embodiments, it would be evident to an artisan with ordinary skill in the art that said embodiments can be modified, reduced, or enhanced without departing from the scope and spirit of the claims described below. For example, clients may request a specific priority, so that a client may choose which of it's requests should be serviced first. The intermediate appliance may limit the overall number of in-flight requests (those sent to the processor, but which no response has been returned) to a given processor. The intermediate appliance may limit the number of in-flight requests with a requested priority from a particular client to a given processor. (For example Client-A may only be allowed to have 2 high priority Requests in-flight for Processor-X).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Other suitable modifications can be applied to the present disclosure without departing from the scope of the claims below. Accordingly, the reader is directed to the claims section for a fuller understanding of the breadth and scope of the present disclosure.</p>
