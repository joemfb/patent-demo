<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to the field of warehouse management systems and more particularly to using access point triangulation in assignment of tasks to warehouse employees.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Large warehouses storing a wide variety of items are typically managed by warehouse management systems (&#x201c;WMS&#x201d;) that are used to track inventories of items within the warehouse, receive and handle orders for those items, and assign warehouse employees to fill those orders. A WMS is often a complex software package that run on top of a relational database management system (&#x201c;RDBMS&#x201d;), such as the Oracle 10 g RDBMS. Oracle Warehouse Management is one example of such a package.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Generally speaking, when an order for an item stored in a warehouse is received, the WMS will assign a task, known as a pick task, to one or more warehouse employees to retrieve the item or items requested by the order from the warehouse to fill the order. One goal of the WMS application is to efficiently allocate tasks to the warehouse employees. Previously, such assignments were made largely at random. More recently, attempts have been made to improve the efficiency of job assignments. This is accomplished by dividing the warehouse into regions or zones with one or more employees assigned to a particular zone. The WMS then determines the zone in which a requested items is located and assigns a pick task for that item to the employee(s) assigned to that zone. That is, the task assignments are made on a per-zone basis.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, this approach is somewhat inefficient. More specifically, depending upon the items requested, some zones and the employees therein may be idle while other zones are over worked. For example, one item or type of item, such as holiday decorations or a particular toy, may be seasonally very popular. The employee or employees working in a warehouse zone in which such items are stored may be extremely busy filling orders for those items while employees in another zone may be idle.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Furthermore, such a system that assigns tasks on a per-zone basis does not take into consideration an employee's movements throughout the zone or the warehouse while performing various tasks. For example, an employee may move into and out of an assigned zone while performing a pick task or the zone may be vary large causing the employee to move a considerable distance to complete a task. Assigning the tasks based on the zone without consideration of an employees movements leads to inefficiencies since another employee may be closer to a requested item and can more easily fill a request for that item.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Some WMSs try to account for movement of the warehouse employees by allowing or requiring an employee to check into or out of a zone as the employee moves about. That is, the employees can check into a zone when they enter that area, thereby making themselves available for pick tasks within that zone. However, such a check-in and check-out system can actually compound inefficiencies. If an employee fails to check into a zone or check out of his previous zone, assignment of tasks becomes inaccurate and inefficient.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another approach has been to allow or require the employees to accept or requests new tasks. That is, the employees could request a task and the WMS would find one, either at random or based on the employee's zone, and assign the task to that employee. However, this can also be ineffective and/or inefficient since it can be heavily affected by employee morale and performance and does not address the other shortcomings of a zone-based system.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Hence, there is a need in the art for more efficient methods and systems for assigning tasks to warehouse employees.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Systems, methods, and machine-readable media are disclosed to assign one or more tasks to a plurality of warehouse employees. In one embodiment, a method is provided which comprises receiving an order for an item stored in a warehouse. A location of the item in the warehouse can be determined. A current location of each of the warehouse employees can be determined based on a strength of a signal from a wireless device assigned to each of the warehouse employees. The signal can be detected by at least two wireless access points at different location in the warehouse. At least one of the warehouse employees can be selected to fill the order based on the current location of each of the warehouse employees and the locations of the item. According to one embodiment, the method can further comprise adding a pick task identifying the requested item to an individual queue associated with the selected warehouse employee. The contents of the queue can be viewable by the selected warehouse employee via the wireless device assigned to the selected warehouse employee.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to another embodiment, the method can further comprise assigning a weighted distance score to each of the warehouse employees based on a distance between the location of the item and the current location of each of the warehouse employees. Selection of at least one of the warehouse employees to fill the order can be based on the weighted distance score. In further embodiments, the method can include determining a current workload for each of the warehouse employees based on a number of pending pick tasks assigned to each of the warehouse employees and assigning a weighted workload score to each of the warehouse employees based on the current workload for each of the warehouse employees. In yet another embodiment, the method can include determining one or more qualifications for each of the warehouse employees and assigning a weighted qualification score to each of the warehouse employees based on the one or more qualifications for each of the warehouse employees and one or more criteria for handling the item. Selection of at least one of the warehouse employees to fill the order can be based on the weighted distance score, the weighted workload score, and/or the weighted qualification score.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to yet another embodiment, the selection of at least one of the warehouse employees to fill the order further comprises determining whether the selected warehouse employee is available based on a time schedule for the selected warehouse employee.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to still another embodiment, the method of assign one or more tasks to a plurality of warehouse employees can further comprise determining whether the task has been completed within an allowed time. In response to determining that the task is not completed and the allowed time has expired, at least one new warehouse employee can be selected to fill the order.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to one embodiment of the present invention, a machine readable medium can have stored thereon a series of instructions which, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to assign one or more tasks to a plurality of warehouse employees by receiving an order for an item stored in a warehouse. A location of the item in the warehouse can be determined. A current location of each of the warehouse employees can be determined based on a strength of a signal from a wireless device assigned to each of the warehouse employees. The signal can be detected by at least two wireless access points at different location in the warehouse. At least one of the warehouse employees can be selected to fill the order based on the current location of each of the warehouse employees and the location of the item. According to one embodiment, a pick task identifying the requested item can be added to an individual queue associated with the selected warehouse employee. The contents of the queue can be viewable by the selected warehouse employee via the wireless device assigned to the selected warehouse employee.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to still another embodiment, a system can comprise a plurality of wireless access points, each wireless access point positioned at a different location in a warehouse. A plurality of wireless devices can be communicatively coupled with the wireless access points. Each wireless device can be assigned to a different warehouse employee. A warehouse management system can be communicatively coupled with the wireless access points. The warehouse management system can have a memory containing instructions which, when executed by the warehouse management system, cause the warehouse management system to assign one or more tasks to the plurality of warehouse employees by receiving an order for an item stored in the warehouse. A location of the item in the warehouse can be determined. A current location of each of the warehouse employees can be determined based on a strength of a signal from each wireless device as detected by at least two of the wireless access points. At least one of the warehouse employees can be selected to fill the order based on the current location of each of the warehouse employees and the location of the item. A pick task identifying the item can be added to an individual queue associated with the selected warehouse employee. The contents of the queue can be viewable by the selected warehouse employee via the wireless device assigned to the selected warehouse employee.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of various embodiments of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that embodiments of the present invention may be practiced without some of these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Embodiments of the present invention include methods, systems, and machine-readable media for determining how to assign tasks to warehouse employees. According to one embodiment of the present invention, &#x201c;pick tasks,&#x201d; i.e., tasks for collecting items from the warehouse to fill an order, can be assigned to one or more warehouse employees based on the employee's current location and his or her proximity to the requested item or items. In this way, assignment of tasks can be done on an individual basis rather than on a per-zone basis. Furthermore, according to other embodiments of the present invention, assignment of tasks may also be made in consideration of other factors in addition to the current location of the employees. For example, consideration can be given to the workload of each employee, individual qualifications of the employees to perform certain tasks, work schedules of each employee, etc. Again, such considerations are made on a per-employee basis rather than on a per-zone basis.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary warehouse for which results of various embodiments of the present invention may be utilized to assign tasks to warehouse personnel. This example illustrates a warehouse <b>100</b> that includes a number of rows <b>105</b>-<b>180</b> of shelves or other storage areas for organizing and storing items such as consumer goods, parts, raw materials, etc. Each row <b>105</b>-<b>180</b> may have a number of shelves or racks (not shown here) and each shelve or rack may have a number of bins <b>101</b>-<b>103</b> for organizing and storing items of different types. So, for example, warehouse <b>100</b> can contain a number of different types of products, each assigned to and stored in a particular row, rack, and bin.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The location, quantity and other information about items stored in the warehouse <b>100</b> can be tracked and maintained by a warehouse management system (not shown here). Generally speaking, the warehouse management system can receive orders for items stored in the warehouse <b>100</b> and then dispatch one or more employees <b>185</b> and <b>190</b> to retrieve the items and fill the orders. For example, when the warehouse management system receives an order for a particular item, it can determine that the item is stored in a particular bin <b>101</b>, on a particular shelf of a particular row <b>145</b> and assign a certain warehouse employee <b>185</b> to retrieve the ordered quantity of the item from that location and take it to a shipping area for packaging and shipping, thereby filling the order.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Each warehouse employee <b>185</b> and <b>190</b> can be assigned a portable wireless device through which he can receive such assignments or &#x201c;pick tasks.&#x201d; A plurality of wireless access points <b>195</b>-<b>198</b> can be positioned at a different location in the warehouse <b>100</b>. The wireless devices assigned to the employees <b>185</b> and <b>190</b> can be communicatively coupled with the wireless access points <b>195</b>-<b>198</b> via any of a variety of wireless media such as radio, infrared, etc. Additionally, the warehouse management system can be communicatively coupled, via wired or wireless communications media, with the wireless access points <b>195</b>-<b>198</b> to communicate with the wireless devices assigned to the employees <b>185</b> and <b>190</b>. Various types of commonly available wireless networks can be used to provide a communication link between the warehouse management system and the wireless devices of each employee. In this way, the warehouse management system can send a pick task to the wireless device of a given employee identifying a particular items, its location, and a quantity requested. The employee can view the pick task through the wireless device and, in some cases, use it to scan the items as he fills the order so that the inventory maintained by the warehouse management system can be updated.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to one embodiment of the present invention, the assignment of a pick task to an employee can be based on the current location of the employees <b>185</b> and <b>190</b> and the location of the item requested. In this case, when the warehouse management system receives an order for an item stored in the warehouse <b>100</b>, it can determine a location of the item in the warehouse <b>100</b> and determine a current location of each of the warehouse employees <b>185</b> and <b>190</b>. The current location of each employee <b>185</b> and <b>190</b> can be based on a strength of a signal from each wireless device as detected by at least two of the wireless access points <b>195</b>-<b>198</b>. That is, various types of commonly available wireless networks can give a signal strength indication for devices within range of a particular wireless access point. Such information from one wireless access point gives a vague idea of a general location of a particular device. However, the signal strength of a wireless device detected from two or more wireless access points can be used to triangulate or determine a more precise X,Y location of a particular device within the warehouse.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">At least one of the warehouse employees <b>185</b> or <b>190</b> can be selected to fill the order based on the current location (i.e., X,Y location within the warehouse) of each of the warehouse employees <b>185</b> and <b>190</b> and the locations of the items as stored in the warehouse management system in terms of an X,Y position within the warehouse <b>100</b>. That is, an employee can be selected based on being closest to the requested item. So, for example, employee <b>185</b> may be selected to fill an order for an item located in row <b>1</b> <b>105</b> since he is currently much closer to that item than employee <b>190</b>. The proximity of each employee <b>185</b> and <b>190</b> to a particular item can be determined by the Euclidean, rectilinear, Manhattan, L<sub>m </sub>or other measure of linear distance between the location of the requested item stored by the warehouse management system and the current location of each employee <b>185</b> and <b>190</b> as determined by the strength of the signals received by the wireless access points <b>195</b>-<b>198</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Once an employee is selected for the task, a pick task identifying the item, the items location, for example in terms of a rack, row, and bin, and the quantity requested can be added to an individual queue associated with the selected warehouse employee. The queue can be located in the wireless device of the employee and/or maintained separately by the warehouse management system. In either case, the contents of the queue can be viewed by the selected warehouse employee via the wireless device assigned to that employee.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram illustrating functional components of an exemplary system in which various embodiments of the present invention may be implemented. This example shows the warehouse management system <b>205</b>, a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) system <b>230</b>, a number of wireless access points <b>235</b>-<b>245</b>, and a number of portable wireless devices <b>250</b>-<b>255</b>. As noted above, the warehouse management system <b>205</b> can communicate via wireless access points <b>235</b>-<b>245</b> with portable wireless devices <b>250</b> and <b>255</b> assigned to each warehouse employee. As shown in this example communication between the warehouse management system <b>205</b> and the wireless access points <b>235</b>-<b>245</b> may be through WLAN system <b>230</b> such as a router or bridge.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The warehouse management system <b>205</b> can include a WLAN interface <b>210</b>, a scheduling module <b>215</b>, and one or more databases of information such as employee information <b>220</b> and warehouse information <b>225</b>. It should be understood that while this information is illustrated here as being in separate stores located within the warehouse management system, other configurations are possible and within the scope of the present invention. For example, employee information <b>220</b>, warehouse information <b>225</b>, and/or other information may be stored in a single or separate databases that are part of or separate from the warehouse management system <b>205</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Regardless of the exact configuration, the location, quantity and other information about items stored in the warehouse can be tracked and maintained by the warehouse management system <b>205</b>. Generally speaking, the warehouse management system <b>205</b> can receive orders for items stored in the warehouse and then dispatch one or more employees to retrieve the items and fill the orders. For example, when the warehouse management system <b>205</b> receives an order for a particular item, it can determine, based on information stored in warehouse information <b>225</b> that the item is stored in a particular bin on a particular shelf of a particular row and assign a certain warehouse employee to retrieve the ordered quantity of the item from that location and take it to a shipping area for packaging and shipping, thereby filling the order.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As discussed above, each warehouse employee <b>185</b> and <b>190</b> can be assigned a portable wireless device <b>250</b> and <b>255</b> through which he can receive such assignments or pick tasks. A plurality of wireless access points <b>235</b>-<b>245</b> can be positioned at a different locations in the warehouse. The portable wireless devices <b>250</b> and <b>255</b> assigned to the employees can be communicatively coupled with the wireless access points <b>235</b>-<b>245</b>. The warehouse management system <b>205</b> can be communicatively coupled with the wireless access points <b>235</b>-<b>245</b> via WLAN system <b>230</b> and/or WLAN interface <b>210</b> to communicate with the portable wireless devices <b>250</b> and <b>255</b>. That is, various types of commonly available wireless networks can be used to provide a communication link between the warehouse management system <b>205</b> and the portable wireless devices <b>250</b> and <b>255</b> of each employee. In this way, the warehouse management system <b>205</b> can send a pick task to the wireless device of a given employee identifying a particular item, its location in terms of, for example, a row, rack, and bin, and a quantity requested. The employee can view the pick task through the wireless device and, in some cases, use it to scan the items as he fills the order so that an inventory maintained in warehouse information <b>225</b> by the warehouse management system <b>205</b> can be updated.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to one embodiment of the present invention, the assignment of a pick task to an employee can be based on the current location of the employees and the location of the item requested. In this case, when the warehouse management system <b>205</b> receives an order for an item stored in the warehouse, it determines a location of the item in the warehouse from previously stored warehouse information <b>225</b> and determines a current location of each of the warehouse employees. The current location of each employee can be based on a strength of a signal from each portable wireless device <b>250</b> and <b>255</b> as detected by at least two of the wireless access points <b>235</b>-<b>245</b>. As mentioned above, various types of commonly available wireless networks can give a signal strength indication for devices within range of a particular wireless access point. The signal strength of a portable wireless device <b>250</b> detected from two or more wireless access points <b>235</b> and <b>240</b> can be used to triangulate or determine an X,Y location of the portable wireless device <b>250</b> within the warehouse using known techniques. Other wireless networks systems <b>230</b> are capable of providing an X,Y location of a wireless device in place of or in addition to a signal strength. In such a case, the warehouse management system <b>205</b> does not perform a triangulation based on the signal strength but rather reads the location from the network system <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some cases, the WLAN system <b>230</b> provides an Application Program Interface (API) or other interface that a system such as the warehouse management system <b>205</b> can use to discover the signal strength or location of one or more wireless devices <b>250</b> and <b>255</b>. In such a case, the warehouse management system <b>205</b> can determine the current location of each of the warehouse employees by requesting, invoking, calling, or otherwise initiating the signal strength or location features of the WLAN system <b>230</b>. In other cases, commonly available WLAN systems maintain a list or table of network attached devices and their current locations. In such cases, an API provided by the WLAN system <b>230</b> can be used by the warehouse management system <b>205</b> to read this information and discover the locations of the warehouse employees.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">At least one of the warehouse employees can be selected to fill the order based on the current location of each of the warehouse employees and the location of the item. That is, an employee can be selected based on being closest to the requested item. The proximity of each employee to a particular item can be determined by the Euclidean, rectilinear, Manhattan, L<sub>m </sub>or other measure of linear distance between the X,Y location in the warehouse of the requested item as stored by the warehouse management system <b>205</b> in warehouse information <b>225</b> and the current X,Y location in the warehouse of each employee as determined by the strength of the signals received by the wireless access points <b>195</b>-<b>198</b> or from location information received from WLAN system <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As will be discussed in greater detail below, selection of one or more employees to fill an order can also be based on additional information stored in employee information <b>220</b>. For example, employee information <b>220</b> may include but is not limited to, information regarding an employee's job qualifications, work schedule, current work load, etc. Such information, together with information related o the task to be assigned, can be used in combination with the location information in selection of the employee(s) to fill a particular order.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Once an employee is selected for the task, a pick task identifying the item, the item's location, and the quantity requested can be added to an individual queue associated with the selected warehouse employee. The queue can be located in the portable wireless device of the employee and/or maintained separately by the warehouse management system <b>205</b> such as in employee information <b>220</b>. In either case, the contents of the queue can be viewed by the selected warehouse employee via the portable wireless device assigned to that employee.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary computer system in which embodiments of the present invention may be implemented. This example illustrates a computer system <b>300</b> such as may be used, in whole, in part, or with various modifications, to provide a warehouse management system or a portable wireless device such as those discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The computer system <b>300</b> is shown comprising hardware elements that may be electrically coupled via a bus <b>355</b>. The hardware elements may include one or more central processing units (CPUs) <b>305</b>, one or more input devices <b>310</b> (e.g., a mouse, a keyboard, etc.), and one or more output devices <b>315</b> (e.g., a display device, a printer, etc.). The computer system <b>300</b> may also include one or more storage device <b>320</b>. By way of example, storage device(s) <b>320</b> may be disk drives, optical storage devices, solid-state storage device such as a random access memory (&#x201c;RAM&#x201d;) and/or a read-only memory (&#x201c;ROM&#x201d;), which can be programmable, flash-updateable and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The computer system <b>300</b> may additionally include a computer-readable storage media reader <b>325</b>, a communications system <b>330</b> (e.g., a modem, a network card (wireless or wired), an infra-red communication device, etc.), and working memory <b>340</b>, which may include RAM and ROM devices as described above. In some embodiments, the computer system <b>300</b> may also include a processing acceleration unit <b>335</b>, which can include a DSP, a special-purpose processor and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The computer-readable storage media reader <b>325</b> can further be connected to a computer-readable storage medium, together (and, optionally, in combination with storage device(s) <b>320</b>) comprehensively representing remote, local, fixed, and/or removable storage devices plus storage media for temporarily and/or more permanently containing computer-readable information. The communications system <b>330</b> may permit data to be exchanged with the network <b>320</b> and/or any other computer described above with respect to the system <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The computer system <b>300</b> may also comprise software elements, shown as being currently located within a working memory <b>340</b>, including an operating system <b>345</b> and/or other code <b>350</b>. It should be appreciated that alternate embodiments of a computer system <b>300</b> may have numerous variations from that described above. For example, customized hardware might also be used and/or particular elements might be implemented in hardware, software (including portable software, such as applets), or both. Further, connection to other computing devices such as network input/output devices may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Software <b>350</b> of computer system <b>300</b> may include code for determining how to more efficiently assign tasks to warehouse employees. As described above, pick tasks can be assigned to one or more warehouse employees based on the employee's current location and his proximity to the requested item of items. In this way, assignment of tasks are performed on an individual basis rather than on a per zone basis. Furthermore, according to other embodiments of the present invention, assignment of tasks may also be made in consideration of other factors in addition to the current location of the employees. For example, consideration can be given to the workload of each employee, individual qualifications of the employees to perform certain tasks, work schedules of each employee, etc. Again, such considerations are made on a per-employee basis rather than on a per-zone basis.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart illustrating, at a high level, a task assignment process according to one embodiment of the present invention. In this example, a method of assigning one or more tasks to a plurality of warehouse employees comprises receiving <b>405</b> an order for an item stored in a warehouse. Generally speaking, the order can indicate one or more items requested and the quantity of each item.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A location of the item in the warehouse can be determined <b>410</b>. The location, i.e., the row, rack, and bin as well as the X,Y coordinates, can be determined from the warehouse information stored by the warehouse management system. For example, when an item is added to the warehouse, the location in which it is stored, both in terms of the rack, row, and bin or other easily identifiable manner, as well as the X,Y location within the warehouse can be stored in one or more databases or other information stores. This information can then be searched or retrieved when an order is received for that item.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A current location of each of the warehouse employees in terms of an X,Y location within the warehouse can be determined <b>415</b>. As discussed above, this determination can be based on a strength of a signal from a wireless device assigned to each of the warehouse employees as detected by at least two wireless access points at different location in the warehouse. The location of each device can be triangulated based on the signal strength using common methods. Alternatively or additionally, the location of each wireless device can be read from a wireless network system supporting the wireless devices.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">One or more of the warehouse employees can then be selected <b>420</b> to fill the order. According to one embodiment, this selection <b>420</b> can be based on the current location of each of the warehouse employees and the location of the item. That is, an employee can be selected to fill an order or part of an order based on his proximity to an item requested in the order. The employees proximity to the item can be determined based on Euclidean, rectilinear, Manhattan, L<sub>m </sub>or other measure of linear distance between the known location of the item in the warehouse and the employee's current location. As will be discussed in greater detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, additional criteria may also be considered in the selection <b>420</b> of warehouse employees to fill the order.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Once an employee or employees are selected, a pick task identifying the item can be added <b>425</b>, i.e., inserted, into an individual queue associated with the selected warehouse employee(s). The contents of the queue can be viewed by the selected warehouse employee via the wireless device assigned to that employee.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Optionally, the method can further comprise determining <b>430</b> and <b>435</b> whether the task has been completed within an allowed time. If <b>430</b> the task has not been completed and the allowed time has expired <b>435</b>, at least one new warehouse employee can be selected <b>440</b> to fill the order. That is, the pick task may be removed from the original selected employee's queue and the task can be reassigned by a new selection process or by using results of the previous selection <b>420</b> process.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a process for selecting warehouse personnel to fill an order according to one embodiment of the present invention. As noted above, the selection process generally includes consideration of the current location of each warehouse employee and his proximity to the requested item(s). However, additional factors may also be considered. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an example including a number of additional factors.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In this example, selection begins by determining <b>505</b> current locations of each of the warehouse employees <b>505</b>. As discussed above, this determination can be based on a strength of a signal from a wireless device assigned to each of the warehouse employees as detected by at least two wireless access points at different location in the warehouse. A weighted distance score can be assigned <b>510</b> to each of the warehouse employees based on a distance between the location of the item and the current location of each of the warehouse employees. That is, the location of each employee can be assigned a score based on his proximity to the requested item. The score can be also be given a customizable weight relative to the other factors to be considered.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">According to one embodiment, the selection process can optionally include determining <b>515</b> a current workload for each of the warehouse employees. This determination <b>515</b> can be based on a number of pending pick tasks assigned to each of the warehouse employees, i.e., the number of pick tasks in the employee's queue. A weighted workload score can be assigned <b>520</b> to each of the warehouse employees based on the current workload for each of the warehouse employees. The score can be also be given a customizable weight relative to the other factors to be considered.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The selection process can also comprise determining <b>525</b> one or more qualifications for each of the warehouse employees. Such qualifications can be related to the employee's ability or qualification to perform certain tasks or handle certain items. For example, some employees may be qualified to operate certain equipment such as forklifts or cranes while others are not. In another example, some employees may be qualified to handle certain types of materials such as hazardous materials while others are not. The requirements for handling a particular requested item can be determined based on information maintained by the warehouse management system. Therefore, the requirements for a requested item can be read from this information and each employee can be scored against these requirements based on his qualifications. A weighted qualification score can then be assigned <b>530</b> to each of the warehouse employees based on the one or more qualifications for each of the warehouse employees and one or more criteria for handling the item. The score can be also be given a customizable weight relative to the other factors to be considered.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The score for each of the selection factors can then be accumulated <b>535</b> to form an overall score. One or more of the warehouse employees can then be selected <b>540</b> to fill the order based on the accumulated score.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a process for selecting warehouse personnel to fill an order according to an alternative embodiment of the present invention. In this example, selection begins by determining <b>605</b> current location of each of the warehouse employees. A weighted distance score can be assigned <b>610</b> to each of the warehouse employees based on a distance between the location of the item and the current location of each of the warehouse employees. That is, the location of each employee can be assigned a score based on his proximity to the requested item. The score can be also be given a customizable weight relative to the other factors to be considered.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to one embodiment, the selection process can also include determining <b>615</b> a current workload for each of the warehouse employees. This determination <b>615</b> can be based on a number of pending pick tasks assigned to each of the warehouse employees. A weighted workload score can be assigned <b>620</b> to each of the warehouse employees based on the current workload for each of the warehouse employees. The score can be also be given a customizable weight relative to the other factors to be considered.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The selection process can also comprise determining <b>625</b> one or more qualifications for each of the warehouse employees. Such qualifications can be related to the employee's ability or qualification to perform certain task or handle certain items. The requirements for handling a particular requested item can be determined based on information maintained by the warehouse management system. Therefore, the requirements for a requested item can be read from this information and each employee can be scored against these requirements based on his qualifications. A weighted qualification score can then be assigned <b>630</b> to each of the warehouse employees based on the one or more qualifications for each of the warehouse employees and one or more criteria for handling the item. The score can be also be given a customizable weight relative to the other factors to be considered.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The score for each of the selection factors can then be accumulated <b>635</b> to form an overall score and one or more of the warehouse employees can then be selected <b>640</b> to fill the order based on the accumulated score.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">According to one embodiment, selecting at least one of the warehouse employees to fill the order can further comprise determining <b>645</b> whether the selected warehouse employee is available based on a time schedule for the selected warehouse employee. That is, the warehouse management system can maintain a work schedule or other time requirements for each employee. For example, one employee may work from 7 AM to 4 PM with a one hour lunch break from 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM. Therefore, he may be removed from consideration or selection outside of his working hours or during his lunch break. Alternatively or additionally, an employee may be considered unavailable for new tasks a short time prior to scheduled breaks or quitting times since the employee may not have time to complete the task. The amount of time may vary depending on the size of the warehouse, the expected time to complete a given task, the nature and/or complexity of a task, etc. Furthermore, an employee may be considered available for new tasks a short time prior to a scheduled start time so that tasks may be available for him immediately upon starting.</p>
