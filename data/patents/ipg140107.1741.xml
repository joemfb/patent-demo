<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A dermal punch for extracting skin or tissue samples. The dermal punch has a blade having a pair of walls. Each wall is convex and opens towards each other. The walls are connected to each other at a pair of mating edges. Each wall has a cutting edge. In a preferred embodiment, the ratio of the minor axis to the major axis of the opening created by the walls is between 1 to 3 and 1 to 4, wherein the major axis extends through the mating edges. The cutting edge is formed of a plurality of teeth and the teeth have a sawtooth shape. The cutting edge has a projecting edge for each wall, and the projecting edge is concave. The cutting length is greater than twice the length of the projecting edge.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Thousands of people are tested annually for melanoma, basal cell, squamous cell, and carcinogens, other abnormal skin growths (&#x201c;moles&#x201d;) and cancers, as well as bacterial or fungal skin infections. One of the most common tests of a skin lesion for diagnostic purposes is a dermal punch biopsy. This procedure entails the insertion of an instrument with a circular blade into the patient's skin and then subsequently rotating the instrument</p>
<p id="h-0003" num="0000">to cut out and remove the skin patch of interest. This provides tissue for microscopic analysis by a pathologist to obtain the correct diagnosis. This technique is nearly 100% effective, and accurate and is consequently widely used.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Although effective, this traditional punch biopsy usually leaves the wound open resulting in delayed healing and unsightly scars. The wound can result in scars that resemble &#x201c;pock-marks&#x201d; or &#x201c;divets.&#x201d; If the skin excision is large, the resultant wound can be closed by stitching but because of the circular shape of the wound, it can leave an uneven skin edge.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The preferred embodiments of the invention relate to a dermal punch and a method of using it to extract tissue samples. In a preferred embodiment, the dermal punch has a handle portion and a blade having a pair of walls. The walls can have an external convex surface that are connected to each other at a pair of mating edges. Each wall has a distal cutting edge surrounding a cavity that defines the area of removal.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a preferred embodiment, the ratio of the minor axis to the major axis of the opening or cavity defined by the walls is at least 1 to 2 and preferably between 1 to 3 and 1 to 4, wherein the major axis extends through the mating edges. As the size and shape of the lesion to be removed can vary, a variety of dermal punches of selected ratios and removal areas can be available depending on the anatomy and orientation of the specific site requiring biopsy, such as in a kit. The kit can include a single handle and a plurality of distal punch elements that can be mounted and detached from the handle as needed or individually mounted punches.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a preferred embodiment, the cutting edge is formed of a plurality of teeth. The teeth can have a sawtooth shape, for example. In one embodiment, the distal tip of the teeth defines a projecting edge for each wall, and the projecting edge is convex or concave. The cutting length is greater than twice the length of the projecting edge for each wall.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a preferred method, the cutting edge is positioned relative to a selected patch of skin. The skin is punctured by the cutting edge on the dermal punch by pushing the dermal punch into the skin. The dermal punch is removed from the body by pulling the dermal punch in a motion perpendicular to the skin. The dermal punch can also be tilted such that a portion of a cutting edge cuts laterally through the fat underlying the portion of skin being removed to aid in removal.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one method, the positioning includes placing the apex of each projecting edge in contact with the skin, with the selected patch of skin to be excised interposed between each apex. The distal end is then manually inserted through the skin and rotated or rocked to sever the sample from the underlying layer. The wound in the skin is then closed. One method of closing is to use a medical glue or adhesive. Another method of closing uses a surgical staple. Another method uses surgical tape closure to pull the edges together.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a preferred embodiment, the distal ends of the walls are tapered in towards the center axis of the handle. In another, the spacing between the walls or the angle of the taper is adjustable. In one embodiment, the dermal punch includes a mechanism for closing the wound. The mechanism can be a device for applying a medical glue or adhesive. In another embodiment, the mechanism is a device for applying at least one staple or a suture.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Although effective, a traditional punch biopsy usually leaves the wound open, resulting in delayed healing and unsightly scars. The open wound results in scars that resemble &#x201c;pock-marks.&#x201d; If the skin excision is large, the resultant wound can be closed by stitching. The dermal punch according to the invention forms a would with clean edges. A fusiform or spindle shape of an embodiment of the dermal punch with a distal taper can facilitate healing of the wound with minimal or no pocking on the skin.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to the drawings in detail, where like numerals indicate like elements, a dermal punch is illustrated in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention designated generally as <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> show a perspective view and a bottom view respectively of a prior art dermal punch <b>30</b>. The dermal punch <b>30</b> has a circular end <b>32</b> with a blade edge <b>34</b>. The blade edge <b>34</b> defines a circular opening <b>35</b> which corresponds to the area of removal and is placed in engagement with a portion of the patient's skin <b>36</b> and rotated to excise the skin sample <b>38</b> of interest, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Typically, the skin sample <b>38</b> is connected to the body by adhesion to the underlying fat layer. The skin patch <b>38</b> is removed from the body by a pair of forceps or a sharp object such as a needle.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows a wound <b>40</b> created by the removal of the skin patch <b>38</b> by the prior art dermal punch <b>30</b>. The circular wound <b>40</b> is either left to heal on its own or is closed using sutures. Regardless, the wound <b>40</b> results in a deformity, such as a scar, for example, that resembles a pock-mark <b>40</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 2C</figref> if the wound is left to heal on its own. If sutures are used, the dimple resembles a noticeable &#x201c;dog ear&#x201d; scar <b>42</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The dermal punch <b>20</b> according to a preferred embodiment of the invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>A, and <b>4</b>B. The dermal punch <b>20</b> has a cutting or blade edge <b>22</b> that is not all located in a single plane. The cutting edge <b>22</b> is formed by a plurality of teeth that can be located at various vertical heights. The dermal punch <b>20</b> has a handle <b>23</b>, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the dermal punch <b>20</b> has a projecting edge <b>24</b> that is defined by the distal tips of the teeth. The dermal punch <b>20</b> can be a pair of walls <b>26</b>, such as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. The walls <b>26</b> have an external convex surface that are connected to each other at a pair of mating edges <b>28</b>. Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a. longitudinal axis <b>50</b> is defined by the interface of the cutting edge <b>22</b> with the mating edges <b>28</b>. A vertical axis <b>52</b> intersects the longitudinal axis <b>50</b> and is interposed between the mating edges <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">While the above refers to a pair of walls with a pair of mating edges, it is recognized that the walls can be formed by several methods including welding of two convex pieces or drawing an integral tube to the desired shape.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In this embodiment, the projecting edge <b>24</b> has a convex shape with a portion that extends the furthest distally, being spaced equidistant from the mating edges <b>28</b> and located the furthest from the longitudinal axis <b>50</b>. This point on each wall <b>26</b> is defined as an apex <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The dermal punch <b>20</b> has a sawtooth or serrated edge <b>56</b> wherein each tooth <b>56</b> has a tip <b>58</b> positioned on the projection edge <b>24</b> and a root <b>60</b> interposed between each tooth <b>56</b> as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The sawtooth <b>56</b> has a knife edge <b>62</b> on the tooth surface <b>62</b> for cutting. The knife edge <b>62</b> on the tooth surface increases the cutting length, which is the length on the dermal punch that is capable of cutting the skin.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In a preferred embodiment, the knife edge has one surface shaped similar to a number <b>11</b> scalpel blade. The sawtooth shape with a knife edge extends between adjacent tips <b>58</b> and roots <b>60</b> therein allowing for an increased cutting length. In a preferred embodiment, the cutting length is greater than twice the length of the projecting edge <b>24</b>. It is recognized that the projecting edge is a projection and not a physical edge and extends from tip to tip of the saw teeth. In one preferred embodiment, the cutting length is in a range of 2 to 4 times the length of the projection edge.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In addition, the cutting edge <b>22</b> of the dermal punch <b>20</b> is formed by the pair of walls that have an external convex surface and engage each other at the mating edges <b>28</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. The two walls <b>26</b> each contain the convex shaped projection edge <b>24</b> with the sawtooth shape. These two convex walls <b>26</b> define an angle at the mating edges.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an enlarged side view of eight sawteeth of the cutting edge <b>22</b> of the dermal punch <b>20</b> in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention is shown. The cutting edge <b>22</b> of the sawtooth has each tip located along the projecting edge <b>24</b>. Each tooth is oriented such that a vertical axis extending from the tip of the tooth extends through the base of the tooth, and preferably at the center or in proximity to the center of the base. The bevel of the cutting edge is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In a preferred embodiment, the dermal punch <b>20</b> has 12 to 18 teeth per wall <b>26</b>. Each tooth has a tip angle of &#x3b2; that in one embodiment is in a range of 15&#xb0; to 35&#xb0; and in a preferred embodiment is in a range of 22&#xb0; to 28&#xb0;. In addition, the root angle is &#x3b3; and is in a range of 15&#xb0; to 35&#xb0; and in a preferred embodiment is in a range of 22&#xb0; to 28&#xb0;. Each of the two surfaces has a knife or cutting edge <b>62</b> as indicated above. In an embodiment, the knife edge <b>60</b> is shaped like a number <b>11</b> scalpel blade. In one embodiment, the knife edge is like a number <b>11</b> scalpel blade, with the knife edge, looking in cross section of the wall, extending from one surface to the other surface. In another embodiment, a pair of knife edge looking in cross section of the wall, each extend from the center line to another surface.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, a bottom enlarged view of the dermal punch <b>20</b> is shown in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The two walls <b>26</b> are connected to each other at the mating edges <b>28</b>. The two walls <b>26</b> define an angle &#x3b1; at the edges <b>28</b>. The angle &#x3b1; in a preferred embodiment is between 75&#xb0; and 115&#xb0;, and in the example discussed herein is 90&#xb0;. The ratio of the major axis <b>70</b> to that of the minor axis <b>72</b> is preferably between a range of 3 to 1 and 4 to 1. In one preferred embodiment, the major axis <b>70</b> has a length of 6 millimeters and the minor axis <b>72</b> is 2 millimeters. Therefore, the ratio of major axis to minor axis is 3 to 1. In the illustrated embodiment, the overall depth from the apex <b>54</b> to the longitudinal axis <b>50</b>, the location of the highest root <b>60</b>, is 2 millimeters. The greatest distance between the tip <b>58</b> and the adjacent root <b>60</b> of the teeth <b>56</b> is 1 millimeter. The opening <b>64</b> between the pair of walls <b>26</b> receives the sample tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The walls <b>26</b> define an opening <b>64</b> that has a fusiform or spindle shape. A major axis <b>70</b> of the opening <b>64</b> extends from one mating edge <b>28</b> to the other mating edge <b>28</b>. A minor axis <b>72</b> extends from one wall <b>26</b> to the other wall <b>26</b> perpendicular to the major axis <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">It is recognized that in certain embodiments that the distance between the tip <b>58</b> and the adjacent root <b>60</b> is greater than 1 millimeter, such as 1.5 millimeters in an embodiment for thick skin of the back or for &#x201c;excision&#x201d; of larger lesions mitigating the need for a scalpel excision.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> is a side view of the dermal punch <b>20</b> of a preferred embodiment of the invention. The mating edge <b>28</b> between the two walls <b>26</b> extends vertically. The two walls <b>26</b> each have a convex shape projecting outward from the mating edge <b>28</b> to the point where the apex <b>54</b> from the projection edge is furthest from the longitudinal axis <b>50</b> which projects in and out of the paper in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> shows the walls in proximity to the cutting surfaces tapering towards each other. It is recognized that the walls can be parallel to each other in certain embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The dermal punch <b>20</b> is positioned next to the skin so that the apex <b>54</b> of each of the walls is positioned so that the skin to be tested is positioned between the walls. The dermal punch <b>20</b> is pushed into the skin with a vertical and slightly rocking motion until the roots of all of the teeth have entered the skin (i.e. until the longitudinal axis <b>50</b> is in the same plane as the surface of the skin.)</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The tips of the teeth engage and puncture the skin. As the dermal punch <b>20</b> is pushed into the skin, the cutting edge slices the skin (tissue) in a region of interest. The teeth provide a longer cutting surface and require less pressure to excise the sample. Therein, the dermal punch <b>20</b> is capable of producing a tissue sample with side walls or edges that are near perpendicular to the upper surface of the skin. The angle of sidewalls can vary slightly from a perpendicular orientation to facilitate bringing the skin edges together when closing the biopsy site. In that the dermal punch does not need to be rotated to cut the tissue sample, the fusiform-spindle-shape can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The resulting wound from the dermal punch <b>20</b> has a smooth shape similar to the shape of a dermal punch as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. Therefore, the resulting closed wound forms a line as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> as compared to the dog ear illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, resulting from the wound mark as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. In addition, the sample that is to be removed from the skin, such as a skin growth, or a mole, or portion thereof, typically does not have a circular shape. The long axis or major axis <b>70</b> of the opening <b>64</b> of the dermal punch <b>20</b> can be oriented with respect to the largest dimension of the mole or tissue sample to be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment dermal punch <b>80</b> in accordance with the invention. The dermal punch <b>80</b> has a pair of walls <b>26</b> that are connected at a single point <b>82</b> on a mating edge <b>28</b>. The single point, a movable hinge <b>82</b>, allows the two pairs of walls <b>26</b> to move relative to each other. Therefore, the pair of walls <b>26</b> with the cutting edge <b>22</b> are pushed into the skin to cut the skin generally in the shape of the opening <b>64</b> formed by the convex shape of the two walls <b>26</b>. In most cases the tissue that has been cut will adhere to the dermal punch where one side of the blade works to &#x201c;hook&#x201d; the tissue for removal from the body. Occasionally the sample will remain adhered to the body through the underlying fat layer. In order to facilitate the removal of the skin sample <b>38</b>, the upper edge <b>86</b> of the walls <b>26</b> of the dermal punch <b>80</b> are moved apart from each other therein allowing the blade or cutting edges <b>22</b> to move closer together. Even the slightest movement of the apexes <b>54</b> of the walls <b>76</b> changes the shape of the opening <b>64</b> relative to the skin sample <b>38</b> causing the grabbing and retention of the skin sample <b>38</b>. Relaxation of the side walls allows the sample to be easily deposited in a specimen cup.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the alternative, a dermal punch <b>90</b> is formed such that a pair of walls <b>26</b> are formed in a similar shape to that discussed above, however, the walls <b>26</b> are joined at a point <b>92</b> only at the mating edge <b>28</b> at the upper edge <b>86</b>, i.e., the edge furthest from the cutting or blade edge <b>22</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. After being inserted into the body to excise the tissue or skin sample <b>38</b> from the remaining skin, the walls <b>26</b> of the dermal punch <b>90</b> are squeezed below the point <b>92</b> to move the free edges, i.e., the cutting edges <b>22</b> of each wall towards each other to reduce the space between the pair of walls <b>26</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> shows the pair of walls <b>26</b> at a position when the dermal punch <b>90</b> is inserted into the skin to create the straight vertical cuts. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> shows the relative position of the walls <b>26</b> when the walls are moved together to allow removal of the skin patch <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the saw teeth or serrated edges <b>56</b> are shown with the tip extending further down as they are further away from the mating edge <b>28</b>, wherein the apex, equally spaced from the mating edges <b>28</b>, is the farthest projection from the longitudinal axis <b>50</b>. In contrast, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows an alternative embodiment wherein the point <b>102</b>, i.e., tip, that projects the furthest from the longitudinal axis <b>50</b>, similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a point being equally distant from the mating edges <b>28</b>. However, the second furthest projecting point <b>104</b> from the longitudinal axis <b>50</b> is in proximity to the mating edge <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">When the dermal punch <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is placed into contact with the skin, the point <b>102</b> on each of the walls <b>26</b> that are equally distant from the mating edge <b>28</b> touch and puncture the skin first. This is similar to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. In contrast, the next points <b>104</b> are each in proximity to the mating edges <b>28</b>. Therefore instead of cutting in two directions away from each apex, the skin is initially cut at four separate and distinct positions i.e., the apexes and the mating edges <b>28</b> and the cuts move towards each other as the dermal punch <b>100</b> is inserted. The cutting from the &#x201c;four corners&#x201d; retains the tissue in position as it is cut.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In a preferred embodiment, the distance between the apex and the longitudinal axis, the location of the highest root is 1 millimeter. The vertical position of the tips do not vary as greatly as the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">After the skin sample <b>38</b> from the area of interest is removed from the body, the wound may be closed using traditional &#x201c;stitching.&#x201d; Alternatively, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows an alternative embodiment of a dermal punch <b>120</b>. The dermal punch <b>120</b> has the cutting edges <b>22</b> at one end and a medical glue or adhesive dispenser <b>122</b> located at the other end so that the surgeon can simply turn the tool around to apply a medical adhesive such as DERMABOND&#xae; marketed by Ethicon, Inc. The medical adhesive dispenser <b>122</b> can be used with other embodiments of the dermal punch. The distal end of the walls <b>26</b> of the dermal punch <b>120</b> are compressed to allow a flow of the medical adhesive to be applied to the wound in thin layers.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">An alternative method of closing the wound is to staple or &#x201c;clip&#x201d; the wound. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows an alternative embodiment of a dermal punch <b>130</b>. The dermal punch <b>130</b> has a mechanism <b>138</b> that retains at least one staple or clip <b>132</b> and is located at one end of the dermal punch <b>130</b> opposite to that of the cutting edge <b>22</b>. The mechanism <b>138</b> has a retainer <b>140</b> for holding the staple <b>132</b> and a crimping bar <b>142</b>. The crimping bar <b>142</b> slides to bend the staple <b>132</b> and interacts with the retainer <b>140</b> to release the staple <b>32</b>. Whether closed by stitching, adhesive, staple, or tape, the dermal punch according to the invention reduces or eliminates scar depression.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">An alternative embodiment of a dermal punch <b>150</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref>. The dermal punch has a sawtooth or serrated edge similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, but in addition has a set of secondary sawtooth edges that are shorter and interposed between the longer teeth.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">It is recognized that the dermal punch can have all the tips equally distant from the longitudinal axis, the longitudinal axis being defined as the location of the highest root. It is also recognized that the dermal punch can have all the roots of the teeth located on the longitudinal axis.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the dermal punch or a portion thereof is disposable and is formed of plastic and has a stainless steel cutting edge. It is recognized that the dermal punch can be formed of materials such as, for example, stainless steel or plastic, that are bio-compatible, cart hold an edge and cut sharply.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Preferred embodiments of the present invention can include a kit having dermal punches of selected sizes and removal areas to accommodate the different sizes and shapes of lesions. The kit can include a single handle with a plurality of distal punch elements that can be mounted and detached as needed or a plurality of dermal punches of different sizes that are each packaged in separate sterilized packages for single use.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">It is recognized that the dermal punch can, in an embodiment, have the convex walls with a smooth cutting edge without sawteeth or serrated edge. This is illustrated, for example, in the embodiment illustrated in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref>. Dermal punch blade <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> includes teeth <b>202</b> and <b>208</b> positioned at the opposite ends of the longitudinal axis <b>50</b> (as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) of the blade. The blade can further include teeth <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> on opposite sides of the minor axis (see <b>72</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>). These four teeth or cutting elements <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> provide the initial cutting points as the blade is inserted into the tissue. The blade of this embodiment has four arcuate regions <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> that extend between the teeth. For example, arcuate region <b>222</b> extends between element <b>208</b> and element <b>206</b> without any additional teeth elements. Thus, cutting edge <b>222</b> forms a continuous cutting edge where the incision in the tissue formed by edge <b>222</b> starts at two separated points or positions associated with cutting points <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> which move towards each other as the blade is inserted.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">This movement of the incision points towards each other operates to prevent displacement of the skin in a manner that distorts the preferred oval shape as described previously herein. This is shown in detail in the blade <b>250</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15C-15D</figref> where arcuate cutting regions <b>258</b>, <b>260</b> which extend between cutting points <b>252</b>, <b>254</b> and <b>254</b>, <b>256</b>, respectively. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C</figref>, the points <b>252</b>, <b>256</b> can extend further then center tooth <b>254</b>, and thus can provide the initial contact points at the tissue surface. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15D</figref>, as the points enter the tissue surface <b>255</b> as a result of movement <b>265</b> into the tissue, each point of entry forms an incision point <b>262</b>, <b>264</b> and <b>266</b>, <b>268</b> which move toward each other along arcuate regions <b>258</b>, <b>260</b>, respectively. Thus, the cutting points converge along each arc. This convergent cutting incision prevents creep of the incision that is found in certain prior art designs used curved blades.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15E and 15F</figref> are additional preferred embodiments utilizing the convergent cutting incision method as described herein. The cutting edge <b>270</b> of each side is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15E</figref> wherein end points <b>272</b> and <b>274</b> and center point <b>276</b> have intermediary points <b>278</b> and <b>280</b>. These teeth <b>278</b>, <b>280</b> can be shorter than the end and middle teeth, or alternatively, can be the same length. Thus, each wall can have a number of teeth in a range of 1 to 3 that are distinct from the edge teeth positioned along the major axis. The teeth can all have the same length, or the teeth positioned at the four corners (i.e., along the major axis and along the minor axis) can extend in a distal direction further than teeth between adjacent corners.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Another preferred embodiment has a blade <b>290</b> that does not utilize a centrally positioned tooth on each side, but can utilize a pair of teeth <b>296</b> that can be spaced at a distance for the end teeth <b>292</b>, <b>294</b>. For example, the teeth can be positioned equidistant from each other along each wall. The claims should not be read as limited to the described order or elements unless stated to that effect. Therefore, all embodiments that come within the scope and spirit of the following claims and equivalents thereto are claimed as the invention.</p>
