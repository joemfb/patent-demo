<p id="p-0001" num="0000">This invention provides an image forming apparatus capable of effectively suppressing an AC color registration error, and a control method thereof. To accomplish this, the image forming apparatus according to this invention controls driving of a transfer belt so that the speed of surface of the transfer belt at the transfer position comes close to a constant speed. The image forming apparatus also controls driving of a photosensitive drum so that the error between the speed of surface of the photosensitive drum and that of the transfer belt at the transfer position becomes almost 0. Further, the image forming apparatus controls the exposure timing in accordance with fluctuations of the speed of surface at the exposure position so that the exposure interval in the sub-scanning direction on the photosensitive drum comes close to a constant interval.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an image forming apparatus such as a copying machine, printer, or facsimile apparatus, and a control method thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, an electrophotographic image forming apparatus forms an image by transferring and superimposing developing material images (toner images) of respective colors formed on different image carriers (photosensitive drums) onto the surface of an intermediate transfer member (transfer belt) or that of a print material held on a conveyance belt. When transferring and superimposing the developing material images, alignment (registration) is important. In the image forming apparatus, however, the photosensitive drums and transfer belt suffer rotational nonuniformity depending on the device precision or the like. The positions of toner images of respective colors shift in the rotational direction, resulting in color misregistration in the formed image. This problem becomes serious especially in a tandem type color image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Such position errors (registration errors) are classified as a DC color registration error and AC color registration error. The DC color registration error is a registration error in which the positions of the leading and trailing ends of a formed image in the moving direction do not match owing to rotation of the transfer belt or the like. The AC color registration error is a registration error in which the magnitude or direction of a position error periodically fluctuates mainly due to a rotating member such as the photosensitive drum or belt driving roller. Of these registration errors, the DC color registration error can be suppressed by detecting registration patches of respective colors by a registration sensor, and correcting the leading end position of a formed image or correcting the magnification in the conveyance direction.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For the AC color registration error, there is known an image forming apparatus which detects rotational fluctuations of the rotating member using an encoder attached to the rotating shaft of the photosensitive drum or the like, and feeding forward or back the detection result to the driving motor to reduce the rotational fluctuations. Even by this control, however, the speed of surface of the photosensitive drum fluctuates owing to an eccentric component that is generated from misalignment of the central axes of the photosensitive drum and photosensitive drum driving shaft. Also, the speed of surface of the transfer belt fluctuates due to the eccentricity caused by misalignment of the rotating shaft of the driving roller or the like, and thickness nonuniformity. For the AC color registration error arising from composite factors, the following methods are being examined.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 62-59977 proposes a method of reducing a registration error amount by locking the phases of registration errors caused by the eccentricity of the photosensitive drums of respective image forming units. In this method, however, when the amplitude of the AC component of rotational fluctuations caused by the eccentricity of the photosensitive drum is different between the photosensitive drums, the AC component still remains.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To solve this problem, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2000-250284 proposes a method of suppressing the AC component in one cycle of the photosensitive drum. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 10-333398 proposes a method of suppressing the AC component in one cycle of the photosensitive drum, a plurality of cycles until the photosensitive drum is driven, and one cycle of the transfer belt. Japanese Patent No. 3186610 proposes a method of suppressing the AC component by setting the exposure position and transfer position to be opposite to each other by 180&#xb0; on the photosensitive drum. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2004-317538 proposes a method of forming an electrostatic latent image free from any position error on the photosensitive drum. In this method, the position error amount is estimated from the result of detecting fluctuations of the speed of surface of the photosensitive drum, and the position error is corrected from a displacement amount smaller than the minimum unit of the resolution to an arbitrary displacement amount.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, these conventional techniques have the following problems. For example, in the methods disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 2000-250284 and 10-333398 and Japanese Patent No. 3186610, when the rotational speed of the photosensitive drum is corrected to suppress the AC component of rotational fluctuations, the difference in the speeds of surface between the transfer belt and the photosensitive drum at the transfer position fluctuates with time. Owing to the speed difference, the state of a stick-slip between the transfer belt and the photosensitive drum changes, making it difficult to effectively suppress the AC component. In the method disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2004-317538, even if electrostatic latent images are formed at constant intervals on the photosensitive drum at the exposure position, a position error is generated in an image transferred onto the transfer belt under the influence of the stick-slip at the transfer position. Therefore, the conventional techniques cannot satisfactorily suppress the AC color registration error generated under the influence of an unpredictable random stick-slip.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described below. The following embodiments would help understand various concepts such as superordinate, intermediate, and subordinate concepts of the invention. The technical scope of the present invention is defined by the scope of the claims, and is not limited by the following embodiments.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">&#x3c;Arrangement of Image Forming Apparatus&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The first embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 7</figref>, <b>19</b>A, <b>19</b>B, and <b>20</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a side sectional view exemplifying an image forming apparatus according to the first embodiment. A plurality of rotating rollers including a driving roller <b>59</b> keep a transfer belt (intermediate transfer member) <b>21</b> taut at the center of the image forming apparatus. The transfer belt <b>21</b> is conveyed in a direction indicated by arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. Four drum-like image carriers (photosensitive drums) <b>5</b>Y, <b>5</b>M, <b>5</b>C, and <b>5</b>K corresponding to toners of yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C), and black (K) are arranged in line to face the conveyance surface of the transfer belt <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Four developing portions <b>52</b> are arranged in correspondence with the respective colors. Each developing portion <b>52</b> includes the photosensitive drum <b>5</b>, a toner, a charger, and a developing unit. The charger and developing unit are arranged at a predetermined interval in the housing of the developing portion <b>52</b>. An exposure portion <b>2</b> including an LED exposes the outer surface of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b> at the interval by emitting a laser beam to it.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Four exposure portions <b>2</b> are arranged in correspondence with the developing portions <b>52</b> of the respective colors. After each charger uniformly charges the outer surface of a corresponding photosensitive drum <b>5</b> with a predetermined amount of charges, the exposure portion <b>2</b> exposes the outer surface in accordance with image data. As a result, an electrostatic latent image is formed on the outer surface. The developing unit develops the electrostatic latent image by transferring toner to a low-potential portion of the electrostatic latent image, forming a toner image (developing material image).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Primary transfer members <b>57</b> are arranged at positions below the conveyance surface of the transfer belt <b>21</b>. Toner images formed on the outer surfaces of the respective photosensitive drums <b>5</b> are primarily transferred to the surface of the transfer belt <b>21</b> by transfer electric fields formed by the corresponding primary transfer members <b>57</b>. In parallel with the primary transfer to the transfer belt <b>21</b>, print sheets <b>61</b> set in a print sheet cassette <b>53</b> at the bottom of the apparatus main body are picked up one by one from the cassette by a crescent pickup roller <b>54</b>. The print sheet <b>61</b> is then conveyed to a secondary transfer portion by a pair of conveyance rollers <b>55</b>. A secondary transfer member <b>56</b> arranged at the secondary transfer portion secondarily transfers the toner image on the transfer belt <b>21</b> onto the print sheet <b>61</b> conveyed to the secondary transfer portion. A fixing portion <b>58</b> formed from a press roller and heat roller fixes the toner image on the print sheet <b>61</b> onto the sheet surface by heat. After that, the print sheet <b>61</b> is discharged from the apparatus by a discharge roller (not shown). A cleaner (not shown) recovers unnecessary toner left on the transfer belt <b>21</b>. Then, the image forming unit shifts to the next image forming process.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Prior to a series of image forming processes, the image forming unit forms a registration patch on the transfer belt <b>21</b>. Also, the image forming unit detects a DC color registration error using a registration detector <b>60</b> located above the transfer belt <b>21</b>. Based on the detection result, the image forming unit controls the exposure timing to correct the DC color registration error.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Note that the embodiment may employ a conveyance belt instead of the transfer belt <b>21</b>. In this case, the print sheet <b>61</b> is chucked, held, and conveyed by the conveyance belt, and toner images of the respective colors are sequentially transferred directly onto the print sheet <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1C</figref> are enlarged views exemplifying the photosensitive drum <b>5</b>, a rotary encoder <b>6</b>, and their surroundings in the image forming apparatus according to the first embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows the surroundings of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> shows those of the rotary encoder <b>6</b>. Note that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1C</figref> are common to all the photosensitive drums <b>5</b>Y, <b>5</b>M, <b>5</b>C, and <b>5</b>K of the respective colors. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the exposure portion <b>2</b> is located above the photosensitive drum <b>5</b>. The exposure portion <b>2</b> incorporates an LED head <b>1</b> in which LEDs corresponding to about several thousand to 20,000 pixels are aligned in the axial direction of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b> (main scanning direction in laser scanner exposure). In the embodiment, the exposure portion <b>2</b> exposes the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b> using the LED head <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The disk-like rotary encoder <b>6</b> is arranged on the extension of the driving shaft of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b>. The rotary encoder <b>6</b> is used to detect the rotational speed of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b> or a position on the photosensitive drum <b>5</b>. The transfer position is set at a position shifted by 180&#xb0; from the exposure position on the photosensitive drum <b>5</b>. A speed detector <b>11</b> at the transfer position is used to detect the speed of surface of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b> at the transfer position.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, the speed detector <b>11</b> directly detects the speed of surface of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b> at the transfer position. Based on the calculation results of the rotary encoder <b>6</b> and speed detector <b>11</b>, a speed estimator <b>13</b> estimates the speed of surface of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b> at the exposure position. Note that a speed detector may be arranged near the exposure position to directly detect a speed of surface at the exposure position.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The rotary encoder <b>6</b> includes a disk <b>6</b><i>c </i>on which grooves or patterns are drawn at the periphery at constant pitches, and two detectors <b>6</b><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b </i>for detecting the patterns. The two detectors are arranged near the disk <b>6</b><i>c </i>because it is difficult to make the disk and the rotating shaft of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b> concentric. That is, if only one detector is used, it detects even a speed fluctuation component arising from the eccentricity of the disk and the rotating shaft of the photosensitive drum. To prevent this, the speed fluctuation component is corrected using the two detectors.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The detectors <b>6</b><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b </i>are arranged at positions opposite to each other by 180&#xb0; with respect to the center of the disk <b>6</b><i>c</i>. By averaging the detection results of the two detectors, the rotational speed of the driving shaft of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b> free from the speed fluctuation component generated by the eccentricity is detected. In this manner, the image forming apparatus includes the two speed detectors <b>6</b><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b </i>(one of which can be replaced by an estimator), and one speed detector <b>11</b> (which can be replaced by an estimator) on the photosensitive drum <b>5</b>. Note that detection by the speed detector <b>11</b> corresponds to processing of obtaining the speed of surface of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b> at the transfer position by the second detection unit. Estimation by the speed estimator <b>13</b> corresponds to processing of obtaining the speed of surface of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b> at the exposure position by the third detection unit. Processing of detecting the rotational speed of the driving shaft of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b> using the rotary encoder <b>6</b> corresponds to processing by the fourth detection unit.</p>

In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows a block arrangement regarding driving control of the transfer belt, driving control of the photosensitive drum, and control of the exposure timing according to the first embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a block diagram exemplifying the block arrangement of control units in the image forming apparatus according to the first embodiment. Control units for executing driving control of the transfer belt <b>21</b>, driving control of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b>, and control of the exposure timing according to the first embodiment will be explained. A control unit <b>151</b> includes a CPU <b>152</b>, RAM (Random Access Memory) <b>153</b>, and ROM (Read Only Memory) <b>154</b>. The CPU <b>152</b> includes a transfer belt control unit <b>161</b>, photosensitive drum control unit <b>162</b>, and exposure control unit <b>163</b>, which control driving of a transfer belt driving unit <b>171</b>, photosensitive drum driving unit <b>172</b>, and exposure driving unit <b>173</b>, respectively. Note that programs and various data for controlling the image forming apparatus are written in the ROM <b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a target position setting unit <b>101</b>, amplifier (Kpblt) <b>102</b>, phase compensator <b>103</b>, motor driver <b>104</b>, and differentiator <b>105</b> are blocks regarding driving control of the transfer belt <b>21</b>, and belong to the transfer belt driving unit <b>171</b>. An accumulated position error calculation unit <b>106</b>, amplifiers (Kpy, Kpm, Kpc, and Kpk) <b>107</b>, phase compensators <b>108</b>, and differentiators (s) <b>109</b> are arranged for the respective colors, are blocks regarding driving control of the photosensitive drums <b>5</b>Y, <b>5</b>M, <b>5</b>C, and <b>5</b>K, and belong to the photosensitive drum driving unit <b>172</b>. Accumulated position error calculation units <b>110</b> and motor drivers <b>111</b> are blocks regarding exposure timing control, and belong to the exposure driving unit <b>173</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a view exemplifying the arrangement of speed detectors near the photosensitive drum <b>5</b> in the image forming apparatus according to the first embodiment.

Two speed detectors <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>(first and second speed sensors) are arranged before and after the photosensitive drum <b>5</b> to read the encoders <b>22</b><i>c</i>. As shown in <b>3</b><i>b </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a speed estimator <b>23</b> is connected to the speed detectors <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b</i>. The speed estimator estimates the speed by averaging the results of detection by the two speed detectors in order to increase the speed measurement precision at the position of the transfer portion. This estimation may adopt a function instead of averaging. Note that a speed detector may be arranged at the transfer position to directly detect the speed of surface of the transfer belt <b>21</b> at the transfer position, in place of the speed estimator <b>23</b>. Estimation by the speed estimator <b>23</b> and detection by the speed detector arranged at the transfer position correspond to processing of obtaining the speed of surface of the transfer belt <b>21</b> at the transfer position by the first detection unit.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in <b>3</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, encoders <b>11</b><i>b </i>are set at equal intervals at the end of the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b>. A speed detector <b>11</b><i>a </i>is arranged near the encoders <b>11</b><i>b </i>to read them. Note that the first embodiment assumes that the speed detectors <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>for the transfer belt <b>21</b> are arranged near the yellow photosensitive drum <b>5</b>Y, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. However, the speed detectors <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>may be arranged near one of the remaining photosensitive drums <b>5</b>M, <b>5</b>C, and <b>5</b>K.</p>

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The sequence of overall control concerning image forming processing including driving control of the transfer belt, driving control of the photosensitive drum, and control of the exposure timing in the image forming apparatus according to the first embodiment will be explained. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart showing overall processing procedures regarding control according to the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In S<b>201</b>, the transfer belt control unit <b>161</b> sets a target speed for the speed of surface of the transfer belt <b>21</b> in accordance with procedures in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. In S<b>202</b>, the transfer belt control unit <b>161</b> drives and controls the transfer belt <b>21</b> using the target speed set in S<b>201</b> as a target value in accordance with procedures in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. In this control, the transfer belt control unit <b>161</b> sets &#x201c;0&#x201d; or &#x201c;1&#x201d; in a flag FLGblt based on the control result.

<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>x</i>=&#x222b;(<i>ps</i>)<i>dt</i>=(<i>ps</i>)&#xb7;<i>t </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
That is, the target position x increases linearly with time. To easily handle the numerical value, the target position setting unit <b>101</b> adopts an accumulated position error as an actually used target position x&#x2032;. The target position x&#x2032; is given as a value obtained by subtracting the time integral of the target speed (ps in this case) from x:

<br/>
In other words, the transfer belt <b>21</b> is driven so that an output from the accumulated position error calculation unit <b>106</b> becomes the target value x&#x2032; (=0).

More specifically, the exposure timing calculation unit <b>112</b>Y calculates timing information for advancing the exposure timing when the speed of surface of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b>Y at the exposure position increases, and delaying it when the speed of surface decreases. An LED driver <b>113</b>Y is a driving unit which causes the LED head <b>1</b>Y to emit light. Based on the calculated value, the LED driver <b>113</b>Y drives the LED head <b>1</b>Y so that the exposure interval in the sub-scanning direction on the photosensitive drum <b>5</b>Y comes close to a constant interval.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The speed of surface of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b>Y at the exposure position is detected as follows. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the speed of surface can be directly detected by arranging the speed detector <b>12</b>Y near the exposure position. If the speed detector <b>12</b>Y cannot be arranged near the exposure position, the speed estimator <b>13</b>Y may estimate the speed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>. In this case, the speed estimator <b>13</b>Y estimates the speed of surface at the exposure position based on the result of detecting the rotational speed of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b>Y by the speed detectors <b>6</b><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b </i>of the rotary encoder <b>6</b>Y (result of detection by the fourth detection unit), and the result of detection by the speed detector <b>11</b>Y at the transfer position of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b> (result of detection by the second detection unit). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>, a relation &#x394;Z=(&#x394;A+&#x394;D)/2=(&#x394;B+&#x394;E)/2=(&#x394;C+&#x394;F)/2 holds from the observation of the relationship between the fluctuation components &#x394;A to &#x394;F of waveforms A to F and the fluctuation component &#x394;Z of the waveform of the driving shaft Z. Based on this relation, for example, a speed signal at exposure position D can be calculated from a speed signal at transfer position A and a speed signal for the driving shaft Z:

Note that this relation is applied to even a method of canceling the eccentric component by averaging signals output from detectors arranged at positions opposite to each other by 180&#xb0; in the rotary encoder or the like.

<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The exposure timing calculation unit <b>112</b>Y calculates the exposure timing, that is, LED emission timing using the speed of surface of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b>Y at the exposure position.

<p id="p-0104" num="0103">As described above, the image forming apparatus according to the first embodiment controls driving of the transfer belt so that the speed of surface of the transfer belt at the transfer position comes close to a constant speed. In addition, the image forming apparatus controls driving of the photosensitive drum so that the error between the speed of surface of the photosensitive drum and that of the transfer belt at the transfer position becomes almost 0. Further, the image forming apparatus controls the exposure timing in accordance with fluctuations of the speed of surface at the exposure position so that the exposure interval in the sub-scanning direction on the photosensitive drum comes close to a constant interval. This can minimize generation of an unpredictable random stick-slip which arises from the error of the speeds of surface between the photosensitive drum and the transfer belt at the transfer position under the influence of the eccentric component of the photosensitive drum. Toner images formed at constant intervals on the photosensitive drum can be transferred onto the transfer belt in the sub-scanning direction without any position error. The image forming apparatus can therefore suppress the AC color registration error and form a high-quality image without any color misregistration.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In the first embodiment, each speed detector has the same meaning as that of a position detector, and control according to the first embodiment can be implemented based on information of either detector. That is, position information can be easily acquired by integrating speed information, and speed information can be easily acquired by differentiating position information. For this reason, the speed detector and position detector are interchangeable. Even if the position detector replaces the speed detector in the embodiment, the same effects as those described above can be attained.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The first embodiment has described an image forming apparatus which intermediately transfers toner images of the respective colors onto the transfer belt.

In the third embodiment, driving control of a transfer belt <b>21</b> and that of a photosensitive drum <b>5</b> are the same as those in the first embodiment, and a description thereof will not be repeated. Although yellow (Y) exposure processing will be explained, the following description also applies to the remaining colors.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In the third embodiment, devices concerning exposure in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> operate as follows under the control of an exposure control unit <b>163</b>. A speed detector <b>12</b>Y which is arranged at the exposure position for a photosensitive drum <b>5</b>Y directly detects the speed of surface of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b>Y at the exposure position. The speed detector <b>12</b>Y outputs the detection result to a target speed calculation unit <b>121</b>Y and laser emission timing calculation unit <b>123</b>Y. When the transfer and exposure positions are opposite to each other by 180&#xb0; on the photosensitive drum <b>5</b>, the speed of surface at the exposure position fluctuates in phase with the eccentric component of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b>Y with an amplitude double as large as the eccentric component, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. By utilizing this characteristic, the speed of surface at the exposure position may be estimated from the eccentric component, instead of using the speed detector <b>12</b>Y.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The exposure control unit <b>163</b> uses the laser emission timing calculation unit <b>123</b>Y to calculate the laser emission timing (exposure start timing in the main scanning direction) based on an output from the speed detector <b>12</b>Y. A laser emission control unit <b>124</b>Y controls a laser <b>8</b>Y to emit light based on input image data at the calculated emission timing, sequentially executing 1-line exposure in the main scanning direction.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The exposure control unit <b>163</b> acquires information about the rotational state of a polygon mirror <b>7</b>Y based on a BD signal obtained when a beam detect (BD) sensor <b>9</b>Y detects a laser beam emitted by the laser <b>8</b>Y outside the image area. When the polygon mirror <b>7</b>Y is a hexahedral mirror, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the BD sensor <b>9</b>Y outputs BD signals six times at every 60&#xb0; during one round of the polygon mirror. A speed control unit <b>122</b>Y receives an error signal which is a difference value between a signal output from the target speed calculation unit <b>121</b>Y and the BD signal. Based on the error signal, the speed control unit <b>122</b>Y outputs a signal to a scanner motor driver <b>125</b>Y to drive a scanner motor <b>64</b>Y. Based on this signal, the scanner motor driver <b>125</b>Y drives the scanner motor <b>64</b>Y. Accordingly, the scanner motor <b>64</b>Y is driven to have a target speed calculated by the target speed calculation unit <b>121</b>Y. Also, the polygon mirror <b>7</b>Y is driven.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a flowchart showing control procedures by the exposure control unit <b>163</b> according to the third embodiment.

In S<b>302</b>, the exposure control unit <b>163</b> detects the speed of surface of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b>Y at the exposure position based on the detection result of S<b>301</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Even when the polygon mirror is used to expose the photosensitive drum <b>5</b>, the exposure control unit <b>163</b> needs to perform exposure at a constant interval in the sub-scanning direction. For this purpose, the exposure control unit <b>163</b> needs to synchronize the BD cycle (for a hexahedral mirror, the time taken for the hexagonal mirror to rotate a &#x2159; round) and the rotation fluctuation amount of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b>Y with each other by controlling the rotation of the polygon mirror in accordance with fluctuations of the speed of surface of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b>. For example, when T is the time taken to rotate the photosensitive drum <b>5</b>Y at the interval (for example, 21.6 &#x3bc;m for 1,200 dpi) of the sub-scanning position at the exposure position of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b>, the BD cycle also needs to be controlled to be T.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In S<b>303</b>, the exposure control unit <b>163</b> uses the target speed calculation unit <b>121</b>Y to calculate the target value of the rotational speed of the polygon mirror based on the calculation result of S<b>302</b>. As a result, the target value of the BD cycle corresponding to the rotational speed is determined. In S<b>304</b>, the exposure control unit <b>163</b> calculates the time period of scanning and the scanning frequency for exposure in the main scanning direction, based on the BD cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">With these settings, the exposure control unit <b>163</b> controls 1-line exposure processing. The polygon mirror is then driven at a corresponding speed so that the set time period of scanning and the scanning frequency are obtained at the exposure timing.

Hence, the exposure control unit <b>163</b> suffices to determine the exposure start timing in the sub-scanning direction in one cycle, and the time period of scanning and the scanning frequency in the main scanning direction.</p>

<p id="p-0132" num="0131">As described above, the image forming apparatus according to the third embodiment controls the exposure timing to perform exposure at a constant interval in the sub-scanning direction in accordance with the speed of surface of the photosensitive drum at the exposure position when the scanner system is used as an exposure source. More specifically, the image forming apparatus controls the rotational speed of the scanner motor in accordance with the speed of surface to execute exposure so that the exposure interval in the sub-scanning direction comes close to a constant interval. In addition, the image forming apparatus calculates the time period of scanning and the scanning frequency for exposure in the main scanning direction, which are determined in accordance with the speed of surface. Even the image forming apparatus using a scanner system as an exposure source can form electrostatic latent images at constant intervals on the photosensitive drum, and transfer toner images onto the transfer belt in the sub-scanning direction without any position error, similar to the first and second embodiments. Therefore, the image forming apparatus can suppress the AC color registration error and form a high-quality image without any color misregistration.</p>

An image forming apparatus according to the fourth embodiment employs a scanner system which uses a polygon mirror as an exposure source, similar to the third embodiment. By making the rotational speed of the scanner motor close to a constant speed, the image forming apparatus according to the fourth embodiment need not set the time period of scanning and the scanning frequency in the main scanning direction, unlike the third embodiment. Instead, the image forming apparatus according to the fourth embodiment corrects a position error in the sub-scanning direction by image processing for image data.</p>

Although yellow (Y) exposure processing will be explained, the following description also applies to the remaining colors.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In the fourth embodiment, devices concerning exposure in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> operate as follows under the control of an exposure control unit <b>163</b>. A speed detector <b>12</b>Y which is arranged at the exposure position for a photosensitive drum <b>5</b>Y directly detects the speed of surface of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b>Y at the exposure position. The speed detector <b>12</b>Y outputs the detection result to a correction amount calculation unit <b>127</b>Y. Similar to the third embodiment, the speed of surface at the exposure position may be estimated based on the eccentric component of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b>Y, in place of using the speed detector <b>12</b>Y.</p>

Based on the corrected image data, the laser luminance modulation unit <b>128</b>Y causes a laser <b>8</b>Y to emit light, exposing the photosensitive drum <b>5</b>Y.</p>

The scanner motor driver <b>125</b>Y operates a polygon mirror <b>7</b>Y by driving a scanner motor <b>64</b>Y arranged for the polygon mirror <b>7</b>Y.

Fluctuations of the speed of surface by the eccentricity of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b> are expressed by a sine wave.

For a sub-scanning pitch of 1,200 dpi, the interval of one dot is about 21.2 &#x3bc;m, and fluctuations with an amplitude (100 &#x3bc;m) of &#x394;x correspond to about 4.7 dots, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a table exemplifying numerical values acquired by the above processing. In the fourth embodiment, the exposure control unit <b>163</b> corrects image data used for exposure and the exposure intensity based on fluctuations of &#x394;x. The exposure control unit <b>163</b> forms electrostatic latent images on the photosensitive drum <b>5</b>Y at constant intervals, eliminating a position error caused by fluctuations of the speed of surface of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b>Y. The correction method will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.

<p id="p-0140" num="0139"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a view showing the concept of correcting the exposure intensity of image data according to the fourth embodiment. <b>17</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows a case in which the value of the decimal part is 0. <b>17</b><i>b </i>and <b>17</b><i>c </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> show a case in which the decimal part is not 0. In <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>and <b>17</b><i>c </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the exposure intensity is represented by 256 tone levels. In the fourth embodiment, the exposure control unit <b>163</b> controls the correction amount calculation unit <b>127</b>Y to calculate correction data for correcting the pixel position in the sub-scanning direction in image data by the laser luminance modulation unit <b>128</b>Y. More specifically, the correction amount calculation unit <b>127</b>Y calculates the integral and decimal parts of the accumulated position error &#x394;x, and generates the correction data based on the calculation results.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">The correction amount calculation unit <b>127</b>Y sets the calculation result of the integral part of &#x394;x as data for correcting the pixel position in image data in the sub-scanning direction. For example, the correction amount calculation unit <b>127</b>Y outputs correction data for advancing the pixel of interest at each sub-scanning position by two lines for &#x394;x=2 and delaying it by one line for &#x394;x=&#x2212;1. Based on the calculation result of the decimal part of &#x394;x, the correction amount calculation unit <b>127</b>Y outputs data for correcting the densities of the pixel of interest and a pixel on the next line in image data.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In <b>17</b><i>b </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the decimal part of &#x394;x is 0.25, and each pixel at the sub-scanning position needs to be advanced by a 0.25 line. In this case, let P(N) be the exposure intensity of the pixel of interest on line N, Ph(N) be the corrected exposure intensity, Ph(N+1) be the exposure intensity of the next line N+1 adjacent to line N in the sub-scanning direction, and Ph(N+1) be the corrected exposure intensity. Then, tone correction is executed based on

</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">When the decimal part is 0, as shown in <b>17</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the density of each pixel at the sub-scanning position need not be corrected, and the level is 255. To the contrary, when the decimal part is 0.25, as shown in <b>17</b><i>b </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the density level of the pixel of interest at the sub-scanning position is 191, and that of a pixel on one preceding line is 64. Similarly, when the decimal part is 0.5, as shown in <b>17</b><i>c </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, both the density level of the pixel of interest at the sub-scanning position and that of a pixel on one preceding line are 128. By adjusting the pixel density in this way, the position of an electrostatic latent image formed on the photosensitive drum <b>5</b>Y can be corrected at a resolution smaller than one dot, as shown in <b>17</b><i>b </i>and <b>17</b><i>c </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a flowchart showing control procedures by the exposure control unit <b>163</b> according to the fourth embodiment. In S<b>321</b>, the exposure control unit <b>163</b> detects the amplitude (eccentric amount) and phase of the eccentric component of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b>. In S<b>322</b>, the exposure control unit <b>163</b> detects the speed of surface of the photosensitive drum <b>5</b> at the exposure position or the magnitude of a position error at each sub-scanning position, based on the detection result of S<b>321</b>. Then, the process shifts to S<b>323</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">In S<b>323</b>, the exposure control unit <b>163</b> uses the correction amount calculation unit <b>127</b>Y to divide the calculation result of the position error in S<b>322</b> into integral and decimal parts. In S<b>324</b>, the exposure control unit <b>163</b> creates correction data (table) for converting the integral part into position correction information and the decimal part into density correction information. In S<b>325</b>, the exposure control unit <b>163</b> corrects image data based on the table created in S<b>324</b>, and controls exposure on the photosensitive drum <b>5</b>Y.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In the above description, one pixel in image data is expressed by the saturation density, but halftone is also used in actual image data. In this case, it suffices to adjust the exposure intensity by multiplying the densities of the pixel of interest and an adjacent pixel by, as correction data, the ratio for correcting a position error. To increase the correction precision, it is preferable to grasp in advance a characteristic displacement amount based on the arrangement of the image forming apparatus, and hold it as a table in S<b>324</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">As described above, the image forming apparatus according to the fourth embodiment makes the rotational speed of the scanner motor close to a constant speed, and corrects the density of image data based on the speed of surface of the photosensitive drum at the exposure position. More specifically, the position of each pixel of image data is moved back and forth in the sub-scanning direction based on the speed of surface. In addition, the densities of the pixel of interest and an adjacent pixel are corrected in the sub-scanning direction, controlling the exposure intensity on the photosensitive drum. Even if the rotational speed of the scanner motor is set constant without correcting the exposure timing, electrostatic latent images can be formed at constant intervals on the photosensitive drum. Similar to the first to third embodiments, an image free from any AC color registration error can be formed on the intermediate transfer member based on the latent images.</p>
