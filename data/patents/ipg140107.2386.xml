<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A rechargeable battery can be recharged and discharged, in contrast to a primary battery that cannot be recharged. A low capacity rechargeable battery is generally used as a power source for a small portable electronic device, such as a mobile phone, a laptop computer, and a camcorder, etc., and a large capacity rechargeable battery is generally used as a power source for driving a motor such as for a hybrid vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A large capacity high power rechargeable battery with high energy density using a non-aqueous electrolyte has been developed, and the rechargeable battery is generally formed with a large capacity high power rechargeable battery module by coupling a plurality of rechargeable batteries in series or in parallel in order to use it to drive a device, for example, a motor such as an electric vehicle requiring a large amount of electric power.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, a high power rechargeable battery is generally formed with a plurality of rechargeable batteries that are coupled in series or in parallel, and the rechargeable battery may be formed in a cylindrical shape or a square shape.</p>

<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, a pouch type battery is weak with respect to external impact and cannot easily discharge heat. Further, because the pouch type battery has no structure that fixes its external shape, it is difficult to manufacture the pouch type batteries with a battery module by stacking.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A metal can type battery has high strength, but has a heavy weight and has a difficulty in discharging internal heat to the outside.</p>
