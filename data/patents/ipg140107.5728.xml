<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure relates to a method for displaying a conversation summary, and more particularly, to a system, method and computer program product for displaying a conversation summary using a tag cloud.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Instant messaging is a very popular form of communication in today's internet driven world. As such, numerous people may be invited to participate in an ongoing instant message chat session. However, it may be difficult for the invitee to gain a full understanding of the context of the conversation without reading the preceding messages or without the people already in the chat providing a summary. As expected, the invitee may not want to join a meeting where the subject is not of particular interest.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Similarly, in virtual worlds an avatar may enter a space where an ongoing conversation is occurring that was previously out of range of the avatar. In order for the avatar to get the gist of the conversation he/she must wait and catch up with the ongoing conversation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Known solutions such as persistent chat may require that the person read back over the conversation in order to get the gist of what is being discussed, which may be time consuming and distracting from the ongoing conversation. Other known solutions such as highlighting keywords in the persistent chat may suffer from similar difficulties in that the person must look back over the entire chat to determine what is being discussed.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF DISCLOSURE</heading>

<p id="h-0007" num="0000">The Conversation Display Process:</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">For the following discussion, conversation display process <b>10</b> shall be described generically and shall collectively refer to any and all combinations of server-side conversation display process <b>12</b> and/or client-side conversation display processes <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>. For illustrative purposes, assume that client-side conversation display processes <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> are processes incorporated into and executed within a client-side instant messaging application (e.g., Microsoft IM&#x2122;, Lotus Sametime&#x2122;, Google Talk&#x2122;) that allow for communication with server-side conversation display process <b>12</b>. However, this is not intended to be a limitation of this disclosure, as other configurations are possible (e.g., stand-alone, client-side conversation display processes and/or stand-alone server-side conversation display processes.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Assume for illustrative purposes that users <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> are all coworkers and that they each use an instant messaging system (e.g., Microsoft IM&#x2122; and Lotus Sametime&#x2122;) to communicate. These examples are provided merely for exemplary purposes, as any suitable messaging system may be used in conjunction with conversation display process <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, one exemplary embodiment depicting operations of conversation display process <b>10</b> is shown. In some embodiments, conversation display process <b>10</b> may include providing a graphical user interface (GUI) configured to allow communication between a plurality of users (e.g., users <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, etc) (<b>102</b>). Conversation display process <b>10</b> may further include displaying an invitation to join a conversation at the graphical user interface from at least one of the plurality of users (<b>104</b>). The invitation may include displaying a summary of the conversation in a tag cloud on a computing device (e.g., notebook computer <b>36</b>) (<b>106</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Thus, the present disclosure may provide a mechanism to give a potential conversation participant a quick summary of the ongoing and/or prior conversation via a summarization displayed as a &#x201c;tag cloud.&#x201d; The summary may be provided with the invitation before the person decides to join the chat and may also dynamically update as the chat proceeds. The term &#x201c;tag cloud&#x201d; as used herein may refer to a display of text. In some cases this display may take the form of a weighted summary, which is discussed in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref>, a particularly illustrative embodiment of conversation display process <b>10</b> is provided. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an example of a graphical user interface in the form of an instant messaging display window <b>150</b> configured for use with conversation display process <b>10</b>. In this particular example, a conversation <b>152</b> may be occurring between two users over network <b>24</b>, for example, user <b>46</b> (Stan) and user <b>48</b> (Mike) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Here, Stan &#x26; Mike may be having an instant message chat about an initiative taking place within their company.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Display window <b>150</b> may include a number of features and selection tools. For example, display window <b>150</b> may include an invitation selection tool <b>154</b>, which may allow for one user (e.g. user <b>46</b> and/or <b>48</b>) to invite another user (e.g. <b>52</b>) to join the conversation <b>152</b>. Here, user <b>46</b> (i.e., Stan) may wish to send an invitation to chat to Dave (i.e., user <b>52</b>). In operation, user <b>46</b> may utilize chat summary tool <b>156</b> shown in display window <b>150</b>. In this example, user <b>46</b> (i.e. Stan) may use pointer <b>158</b> to select that he wishes to include a chat summary with the invitation. Chat summary tool <b>156</b>, if selected, may be configured to provide a chat summary to the recipient (i.e. user<b>52</b>/Dave) of the invitation.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">While invitation selection tool <b>154</b> and chat summary tool <b>156</b> are depicted as drop-down menus accessible via pointer <b>158</b>, this disclosure is not intended to be limited to such implementations. As such, numerous other examples may include, but are not limited to, buttons, right-click activation, keystroke combinations, toolbar options, etc. In some embodiments, invitation selection tool <b>154</b> and chat summary tool <b>156</b> may be combined and/or accessible through a single selection tool. Moreover, this particular example describes a conversation between two users who may desire to add a third user. However, it should be noted that this disclosure is not limited such an implementation as the concepts described herein may be applied to any number and/or combination of users.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, conversation display process <b>10</b> is shown in display window <b>200</b>. Display window <b>200</b> may be utilized by the recipient of the invitation, for example, user <b>52</b> (i.e. Dave). Display window <b>200</b> may provide user <b>52</b> with the invitation <b>253</b> from user <b>46</b> (i.e. Stan). Display window <b>200</b> may further include invitation selection tool <b>254</b> and chat summary tool <b>256</b> as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Invitation <b>253</b> may include conversation summary <b>260</b>, which may take the form of a tag cloud or other display. User <b>52</b> may now view conversation summary <b>260</b> and determine whether or not to join the conversation. User <b>52</b> may choose to accept the invitation by selecting accept chat invitation box <b>262</b> using pointer <b>258</b>. Alternatively, user <b>52</b> may decline the invitation by selecting decline chat invitation box <b>264</b>. Conversation summary <b>260</b> may provide the recipient of the invitation with a nearly instant context of what has been and/or is being discussed.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, boxes <b>262</b> and <b>262</b> may be configured to automatically appear in display window <b>200</b> of the receiver of the invitation when a sender (e.g., user <b>46</b>) has sent the invitation. However, it should be noted that the accept and decline features need not take the form of a selectable box. Numerous other options are also within the scope of the present disclosure. For example, the option to accept or decline the invitation may appear anywhere within and/or outside of display window <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Similarly, although conversation summary <b>260</b> is depicted within the body of invitation <b>253</b>, conversation summary <b>260</b> may be located in any suitable location within and/or outside of display screen <b>200</b>. In some embodiments, user <b>52</b> may activate conversation summary <b>260</b> by selecting from chat summary tool <b>256</b>. In this way, chat summary tool <b>256</b> may allow for both the sender and receiver to select the show chat summary feature.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, conversation summary <b>260</b> may be a live dynamically updating summary of the ongoing conversation. The sender of invitation <b>253</b>, here user <b>46</b> (i.e., Stan), may decide to allow the entire conversation between he and user <b>48</b> (i.e. Mike) to be forwarded to user <b>52</b> (i.e., Dave), or alternatively, only selected portions. In this way, conversation summary <b>260</b> may include the complete previous conversation or may pick-up from where one of the users joined. For example, in some situations a user may be invited without revealing portions of the previous conversation via the invite.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As discussed above, conversation summary <b>260</b> may take the form of a tag cloud. The tag cloud may be user-configurable and may include a number of different options. In some embodiments, the tag cloud may include a precision selector <b>266</b>, which may be configured to identify the most commonly used terms in the conversation. Precision selector <b>266</b> may allow a user to select the precision with which he/she wishes to view conversation summary <b>260</b>. For example, common keywords in the conversation may be displayed in large font or in bold, underlined, etc. The number of keywords displayed may depend upon where precision selector <b>266</b> is set between the options of &#x201c;more&#x201d; or &#x201c;less.&#x201d; This gives the user the option of choosing how many words he/she wishes to display within conversation summary <b>260</b>. In some embodiments, as the keywords age they may eventually fade out of conversation summary <b>260</b>. The example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> clearly shows the terms &#x201c;energy&#x201d;, &#x201c;environmental&#x201d;, &#x201c;green-initiative&#x201d;, &#x201c;community&#x201d;, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments, as the conversation proceeds a record of the words used in the conversation may be stored (<b>108</b>). Once used, each word in the conversation may be time stamped to provide a record of when it was last used. Moreover, conversation display process <b>10</b> may be configured to maintain a count indicative of the usage of the word. Conversation display process <b>10</b> may also be configured to ignore punctuation and common filler words such as &#x201c;the&#x201d;, &#x201c;if&#x201d;, &#x201c;then&#x201d;, &#x201c;are&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d;, etc. Any or all of these options may be user-configurable and, therefore, set to a particular user's preferences.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Either individually or in combination, the count and the time stamp may be used to generate conversation summary <b>260</b> (e.g. tag cloud). In this way, conversation display process <b>10</b> may further include determining a weighting for each of the words based upon the count and the time stamp (<b>110</b>). The weighting for each word may be determined using a variety of different factors, including but not limited to, the word's count, the word's recent usage, etc. The words may then be shown in the tag cloud according to this determined weight.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, configuration settings may be used to limit the size of the summarization record. Thus, the older record of used words may drop off of the list as the summarization record exceeds a predefined limit. As discussed above, this limit may be set by the user. This feature may help to ensure that the summary reflects the current context of the conversation.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, conversation summary <b>260</b> may be generated using a text analysis engine that may incorporate natural language processing (NLP) technology. Some text analysis engines may include, but are not limited to, IBM&#xae; LanguageWare&#xae;, Natural Language Toolkit, etc. The text analysis engine may be used to provide a summarization of the text of the conversation. This summarization may be used as the basis to produce the record of the words as well as conversation summary <b>260</b>. Natural language processors may provide advantage such as in the grouping of similar words to provide a more concise summary. For example, in a conversation with the words geese and goose, a summarization may choose to group these as a single word &#x201c;Geese&#x201d;. This may minimize excessive duplication of words in conversations summary <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, conversation display process <b>10</b> may be associated with a virtual world environment (e.g. Second Life&#xae;). In this example, an object may be placed somewhere in the virtual space, for example in a meeting room, theatre, etc. The object may be within range of conversations within that space and may record the ongoing chat. This recorded conversation may be displayed on a panel in the manner described above, i.e., as a conversation summary tag cloud, which may dynamically update as the conversation proceeds. A person upon entering the space may then see the conversation summary or tag cloud and obtain a summary of the ongoing conversation.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, conversation display process <b>10</b> may be associated with a Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) or IP telephony application. In an IP telephony environment, voice to text technology may be used to produce a conversation summary, which may be provided to invitees to the voice chat. Of course, numerous other embodiments and applications are also within the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Some of the embodiments described above may be implemented as software modules executed by a processor of a computing system, and/or in a computer program product that may be stored on a storage medium having instructions that when executed by a processor perform the messaging process described herein. The storage medium may include any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, compact disk read-only memories (CD-ROMs), compact disk rewritables (CD-RWs), and magneto-optical disks, semiconductor devices such as read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs) such as dynamic and static RAMs, erasable programmable read-only memories (EPROMs), electrically erasable programmable read-only memories (EEPROMs), flash memories. Other embodiments may be implemented as software modules executed by a programmable control device.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A number of implementations have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made. Accordingly, other implementations are within the scope of the following claims.</p>
