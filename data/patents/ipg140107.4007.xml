<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Semiconductor processing involves deposition, patterning and removal of various layers of materials on semiconductor wafers.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A typical semiconductor processing method <b>1000</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Usually, wafers are processed in a track-like setup (often referred to as the &#x201c;wafer track&#x201d;) that integrates several instruments needed to process photo resist. Frequently, after deposition of a photo resist layer, block <b>1002</b>, it is necessary to planarize the deposited layer using chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). CMP involves abrasion of the layer with a polishing pad, in the presence of a slurry. Following the completion of the CMP, the slurry debris and contaminants must be removed to avoid contamination of integrated circuit layers. After the photo resist deposition, the wafer is removed from the wafer track and is placed in a scanner.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The scanner is a projection-printing tool whereby an image of a mask is projected onto the wafer. The image of the mask is projected onto the wafer, exposing the main field of the wafer, block <b>1004</b>.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">This detailed description of exemplary embodiments is intended to be read in connection with the accompanying drawings, which are to be considered part of the entire written description. In the description, relative terms such as &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; &#x201c;horizontal,&#x201d; &#x201c;vertical,&#x201d;, &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;up,&#x201d; &#x201c;down,&#x201d; &#x201c;top&#x201d; and &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; as well as derivative thereof (e.g., &#x201c;horizontally,&#x201d; &#x201c;downwardly,&#x201d; &#x201c;upwardly,&#x201d; etc.) should be construed to refer to the orientation as then described or as shown in the drawing under discussion. These relative terms are for convenience of description and do not require that the apparatus be constructed or operated in a particular orientation. Terms concerning attachments, coupling and the like, such as &#x201c;connected&#x201d; and &#x201c;interconnected,&#x201d; refer to a relationship wherein structures are secured or attached to one another either directly or indirectly through intervening structures, as well as both movable or rigid attachments or relationships, unless expressly described otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">One aspect of the present invention is the realization that for line and space layers, wafer edge exposure reduces scanner exposure time and improves throughput. Since scanner exposure time is often a time limiting factor, reducing scanner exposure time results in higher throughput.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">An embodiment provides for a wafer track with a wafer edge exposure module.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a semiconductor processing method <b>2000</b> wherein wafer edge exposure is performed within the wafer track, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Initially, the wafer is processed through the wafer track, where photo resist is applied, block <b>2002</b>. Wafer edge exposure is performed within the wafer track, block <b>2004</b>, which enables pipelining of the wafer processing, as edge exposure of another wafer in the wafer edge exposure module may be performed in parallel with scanning the main field of a first wafer in the scanner. Since the edges of the wafer will not be processed into the final integrated circuit, the wafer edge exposure module creates a dummy pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Transferring the wafer to the scanner, the main field pattern is exposed, block <b>2006</b>, and the wafer is returned to the wafer track for pattern developing, block <b>2008</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a wafer edge exposure module <b>3000</b> as part of the wafer track, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Wafer edge exposure module <b>3000</b> has a chuck for supporting a wafer <b>3130</b>. The chuck rotates around a central axis.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Wafer edge exposure module <b>3000</b> comprises a wafer spin device and optical system, which includes a broadband optical system <b>3110</b>, a focusing lens <b>3114</b>, and exposure mask <b>3116</b>. Additionally, in some embodiments wafer edge exposure module <b>3000</b> may also include a controller <b>3140</b>, and a scanner interface module <b>3150</b>. In some embodiments, a notch sensor is used for wafer alignment in wafer edge exposure module <b>3000</b>; in such embodiments, a notch searching unit <b>3120</b> may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Optical system <b>3110</b> is shown. It is understood that more than one optical system <b>3110</b> may be used. In some embodiments, optical system <b>3110</b> has crystal optics. Optical system <b>3110</b> a respective irradiation system positioned or movably positionable with a common radial distance from the axis of the wafer spinning device. Each optical system <b>3110</b> is configured to direct exposure light on a respective edge portion of the wafer <b>3130</b> simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, each optical system <b>3110</b> includes a respective light emitter, such as a laser or light emitting diode (LED), a focusing lens <b>3114</b> and an exposure mask <b>3116</b>. The exposure mask <b>3116</b> permits a shaped exposure light <b>3118</b> to impinge on and develop a photosensitive material at the circumferential edge of the wafer <b>3130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, optical system <b>3110</b> may include a plurality of light sources positioned or movably positionable directly opposite from each other along a line segment that passes through the axis.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In other embodiments, such as the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, wafer edge exposure module <b>3000</b> may include any whole number of two or more light sources <b>3112</b>-<b>1</b>, . . . <b>3112</b>-N. More generally, the optical system includes N light sources, where N is an integer greater than one, the N light sources being spaced apart from each other by an angle of 360/N degrees between each pair of successive light sources. Thus, the wafer edge exposure module <b>3000</b> may include three light sources spaced 120 degrees apart, four light sources spaced 90 degrees apart, or any other combination. The optimal number of light sources for a given wafer edge exposure module <b>3000</b> depends on the size of the wafers to be processed, and the desired total exposure time.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">For example, in an embodiment with an optical system <b>3110</b> with two light sources on opposite sides of the wafer <b>3130</b>, each light source exposes a respective semi-circular half of the circumference of the edge of wafer <b>3130</b>, simultaneously. When the wafer <b>3130</b> has rotated 180 degrees, the entire circumference has been exposed. Without changing the photosensitive material, irradiating light intensity, or rotation speed, the exposure time within the wafer edge exposure module <b>3000</b> is reduced by 50%.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, the wafer edge exposure module <b>3000</b> is originally constructed to include two light sources. In other embodiments, a second light source <b>110</b><i>b </i>is retro-fitted in a pre-existing wafer edge exposure module <b>3000</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Wafer edge exposure module <b>3000</b> may also include one or more notch searching units <b>3120</b>, positioned or movably positionable for detecting a notch <b>3132</b> proximate an edge portion of the wafer <b>3130</b>. For example, a plurality of notch searching units include two notch searching units positioned or movably positionable directly opposite from each other along a line segment that passes through the axis.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown, in a wafer edge exposure module <b>3000</b> having only one notch searching unit, if the notch has just passed the detector when the wafer begins rotating, then the first notch detection does not occur until the wafer has rotated nearly 360 degrees. Then the wafer rotates another 360 degrees before the exposure is considered complete. Thus, with only one notch searching unit, the maximum time for two detections of the notch is nearly two times the rotation period of the wafer. Similarly, the minimum time for two notch detections (when the notch passes the detector immediately after the wafer begins rotating) is slightly more than the rotation period of the wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Each notch searching unit <b>3120</b> includes a light source a lens and a sensor, which may be a CCD or CMOS imaging sensor. Each notch searching unit may be mounted on a rail and movable by a linear actuator towards or away from the axis, to accommodate differently sized wafers. Upon mounting the wafer <b>3130</b> on the chuck, the notch searching units are actuated towards the axis, until the CCD or CMOS imaging sensor detects an edge of the wafer. At that point, the wafer can be rotated until the notch <b>3132</b> is detected twice, to expose the edge to the light from the light sources.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a notch searching units <b>3120</b> evenly spaced from the optical system <b>3110</b>, this is only an example. The notch searching units <b>3120</b> may be positioned closer to, or further from the optical system <b>3110</b>, so long as the units fit within the wafer edge exposure module <b>3000</b> housing and do not interfere with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">More generally, the plurality of notch searching units may include N notch searching units, where N is any integer greater than one, the N notch searching units being spaced apart from each other by an angle of 360/N degrees between each pair of successive notch searching units.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">With two notch searching units <b>3120</b> the amount of time between notch detections is decreased. The determination of the duration of the exposure of the wafer is based on notch detections by both notch searching units. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the controller <b>3140</b>, described below, controls the system to expose the wafer edge for a period that includes two consecutive wafer detections, one by each notch searching unit.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">With an embodiment with two notch searching units <b>3120</b>, if the notch <b>3132</b> has just passed the notch searching unit <b>3120</b> when the wafer <b>3130</b> begins rotating, then the first notch detection does not occur until the wafer <b>3130</b> has rotated nearly 180 degrees. Then the wafer rotates another 180 degrees before the exposure is considered complete. Thus, the maximum time for two detections of notch <b>3132</b> is reduced to less than one rotation period of the wafer. Similarly, the minimum time for two notch detections (when the notch passes the notch searching unit <b>3120</b> immediately after the wafer <b>3130</b> begins rotating) is slightly more than one half the rotation period of the wafer <b>3130</b>. For larger wafers, the reduction in total wafer edge exposure module <b>3000</b> time of about one rotation period is a significant time savings that may improve the duty cycle of the downstream equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">With two notch detection units <b>3120</b>, the controller <b>3140</b> controls the duration of the wafer edge exposure process, so as to include detections of the notch by each of the two notch searching units <b>3120</b>. More generally, with N notch detection units, the controller <b>3140</b> controls the duration of the wafer edge exposure process, so as to include detections of the notch by two successive ones of the N notch searching units. The controller <b>3140</b> controls the duration to be shorter than a period of three successive detections of the notch by three successive ones of N evenly spaced notch searching units. Further, it is not necessary to wait for any single one of the notch detection units to make a second detection by the same notch detection unit to complete the exposure of the wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The controller <b>3140</b> may be an embedded microprocessor or digital signal processor implemented in application specific integrated circuitry (ASIC), or a networked computer or programmable logic controller. Controller <b>3140</b> controls the system to expose the wafer edge, while communicating with a scanner via scanner interface module <b>3150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Scanner interface module <b>3150</b> is any electronic device capable of communicating processing data with a scanner. In some embodiments, scanner interface module <b>3150</b> may be any interface as known in the art for communicating or transferring files across a computer network, examples of such networks include Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), Ethernet, Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), token bus, or token ring networks.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Coordinating processing information with the scanner, controller <b>3140</b> calculates and forwards dummy shot coordinates to the scanner to facilitate the main field of a wafer. Scanner interface module <b>3150</b> sends the coordinates of the dummy shot to the wafer edge exposure module <b>3000</b> via a controller. The dummy shot may be located via a notch sensor used for wafer alignment.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the foregoing specification, the aspects have been described with reference to specific embodiments thereof. It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereunto without departing from the broader spirit and scope as set forth in the appended claims. The specification and drawings are accordingly to be regarded in an illustrative rather than in a restrictive sense.</p>
