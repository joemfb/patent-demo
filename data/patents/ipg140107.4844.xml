<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The embodiments of the present invention relate generally to optical interconnects, optical communication and data transfer, lasers, optical multimode lenses, optical coupling, and silicon photonics.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background Information</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Data transmission and communication using optical-based technologies offers advantages over standard electrical conductor-based systems, such as higher rates of data transmission. Lasers can produce the light (electromagnetic radiation) on which data may be encoded and transmitted. The light produced by a laser can be, for example, electromagnetic radiation in the infrared, visible, ultraviolet, or X-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Silicon-based optics typically use light in the infrared region. For high rates of data transmission, data is encoded using a plurality of wavelengths of light which are then multiplexed together, sent to an input device, demultiplexed, and detected at a detector.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Optical data transmission is useful, for example, inside and around personal computers, servers, and data centers as well as more long-range data transmission and communication activities. A challenge is presented by the need to cost-effectively couple small-scale optical devices together to enable data transmission.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Embodiments of the invention provide devices capable of coupling multi-mode optical sources with waveguides having one or more substantially smaller dimensions. In an embodiment of the invention, a multi-mode optical source, such as a multimode waveguide, fiber, and or lens, has dimensions in the tens of micrometers and the device to which the light output from the multimode optical source is directed has dimensions in the micrometer or sub-micrometer range. Devices according to embodiments of the invention that are capable of coupling light sources having different dimensions are useful in optical data transmission applications, such as, for example, transferring data in and around personal computers, servers, and data centers as well as for longer-range data transmission. Further, devices according to embodiments of the invention are amenable to fabrication on integrated circuit chips having other components and devices and are amenable to fabrication by semiconductor processing techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> provides a graded-index lens that enables optical focusing for supported modes of an output waveguide. In an embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the optical output of the graded-index lens is focused into a waveguide coupled to an optical detector. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, light <b>105</b> from an optical waveguide (not shown), such as a multimode optical fiber and or lens, enters a graded-index lens region <b>110</b> that is housed on a substrate <b>115</b>. The substrate <b>115</b> is a semiconductor material, such as, for example, silicon or silicon-on-insulator, and the substrate <b>115</b> can optionally be the substrate for an integrated circuit (IC) chip that houses other electronic components. The graded-index lens region <b>110</b> enables beam focusing into the smaller-dimensioned waveguide region <b>120</b>. Dotted arrow <b>106</b> represents a more focused beam output from the on-chip graded-index lens <b>110</b>. Light (such as multimode light) that enters the graded-index lens region <b>110</b> is focused into the waveguide region <b>120</b> and travels to optional photodetector <b>125</b>. In embodiments of the invention, the graded-index lens <b>110</b> is capable of focusing an input optical beam, such as a multimode optical beam, into an output waveguide region <b>120</b> that is at least 70 percent smaller in at least one dimension, at least 85 percent smaller in at least one dimension, or at least 90 percent smaller in at least one dimension. The graded-index region <b>110</b> is comprised of layers of material in which each layer has a successively higher index of refraction than the previous layer and the index of refraction increases toward a waveguide <b>120</b>. An arrow <b>111</b> indicates the direction of increasing index of refraction. The waveguide region <b>120</b> has the same index of refraction as the layer of the graded-index lens region having the highest index. In an embodiment of the invention, the graded-index lens <b>110</b> is comprised of Si<sub>(1-x)</sub>Ge<sub>x</sub>. The index of refraction increases as the percent composition of Ge in the Si<sub>(1-x)</sub>Ge<sub>x </sub>increases. In an embodiment of the invention, an index of refraction change from 3.5 to 3.56 represents a SiGe materials having from 0 to 10 atomic % Ge. The graded-index region <b>110</b> is comprised of at least 4 layers of material, at least 5 layers of material, or a number of layers that is between and including 5 to 10 layers.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an embodiment of the invention, incoming multimode light <b>105</b> from a waveguide, fiber, or lens has dimensions of 20-30 &#x3bc;m by 20-30 &#x3bc;m and the height, h<sub>1</sub>, and the width (not shown) of the graded-index lens region <b>110</b> are 30 &#x3bc;m. The height of the output light <b>106</b>, h<sub>2</sub>, is 3 to 4 &#x3bc;m and the width (not shown) is 30 &#x3bc;m. In the embodiment, the focal distance, f<sub>d</sub>, of the graded-index lens <b>150</b> is 300 &#x3bc;m. Other dimensions for the incoming light, the light output waveguide, and the focal distance are possible. For example, multimode fibers that act as optical waveguides also are commercially available in 50 &#x3bc;m and 62.5 &#x3bc;m diameters. In general, embodiments of the invention are useful as photonic links where multimode coupling and optical beam size conversion are needed. Embodiments of the invention are capable of providing at least a 70% coupling efficiency between a multimode light source and a smaller-dimensioned waveguide.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Other materials the graded-index lens <b>110</b> can be include, for example, dielectric SiON, polymers, and III-V/II-VI semiconductors. Semiconductor materials that are III-V/II-VI semiconductors are materials that are comprised of elements from group III (3A), group V (5A), group II (2A), and group VI (6A), respectively, of the periodic table. Elements from group III include, for example, aluminum, indium, and gallium, elements from group V include, for example, phosphorous, arsenic, and antimony, elements from group II include, for example, beryllium, magnesium, calcium, and strontium, and elements from group VI include oxygen, sulfur, selenium, and tellurium. In embodiments of the invention, the graded-index lens is GaAs or InP. Other materials and values for ranges of the index of refraction range for the graded-index lens <b>110</b> are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">An optional echelle grating <b>130</b> is interposed between the waveguide photodetector <b>125</b> and the graded-index lens region <b>110</b>. The echelle grating <b>130</b> is made up of slits having widths that are close to the wavelength of diffracted light. The slits are filled, for example, with silicon dioxide. The echelle grating <b>130</b> is capable of functioning as a demultiplexer which separates the optical beam according to wavelengths of light carrying distinct information streams. The echelle grating can refract different wavelengths at different angles. The different wavelengths are then guided at different locations. The waveguide photodetector <b>125</b> is optically coupled to the waveguide <b>120</b> and is, for example, a SiGe photodetector, a p-i-n photodiode, p-n photodiode, an avalanche photodiode, and or an edge detector. An exemplary p-i-n photodetector evanescently coupled to a waveguide is described in Yin, Tao, et al., &#x201c;31 GHz Ge n-i-p Waveguide Photodetectors on Silicon-on-Insulator Substrate,&#x201d; Optics Express, vol. 15, No. 12, 13965 (2007). The waveguide photodetector <b>125</b> is coupled to conducting regions <b>127</b> and <b>128</b> that allow the waveguide photodetector <b>125</b> to be driven by electronics (not shown). The electronics for driving the waveguide photodetector <b>125</b> and outputting the data contained in incoming light as electrical signal are optionally co-located with the graded-index lens <b>110</b> on an IC chip. The substrate <b>115</b> can be a substrate housing electronics for data output conversion whereby input light is converted to output electrical signal(s). Conducting regions <b>127</b> and <b>128</b> are comprised of, for example, p- or n-doped semiconductors, such as p- or n-doped silicon, and or metals. Conducting regions <b>127</b> and <b>128</b> are not necessarily both comprised of the same material. Region <b>135</b> is comprised, for example of silicon, although other materials are also possible. The waveguide photodetector <b>125</b> can also optionally be located in region <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In general, a waveguide consists of a core and a cladding or substrate at least partially surrounding the core. The refractive index of the core material is higher than that of the surrounding material (the cladding). A waveguide acts a router for light waves through total internal reflection within the core. Waveguides are transparent at the wavelengths at which optical communications operate, such as for example, infrared wavelengths.

The graph in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows the change in index of refraction along the y axis and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> was calculated for a SiGe graded-index multimode lens. From <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> it can be seen that an index of refraction (n) varies from 3.5 to 3.56 and that has a parabolic profile provides beam focusing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows the calculation of a focal distance for the graded-index lens of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. A focal distance of 250 &#x3bc;m is obtained for beam focusing by deriving the z position for the condition in which y=0. Other values for an overall change in refractive index and a lens height for a graded-index multimode coupler are also possible.
</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Ten digitized graded-index SiGe layers having dimensions of 30 &#x3bc;m by 30 &#x3bc;m were modeled using the Beam Propagation Method. An 80% coupling efficiency was found for the fundamental mode coupling for the condition in which the fundamental mode input dimension was 30 &#x3bc;m diameter and the output waveguide dimension was 3 &#x3bc;m by 30 &#x3bc;m. The focal distance was found to be 200 &#x3bc;m which was close to the focal distance calculated with the analytical model. For multimode coupling with up to 20 modes launched together into the SiGe graded-index structure, a coupling efficiency of 73% and a focal distance of 200 &#x3bc;m were obtained. In general, minimizing loss in the fundamental mode is easier to achieve than minimizing loss for additional modes present in the multimode coupling situation. Performing similar calculations for a six digitized layer SiGe graded-index structure having dimensions of 30 &#x3bc;m by 30 &#x3bc;m yielded a coupling efficiency that was about 10% less than what was found for the ten digitized graded-index SiGe layer structure.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an embodiment of an optical transceiver unit for converting an incoming optical signal to an electrical signal. The optical transceiver unit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is useful, for example as part of an optical data transmission system, a computer system, a computing device, and the systems of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. Other configurations are also possible. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the conversion unit is housed on board <b>305</b>. An optical signal enters the conversion unit through multimode fiber <b>310</b>. The multimode fiber <b>310</b> is optically coupled to a graded-index lens region <b>315</b> which focuses an incoming optical beam in at least one dimension. The graded-index lens region <b>315</b> is optically coupled to a demultiplexing region <b>320</b> which splits an incoming optical beam into data-carrying component wavelengths. The component light beams are directed into photodetectors <b>325</b>. In this embodiment, four photodetectors <b>325</b> are shown, although other numbers are possible. Photodetectors <b>325</b> are SiGe photodetectors, a p-i-n photodiodes, p-n photodiodes, avalanche photodiodes, or edge detectors. Output from the four photodetectors <b>325</b> enters the conversion module <b>330</b> which converts the signal from the photodetectors <b>325</b> (current signal) into signal that can be used by other devices (amplified voltage signal). In embodiments of the invention, the conversion module <b>330</b> is a trans-impedance amplifier (TIA). The TIA converts the current signal from each photodetector into a voltage signal and amplifies it. The gain is called the trans-impedance gain. The graded-index lens region <b>315</b>, demultiplexing region <b>320</b>, photodetectors <b>325</b>, and conversion module <b>330</b> are optionally built on a semiconductor chip which is then packaged (packaged semiconductor chip <b>335</b>) to include coupler <b>340</b> which couples output electronic signals from conversion module <b>330</b> to board <b>305</b>. The conversion module <b>330</b> converts each electrical signal from each photodetector <b>325</b> into a separate signal each of which is output through coupler <b>340</b>. In this embodiment, board <b>305</b> includes metal traces <b>345</b> which are electrically coupled to electrical connectors <b>350</b>. The metal traces <b>345</b> are coupled to an input coupler (not shown) attached to the board <b>305</b>. The input coupler couples with coupler <b>340</b> and routes the four (in this example) electrical signals from the conversion module so that each signal is routed to one of the traces <b>345</b>. Electrical connectors <b>350</b> are plugs or sockets, for example. Electrical connectors <b>350</b> are capable of connecting with other elements of a computing system. Other configurations are also possible for units that convert optical to electrical signal. For example, other configurations can include, for example, various waveguides, splitters, gratings, and rings, and any possible passive devices before the photo-detector.</p>

The optical transceiver <b>420</b> comprises at least one graded-index lens and photodetector (not shown). Optionally, the optical transceiver <b>420</b> also comprises an optical demultiplexer (not shown). Optical signal enters the optical transceiver <b>420</b>, is focused into a waveguide having a smaller dimension by the graded-index lens, and detected by the photodetector. Optionally, the optical signal is demultiplexed before it is detected by the photodetector.

Some or all of the components of the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are optionally integrated into semiconductor chips. Waveguides <b>515</b> optically connect the hybrid lasers <b>510</b> to optical modulators <b>520</b> that encode information. Light output is then capable of passing to the optional multiplexer <b>525</b> which channels the output of the optical modulators <b>520</b> into an optical waveguide <b>530</b>. Optionally, the optical waveguide <b>530</b> is an optical fiber. In embodiments of the invention, the waveguide or fiber is a multimode fiber. Multimode fibers can enable low-cost and passive alignment enabled coupling. Optical receiver <b>535</b> is capable of receiving the light output from the optical waveguide <b>530</b> and may be housed on an integrated circuit chip.

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Typically a computer, a portable computing device, or other device comprising a processor, has a processing system, including a processor that is communicatively coupled to one or more volatile or non-volatile data storage devices, such as random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), mass storage devices such as serial advanced technology attachment (SATA) or small computer system interface hard drives, and or devices capable of accessing media, such as floppy disks, optical storage, tapes, flash memory, memory sticks, CD-ROMs and or digital video disks (DVDs). The term ROM refers to non-volatile memory devices such as erasable programmable ROM (EPROM), electrically erasable programmable ROM (EEPROM), flash ROM, and or flash memory. The processor may also be communicatively coupled to additional components, such as video controllers, SCSI controllers, network controllers, universal serial bus (USB) controllers, and input devices. Communications between elements of the computer system, additional processors, and or the electrical usage monitors can occur using various wired and or wireless short range protocols including, USB, WLAN (wireless local area network), radio frequency (RF), satellite, microwave, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11, Bluetooth, optical, fiber optical, infrared, cables, and lasers.</p>
