<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Danish Utility Model Application #BA 2010 00171, filed on Sep. 9, 2010, and incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Not Applicable.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to motor skills training, and more particularly to a visual stimulus game apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Cognitive research has shown that motor skills, including ability to react quickly, are important for a child's general learning ability. In other words, children better learn math, ball handling and response speed workout. Smaller children, &#xbd;-3 years old, have a naturally ability to train these skills themselves. For example, balance ability is learned by standing and walking, and ball control comes by playing. Training and developing a child's reaction speed and motor skills have important positive consequences for the child's future learning ability.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are several ways to construct a reactivity trainer. Presently it is common that the adult person (hereinafter called &#x201c;the trainer&#x201d;) sits with the child or an injured person needing rehabilitation or other person in need of such training (hereinafter called &#x201c;the student&#x201d;) and moves or manipulates various objects as the student in one way or another tries to find, touch, grab or catch the objects. But students can typically see the trainer's hand and arm movements and in this way can partially predict the motion of the moving object, thus reducing the training effectiveness.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, there is a need for a device that allows a trainer to develop motor skills in a student that is easy to use, inexpensive to manufacture, and allows for a variety of skill levels of the student. Such a needed device would shield the motion of the trainer's arm and hands from the student, and would provide feedback to the student of success. Such a needed invention would appear to be a game and would be fun for the student to use. The present invention accomplishes these objectives.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present device is an aid for a trainer teaching a student motor skills to increase the student's visual reflexes, hand-eye coordination, and reflex speed. A shield has a substantially flat front side and rear side. The shield is made from a magnetically inert material, such as plastic, wood, cardboard, or the like. Further, the shield is preferably large enough to shield the motion of the trainer's hands from the student while in-use. At least one screen is fixed to the front side of the shield. Such a screen provides at least one camouflage means and is made from a magnetically inert material.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A token has a magnetically-attractive material proximate a bottom side thereof, and a token controller has a first magnet fixed proximate a top side thereof, such that the token controller may be used to move the token around on the screen when the token controller is pressed up against the rear side of the shield.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The camouflage means may include a pattern applied to a top side of the token and a similar pattern applied to a front surface of one of the at least one screens. As such, the token is visually difficult to discern against the screen when the token is stationary, but relatively easy to see when moving. Alternately, or perhaps in combination with the patterns, one of the screens may include at least one raised portion raised off of the front surface of the screen a distance sufficient to receive the token thereunder. As such, the trainer can move the token back and forth from under each raised portion to alternately raised above the front side of the shield, with at least one aperture formed therein through which the token may be seen and grasped by the student.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, the token further includes an electronic circuit that activates a stimulation transducer such as an audio speaker or LED when the student successfully grasps the token and removes the token from the screen.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In use, with one of the at least one screens fixed with the front side of the shield and the top side of the token controller placed against the rear side of the shield, and with the bottom side of the token placed on the screen and aligned with the token controller, the trainer may move the token controller about the rear side of the shield to move the toke correspondingly about the screen. The shield blocks the student from being able to determine the movements of the token by watching the movements of the trainer. Various activities and games may be played with the aid, revolving primarily about the student trying to grasp a token that is moved by the trainer about the screen.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Each shield and screen is made of a material that allows a magnetic field to penetrate. The trainer is now able, using magnetic force, to transfer his movement from the rear side of the shield to the front side of the screen using a magnet on one side of the screen and a magnet or a magnetic material on the other side of the screen. During training, the student must find and/or capture the token on the student side of the screen. The aim of the present invention is using screen separation and the magnetic transfer of the trainer's movements to maximize student focus exclusively to keep track of the token moving on the student side of the screen. This new increased effect of training is achieved by making the screen large enough to hide the trainer's forearm and hand, and that movements are transferred directly through the screen by means of magnetic force. It is desired also for training the children that this magnetic power is adjustable in force so that the child is able to seize and remove the token from the screen as proof that the subject is caught. This magnetic holding force between the token and the token controller must therefore be at the low end between 0.2 and 5 Newton. At the same time, the size of the token must be large enough that it cannot be swallowed by a toddler or small child.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The invention involves training that gets more difficult and more fun as the child grows in age and training. Many different screens may be developed, each requiring a different skill level for the student to be successful at &#x201c;catching&#x201d; the token. Variations of the camouflaged means of the present invention may include, but are not limited to, camouflaged paintings, raised &#x201c;garages&#x201d; to hide the magnet, screen with apertures where the token only appears infrequently, &#x201c;3D&#x201d; painting with many images similar to that of the token, thus camouflaging the token when it is stationary.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention is a device that allows a trainer to develop motor skills in a student. The present device is easy to use, inexpensive to manufacture, and allows for a variety of skill levels of the student. The present invention shields the motion of the trainer's arm and hands from the student, and provides feedback to the student of success. The present invention resembles a game and is fun for the student to use. Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following more detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> illustrate an aid <b>10</b> for a trainer (not shown) teaching a student (not shown) motor skills to increase the student's visual reflexes, hand-eye coordination, and reflex speed. A shield <b>20</b> has a substantially flat front side <b>22</b> and rear side <b>28</b>. The shield <b>20</b> is made from a magnetically inert material, such as plastic, wood, or the like. Further, the shield <b>20</b> is preferably large enough to shield the motion of the trainer's hands from the student while in-use, such as at least 6&#x2033;&#xd7;6&#x2033; but preferably even larger. The shield <b>20</b> as shown in the illustrations takes the form of a heart shape, but could be any suitable shape such as square, rectangular, oval, round, clover-leaf, diamond, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">At least one screen <b>30</b> is fixed to the front side <b>22</b> of the shield <b>20</b> with an attachment means <b>40</b> and is made from a magnetically inert material, such as cardboard, plastic, or the like. The attachment means <b>40</b> may be a friction fit of each screen <b>30</b> within a raised border <b>25</b> of the shield <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), for example. Alternately, each screen <b>30</b> may be made from a cling vinyl type material so that static cling retains each screen on the front side <b>22</b> of the shield <b>20</b>, static cling acting as the attachment means <b>40</b>. Alternately, at least one mechanical fastener <b>130</b>, such as a pair of magnets or clips (not shown), for example, may be used to mechanically fix each screen to the front side <b>22</b> of the shield <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A token <b>60</b> has a magnetically-attractive material <b>70</b> proximate a bottom side <b>62</b> thereof, and a token controller <b>80</b> has a first magnet <b>90</b> fixed proximate a top side <b>88</b> thereof, such that the token controller <b>80</b> may be used to move the token <b>60</b> around on the screen <b>30</b> when the token controller <b>80</b> pressed up against the rear side <b>28</b> of the shield <b>20</b>. In one embodiment, the magnetically-attractive material <b>70</b> of the token <b>60</b> is a second magnet <b>75</b>. In one embodiment (not shown), the token controller <b>80</b> has a plurality of magnets spaced apart such that a plurality of the tokens <b>60</b> may be used, all moving simultaneously but perhaps rotating with respect to each other as the trainer manipulates the token controller.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">At least one of the screens <b>30</b> provides at least one camouflage means <b>50</b>. The camouflage means <b>50</b> may include a pattern <b>100</b> applied to a top side <b>68</b> of the token <b>60</b> and a similar pattern <b>110</b> applied to a front surface <b>32</b> of one of the at least one screens <b>30</b>. As such, the token <b>60</b> is visually difficult to discern against the screen <b>30</b> when the token <b>60</b> is stationary, but easy to see when moving.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Alternately, or perhaps in combination with the patterns <b>100</b>,<b>110</b>, one of the screens <b>30</b> may include at least one raised portion <b>120</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) raised off of the front surface <b>32</b> of the screen <b>30</b> a distance sufficient to receive the token <b>60</b> thereunder. As such, the trainer can move the token <b>60</b> back and forth from under each raised portion <b>120</b> to alternately show and then hide the token <b>60</b> from the student. In one embodiment, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, most of the screen <b>30</b> is raised above the front side <b>22</b> of the shield <b>20</b>, with at least one aperture <b>35</b> formed therein through which the token <b>60</b> may be seen and grasped by the student.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment, the token <b>60</b> further includes an electronic circuit <b>150</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) that has a power source <b>160</b>, such as a battery, a stimulation transducer <b>170</b>, and a normally-closed switch <b>180</b> that is configured to power the stimulation transducer <b>170</b> when closed. As such, when the token <b>60</b> is held against the screen <b>30</b> by the first magnet <b>90</b> of the token controller <b>80</b>, the switch <b>180</b> is open. But when the student successfully grasps the token <b>60</b> and removes the token <b>60</b> from the screen <b>30</b>, the switch <b>180</b> closes to activate the stimulation transducer <b>170</b>. Such a stimulation transducer <b>170</b> may be an audio speaker, a vibration generator, at least one LED, or a combination thereof, for example. As such, when the student successfully grasps and removes the token <b>60</b> from the screen <b>30</b> the stimulation transducer <b>170</b> acts as an award to alert the student of success. The audio speaker, for example, may play a prerecorded sound clip of a crown applauding, for example, such a prerecorded sound clip being stored in a memory (not shown) of the electronic circuit <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In such an embodiment, the electronic circuit <b>150</b> may further include a timing means <b>190</b>, such as a timing circuit <b>230</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). As such, when the token <b>60</b> is removed from the screen <b>30</b>, the switch <b>180</b> closes to activate the stimulation transducer <b>170</b> for a period of time determined by the timing means <b>190</b>. Once the switch <b>180</b> is reopened, such as by applying it again to the screen <b>30</b>, the timing means <b>190</b> resets.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In use, with one of the at least one screens <b>30</b> fixed with the front side <b>22</b> of the shield <b>20</b> and the top side <b>88</b> of the token controller <b>80</b> placed against the rear side <b>28</b> of the shield <b>20</b>, and with the bottom side <b>62</b> of the token <b>60</b> placed on the screen <b>30</b> and aligned with the token controller <b>80</b>, the trainer may move the token controller <b>80</b> about the rear side <b>28</b> of the shield <b>20</b> to move the toke <b>60</b> correspondingly about the screen <b>30</b>. The shield <b>20</b> blocks the student from being able to determine the movements of the token <b>60</b> by watching the movements of the trainer. Various activities and games may be played with the aid <b>10</b>, revolving primarily about the student trying to grasp a token <b>60</b> that is moved by the trainer about the screen <b>30</b>. As the student progresses in his ability to successfully &#x201c;catch&#x201d; the token <b>60</b>, the trainer may move the token <b>60</b> more quickly about the screen <b>30</b> to offer a greater challenge to the student, or another screen <b>30</b> may be installed on the shield <b>20</b> that provides more challenge to the student in grasping the token <b>60</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A cover <b>140</b> may be included and adapted to close over the shield <b>20</b> and contain the token <b>60</b>, token controller <b>80</b>, and at least one of the shields <b>30</b> therebetween (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref> and <b>2</b>). Such a cover <b>140</b> may be magnetically fixed with the shield with at least one pair of magnets <b>145</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">While a particular form of the invention has been illustrated and described, it will be apparent that various modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, various shapes of the shield <b>20</b> and screens <b>30</b> may be used other than those illustrated in the drawings. Accordingly, it is not intended that the invention be limited, except as by the appended claims.</p>
