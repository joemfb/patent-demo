<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a height-adjustable support for semi-trailers or the like. Such supports are arranged in pairs in the front region of semi-trailers and, in the fast gear, can be brought into the supporting or transport position and, if necessary, in the low gear, they can be used to lift a partial mass of the semi-trailer.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A generic support is known from EP 1 104 369 B1. Its large-diameter gearwheel for the fast gear is designed pot-shaped and supported in a cap seated on an outer sleeve. At the front face of the support and constructionally below the transmission input shaft, the large gear rim of this gearwheel directly dips into the outer sleeve. Constructionally, this necessitates a substantial shortening of the front wall region of the inner sleeve, resulting in a loss of guiding length between the outer and the inner sleeves, which, in the case of an extreme lifting length of the inner sleeve, leads to a loss of kinking and bending stiffness of the support.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is an object of the invention to propose a height-adjustable support for semi-trailers, in which it is possible to change easily and safely between a low gear and a fast gear.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This object is achieved by means of a height-adjustable support for semi-trailers or the like having the features defined in claim <b>1</b>. Preferred embodiments are defined in the dependent claims.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to the invention a height-adjustable support for semi-trailers or the like is provided, comprising a shaft tube body that can be fastened to a semi-trailer frame, a slidable support inner tube which is arranged in the shaft tube body and to the lower end region of which a foot is fastened and which support inner tube is connected to a nut located on a spindle, which can be driven by a transmission having a switchable spur gear region and a bevel gear stage, wherein a shifting region of the transmission comprises a low-gear pinion and a fast-gear gearwheel, wherein the low-gear pinion is associated with or arranged on a drive shaft or a pinion coupling part, which can mesh with a low-gear gearwheel, wherein the fast-gear gearwheel can cause the driving of a fast-gear pinion, wherein the fast-gear gearwheel is supported on the drive shaft or the pinion coupling part, respectively, and wherein the drive shaft or the pinion coupling part, respectively, is supported in an unrotatable and axially slidable manner in a sleeve bearing, which is supported rotatably in a bearing block or load bearing base, respectively, supporting or bearing the spindle.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the support according to the invention the large-diameter fast-gear gearwheel is supported on the drive shaft or a pinion coupling part with drive piece, respectively, which are each supported in a sleeve bearing in an unrotatable and axially slidable manner, wherein the drive piece in turn is rotatable and, like the spindle, is supported in a load bearing base or bearing block, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the invention it is proposed to support the drive shaft or the pinion coupling part, respectively, in an unrotatable and axially slidable manner in a sleeve bearing which, in turn, is supported rotatably in the load bearing base.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Advantageously, the arrangement of the large-diameter gearwheel for the fast-gear operation has no negative influence on its optimal design.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably, the sleeve bearing has at least a longitudinal groove at its inside, into which groove a carrier of the drive shaft or the pinion coupling part, respectively, can be inserted or with which it can engage, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Advantageously, the drive shaft or the pinion coupling part, respectively, has a bearing journal with at least a carrier, preferably two carriers, which preferably protrude radially.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The sleeve bearing preferably can be provided with longitudinal grooves at its inside into which, for establishing the torsional rigidity with the drive shaft, preferably two radially protruding carriers engage at the end region of the support inner side of the drive shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Expediently, the carrier is designed to mesh with the fast-gear gearwheel after a displacement of the drive shaft or of the pinion coupling part, respectively. Thus, after the displacement of the drive shaft, the carriers of the drive shaft can serve for meshing with the fast-gear gearwheel so as to cause its rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, the carrier has a width and an arrangement on the drive shaft or the pinion coupling part, respectively, such that at the same time a meshing with the fast-gear gearwheel and the sleeve bearing is made possible. If the width and the arrangement of the carriers are chosen such that simultaneously also a positive meshing with the sleeve bearing is ensured when they are coupled with the fast-gear gearwheel, it is achieved that during the fast-gear operation the sleeve bearing rotates synchronously to the fast-gear gearwheel. This offers the advantage that the shifting from the fast-gear operation is made possible by means of a slight axial displacement of the drive shaft since the carriers can glide within the longitudinal grooves of the fast-gear gearwheel and the sleeve bearing, which grooves are axially aligned in this case.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, the drive shaft is supported in a flange bearing, which heightwise is located below the drive shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is also preferred that in the preferably retracted state of the support the lower region of the fast-gear gearwheel protrudes heightwise into the support inner tube.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Preferably, the drive shaft or the pinion coupling part, respectively, is arranged perpendicularly to the spindle.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Expediently, the fast-gear gearwheel is located within the shaft tube body at a distance from its front wall. The fast-gear gearwheel is arranged within the shaft tube body at a distance from its front wall and preferably in its lower region heightwise arranged such that it protrudes into the support inner tube. The fast-gear gearwheel is also supported in the inner region of the shaft tube body. To this end, it is preferably not necessary to cut out the front wall region of the support inner tube, which would reduce its strength.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferably, the sleeve bearing is supported in a bearing bore of the bearing block or load bearing base, respectively.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The support <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> is fastened in pairs to the front region of the chassis of a semi-trailer. The supports <b>10</b> of each pair are connected to one another by means of a connecting shaft <b>11</b> at their transmission output shafts or driven shafts <b>12</b>, respectively, and in the transport position, they are retracted, i.e. in their shortened state. Prior to uncoupling the semi-trailer from the road tractor, the supports <b>10</b> are extended.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The support <b>10</b> has a support outer tube or a shaft tube body <b>13</b>, respectively, and a support inner tube <b>14</b> which is arranged therein such that it is slidable in the longitudinal direction. The inner region of the shaft tube body <b>13</b> and the support inner tube <b>14</b> preferably have square cross-sections. The support <b>10</b> is fastened to the semi-trailer frame by means of flange legs <b>13</b><i>a </i>located on the shaft tube body <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">At the lower end of the support inner tube <b>14</b> there is fastened a foot <b>15</b> for placement onto the ground.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the support <b>10</b> has a spindle <b>16</b> with a spindle nut or nut <b>17</b>, respectively. The nut <b>17</b> is connected to the support inner tube <b>14</b> (not shown). On a disc on the shoulder of the spindle <b>16</b> there is seated an axial bearing <b>18</b> which is supported on a bearing block or load bearing base <b>19</b>, respectively, fastened in the shaft tube body <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Above the load bearing base <b>19</b> there is a bevel gear or crown wheel <b>20</b>, respectively, which is connected in an unrotatable manner to the spindle <b>16</b> by means of a pin <b>21</b>, which carries the spindle <b>16</b>. Above the crown wheel <b>20</b> there is arranged the driven shaft <b>12</b>. On the driven shaft <b>12</b> there are seated a low-gear gearwheel <b>22</b>, a fast-gear pinion <b>23</b> and a bevel gear or bevel pinion <b>24</b>, respectively, each in an unrotatable manner. The driven shaft <b>12</b> is axially fixed by means of a plug-in lock washer <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the load bearing base <b>19</b> the spindle <b>16</b> is supported vertically. Furthermore, in a bearing bore <b>19</b><i>a </i>of the load bearing base <b>19</b> a rotatable sleeve bearing <b>26</b> is supported horizontally. The sleeve bearing <b>26</b> has at its inside longitudinal grooves <b>26</b><i>a</i>. In the sleeve bearing <b>26</b> the bearing journal <b>27</b><i>a </i>of an axially slidable drive shaft <b>27</b> is supported in an unrotatable manner. The bearing journal <b>27</b><i>a </i>of the drive shaft <b>27</b> has in its front region radially protruding carriers <b>27</b><i>b</i>. On the drive shaft <b>27</b> there is also provided a toothing as a low-gear pinion <b>27</b><i>c</i>. The shank of the drive shaft <b>27</b> is supported in a flange bearing <b>28</b> which is fastened to the shaft tube body <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">To the outer end of the drive shaft <b>27</b> a hand crank <b>29</b> is fastened. The flange bearing <b>28</b> has a collar bush <b>30</b> with two radial grooves <b>30</b><i>a </i>into which a ball stop <b>31</b> mounted in the drive shaft <b>27</b> can alternately lock.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">On the bearing journal <b>27</b><i>a </i>there is supported a fast-gear gearwheel <b>32</b> which has inner longitudinal grooves <b>32</b><i>a </i>which, as regards their cross-section and radial arrangement, correspond to the longitudinal grooves <b>26</b><i>a </i>in the sleeve bearing <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The transmission functions of the support <b>10</b> are as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, for the low-gear operation the drive shaft <b>27</b> is inserted, wherein the toothing of the low-gear pinion <b>27</b><i>c </i>is in mesh with the low-gear gearwheel <b>22</b>, and the carriers <b>27</b><i>b </i>are located within the longitudinal grooves <b>26</b><i>a </i>of the sleeve bearing <b>26</b>. The drive shaft <b>27</b> is axially fixed since the ball stop <b>31</b> locks into the rear radial groove <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the collar bush <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">When cranking the hand crank <b>29</b> on the drive shaft <b>27</b>, the sleeve bearing <b>26</b>, caused by the carriers <b>27</b><i>b</i>, is also rotated and torque or force is transmitted as is shown by arrow lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Force flows from the low-gear pinion <b>27</b><i>c </i>to the low-gear gearwheel <b>22</b>, via the driven shaft <b>12</b> to the bevel pinion <b>24</b>, from there via the crown wheel <b>20</b>, then to the spindle <b>16</b> and the nut <b>17</b> which moves the support inner tube <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in the fast-gear operation, the drive shaft <b>27</b> is displaced towards the outside. In this case, the overlapping or meshing of the toothing of the low-gear pinion <b>27</b><i>c </i>and the low-gear gearwheel <b>22</b> is removed or canceled and the ball stop <b>31</b> is locked into the front radial groove <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the collar bush <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The position of the carriers <b>27</b><i>b </i>is such that they mesh both with the longitudinal grooves <b>32</b><i>a </i>and the longitudinal grooves <b>26</b><i>a </i>and drive the fast-gear gearwheel <b>32</b>, wherein the sleeve bearing <b>26</b> can be rotated simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">When cranking the hand crank <b>27</b>, the power flows from the drive shaft <b>27</b> via the carriers <b>27</b><i>b </i>into the fast-gear gearwheel <b>32</b> and from the latter to the fast-gear pinion <b>23</b>, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> with dot-dash arrow lines.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The further power flow is the same as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Between the shifting position for the low-gear operation and that for the fast-gear operation of the transmission a freewheel is possible. Here, the low-gear pinion <b>27</b><i>c </i>is not in mesh and, as during the low-gear operation, the carriers <b>27</b><i>b </i>are in a position within the longitudinal grooves <b>26</b><i>a </i>of the sleeve bearing <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the foregoing description, it will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art that modifications may be made to the invention without departing from the concepts disclosed herein. Such modifications are to be considered as included in the following claims, unless these claims by their language expressly state otherwise.</p>
