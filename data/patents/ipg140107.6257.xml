<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a view <b>130</b> of an exemplary environment in which one or more technologies may be implemented. As shown network <b>100</b> includes domain <b>140</b> including Application Service Router (ASR) <b>145</b> optionally linked to admin station <b>115</b>. Alternatively or additionally, admin station <b>115</b> can be linked to application manager <b>110</b> via control linkage <b>113</b>. Domain <b>140</b> includes appnet <b>150</b> including core <b>151</b> and core <b>152</b> at least coupled by linkage <b>155</b>, which can be a virtual or other channel between mutually remote sites, for example. In some embodiments, an appnet includes at least a set of cores associated with an application (or a suite of applications), and may also include circuitry, code, data, or the like. The cores may comprise processing cores or environments, simple communication cores, relays, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, a &#x201c;core&#x201d; refers to a processing core, a computer or processing environment, a network node, software or logic configured for processing data, active relay circuitry operable for handling data, or the like. Likewise a data object can be &#x201c;in&#x201d; a core if it is at more closely associated with that core than with other cores, for example by virtue of existing within one or more media of a hardware core or within a core's designated space allocation of memory or storage.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">One or more of the cores <b>151</b>, <b>152</b> in appnet <b>150</b> are coupled to ASR <b>145</b>. One or more of the cores <b>151</b>, <b>152</b> in appnet <b>150</b> can optionally interact with client <b>120</b> via request linkage <b>123</b>. Network <b>100</b> can (optionally) include one or more other appnets such as overlapping appnet <b>160</b>. Appnet <b>160</b> can include core <b>152</b> and core <b>163</b> at least, optionally coupled by open database communication (ODBC) link <b>165</b> or the like. In some embodiments, one or more cores <b>152</b>, <b>163</b> of appnet <b>160</b> can also be accessible to client <b>120</b>, such as by linkage <b>122</b>. As shown, each of appnets <b>150</b>, <b>160</b> associates an application (or a cluster of applications) to groups of cores. For example, one or more label(s) <b>166</b> (&#x201c;Enterprise&#x201d; or &#x201c;Parts Catalog,&#x201d; e.g.) can represent the application(s) of appnet <b>160</b> in view <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is shown a high-level logic flow <b>200</b> of an operational process. Operation <b>210</b> describes signaling a first application relating with a first core and with a second core (e.g. ASR <b>145</b> signaling that appnet <b>150</b> contains a rendering application distributed across network cores <b>151</b>, <b>152</b>). Alternatively or additionally, operation <b>210</b> can include signaling such a distributed application via a direct or indirect path. In some embodiments, operation <b>210</b> can include storing or transmitting an indication of a relationship between the application and the cores, optionally as one or more messages that also indicate features of the relationship. The features can include names or other handles of processes, resources, or controls affecting or effectuating the application at one or more of the cores, for example. In some embodiments, an application comprises software or firmware that employs the capabilities of circuitry for performing a user-assigned task or some other task that some operating systems might not perform.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Flow <b>200</b> includes operation <b>210</b>&#x2014;signaling a first application relating with a first core and with a second core (e.g. admin station <b>115</b> reporting a complete topography of appnet <b>150</b> via control linkage <b>113</b>). Portions of this topography can be omitted for brevity, of course, in some embodiments. Alternatively or additionally, in various embodiments as described below, operation <b>210</b> can likewise be performed by ASR <b>145</b> or by various combinations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 26</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Flow <b>200</b> further includes operation <b>220</b>&#x2014;signaling via a third core a partial service configuration change at least in the first core in response to data received after signaling the first application relating with the first core and with the second core (e.g. admin station <b>115</b> or ASR <b>145</b> signaling a process suspension or restart in core <b>151</b> responsive to an instruction from application manager <b>110</b> after operation <b>210</b>). Signaling the process suspension can include triggering or displaying an indication of the suspension or restart (via ASR <b>145</b> or control linkage <b>113</b>, e.g.).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is shown an exemplary environment in which one or more technologies may be implemented. Network <b>300</b> includes domain <b>301</b> including subsystem <b>302</b> and appnet <b>350</b> linked by channel <b>303</b> or otherwise able to communicate with each other.

<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Operation <b>3252</b> describes signaling an application cluster relating with the first core and with the second core, the application cluster including at least the first application (e.g. app interface <b>2728</b> addressing modules <b>1024</b>-<b>1026</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> as a single entity characterized or otherwise listed in cluster definitions <b>2799</b>). This can occur, for example, in any of the embodiments described in which aggregation module <b>2702</b> can perform operation <b>450</b> and in which channel <b>2710</b> is directly or indirectly coupled with appnet <b>1062</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Alternatively or additionally, app interface <b>2728</b> can provide one or more aspects of how the cluster relates with the cores, such as in a domain (domain <b>1000</b>, e.g.) to be used frequently for accessing two or more applications as a cluster. In some implementations of appnet <b>1062</b>, for example, tier <b>1002</b> can include three functionally related applications (module <b>1024</b>, <b>1025</b>, <b>1026</b>, e.g.) addressable as a cluster to permit a joint operation by or upon all three with a minimal service disruption.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Operation <b>3253</b> describes applying a common data aggregation policy to the application cluster (e.g. aggregator <b>2730</b> causing the application cluster to pause and report a status or progress regularly or occasionally). The status or progress can relate to one or more processes, cores, or resources in an appnet of the cluster, for example. In some embodiments, the aggregation policy includes one or more specifications of which phenomena are to be measured, which measurements are to be combined, which combinations are to be transmitted, which transmissions are to be aggregated, or which aggregations are to be retained. Those skilled in the art can incorporate existing policies of any of these types, or others, into the present context without undue experimentation.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Operation <b>3255</b> describes establishing an aggregation agent at a third core (e.g. dispatcher <b>2745</b> sending a mobile agent or the like as aggregator <b>2730</b> to core <b>2693</b> for gathering data sent by other cores <b>2691</b>, <b>2692</b> in cluster <b>2690</b>). Alternatively or additionally, dispatcher <b>2745</b> or the aggregation agent can occasionally generate data requests or other triggers causing one or more of cores <b>2691</b>, <b>2692</b> to send data as described herein to the &#x201c;third&#x201d; core.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Operation <b>3256</b> describes establishing a linkage between the aggregation agent and at least one of the first core or the second core (e.g. router <b>2737</b> adding core <b>2693</b> to cluster <b>2690</b> in the above example). This can occur, for example, by router <b>2737</b> allocating channel <b>2710</b> or linkage <b>2628</b>, at least temporarily linking core <b>2693</b> (at which aggregator <b>2730</b> has been established, e.g.) with core <b>2691</b>. (Those skilled in the art will recognize the foregoing as one of many examples of flows herein that can be performed in a different sequence than that shown. Of course a linkage between cores <b>2691</b> and <b>2693</b> can be established before or during operation <b>3255</b>, for example, so that establishing the agent establishes the linkage).</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Operation <b>3258</b> describes recording one or more system registry values (e.g. aggregator <b>2730</b> recording one or more register values <b>2732</b> in response to an interrupt or the like in the data received after signaling the application relating with the first core and with the second core). In some instances, for example, an entire system registry can be pushed onto a stack in response to a system error that aborts a process.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Operation <b>3264</b> describes including at least a link-layer protocol indicator within the portion of the aggregated information (e.g. sampler <b>2778</b> capturing an indication of whether incoming packets came via Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Token Ring, PPP, ATM, Frame Relay, SMDS, or the like). In some embodiments, of course, the information portion need not include packets, or the link layer may signify a protocol outside the internet protocol suite.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Operation <b>3265</b> describes including at least a time-indicative event indicator within the portion of the aggregated information (e.g. responder <b>2779</b> responding to input with a plot of one or more parameters versus time as graphical output <b>2785</b>). Operation <b>3265</b> can occur, for example, in embodiments in which signaling module <b>2701</b> performs operation <b>210</b>, in which aggregation module <b>2702</b> performs operation <b>450</b> (individually or jointly with resources <b>2704</b>), and in which transmission module <b>2703</b> performs operation <b>460</b>. The parameter(s) can include one or more of an error count, a port usage or resource level, a pattern-matching event symptomatic of a worm or other malicious agent, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Operation <b>3266</b> describes selecting the portion of the aggregated information in response to receiving a selection policy (e.g. distiller <b>2775</b> selecting a representative portion of the information aggregated in response to receiving one or more new executable instructions or other selection parameters). The representative portion can include every tenth record, for example, in an embodiment in which other records are discarded. Alternatively or additionally, in some embodiments distiller <b>2775</b> can be adjusted so that a diagnostically probative portion of the aggregated information is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Operation <b>3269</b> describes broadcasting at least the portion of the aggregated information (e.g. transmitter <b>2788</b> transmitting at least event indicators <b>2798</b> as text output <b>2787</b> to several destinations at addresses <b>2795</b>). Alternatively or additionally, the information portion can be sent to some or all cores within a tier, appnet or domain, in some embodiments. This can occur, for example, in embodiments in which transmission module <b>2703</b> can perform operation <b>460</b> by broadcasting a security or priority protocol change to all modules <b>1024</b>, <b>1025</b>, <b>1026</b> in cluster <b>1095</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, there are shown several variants of the flow <b>900</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Operation <b>960</b>&#x2014;associating a first mobile agent with a first security policy and a second mobile agent with a second security policy&#x2014;may include one or more of the following operations: <b>3364</b>, <b>3367</b>, <b>3368</b>, or <b>3369</b>.

<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Operation <b>3364</b> describes causing the first security policy to include one or more confidentiality policies (e.g. first security policy circuitry <b>2138</b> including one or more confidentiality policies <b>2154</b>). In some embodiments, a confidentiality policy can ensure that a first level of information cannot be accessed by a subject at any lower level of authorization. Alternatively or additionally, the access can be modulated so that the level of a required authorization depends upon whether the mode of accessing the information is to include reading, writing, modifying, executing or the like. This can occur, for example, at least in embodiments in which module <b>1751</b> implements the &#x201c;first&#x201d; mobile agent, in which policy association module <b>2130</b> is configured to perform operation <b>960</b>, in which evaluation module <b>2170</b> is configured to perform operation <b>970</b>, and in which first security policy circuitry <b>2138</b> is implemented as one or more of software, firmware, hardware, or media bearing signals. Alternatively or additionally, first security policy circuitry <b>2138</b> can include one or more of message encryption, user authentication, shrink-wrap licensing or other digital rights management technologies available to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Operation <b>3367</b> describes activating the first security policy at least in the first mobile agent (e.g. first security policy circuitry <b>2138</b> and activation logic <b>2131</b> jointly implementing a heartbeat, a provenance indication or the like in a spawning agent or the like). This can occur, for example, in embodiments in which the mobile agent includes a broker agent, a content delivery agent, a synthesizing agent, a research agent or the like. Likewise the first security policy can include security policies referenced herein or combinations of them, as will be understood by those skilled in the art. In some variants, the &#x201c;first&#x201d; security policy can include data integrity policies such as a &#x201c;no write up, no read down&#x201d; policy. Alternatively or additionally, such policies can include transaction integrity policies <b>2155</b> such as recording at least an authorization identifier and timestamp in association with each qualifying transaction. Those skilled in the art can implement many other existing data or transaction integrity policies selectively for use as the first security policy without undue experimentation. (Alternatively or additionally, of course they can likewise include implementations of flow <b>700</b> or flow <b>800</b> as taught herein for embodiments in which one or more of the mobile agents are remote.) Operation <b>3368</b> describes causing the second security policy to include one or more integrity policies (e.g. second security policy circuitry <b>2139</b> including data integrity policies <b>2136</b> or transaction integrity policies <b>2155</b>). Alternatively or additionally, this variant can include one or more of operation <b>3364</b>, operation <b>3367</b>, or other operations affecting or effectuating other security policies. This can occur, for example, in embodiments in which policy association module <b>2130</b> can perform operation <b>960</b>, in which message evaluation module <b>2170</b> can perform operation <b>970</b>, and in which module <b>1753</b> implements the &#x201c;first&#x201d; mobile agent.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Operation <b>3369</b> describes associating the first security policy at least with the first mobile agent and with the second mobile agent (e.g. association logic <b>2133</b> including a record or function that maps at least an identifier of the policy with the two or more mobile agents). Alternatively or additionally, the association may include activating or otherwise implementing the first security policy in the first or second mobile agents. In some variants, second security policy circuitry <b>2139</b> and association logic <b>2133</b> can jointly perform operation <b>3369</b> by providing specific security instructions to all addressable mobile agents in subsystem <b>1700</b>. The security instructions may include a periodic or occasional intrusion detection procedure, an incoming data filter implementation, a conditional security deactivation instruction, a handshaking protocol or the like as known by those skilled in the art. Alternatively or additionally, one or more agent selection criteria may be applied for deciding which software agents receive the specific security instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Operation <b>3371</b> describes evaluating the received message at least partly as a roughly contemporaneous response to receiving the indication of the first security policy (e.g. triggering circuitry <b>2178</b> causing one or more other portions of evaluation module <b>2170</b> to begin processing the received message within about a day of receiving the indication). This can occur, for example, in embodiments in which the evaluation of a recent message (e.g. that the first mobile agent &#x201c;needs a firewall&#x201d;) is changed (e.g. to &#x201c;needs a transaction security protocol&#x201d;) in response to the indication (e.g. that the first mobile agent &#x201c;has Firewall X&#x201d;). In some embodiments, the message evaluation can yield an error message, an event record, a process initiation, a reconfiguration, a level indication or the like. Alternatively or additionally the evaluation can be performed with user interaction, such as by indicating the first security policy and receiving the evaluation at user interface <b>2151</b> responsive to a suitably authorized user logging on a few weeks after network interface <b>2192</b> receives a message.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Operation <b>3373</b> describes receiving a level indicator as the indication of the first security policy or the indication of the second security policy (e.g. network interface <b>2192</b> receiving &#x201c;high,&#x201d; 61%, or 5th as one or more level indicators <b>2195</b> signifying a capacity, an activity level, a ranking, or the like).

<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Operation <b>3465</b> describes configuring the first mobile agent with one or more instructions able to cause the first mobile agent to transmit an indicator of the first security policy (e.g. code generation circuitry <b>2135</b> creating module <b>1758</b> able to transmit policy identifiers <b>2157</b> indicating one or more policies <b>1797</b>). This can occur, for example, in embodiments in which module <b>1758</b> implements the &#x201c;first&#x201d; mobile agent, in which core <b>1785</b> comprises subsystem <b>2100</b>, in which at least part of evaluation module <b>2170</b> can perform operation <b>970</b>, and in which channel <b>2110</b> can be coupled to transmit one or more of module <b>1758</b> or a message identifying the &#x201c;first&#x201d; security policy. Alternatively or additionally, the message can include a timestamp, a status, an event log, information about one or more processes <b>1794</b> or resources <b>2150</b> available at core <b>1785</b>, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Operation <b>3466</b> describes configuring the second mobile agent with one or more instructions able to cause the second mobile agent to transmit at least a portion of the second security policy (e.g. code generation circuitry <b>2135</b> configuring the &#x201c;second&#x201d; mobile agent with one or more data integrity policies <b>2136</b> comprising policy definition logic <b>2158</b> such as executable virus scanners and other malware detection code).

Data <b>2184</b> may indicate Field_<b>22</b> as a sender or subject of data <b>2184</b>, for example, in a scenario in which that agent was expected to remain anonymous. Alternatively or additionally, authentication logic <b>2183</b> can be configured to identify the second mobile agent implicitly by finding a sign of that agent in data <b>2184</b> (e.g. by intercepting a spyware message or the like identifying &#x201c;Field<sub>&#x2014;</sub>22&#x201d; as locally resident).</p>

Policy manager <b>2187</b> may be configured to respond by looking up the second security policy (e.g. as a table look-up function using policy list <b>2189</b>), for example, and optionally by providing information about the second security policy to the requesting entity.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Operation <b>3475</b> describes receiving an indication of a third security policy as the indication of the first security policy and as the indication of the second security policy (policy manager <b>2187</b> receiving policy list <b>2189</b> containing several policies as the third security policy). In some embodiments, policy list <b>2189</b> may likewise be configured to include associations between the first and second security policies and one or more mobile agents or other modules. The associations may identify one or more of (a) a module that currently subscribes, (b) a module that is able to subscribe, (c) a module that has previously subscribed, to the first or second security policy.

Operation <b>970</b>&#x2014;evaluating a received message at least in response to an indication of the first security policy and to an indication of the second security policy&#x2014;may include one or more of the following operations: <b>3572</b>, <b>3574</b>, or <b>3576</b>. Operation <b>3550</b>&#x2014;performing one or more additional operations&#x2014;may include one or more of the following operations: <b>3551</b>, <b>3553</b>, <b>3554</b>, or <b>3559</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Operation <b>3572</b> describes deciding whether to enable a triggering circuit in response to the indication of the second security policy (e.g. enable logic <b>2179</b> enabling some other portion of evaluation module <b>2170</b> in response to one or more indicators of type <b>2</b> policy <b>1799</b>). This can occur, for example, in embodiments in which policy association module <b>2130</b> can perform operation <b>960</b>, in which evaluation module <b>2170</b> can perform operation <b>970</b>, in which enable logic <b>2179</b> is configured to enable triggering circuit <b>2178</b> in response to at least one potential value of the second security policy indication. In one such embodiment, type <b>2</b> policy <b>1799</b> defines a network interface enable bit having a &#x201c;set&#x201d; value (e.g. 1) to which enable logic <b>2179</b> responds by enabling network interface <b>2192</b>. In some variants, type <b>2</b> policy <b>1799</b> can likewise define one or more other enable bits each respectively controlling access to one or more of resources <b>2150</b>, signal evaluation circuitry <b>2171</b>, authentication logic <b>2183</b>, policy manager <b>2187</b>, message handler <b>2190</b>, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">Operation <b>3574</b> describes transmitting a yes-orno decision (e.g. positive response logic <b>2173</b> producing no output or otherwise signaling a negative decision). This can occur, for example, in response to an indication that first security policy circuitry <b>2138</b> requires messages to have a checksum of 3, that second security policy circuitry <b>2139</b> requires messages to have at most ten bytes, and that the received message is a 94-byte message having a checksum of 2. The negative decision in this example thus indicates the message apparently did not come from any agent with the first or second security policy. Alternatively or additionally, a yes-or-no decision can indicate whether an error has occurred, whether a policy has been employed, whether a task shall proceed, or whether some other hypothesis is supported by observations. Alternatively or additionally, the evaluation(s) can include a level or other non-Boolean outcome.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">This can likewise occur in a variant in which the first and second security policies do not call the mobile agents to generate heartbeat signals, and in which the received message includes a heartbeat signal. The decision can thus indicate that the received message apparently did not come from the first or second mobile agent, for example. In some embodiments, such decisions can trigger a deployment (of a patch or diagnostic agent, e.g.) or be used as a basis for deciding whether to ignore a message. Alternatively or additionally, the message can indicate that one or more of the policies are to be ignored, for example, by virtue of module having disabled a policy. The message can likewise contain a policy dictating that other information is to be ignored such as trust indications, expected message protocols or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Operation <b>3576</b> describes evaluating a signal containing the received message (e.g. message handler <b>2190</b> and signal evaluation circuitry <b>2171</b> jointly producing ranking <b>2174</b> or explanation <b>2176</b> responsive to receiving signals <b>2198</b>). This can occur, for example, in embodiments in which packets, tasks, or other messages in the signal include priority-indicative data that can be used to rank them. The sample portion can include a digital signal decoded by a Viterbi detector or the like, for example. Alternatively or additionally, the responsive value can correlate with an error rate estimate, a confidence estimate relating to the received message, or other quality indicator(s). In some embodiments, some samples or portions of the signal can be disallowed so that the received message excludes them. Alternatively or additionally, such responsive values can be used as the evaluation(s) or further processed such as by one or more lookup tables to generate the scalar score, decision, or other evaluation.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Operation <b>3551</b> describes deploying at least the first mobile agent and the second mobile agent (e.g. deployment module <b>2160</b> deploying first agent <b>2161</b> and second agent <b>2162</b>). This can occur, for example, in embodiments in which these agents are mobile. In some embodiments, they may be deployed into respective cores (e.g. <b>1781</b>-<b>1783</b>) in direct mutual communication (respectively as modules <b>1755</b>, <b>1754</b>, e.g.).

In some embodiments an originating agent includes evaluation module <b>2170</b>, for example, including triggering circuitry <b>2178</b> for signaling when module <b>1751</b> should be deployed.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Operation <b>3554</b> describes deploying the first mobile agent remotely (e.g. deployment module <b>2160</b> and router <b>2168</b> jointly deploying first agent <b>2161</b> via one or more routes <b>2169</b>). In an embodiment in which core <b>1785</b> includes subsystem <b>2100</b> configured to deploy first agent <b>2161</b> to core <b>1782</b>, for example, routes <b>2169</b> can include numerous options even in the environment of subsystem <b>1700</b> (e.g. via core <b>1781</b>; via cores <b>1786</b>, <b>1787</b>; via cores <b>1786</b>, <b>1781</b>, <b>1787</b>; via cores <b>1786</b>, <b>1781</b>; via cores <b>1781</b>, <b>1787</b>; via cores <b>1784</b>, <b>1781</b>; via cores <b>1786</b>, <b>1781</b>, <b>1784</b>, <b>1783</b>; or via cores <b>1784</b>, <b>1783</b>). In some embodiments router <b>2168</b> implements one or more policies <b>1797</b> for controlling routes selected for deploying one or more portions of the first mobile agent. In one scenario, for example, the first mobile agent includes module <b>1757</b> in transit between core <b>1785</b> and core <b>1781</b> as a step toward deployment module <b>2160</b> performing operation <b>3554</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Operation <b>3559</b> describes deploying at least the second security policy to the first mobile agent (e.g. message handler <b>2190</b> deploying at least one of policies <b>2153</b> to first agent <b>2161</b>, before or after deployment module <b>2160</b> deploys first agent). In various embodiments, the second security policy can include, activate, modify, transmit, perform or otherwise implement one or more logical blocks of the first mobile agent, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, there are shown several variants of the flow <b>800</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Operation <b>880</b>&#x2014;providing a first agent with code for responding to situational information about the first agent and about a second agent&#x2014;may include one or more of the following operations: <b>3682</b>, <b>3683</b>, <b>3685</b>, <b>3686</b>, <b>3687</b>, or <b>3689</b>. Operation <b>3690</b>&#x2014;performing one or more other operations&#x2014;may include one or more of the following operations: <b>3691</b>, <b>3693</b>, <b>3695</b>, <b>3697</b>, or <b>3699</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Operation <b>3682</b> describes implementing a situation-dependent logic table in the first agent (e.g. linking module <b>2579</b> providing digital logic that generates one or more bits responsive to inputs that indicate a status of at least the first and second agent). This can occur, for example, in embodiments in which operation <b>880</b> is performed by agent configuration module <b>2580</b>, in which operation <b>890</b> is performed by agent deployment module <b>2590</b>, in which module <b>1751</b> implements the first agent, in which resources <b>1796</b> of module <b>1751</b> include the digital logic, and in which one or more portions of ASR <b>2530</b> or resources <b>2560</b> are configured to interact with module <b>1751</b>. Each input can, in some embodiments, relate to only one of the agents of subsystem <b>1700</b>. In other embodiments one or more of the inputs can jointly describe some aspect of more than one of the agents (e.g. a fault bit set when any agent signals a fault to linking, and otherwise generally not set). Alternatively or additionally, the situation-dependent logic table implementation can encode and depend upon situational aspects such as location, connection types and other aspects of resources, trust indications and other aspects of policies, resource and policy availability, active processes or controls, timestamps, version indicators, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Operation <b>3683</b> describes associating the second agent with a remote location (e.g. location designation logic <b>2582</b> locally identifying a remote core at which the second agent is or was situated). In some embodiments the second agent can include a mobile agent associated successively with a series of past or current remote locations such as may be specified by IP addresses. Alternatively or additionally, some remote locations associated with the second agent may include planned or potential locations within a directory structure. The first agent can optionally be configured to perform operation <b>3683</b>, such as in an embodiment in which module <b>1751</b> implements the first agent, in which module <b>1752</b> implements the second agent, and in which one or more resources <b>1796</b> of module <b>1751</b> can perform the associating. This can enable a module in a more-trusted location to monitor a module in unknown location, in some situation, such as when core <b>1782</b> is more trusted than core <b>1781</b>. Even without such trust information, though, positioning agents for monitoring other agents remotely can enhance operational safety.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Operation <b>3685</b> describes sending an inquiry to a network location (e.g. inquiry transmitter <b>2583</b> and network interface <b>2585</b> jointly polling nearby network locations to determine whether any have a specific resource). The specific resource can include one or more of a processing power surplus, an upgrade, electrical power, internet service, geographic information, surplus storage or the like, optionally within or otherwise controlled by a software module (e.g. resources <b>1796</b> controlled by module <b>1752</b>). In some embodiments, the inquiry is broadcast to any available nodes of an ad hoc network. It will be understood, however, that many variants of flow <b>800</b> described herein can be implemented even in the absence of a network.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Operation <b>3686</b> describes receiving data from the network location (e.g. network interface <b>2585</b> and receiver <b>2565</b> receiving packet data from a network that includes subsystem <b>1700</b> via channel <b>2510</b>). This can occur, for example, in embodiments in which agent configuration module <b>2580</b> and resources <b>2560</b> jointly perform operation <b>880</b>, in which at least ASR <b>2530</b> is configured to perform operation <b>890</b>, and in which in which the data can be treated as a response to the inquiry or otherwise as resource-indicative data.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">Operation <b>3687</b> describes deploying a mobile software agent as the second agent (e.g. allocation manager <b>2589</b> moving an executable portion of module <b>1752</b> into memory and triggering one or more processes <b>1794</b> leading to a departure of module <b>1752</b> from core <b>1781</b>). The one or more processes <b>1794</b> can serve other roles as exemplified herein, for example, in module <b>1752</b> or other modules of subsystem <b>1700</b> as shown. Alternatively or additionally, operation <b>3687</b> may comprise deploying the mobile software agent at a remote core or other location outside the core at which allocation manager <b>2589</b> operates (e.g. outside core <b>1781</b>).</p>

The data-transformative operations can include one or more of encrypting, compiling, compressing, or multiplexing, for example. This can occur, for example, in embodiments in which subsystem <b>2500</b> resides locally at the processing core (e.g. core <b>1785</b>). Alternatively or additionally, router <b>2593</b> can be used to transmit the second agent through one or more data relay cores or the like in an ad hoc network, which need not be configured to perform any processing of the second agent.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Operation <b>3691</b> describes generating the situational information at least partly based on an agent output (e.g. evaluator <b>2561</b> determining that an agent's environment is normal responsive to an absence of alerts or to an expected output from the agent). The expected output can include an outcome from a negotiation or other task, timestamps, visited locations or other provenance data, a heartbeat, gathered data or the like, for example. The evaluator can incorporate expectation logic (not shown) defining criteria by which the agent output is to be judged, suitable examples of which are readily available to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Operation <b>3693</b> describes sending a signal to the first agent (e.g. transmitter <b>2562</b> sending signal <b>2563</b> via port <b>2564</b> as one or more resources <b>1796</b> to module <b>1754</b>). Signal <b>2563</b> can include an executable module that resides alongside the first agent in a common core, for example (e.g. by using module <b>1755</b> for updating module <b>1752</b> in core <b>1781</b>). Alternatively or additionally, signal <b>2563</b> can include virus vectors, resource definition data, price negotiation data or other comparative information for use by the first agent for performing a primary function (e.g. price negotiation or related research) or secondary function (e.g. a mobile agent firewall or network topology discovery). In some embodiments, signal <b>2563</b> includes a heartbeat, a location identifier, a password or other mechanism for communicating with another agent, or other resources. In some embodiments, the signal is likewise sent to the second or other agents (e.g. in a broadcast operation by transmitter <b>2562</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">Operation <b>3695</b> describes receiving a security policy update (e.g. receiver <b>2565</b> receiving agent output <b>2569</b> indicating a revision of a security mechanism of subsystem <b>2500</b> or an agent residing there). In some embodiments, the update can simply be a change to a version number in a record describing the agent or the core in which it operates. Alternatively or additionally, the update can include a module implementing the security policy update, such as a replacement for an executable decryption module or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">Operation <b>3697</b> describes receiving situational data about the second agent via the first agent (e.g. receiver <b>2565</b> receiving relayed data <b>2566</b> about module <b>1758</b> via module <b>1759</b>). This can occur, for example, in embodiments in which module <b>1759</b> implements the &#x201c;first&#x201d; agent, in which module <b>1758</b> implements the &#x201c;second&#x201d; agent, and in which the first agent monitors, receives, or otherwise gleans situational data about the first agent. In some embodiments, the second agent resides within or near the first agent (i.e. at core <b>1785</b>) and distills a concise inference about the situation of the first agent. The inference can include an indication of trust or risk, for example, responsive to a reaction time, ownership, task attribute, connection type, resource status, or other aspect of core <b>1785</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Operation <b>3699</b> describes receiving situational data from the second agent (e.g. receiver <b>2565</b> receiving situational input <b>2567</b> describing computing environment attributes relating to a domain including the second agent). Alternatively or additionally, the first agent can relay or otherwise receive the data from the second agent (e.g. ASR <b>2530</b> receiving the situational data from the second agent as message input <b>2541</b>, optionally discarding some of the data and relaying other parts as message output <b>2542</b>).</p>

<p id="p-0186" num="0185">Operation <b>3781</b> describes obtaining one or more risk indicators in the situational information about the first agent and about the second agent (e.g. implementer <b>2570</b> with risk dependency logic <b>2572</b> receiving raw vulnerability data such as an indication of a successful remote access). In some embodiments, risk indicators can be summarized or presented in conjunction with a responsive action such as an executable security protocol update module that can directly modify one or more of the agents. Alternatively or additionally, the obtained risk indicators can be distilled into more concise risk indicators (e.g. &#x201c;medium&#x201d; risk or &#x201c;R=2&#x201d; to a denial-of-service-type attack) for aggregation or transmission to a remote network management site. Those skilled in the art can readily implement such functions in light of teachings herein and of the general methodologies used, for example, in common vulnerability evaluation software such as Nessus (see NESSUS.COM), GFI LANguard (see GFI.COM), ISS Internet Scanner (see ISS.NET) or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">Operation <b>3782</b> describes including at least code for receiving a capacity indicator of the situational information (e.g. implementer <b>2570</b> with capacity dependency logic <b>2574</b> indicating a quantity of computational, storage, carrying or other capacity currently or potentially available). The capacity indicator can (optionally) include a count, percentage, or vector-valued entity. Alternatively or additionally, the included value can indicate a capacity indirectly, such as by giving a cores' response time in milliseconds as an indicator of its available capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">Operation <b>3784</b> describes including at least code for obtaining a handle of a network location of the situational information (e.g. implementer <b>2570</b> with location dependency logic <b>2573</b> remotely or locally invoking a utility that generates one or more addresses). The utility can function like TCPView or Netstat, for example, generating one or more addresses for each of several connections or processes or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">Operation <b>3785</b> describes receiving a mobile software agent as the first agent (e.g. memory manager <b>2576</b> receiving at least a portion of module <b>1755</b> into memory <b>2575</b> responsive to receiver <b>2577</b> receiving at least the portion from outside subsystem <b>2500</b>).

<p id="p-0190" num="0189">Operation <b>3786</b> describes obtaining the code for responding to the situational information about the first agent and about the second agent before obtaining the first agent (e.g. memory manager <b>2576</b> and receiver <b>2577</b> jointly receiving receiver <b>2565</b> for inclusion in the &#x201c;first&#x201d; agent). In some implementations, operation <b>3786</b> can later be completed by code generator <b>2578</b> and memory manager <b>2576</b> jointly generating the first agent by assembling components in memory <b>2575</b> with received receiver <b>2565</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">Operation <b>3789</b> describes configuring the first agent with policy update code (e.g. receiver <b>2577</b> and code generator <b>2578</b> implementing malware-indicative or other anomaly signature data in one or more controls <b>1795</b> operable to update a policy in module <b>1757</b>). Controls <b>1795</b> for updating policies <b>1797</b> can be implemented as one or more code blocks, one or more executable instructions for modifying controls <b>1795</b> that configure a policy, one or more assignments or replacement values, or the like such as are known by those skilled in the art. In some implementations policies <b>1797</b> employed by processes <b>1794</b> are pervasively controlled by software switches, for example, for reducing the necessity of replacing executable code.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">Operation <b>3792</b> describes deploying the first agent to a first core operable to transmit a signal to a location of the second agent substantially directly via a passive medium (e.g. transmitter <b>2591</b> depositing module <b>1754</b> in core <b>1783</b> directly coupled to core <b>1782</b> via one or more passive media <b>1712</b>).

<p id="p-0195" num="0194">Operation <b>3798</b> describes deploying the first agent to a first location in response to an association between a second location and the second agent (e.g. deployment module <b>2160</b> sending first agent <b>2161</b> to core <b>1781</b> rather than to core <b>2691</b> responsive to an indication that second agent <b>2162</b> has been routed to core <b>1782</b>). This can occur, for example, in embodiments in which a current location of the second agent is unknown or in which the domain of each core is known. In some embodiments the first location is selected to be remote from the second location, such as those in which deployment module <b>2160</b> implements a dispersion of related agents that favors a first deployment into each listed domain over other deployments. Alternatively or additionally, in some embodiments, a decision to place the first agent into a domain (e.g. subsystem <b>1700</b>) can depend at least partly on an indication of whether one or more functionally related agents exist within the domain.

This can occur, for example, in embodiments in which at least first signaling module <b>2410</b> performs operation <b>210</b>, in which at least second signaling module <b>2420</b> performs operation <b>220</b>, in which local subsystem <b>2401</b> includes subsystem <b>1700</b>, and in which channel <b>2450</b> couples directly or indirectly to passive media <b>1712</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">In the variant of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, message handling module <b>2678</b> can likewise perform operation <b>4112</b> (e.g. by sending controls <b>2695</b> and communication modules to cores <b>2691</b>-<b>2693</b> in creating appnet <b>2688</b>). For example, the controls <b>2695</b> can include passwords, selections, security levels, user preferences, path names, switch values, or the like. The communication modules can comprise resources <b>2696</b>, mobile agents, or the like. Each of the cores can also receive other information about application <b>2698</b> when assembling application <b>2698</b>, such as indications of where message handling module <b>2678</b> resides or of which cores comprise appnet <b>2688</b>. Alternatively or additionally, authorized user lists and other sensitive information relating to application <b>2698</b> can generally remain within subsystem <b>2610</b> as a single access control point in domain <b>2601</b> for higher-level commands <b>1409</b> (such as those in row <b>1403</b>, e.g.).</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">Operation <b>4114</b> describes transmitting information about how the first application relates at least to the first core after receiving a handle of the first application (e.g. software agent <b>1589</b> sending topological information about appnet <b>1581</b> specifying one or more core groups <b>1564</b>, after receiving an application handle from directory manager <b>1520</b>). A request for such information can include &#x201c;Enterprise&#x201d; or a pathname as an application handle, for example, or a handle of a resource or other component of the application or appnet, for searching directory <b>1586</b>. This can occur, for example, in embodiments in which domain <b>1585</b> implements domain <b>2601</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, in which software agent <b>1589</b> implements Application Service Router <b>2620</b> for performing operation <b>210</b>, in which appnet depicter <b>2613</b> is configured to perform operation <b>4114</b>, in which directory <b>1586</b> implements object directory <b>2643</b>, in which appnet <b>1581</b> implements cluster <b>2690</b> (including core <b>2691</b>), and in which ASR <b>2650</b> is configured to perform operation <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">In one scenario, app <b>1571</b> provides a handle of part or all of appnet <b>1581</b> (&#x201c;Enterprise,&#x201d; e.g.) in seeking to register with directory manager <b>1520</b>. (This can occur, for example, after app <b>1571</b> attempts to complete a transaction directly with core <b>2691</b> of appnet <b>1581</b> via linkage <b>1523</b> without success.) In some instances &#x201c;Enterprise&#x201d; may not be found locally within directory manager <b>1520</b>, in which case directory manager may broadcast or otherwise send an inquiry about &#x201c;Enterprise&#x201d; across linkage <b>1522</b> and others (not shown), triggering the above-described response.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">In another scenario, directory manager <b>1520</b> comprises an instance of subsystem <b>2610</b> that can mediate between app <b>1571</b> and appnet <b>1581</b> by obtaining a channel to appnet <b>1581</b> via software agent <b>1589</b>. In many cases like these, the existence of several high-level appnet constructs defined within company <b>1580</b> enables software agent <b>1589</b> to be configured centrally to serve as a convenient regional or global network access point for company <b>1580</b>. This provides better visibility of organizational responsibility and usage of various infrastructure and application components within appnets <b>1581</b>-<b>1583</b>. It also enables developers and users to better implement and enforce application- and system-level resource access control. These configurations and scenarios thus illustrate how appnets can be used for increasing divisional or organizational agility, especially when using shared hardware (e.g. cores <b>1565</b>) or common software interfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">Operation <b>4118</b> describes signaling, at least to the first core, the first application relating with the first core and with the second core (e.g. routelet app <b>2668</b> transmitting a digital signal to core <b>2691</b> indicating that an aggregator application is running jointly on at least core <b>2691</b> and core <b>2692</b>). In some variants, the digital signal can include a name of the application, for example, a name of one or more processes <b>2694</b> of the application on the second core or on other cores, a timestamp, a list of cores or core groups (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, e.g.), information about other applications or overlapping appnets, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">Operation <b>4133</b> describes booting at least the second core in response to the data received after signaling the first application relating with the first core and with the second core (e.g. implementer <b>2662</b> rebooting core <b>2691</b> in response to receiving an instruction or timeout signal after appnet depicter <b>2613</b> signals application <b>2698</b> at cores <b>2691</b>-<b>2693</b>). This can occur, for example, in embodiments in which core <b>2691</b> is the second core, in which data manager <b>2644</b> is configured to perform operation <b>220</b>, and in which ASR <b>2650</b> is configured to perform operation <b>4130</b>. In another such scenario, appnet manager <b>2653</b> can begin a sequence for initializing application <b>2698</b> by publishing an intention to boot one or more cores <b>2691</b>-<b>2693</b> of cluster <b>2690</b> in lieu of detecting any countervailing conditions (defined in and monitored by rule handler <b>2679</b>, e.g.) within a period of time. The countervailing conditions may include input from interface <b>2607</b>, activity in application <b>2697</b>, or the like. The data received may include clock transitions or other indications of elapsed time, indications of activity in one or more of the cores <b>2691</b>-<b>2693</b>, an indication of the partial service configuration change relating, a linkage between such a change and application <b>2697</b>, or the like. The booting may include any sequence of hardware transitions or other triggers known by those skilled in the art, and may include implementer <b>2662</b> causing a reboot event as an indirect effect (of power cycling cluster <b>2690</b> or generating a fault condition, for example).</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">Operation <b>4134</b> describes superseding a service configuration at least in the second core in response to the data received after signaling the first application relating with the first core and with the second core (e.g. appnet manager migrating module <b>1033</b> responsive to super-user <b>1406</b> or policy app <b>2669</b> indicating a removal of module <b>1033</b> from appnet <b>1062</b>). This can occur, for example, in embodiments in which module <b>1034</b> is the first core, for example, or otherwise in which module <b>1033</b> is or resides in the second core. In some variants interface <b>2607</b> is configured to interact with super-user <b>1406</b>, with rule handler <b>2679</b> defining which commands <b>1409</b> are available to super-user <b>1406</b> when interacting with appnet <b>1062</b> (e.g. those included in one of columns <b>1461</b>-<b>1465</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">Operation <b>4136</b> describes evaluating the signaled partial service configuration change (e.g. abstracter <b>2615</b> predicting a success rate of 92% in relation to a cache hits performance statistic, for example, or a difference between 92% and a current success rate). This can occur, for example, in embodiments in which abstracter <b>2615</b> receives a user-proposed partial service configuration change and one or more user-designated statistics of interest in operation <b>210</b>. In some embodiments, abstracter <b>2615</b> estimates one or more effects jointly (with input from adapter app <b>2666</b>, servicelet app <b>2667</b>, one or more resources <b>2696</b>, or the like) in performing operation <b>4136</b></p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">Alternatively or additionally, operation <b>4136</b> can yield an evaluation of a past change as &#x201c;harmless&#x201d; or a proposed change as &#x201c;risky,&#x201d; can an efficiency or other performance model relating to past changes, indications of various aspects of the change (relating to an availability of resources <b>2696</b>, e.g.), or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>, there are shown several variants of the flow <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <b>38</b>, <b>39</b>, <b>40</b>, or <b>41</b>. Operation <b>210</b>&#x2014;signaling a first application relating with a first core and with a second core&#x2014;may include one or more of the following operations: <b>4211</b> or <b>4218</b>. Operation <b>220</b>&#x2014;signaling via a third core a partial service configuration change at least in the first core in response to data received after signaling the first application relating with the first core and with the second core&#x2014;may include one or more of the following operations: <b>4222</b>, <b>4224</b>, <b>4227</b>, <b>4228</b>, or <b>4229</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">Operation <b>4211</b> describes depicting an option including at least a representation of the first application relating with the first core and with the second core (e.g. option depicter <b>2617</b> graphically showing appnet <b>150</b> including cores <b>151</b>, <b>152</b>). One or more additional appnets may likewise be depicted, such as in network <b>100</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Alternatively or additionally, one or more of the options or other features may be shown in menu form. Alternatively, an appnet can be depicted without related options per se, such as for context or other merely informational purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">Operation <b>4218</b> describes accessing a record relating the first application to the second core (e.g. DMA <b>1163</b> accessing a current or recent list of processes from memory <b>1166</b>). A process list from the second core can be received within app payload <b>1258</b> of message <b>1210</b>, for example. This can occur periodically or in response to a request, such as can be generated when a user requests a view of an appnet for the application.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">Operation <b>4222</b> describes signaling the partial service configuration change via a channel traversing the third core (e.g. implementer <b>2662</b> using channel <b>1391</b>, traversing database server <b>1342</b>, for signaling an activation of &#x201c;Node1&#x201d; module <b>1351</b> from web server <b>1341</b> at &#x201c;Pricedb&#x201d; module <b>1352</b>). This can occur, for example, in an embodiment in which core <b>2691</b> implements web server <b>1341</b>, in which core <b>2692</b> implements database server <b>1342</b>, in which appnet <b>2687</b> implements trade clearing appnet <b>1321</b>, and in which ASR <b>2650</b> can perform operation <b>220</b>. (The channel may likewise comprise one or more physical signal paths such as linkage <b>2628</b>.) Operation <b>4224</b> describes upgrading a portion of the first application at least at the first core (e.g. servicelet app <b>2667</b> suspending one or more processes <b>2694</b> of application <b>2697</b> at core <b>2691</b> and replacing one or more resources <b>2696</b> of the suspended process such as a subroutine code module of application <b>2697</b>). In such embodiments appnets can be used for facilitating an incremental software upgrade using existing subsystems. Incremental upgrades can be useful, for example, in determining which portion of an upgrade might have introduced malicious agents or other anomalies into a network.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">Operation <b>4227</b> describes indicating a portion of a first core service upgrade at the third core (e.g. query agent <b>2727</b> requesting specific authorizations to upgrade some controls <b>395</b> or resources <b>396</b> of core <b>391</b> via interface <b>325</b>). This can occur, for example, in embodiments in which signaling module <b>321</b> is configured to perform operation <b>210</b>, in which aggregation module <b>322</b> implements aggregation module <b>2702</b> for performing at least operation <b>220</b>, in which interface <b>325</b> can be used for selecting some of controls <b>395</b> or resources <b>396</b>. If receiver <b>2722</b> receives an indication of code module X (not shown) of resources <b>396</b> in core <b>391</b> being selected for upgrade, for example, in some embodiments update circuitry <b>2762</b> can respond by updating only code module X as the partial service configuration change. This illustrates that an appnet can facilitate selective upgrades effectively in some embodiments. This also illustrates how appnets can be used for facilitating the reuse of code modules, for example, during selective additions or replacements of network hardware components.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">Operation <b>4228</b> describes causing the partial service configuration change by an activity at the third core (e.g. transmitter <b>2531</b> sending service identifiers <b>2532</b> or service change specifications <b>2533</b> corresponding with a service level change). This can occur, for example, in embodiments in which the &#x201c;first&#x201d; and &#x201c;second&#x201d; cores are remote (from transmitter <b>2531</b>, e.g.), in which subsystem <b>2802</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> implements a local &#x201c;third&#x201d; core, in which ASR <b>2866</b> is configured to perform operation <b>210</b>, in which signaling circuitry <b>2868</b> is configured to perform operation <b>220</b>, and in which signaling circuitry <b>2868</b> is configured to implement one or more of the listed components of ASR <b>2530</b>, including at least transmitter <b>2531</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">Operation <b>4229</b> describes migrating at least a portion of a resource of the first core (e.g. servicelet app <b>2667</b> causing one or more resources <b>2696</b> to be allocated at core <b>2691</b> in lieu of some or all of like resources at core <b>2692</b>).

<p id="p-0249" num="0248">Operation <b>4382</b> describes displaying one or more identifiers of a physical object type in the portion of the data structure (e.g. view selection logic <b>2363</b> showing one or more alphanumeric values <b>2364</b> such as part numbers identifying components of an article of manufacture in data structure <b>2322</b>). This can occur, for example, in embodiments in which interface module <b>2360</b> is configured to perform operation <b>580</b>, in which decision module <b>2350</b> is configured to perform operation <b>590</b>, and in which view selection logic accesses data structure portions such as DDO's <b>2380</b>, SDO's <b>2385</b>, or labels associated with them.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">Operation <b>4384</b> describes displaying one or more cognitive symbols at least partly based on one or more estimates from the data structure (e.g. data format logic <b>2365</b> showing decimal values or other quantity-indicative symbols responsive to estimates <b>2234</b> arriving as a destination data object <b>2287</b>). The symbols can reflect desired, required, or available product quantity estimates, for example, or a cost or component quantity based upon them, many examples of which are available to those skilled in the art.</p>

The graphic image can be a direct copy from type <b>3</b> SDO <b>2393</b>, for example, or can be processed based on a local (prior) image and editing or other image processing instructions in type <b>2</b> SDO <b>2392</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">Operation <b>4393</b> describes requesting the inter-core linkage incorporating a reference to a network address (e.g. linkage request logic <b>2354</b> asking for an association between destination data objects <b>2380</b> locally and source data objects <b>2390</b> at a remote IP address via physical linkage <b>2311</b>). The recipient of the request may be a local entity (e.g. link management module <b>2240</b>) or a remote entity (e.g. in second network <b>2300</b>). In some embodiments, linkage request logic <b>2354</b> can first request a remotely-managed linkage (by which a remote entity is responsible for updating relationships in either or both directions), and absent a positive response, request a locally-managed linkage (by which a local entity updates the data relationship). Either of these entities can optionally be configured to pull or push data to update or confirm the data object relationship periodically or occasionally, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">Operation <b>4395</b> describes receiving via a network port a message explicitly signaling the inter-core linkage (e.g. message parser <b>2355</b> receiving a web page or e-mail message indicating linkage <b>2311</b>, such as by identifying channel <b>2310</b> or some other route between first network <b>2200</b> and other entities). The explicit signal may comprise identifiers of the linked cores, for example, or a similar transport header or the like.

The various aspects and embodiments disclosed herein are for purposes of illustration and are not intended to be limiting, with the true scope and spirit being indicated by the following claims.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0311">It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as &#x201c;open&#x201d; terms (e.g., the term &#x201c;including&#x201d; should be interpreted as &#x201c;including but not limited to,&#x201d; the term &#x201c;having&#x201d; should be interpreted as &#x201c;having at least,&#x201d; the term &#x201c;includes&#x201d; should be interpreted as &#x201c;includes but is not limited to,&#x201d; etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; and &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to inventions containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; or &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; and indefinite articles such as &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; (e.g., &#x201c;a&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;an&#x201d; should typically be interpreted to mean &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; or &#x201c;one or more&#x201d;); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of &#x201c;two recitations,&#x201d; without other modifiers, typically means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to &#x201c;at least one of A, B, and C, etc.&#x201d; is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., &#x201c;a system having at least one of A, B, and C&#x201d; would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). In those instances where a convention analogous to &#x201c;at least one of A, B, or C, etc.&#x201d; is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., &#x201c;a system having at least one of A, B, or C&#x201d; would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that any disjunctive word and/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase &#x201c;A or B&#x201d; will be understood to include the possibilities of &#x201c;A&#x201d; or &#x201c;B&#x201d; or &#x201c;A and B.&#x201d; Moreover, &#x201c;can&#x201d; and &#x201c;optionally&#x201d; and other permissive terms are used herein for describing optional features of various embodiments.

It is to be understood that such depicted architectures are merely exemplary, and that in fact many other architectures can be implemented which achieve the same functionality. In a conceptual sense, any arrangement of components to achieve the same functionality is effectively &#x201c;associated&#x201d; such that the desired functionality is achieved.
