<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is the U.S. national stage application which claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;371 to International Patent Application No.: PCT/AU2009/001319, filed on Oct. 5, 2009, which claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119, to Australian Patent Application No.: 20089055170, filed Oct. 6, 2008, the disclosure of which are incorporated by reference herein their entireties.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a whiteboard.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Whiteboards are used for presentation of information in many different locations. In some locations, for example corporate board rooms, the permanent mounting of a whiteboard to a wall of the room may detract from the appearance of the room. One possible solution in such circumstances is to use a mobile whiteboard which can be stored when not in use. This however results in the inconvenience of having to move the whiteboard in and out of position and requiring also a suitable space to store the whiteboard when not in use.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates to a whiteboard which attempts to overcome, at least in part, the abovementioned problems.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a whiteboard comprising a transparent panel locatable in front of a surface and a screening means, wherein the screening means comprises a blind windable onto a reel such that in a first state the blind is wound onto the reel and in a second state the blind is extended from the reel to be adjacent the transparent panel.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Preferably the reel is securable adjacent an upper edge of the transparent panel and in the second state the blind is located adjacent to the transparent panel between the transparent panel and the surface on which the transparent panel is mounted. Further, the reel is preferably mounted within a housing secured to the upper edge of the transparent panel.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Preferably a plurality of spacers are provided around edges of the transparent panel such that the transparent panel is held away from and parallel to the surface by the spacers. In one embodiment, the spacers are provided secured to the lower edge of the transparent panel at opposite ends of the lower edge and the housing is secured along the length of the upper edge and is securable to the surface such that the transparent panel is held away from and parallel to the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A front longitudinal edge of the housing may be provided with a recess such that an upper edge of the transparent panel is received into the recess.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, the housing comprises a generally U-shaped elongate member arranged such that an open side thereof is positioned lowermost and a pair of end caps are secured across each longitudinal end of the elongate member. The reel is preferably secured between protrusions provided on inner surfaces of the end caps such that the reel can turn, allowing the blind to be pulled downwardly from the lower open side of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably a mounting rail is provided, the mounting rail comprising an elongate member having an upward facing groove such that a rear longitudinal edge of the housing can be received downwardly in the groove.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A guide member may be provided extending between the end caps below the reel and adjacent the upper edge of the transparent panel, the guide member including an angled wall having an upper edge generally tangential to the reel and a lower edge generally parallel to the transparent panel such that the blind slides over the angled wall when extending to the second state thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment, one or more lights is provided within the housing to backlight the blind or to illuminate the surface behind the transparent panel.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A sensor may be provided to detect the position of the screening means and switch the lights on or off based on the detected position of the screening means.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an alternative embodiment, the transparent panel comprises a panel of smart glass switchable between a clear and an opaque state.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to the Figures there is shown a whiteboard <b>10</b> comprising a transparent panel <b>12</b> and a screening means <b>14</b>. In the embodiment shown, the transparent panel <b>12</b> comprises a glass panel. The transparent panel <b>12</b> may alternatively be constructed of any suitable clear material, such as a transparent plastic.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The transparent panel <b>12</b> is locatable in front of a surface such that the transparent panel <b>12</b> is positioned generally parallel to the surface. In the embodiment shown, the surface comprises a wall <b>18</b> and the transparent panel <b>12</b> is mountable in front of the wall <b>18</b> such that a space is defined between the transparent panel <b>12</b> and the wall <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The screening means is changeable between a first state and a second state. In the first state, the screening means does not obstruct the passage of light from the wall <b>18</b> through the transparent panel <b>12</b>. That is, the wall <b>18</b> behind the transparent panel <b>12</b>, or any item in front of the wall <b>18</b>, can be viewed through the transparent panel <b>12</b>. When the screening means <b>14</b> is in the first state, the whiteboard <b>10</b> is in a non-use state. In the embodiment shown in the Figures, the transparent panel <b>12</b> is positioned on the wall <b>18</b> in front of a picture <b>20</b> mounted on the wall <b>18</b>. In the non-use state, the picture <b>20</b> can therefore be viewed through the transparent panel <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">When in the second state, the screening means <b>14</b> obstructs the passage of light from the wall <b>18</b> through the transparent panel <b>12</b>. That is, the wall cannot be viewed through the transparent panel <b>12</b>. When the screening means <b>14</b> is in the second state, the whiteboard <b>10</b> is in the &#x201c;in use&#x201d; state.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The transparent panel <b>12</b> is provided with a plurality of spacers <b>46</b> around the edge thereof such that the transparent panel <b>12</b> is held away from and parallel to the wall <b>18</b> by the spacers <b>46</b>. In the embodiment shown, spacers <b>46</b> are provided secured to the lower edge of the transparent panel <b>12</b> at opposite ends of the lower edge.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the embodiment shown in the Figures, the screening means comprises a blind <b>22</b> windable onto a reel <b>24</b>. The reel <b>24</b> is mounted within a housing <b>26</b> secured in use adjacent an upper edge of the transparent panel <b>12</b>. The housing <b>26</b> is secured along the length of the upper edge and is securable to the wall <b>18</b> such that the upper edge is held away from the wall <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The blind <b>22</b> is preferably opaque and white in colour. In the first state (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>), the blind <b>22</b> is wound onto the reel <b>24</b> so that the blind is entirely contained within the housing <b>26</b>. In the second state (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</figref>), the blind <b>22</b> is extended downwardly such that the blind <b>22</b> is adjacent to and behind the transparent panel <b>12</b>. The blind <b>22</b> extends through an opening in a lower side of the housing <b>26</b>. When in the second state, the transparent panel <b>12</b> therefore appears white and can be used as a whiteboard.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> show the components of the housing <b>26</b> of the whiteboard <b>10</b>. The housing <b>26</b> comprises a hollow elongate member having the opening in the lower side thereof. In the embodiment shown, the hollow elongate member is formed from a generally U-shaped extrusion <b>28</b> arranged such that the open side is positioned lowermost and a pair of end caps <b>30</b> are secured across each longitudinal end of the extrusion <b>28</b>. The reel <b>24</b> is secured between protrusions <b>32</b> provided on inner surfaces of the end caps <b>30</b> such that the reel <b>24</b> can turn, allowing the blind <b>22</b> to be pulled downwardly from the lower open side of the housing <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Also provided is a mounting rail <b>33</b>. The mounting rail <b>33</b> comprises an elongate plate generally J-shaped in cross section (as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) such that an upward facing groove <b>34</b> is defined. The mounting rail <b>33</b> is secured to the wall <b>18</b> and a rear longitudinal edge <b>36</b> of the housing <b>26</b> can be received downwardly in the groove <b>34</b> such that the housing <b>26</b> hangs from the mounting rail <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The housing <b>26</b> is also provided with a guide member <b>37</b>. The guide member <b>37</b> comprises an extrusion extending between the end caps <b>30</b> below the reel <b>24</b> and adjacent the upper edge of the transparent panel <b>12</b>. The guide member <b>37</b> includes a horizontal section <b>38</b> and an angled wall <b>40</b>. The angled wall <b>40</b> extends from an edge of the horizontal section <b>38</b> and is curved such that an upper edge is generally tangential to the reel <b>24</b> and a lower edge is generally parallel to the transparent panel <b>12</b>. The blind <b>22</b> slides over a surface of the angled wall <b>40</b> as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The front longitudinal edge <b>42</b> of the housing <b>26</b> is provided with a recess <b>44</b> such that an upper edge of the transparent panel <b>12</b> is secured into the recess <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A lower edge of the blind <b>22</b> is provided with a support rod <b>48</b>. Ends of the support rod <b>48</b> are slidably connected to vertical edges of the transparent panel <b>12</b>. Each end of the support rod <b>48</b> is provided with a roller member <b>50</b>. The roller members <b>50</b> each include a pair of rollers <b>52</b> positioned such that the rollers <b>52</b> engage with the vertical edge of the transparent panel <b>12</b>. By gripping one or both of the roller members <b>50</b> and sliding the roller members <b>50</b> downwardly, the support rod <b>48</b> and hence the lower edge of the blind <b>22</b> can be moved down into the second state thereof. The reel <b>24</b> is preferably of a known spring loaded type which can retract the blind <b>22</b>. To move the blind <b>22</b> back to the first state thereof, the roller members <b>50</b> are pulled briefly downwardly and released to allow the spring mechanism to retract the blind <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The transparent panel <b>12</b> may also be provided with a shelf <b>54</b>. The shelf <b>54</b> is connected to the lower edge of the transparent panel <b>12</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> and can be used to store whiteboard implements such as markers and erasers. The shelf <b>54</b> may be pivotally connected to the lower edge of the transparent panel <b>12</b> such that it can be pivoted between a horizontal position and a vertical position. In the vertical position the shelf <b>54</b> is located adjacent and parallel to the transparent panel. A lower surface of the shelf <b>54</b> may be provided with a label holder (not shown) such that the label holder can be used to display information about the picture located behind the transparent panel <b>12</b> when the whiteboard <b>10</b> is in the non-use state.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Further, one or more lights may be incorporated in the whiteboard <b>10</b>. The lights may be provided to backlight the blind <b>22</b> to provide better illumination for use as a whiteboard. In this case, the blind <b>22</b> may be constructed of a material such that it is not completely opaque in order for some light to pass through the blind <b>22</b>, thereby backlighting the whiteboard <b>10</b> in the second state.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The lights may also be provided to light the picture <b>20</b> behind the transparent panel <b>12</b> when not in use as a whiteboard <b>10</b>. The lights may be contained in a strip of lights <b>56</b> secured to the underside of the horizontal section <b>38</b> of the guide member <b>37</b>. A sensor may also be provided to detect the position of the screening means and switch on or off the lights automatically based on the detected position of the screening means <b>14</b>. The sensor may be used to turn on the light when the blind is in the second state thereof for backlighting the whiteboard in the in-use state, or may turn on the light when the blind <b>22</b> is in the non-use state in order to light the picture behind the transparent panel <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In use, the whiteboard can be positioned in a location such as over a picture frame <b>20</b> as shown in the Figures. The arrangement of the transparent panel <b>12</b> supported from the wall <b>18</b> in front of the picture frame <b>20</b> by the spacers <b>46</b> gives the appearance of the transparent panel <b>12</b> being used as a protective cover for the picture frame <b>20</b>. The whiteboard <b>10</b> when not in use therefore does not obviously appear as a whiteboard and does not detract from the appearance of the area in which it is mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a further embodiment of the invention, a motor may be provided to drive the reel <b>24</b> such that the blind <b>22</b> can be moved between the first and second positions thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It will be appreciated that the whiteboard <b>10</b> may be positioned in another suitable position such that when in the non-use state, the view through the whiteboard <b>10</b> is unobstructed. The whiteboard <b>10</b> can then be used when desired by moving the screening means <b>14</b> to the in use state. The whiteboard <b>10</b> may, for example, be positioned in front of a window, rather than in front of a picture <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In an alternative embodiment, the transparent panel <b>12</b> which forms part of the whiteboard <b>10</b> may also be used as part of a picture frame. That is, the transparent panel <b>12</b> may include means to hold a picture such that the blind <b>22</b> can be pulled down between the picture and the transparent panel <b>12</b>. Also, in another embodiment, the transparent panel <b>12</b> may itself form part of a window structure. For example, the transparent panel <b>12</b> may comprise the inner pane of a double glazed window, with the blind <b>22</b> slidable down between the two panes of glass.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In a further embodiment, the screening means <b>14</b> may comprise a mechanism other than a blind slidable downwardly to obstruct the view through the transparent panel <b>12</b>. For example, the transparent panel <b>12</b> may be constructed of &#x2018;Smartglass&#x2019; such that applying or removing a current switches the transparent panel <b>12</b> between the first state in which the glass is clear and the second state in which the view through the panel is obstructed.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">It will be appreciated that the whiteboard of the present invention may also be used for other purposes in which an opaque screen is required, such as a projector screen.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It will be readily apparent to persons skilled in the relevant arts that various modifications and improvements may be made to the foregoing embodiments, in addition to those already described, without departing from the basic inventive concepts of the present invention.</p>
