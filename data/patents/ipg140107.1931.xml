<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates generally to hydrometallurgical processing of precious metal-containing materials and particularly to hydrometallurgical processing of refractory gold ores, concentrates, tailings, and other materials.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Many of the world's remaining gold deposits are considered to be refractory or double refractory in nature. Refractory ores are those in which the recoveries of gold by conventional cyanidation are typically noneconomic. Low gold recoveries can be caused by naturally occurring preg-robbing carbonaceous materials, which can pre-empt the absorption of gold by activated carbon in gold recovery processes. In addition, many gold ores are also sulfide refractory. The gold in sulfide refractory ores is inaccessible to gold lixiviants because the gold occurs as; particles finely disseminated within sulfide mineral crystals or as a solid solution in the sulphide matrix. The cost of size reduction associated with liberating this gold is often prohibitive, and, in the case of gold occurring as a solid solution, the size reduction is also generally ineffective. This problem has been overcome by oxidizing the sulfides contained in the ore, thereby liberating the gold from the sulfide matrix and rendering it amenable to leaching by cyanide or other lixiviants. Methods of oxidation employ bio-oxidation, roasting, atmospheric leaching and pressure oxidation. Pressure oxidation can be performed under alkaline conditions, as in the process disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 4,552,589, or acid conditions, as disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 5,071,477.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In alkaline pressure oxidation, the sulfuric acid produced during the oxidation step reacts with the carbonate or other acid consumers contained in the autoclave feed according to the following reactions (based on pyrite oxidation):</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">1 Oxidation: 4FeS<sub>2</sub>+15O<sub>2</sub>+2H<sub>2</sub>O&#x2192;2Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>+8H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub></p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2 Neutralization: CaCO<sub>3</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>&#x2192;CaSO<sub>4</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O+CO<sub>2</sub>&#x2191;</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The amount of carbonate, or other acid consumers, is in stoichiometric excess to the amount of acid that is generated by oxidation, and therefore the pH of the autoclave discharge is near neutral to alkaline depending upon the amount and type of acid consumers. When a portion of the gold occurs within the unreacted carbonates in the oxidized ore, the gold can remain inaccessible to lixiviants in subsequent gold leaching operations and thereby be unrecovered.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In acid pressure oxidation, the following reactions can occur:</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">3 Oxidation: 4FeS<sub>2</sub>+15O<sub>2</sub>+2H<sub>2</sub>O&#x2192;2Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>+8H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub></p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">4 Oxidation: 4FeS<sub>2</sub>+6O<sub>2</sub>+2H<sub>2</sub>O&#x2192;2Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>+6S<sup>o</sup>+2H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub></p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The prevalence of one reaction over the other depends on a number of factors including operating temperature, pressure, molecular oxygen overpressure, and residence time. No matter which of the oxidation reactions prevails, a substantial, amount of sulfuric acid is produced and must be neutralized. Acid neutralization costs can significantly increase plant operating costs.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">These and other needs are addressed by the various embodiments and configurations of the present invention. The present invention is directed generally to the parallel use of acid and alkaline pressure oxidation to treat refractory and double refractory sulfidic ores, concentrates, tailings, and other valuable metal-containing materials and the combination of the autoclave discharges produced therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention can potentially address the shortcomings of acid and alkaline autoclave discharges. By combining the alkaline autoclave discharges with the acid pressure oxidation discharge a portion or all of the residual acid from the acid pressure oxidation is neutralized resulting in a substantial reduction of lime consumption. At the same time a portion or all of the unreacted carbonates in the alkaline discharge reacts with the acid, with the potential of liberating additional gold.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, an acid generating precious metal-containing autoclave feed material has more acid generators than consumers, and an alkaline or acid consuming precious metal-containing feed material has more acid consumers than generators. The acid generating feed material is subjected to pressure oxidation which produces an acidic discharge slurry while the alkaline autoclave feed material is subjected to alkaline pressure oxidation which produces an alkaline discharge slurry. The acidic and alkaline discharge slurries are combined to provide a combined discharge slurry having a pH higher than that of the acidic discharge slurry. The combination of the slurries can reduce lime or other alkali consumption thereby significantly reducing neutralization costs.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another embodiment, an aqueous leach barren solution comprising a leaching agent is passed through a membrane filter to form an aqueous retentate (including most of the leaching agent) and an aqueous permeate (including some of the leaching agent). The aqueous retentate is recycled to a leaching step. Most of the leaching agent in the aqueous permeate is destroyed to form an aqueous recycle stream substantially free of leaching agent. The aqueous recycle stream is recycled to a unit operation upstream of the leaching step. The process can inhibit the recycle of lixiviant or leaching agent, in the recycle water, to other unit operations, which can cause precious metal leaching and consequent losses. This enables water recycling from the precious metal leach to upstream unit operations, thereby reducing water consumption, and permitting leaching agent recycle to leaching, thereby reducing reagent costs. Membrane filtration beneficially reduces the volume of leaching solution recycled to precious metal leaching and the concentration of leaching agent needing to be destroyed (thereby reducing reagent costs).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The embodiments of the present invention can provide a number of other advantages depending on the particular configuration. The process can combine the advantages of alkaline and acid pressure oxidation while offsetting their respective disadvantages. While alkaline pressure oxidation effectively treats highly carbonate materials, it cannot economically or effectively treat highly sulfidic materials. In contrast, acid pressure oxidation effectively treats highly sulfidic materials but not highly carbonate materials. The selective use of acid pressure oxidation to treat sulfidic materials having relatively low carbonate levels and alkaline pressure oxidation to treat carbonate materials having relatively low sulfide sulfur levels is more effective than blending the materials and treating them in the autoclave together. The generation of carbon dioxide within the autoclave from the reaction of generated sulfuric acid with carbonates is to be minimized whenever possible, as the generation of CO<sub>2 </sub>within the autoclave will cause increased venting of the autoclave, which in turn causes the loss of O<sub>2 </sub>and increased O<sub>2 </sub>consumption and heating costs. For this reason, pre-acidification is commonly employed for low carbonate sulfidic ores. Pre acidification is generally not cost effective on high carbonate sulfide ores.</p>

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The acid generating precious metal- and sulfide-containing material <b>100</b> typically contains from about 1 weight percent to about 35, even more typically from about 2 to about 15, weight percent sulfide sulfur The material, as it enters the autoclave <b>120</b>, contains an equivalent carbonate level, in the material, of preferably between about 0.1 and 1% by weight In some applications, the material <b>100</b>, may be pre-acidulated to achieve the desired carbonate level. For ores such as those of sulfide-containing material <b>104</b>, pre-acidulation to this extent of carbonate content is not economical.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The acid consuming or alkaline precious metal and sulfide containing material <b>104</b>, on the other hand, typically contains, or is adjusted to contain, an equivalent carbonate level, in the material, of greater than about 0.7% by weight as the material enters the autoclave <b>136</b>. Commonly, the material <b>104</b> contains from about 1 to about 45 percent by weight total inorganic carbon compounds (based on CO<sub>3</sub>). Most, and typically at least about 90%, of the inorganic carbon present in the ores and concentrates is in the form of inorganic metal carbonates, such as limestone, dolomite, calcite, and magnesite. Carbonate ores and concentrates can contain sulfide sulfur primarily in the form of sulfides of iron, arsenic, and other metals. Commonly, carbonate ores and concentrates contain up to about 15 weight percent total sulfide sulfur and typically from about 0.1 to about 7 weight percent total sulfide sulfur.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The precious metal- and sulfide-containing materials <b>100</b> and <b>104</b> can be obtained in many ways. In one application, the materials <b>100</b> and <b>104</b> are excavated from different parts or zones of a stratified deposit. In other applications, the materials <b>100</b> and <b>104</b> are produced by floating a common feed material. The low carbonate sulfide-containing material <b>100</b>, for example, can be a concentrate or tailings fraction. In another application, the materials <b>100</b> and <b>104</b> are excavated from different deposits.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In steps <b>200</b> and <b>204</b>, respectively, the sulfide-containing low carbonate and high carbonate-containing materials <b>100</b> and <b>104</b>, respectively, are comminuted and slurried by the corresponding acid and alkaline comminution circuits <b>108</b> and <b>112</b> to produce slurried comminuted precious metal- and sulfide-containing and carbonate-containing materials <b>208</b> and <b>212</b>, respectively. The acid and alkaline comminution circuits <b>108</b> and <b>112</b> can be any open or closed crushing and/or grinding circuits and thickeners known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Typical comminution devices include autogeneous, semi-autogeneous, or non-autogeneous crushers, ball mills, rod mills, and the like. Thickening of the slurried comminuted materials is typically performed using polymeric flocculants. Although the size fraction depends on the mineralogies of the materials <b>100</b> and <b>104</b> and the liberation of the precious metal, the comminuted materials <b>208</b> and <b>212</b> preferably have a P<sub>80 </sub>size of about 20 microns or higher, even more preferably of about 35 microns or higher, and even more preferably ranging from about 40 to about 150 microns. The slurried materials <b>100</b> and <b>104</b> typically have a pulp density of from about 10 to about 60, even more typically of from about 30 to about 55, and even more typically from about 50 to about 55 wt. % solids.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Acid Pressure Oxidation</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Before pressure oxidation, the optionally pre-acidulated material <b>220</b> may be preheated, particularly when processing low sulfur feeds. Steam from the acid autoclave <b>120</b> and/or from the flash cooler <b>128</b> is contacted with the acidulated material, such as by splash condensers, to heat the material to a preferred temperature ranging from about 30 to about 115&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In step <b>224</b>, the acidulated material <b>220</b> is subjected to pressure oxidation to oxidize preferably most, even more preferably about 75% or more, and even more preferably about 90% or more of the sulfide sulfur and form an acid autoclave discharge slurry <b>228</b>. The oxidation product depends on the temperature regime. When the pressure oxidation temperature is in the range of from about 100 to about 170&#xb0; C., a significant portion of the sulfide sulfur is converted into elemental sulfur. When the pressure oxidation temperature is above about 170 to about 240&#xb0; C., sulfide sulfur is irreversibly oxidized to sulfate sulfur. In either case sulfuric acid is produced.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Most of the acid consumers in the (optionally preacidulated) material <b>220</b> will react with the generated sulfuric acid to yield a preferred pH of less than pH 7 and even more preferably ranging from about pH 0 to about pH 6.5. For example, carbonates present in the (optionally preacidulated) material <b>220</b> will react with the generated sulfuric acid, producing gypsum, water and carbon dioxide. To minimize the effect of carbon dioxide production, it is common practice to bleed off a portion of the gas in the vapor space to prevent carbon dioxide build-up and to recycle the large tail gas stream from pressure oxidation through an acid gas scrubber for particulate and sulfur dioxide removal.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The preferred reactor vessel for pressure oxidation is a sealed, multiple-compartment autoclave. The autoclave typically has at least six compartments to minimize short circuiting of the autoclave feed material <b>216</b> to the acid autoclave discharge slurry <b>228</b> as can occur in autoclaves with fewer compartments.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">During pressure oxidation, sufficient molecular oxygen is introduced into the acid autoclave <b>120</b> to preferably maintain a molecular oxygen partial pressure ranging from about 20 to about 300 psig. The total pressure in the acid autoclave is preferably in the range of from about 250 to about 750 psig.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The duration of pressure oxidation depends upon a number of factors, including the mineral characteristics of the autoclave material <b>220</b> and the pressure oxidation temperature and pressure, particle size, and free acid levels. Preferably, the duration of pressure oxidation ranges from about 0.5 to about 3 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The acid autoclave discharge slurry <b>228</b> contains a liquid phase including a variety of species, including dissolved (iron) sulfate sulfur and commonly from about 2 to about 150 g/L, more commonly less than about 25 g/L, even more commonly less than about 10 g/L, and even more commonly between about 5 and 25 g/L free sulfuric acid and a solid phase, including preferably most, more preferably about 95% or higher, and even more preferably about 99% or higher of the precious metal.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The acid autoclave discharge slurry <b>228</b>, in step <b>232</b>, is flashed in an open vessel or flashed cooler <b>124</b> to release pressure and evaporatively cool the slurry <b>228</b> through release of steam to form a flashed slurry. The flashed slurry typically has a pulp density of 30% by weight or higher.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In optional hot cure step <b>236</b>, the acid autoclave discharge slurry <b>228</b> slurry is maintained, in one or more hot cure vessel(s) <b>128</b>, at a preferred temperature of about 60&#xb0; C. or higher, for a time sufficient for most of the solid-phase basic ferric sulfate to react with free sulfuric acid in the liquid phase to form dissolved ferric sulfate. The details of the hot cure step are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 11/761,103, filed Jun. 11, 2007, and 11/249,120, filed Oct. 11, 2005, (now U.S. Pat. No. 7,604,703), each of which is incorporated herein by this reference. The hot cure step <b>236</b> can reduce, significantly, lime consumption in later neutralization.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Alkaline Pressure Oxidation</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The comminuted precious metal- and carbonate-containing material <b>212</b>, in parallel, is conditioned in step <b>240</b>, in one or more conditioning vessels <b>132</b>, to form a conditioned material having a desired slurry pulp density (which is in the range set forth above) and containing an conditioning agent to inhibit, during pressure oxidation, the coating of the material <b>212</b> with insoluble metal compounds. While any suitable conditioning agent may be employed, preferred conditioning agents include trona (Na<sub>3</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)(HCO<sub>3</sub>)&#xb7;2(H<sub>2</sub>O)), NaCO<sub>3</sub>, NaOH, and mixtures thereof. For example, trona, when added in sufficient quantities, can substantially inhibit the formation of gypsum. Preferably, the amount of conditioning agent added ranges from about 5 to about 40 lb/ston and even more preferably from about 10 to about 30 lb/short ton (ston.)</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The conditioned material <b>244</b> is subjected to alkaline pressure oxidation, in an alkaline autoclave <b>136</b> and in step <b>248</b> to form an alkaline autoclave discharge slurry <b>252</b>. Alkaline pressure oxidation oxidizes sulfide sulfur to form sulfuric acid, which is neutralized by the acid consumers, such as inorganic metal carbonates (including the trona), in the conditioned material <b>244</b>. Alkaline pressure oxidation (though operated under neutral or slightly alkaline pH), uses similar conditions of temperature (in the above-quoted temperature range), total pressure (in the above-quoted pressure range), molecular oxygen partial pressure (in the above-quoted molecular oxygen partial pressure range), autoclave residence time (in the above-quoted residence time range), as acid pressure oxidation. A primary difference is that typically most, and even more typically about 75% or more, and even more typically about 95% or more of the sulfuric acid generated by sulfide oxidation in the conditioned material <b>244</b>, is rapidly neutralized by acid consumers in the material <b>244</b>. In addition, unlike acid pressure oxidation, the degree of gold recovery is not as closely tied to the degree of sulfide oxidation, for or this reason the economic limit of percent sulfide oxidation of the alkaline material can be as low as 50%. The pH of the alkaline autoclave discharge slurry <b>252</b> is preferably about pH 6 or higher, even more preferably ranges from about pH 7 to about pH 9, and even more preferably ranges from about pH 7 to about pH 8. The pH of the discharge from the alkaline autoclave may be below 7, however if the acid base reaction is permitted to reach steady state, the pH will be between about pH 6 to about pH 8.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The alkaline autoclave discharge slurry <b>228</b> contains a liquid phase commonly having no more than about 1 g/L free sulfuric acid and acid equivalents. and a solid phase, preferably including preferably most, more preferably about 95% or higher, and even more preferably about 99% or higher of the precious metal.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The alkaline autoclave discharge slurry <b>252</b>, output by the alkaline autoclave <b>136</b>, is introduced into a flash cooler <b>140</b> and subjected to flash cooling in step <b>256</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Combination of Acid and Alkaline Autoclave Discharge Slurries</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The acid and alkaline autoclave discharge slurries <b>228</b> and <b>252</b>, after flash cooling <b>232</b> and <b>256</b> and optionally hot curing step <b>236</b>, is preferably further cooled in indirect heat exchanges ahead of neutralization and precious metal recovery. Depending on the temperature after flash cooling, the acid autoclave discharge slurry may be subjected to indirect heat exchange cooling before the hot curing step <b>236</b>. Although intermediate washing and/or liquid-solid separation may be employed, direct neutralization after cooling is preferred. The temperature of the hot acid autoclave discharge slurry is preferably reduced to between about 90&#xb0; F. and about 140&#xb0; F., more preferably between about 110&#xb0; F. and about 130&#xb0; F., and even more preferably below about 120&#xb0; F.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In step <b>260</b>, the partially cooled acid and alkaline autoclave discharge slurries <b>228</b> and <b>252</b> are combined, in one or more combination vessels <b>144</b> to form a combined discharge slurry <b>264</b>, in which acid contained in the acid discharge <b>228</b> reacts with the carbonates and other acid consumers in the alkaline discharge. It is not necessary that the acid and alkaline discharge slurries be of equivalent volume. The pH of the combined slurry will be greater than that of the acid discharge, and lower than that of the alkaline discharge. As will be appreciated, the final pH of the combined discharge slurry <b>264</b> can be acidic or alkaline and varies depending on the relative volumes and acid consumer on the one hand and free acid and acid equivalent on the other hand contents of the acid and alkaline autoclave discharge slurries <b>228</b> and <b>252</b>. In one application, the combined discharge slurry has less free sulfuric acid and/or acid equivalents than the acid discharge slurry <b>228</b> and/or more free sulfuric acid and/or acid equivalents than the alkaline discharge slurry <b>252</b>. In one application, the combined discharge slurry has more acid consumers than the acid discharge slurry <b>228</b> and/or less acid consumers than the alkaline discharge slurry <b>252</b>. The slurries are contained in a stirred neutralization vessel for 30 to 120 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Once the reaction between the acid and alkaline discharge is complete, the pH of the combined slurry is adjusted, if required, in step <b>270</b> and in one or more neutralization vessels <b>170</b> to a level suitable for the lixiviant employed, which is typically a pH of about pH 8 or higher.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The neutralization vessel(s) <b>170</b> can be in a single stirred stage or in multiple stirred stages, with two to six stages being common. Under the agitated conditions, decomposition occurs more rapidly because the residue is dispersed and suspended for more efficient contact with the acid consumer. The acid consumer is added while agitating the removed solid phase. The amount of lime required will depend upon the terminal pH of the combined slurry, and the target pH for gold recovery.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In step <b>276</b> and precious metal recovery circuit <b>178</b>, the precious metals are dissolved by leaching the solid phase of the neutralized discharge slurry <b>272</b>. Leaching is typically performed without additional liquid/solid separation or pulp density adjustment operations being performed on the neutralized discharge slurry <b>272</b>. The leaching agent or lixiviant is typically cyanide, ammonium, sodium or calcium thiosulfate and less typically halides (iodide, bromide, chloride), and thiourea. In one configuration, the leaching step <b>276</b> is performed at atmospheric pressure and under alkaline conditions (at or above a pH of about pH 7) to produce a pregnant leach solution containing (at least) most of the precious metal content of the slurry <b>272</b>. The precious metal leaching step <b>276</b> may be performed by any suitable technique including using cyanide leaching and Carbon-in-Pulp or CIP techniques, Carbon-In-Leach or CIL techniques, cementation techniques, Resin-in-Pulp or RIP techniques, Resin-In-Leach or RIL techniques, or by circulating a pregnant leach solution and/or slurry through one or more precious metal sorbent columns. In the CIL, CIP, RIP, RIL, and other sorbent-based techniques, a sorbent, such as activated carbon or an ion exchange resin, sorbs the precious metal dissolved in the lixiviant. The sorbed precious metal is stripped from the sorbent by an suitable eluant to form a barren sorbent for recycle to the leaching step <b>276</b> with and/or without regeneration, and a pregnant eluate containing most of the precious metal sorbed on the sorbent.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the precious metal recovery step <b>280</b>, the precious metal is recovered from the pregnant leach solution (or pregnant eluate) by suitable techniques, such as electrowinning or cementation followed by smelting, to form the precious metal product <b>284</b>. When required, the barren solid residue or tailings <b>288</b> from the leaching step <b>276</b> is subjected to leaching agent detoxification or destruction and discarded at tailings disposal or impoundment area <b>182</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">An embodiment of the precious metal recovery circuit <b>178</b> and process <b>280</b> will be discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In the depicted process, a barren leach solution, containing the lixiviant, is subjected to membrane filtration to recycle a retentate to the lixiviant to a precious metal-containing residue leaching step and a permeate to a lixiviant destruction step, with the lixiviant destroyed recycle water being used in other upstream process steps, such as comminution.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the precious metal-containing residue <b>300</b> is subjected to precious metal-containing residue leaching in step <b>304</b> (as discussed above) to dissolve most of the precious metals from the residue and form a pregnant leach solution <b>308</b>. In step <b>312</b>, most of the precious metal is recovered, by any of the techniques noted above, from the pregnant leach solution <b>308</b> to form the precious metal product <b>284</b> and the barren leach solution <b>316</b> substantially free of dissolved precious metals. The barren leach solution <b>316</b> can be isolated from the residue by known liquid/solid separation techniques, such as thickening.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The barren leach solution <b>316</b>, after optional gypsum removal step <b>370</b>, is directed to membrane filtration step <b>320</b> to form a retentate <b>324</b> containing most of the lixiviant, or leaching agent, in the barren leach solution <b>316</b>, and a permeate <b>328</b> containing some leaching agent and most of the water in the barren leach solution <b>316</b>. Gypsum removal step <b>370</b> is performed when the dissolved gypsum exceeds the gypsum solubility limit that can be handled by the anti-scalant. Anti-sealant reagent costs can be decreased by decreased gypsum load following step <b>370</b>. As will be appreciated, the anti-sealant is added following optional step <b>370</b> and before the membrane filtration step <b>320</b>. The retentate is commonly less than 50% of the volume of the barren leach solution <b>316</b> while the permeate is commonly more than 50% of the barren leach solution volume. Preferably, only a single membrane filtration stage is employed to enable reduced osmotic pressure and avoid gypsum scaling from highly concentrated salts in subsequent filtration stages. The barren leach solution <b>316</b> may be softened with a water softener, such as soda ash, prior to filtration. The membrane filter may be any filter able to remove most of the lixiviant in the retentate. Preferably, from about 75 to about 95 and even more preferably from about 80 to about 92.5% of the leaching agent is separated into the retentate, leaving from about 5 to about 25% of the leaching agent in the permeate. Exemplary membrane filters include leaky reverse osmosis filters, nanofilters, ultrafilters, and microfilters.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The retentate <b>324</b> is recycled to the precious metal-containing leaching step <b>304</b>. Prior to recycling, sodium carbonate is added to the retentate <b>324</b> stream, and precipitated gypsum is removed by clarification in the gypsum removal step <b>350</b>, thus lowering the sulfate level circulating back to the leaching step <b>304</b> Gypsum precipitation is believed to result from decomposition of the anti-scalant added upstream of the membrane filtration step <b>320</b>. Precipitated gypsum is recycled to step <b>350</b> to promote calcium removal. The recycled gypsum acts as a &#x201c;seed&#x201d; or nucleation site for further gypsum precipitation. When the lixiviant oxidatively decomposes, such as thiosulfate oxidatively decomposes to form polythionates, the retentate <b>324</b> may be regenerated in lixiviant regeneration step <b>360</b> before reuse in the leaching step <b>304</b>. As will be appreciated, thiosulfate can be regenerated from polythionates by sulfite, sulfide, or polysulfide addition, and by thermal techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The permeate <b>328</b> is oxidized in lixiviant destruction step <b>332</b> to destroy most, and even more commonly 95% or more of the residual leaching agent and form recycle water <b>336</b>. The destruction products are substantially unable to leach precious metal(s). The particular process used to effect destruction depends on the leaching agent. Exemplary processes include volatilization (e.g., by pH or temperature changes, solution aeration or agitation, and combinations thereof), chemical or biological oxidation, adsorption, iron complexation, and precipitation.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In one application, an oxidation process is used in step <b>332</b> to destroy the lixiviant. The particular oxidation process depends on the particular leaching agent employed. Known chemical oxidants include hydrogen peroxide, sulfur dioxide/air, alkaline chlorine-hypochlorite, Caros acid, and ozone. By way of example, thiosulfate destruction can be done by reagents, such as hydrogen peroxide, and the SO<sub>2</sub>/air. Thiosulfate, Caros acid, and residual sulfur species are oxidized to sulfates. As will be appreciated, excess oxidants can degrade the leaching agent in precious metal leaching. Accordingly, most of the residual oxidants are preferably consumed by super-stoichiometric addition of reductants. In one configuration, excess hydrogen peroxide is reacted with Caro's acid to form sulfates.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The recycle water <b>336</b>, which is substantially free of the leaching agent and residual oxidants, is recycled to other unit operations.</p>

Because of the high carbonate level in the combined feed alkaline pressure oxidation was performed. Batch pressure oxidation was completed on 625 grams of sample at a feed pulp density of 40% for a period of one hour at 225&#xb0; C., with oxygen over pressure of 80 psi. 20 lb/ton of trona was added to the feed material prior to pressure oxidation. The pH of the autoclave discharge was 7.6. The sulfide content of the discharge was 0.48%, and therefore the percent sulfide oxidation was 58.6&#x2014;lower than the sulfide oxidation observed in examples 1 (92.7%) and 2 (60.5%). The pH of the discharge was adjusted to 8 using 1.5 kg Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>/tonne of ore. This is slightly lower than the lime consumption in example 3. The gold was then recovered using resin in leach, and the percent gold recovered was 74.5%. This is the same as the gold recovery in example 3.
