<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THIS INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Molecular sieve materials, both natural and synthetic, have catalytic properties for various types of hydrocarbon conversion. Certain molecular sieves (e.g., zeolites, AlPOs, and/or mesoporous materials) are ordered, porous crystalline materials having a definite crystalline structure. Within the crystalline molecular sieve material there are a large number of cavities which may be interconnected by a number of channels or pores. These cavities and pores are uniform in size within a specific molecular sieve material. Since the dimensions of these pores are such as to accept for adsorption molecules of certain dimensions while rejecting those of larger dimensions, these materials have come to be known as &#x201c;molecular sieves&#x201d; and are utilized in a variety of industrial processes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such molecular sieves, both natural and synthetic, include a wide variety of positive ion-containing crystalline oxides of tetravalent element. These oxides of tetravalent element can be described as a rigid three-dimensional framework of YO<sub>4 </sub>and a trivalent element oxide, such as a Group 13 element oxide (e.g., AlO<sub>4</sub>) (as defined in the Periodic Table, Chemical and Engineering News, 63(5), 27 (1985)). The tetrahedra are cross-linked by the sharing of oxygen atoms whereby the ratio of the total trivalent element (e.g., aluminum) and tetravalent atoms to oxygen atoms is 1:2. The electrovalence of the tetrahedra containing the trivalent element (e.g., aluminum) is balanced by the inclusion in the crystal of a cation, for example a proton, an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal cation. This can be expressed as the ratio of the trivalent element (e.g., aluminum) to the number of various cations, such as H<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/2, Sr<sup>2+</sup>/2, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, or Li<sup>+</sup>, being equal to unity.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Molecular sieves that find application in catalysis include any of the naturally occurring or synthetic crystalline molecular sieves. Examples of these sieves include large pore zeolites, intermediate pore size zeolites, and small pore zeolites. These zeolites and their isotypes are described in &#x201c;Atlas of Zeolite Framework Types&#x201d;, eds. W. H. Meier, D. H. Olson and Ch. Baerlocher, Elsevier, Fifth Edition, 2001, which is herein incorporated by reference. A large pore zeolite generally has a pore size of at least about 7 &#x212b; and includes LTL, VFI, MAZ, FAU, OFF, *BEA, and MOR framework type zeolites (IUPAC Commission of Zeolite Nomenclature). Examples of large pore zeolites include mazzite, offretite, zeolite L, VPI-5, zeolite Y, zeolite X, omega, and Beta. An intermediate pore size zeolite generally has a pore size from about 5 &#x212b; to less than about 7 &#x212b; and includes, for example, MFI, MEL, EUO, MTT, MFS, AEL, AFO, HEU, FER, MWW, and TON framework type zeolites (IUPAC Commission of Zeolite Nomenclature). Examples of intermediate pore size zeolites include ZSM-5, ZSM-11, ZSM-22, &#x201c;MCM-22 family material&#x201d;, silicalite 1, and silicalite 2. A small pore size zeolite has a pore size from about 3 &#x212b; to less than about 5.0 &#x212b; and includes, for example, CHA, ERI, KFI, LEV, SOD, and LTA framework type zeolites (IUPAC Commission of Zeolite Nomenclature). Examples of small pore zeolites include ZK-4, ZSM-2, SAPO-34, SAPO-35, ZK-14, SAPO-42, ZK-21, ZK-22, ZK-5, ZK-20, zeolite A, chabazite, zeolite T, gmelinite, ALPO-17, and clinoptilolite.</p>

The entire contents of the patents are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0012">It is to be appreciated the MCM-22 family molecular sieves described above are distinguished from conventional large pore zeolite alkylation catalysts, such as mordenite, in that the MCM-22 materials have 12-ring surface pockets which do not communicate with the 10-ring internal pore system of the molecular sieve.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0013">The zeolitic materials designated by the IZA-SC as being of the MWW topology are multi-layered materials which have two pore systems arising from the presence of both 10 and 12 membered rings. The Atlas of Zeolite Framework Types classes five differently named materials as having this same topology: MCM-22, ERB-1, ITQ-1, PSH-3, and SSZ-25.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0014">The MCM-22 family molecular sieves have been found to be useful in a variety of hydrocarbon conversion processes. Examples of MCM-22 family molecular sieve are MCM-22, MCM-49, MCM-56, ITQ-1, PSH-3, SSZ-25, and ERB-1. Such molecular sieves are useful for alkylation of aromatic compounds. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,936,744 discloses a process for producing a monoalkylated aromatic compound, particularly cumene, comprising the step of contacting a polyalkylated aromatic compound with an alkylatable aromatic compound under at least partial liquid phase conditions and in the presence of a transalkylation catalyst to produce the monoalkylated aromatic compound, wherein the transalkylation catalyst comprises a mixture of at least two different crystalline molecular sieves, wherein each of said molecular sieves is selected from zeolite beta, zeolite Y, mordenite and a material having an X-ray diffraction pattern including d-spacing maxima at 12.4&#xb1;0.25, 6.9&#xb1;0.15, 3.57&#xb1;0.07 and 3.42&#xb1;0.07 Angstrom (&#x212b;).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0015">The MCM-22 family molecular sieves including MCM-22, MCM-49, and MCM-56 have various applications in hydrocarbon conversion processes. Unfortunately, industrial applications of zeolite catalysts have been hindered due to some major disadvantages associated with the current synthesis techniques that make large scale production of these catalysts complicated and therefore expensive. At present, crystalline zeolite catalysts are synthesized mainly by conventional liquid-phase hydrothermal treatment, including in-situ crystallization and seeding method, and the liquid phase transport method.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0016">Ethylbenzene is a key raw material in the production of styrene and is produced by the reaction of ethylene and benzene in the presence of an acid catalyst. Old ethylbenzene production plants, typically built before 1980, used AlCl<sub>3 </sub>or BF<sub>3 </sub>as the acidic catalyst. Newer plants have in general been switching to zeolite-based acidic catalysts.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0017">Traditionally, ethylbenzene has been produced in vapor-phase reactor systems, in which the ethylation reaction of benzene with ethylene is carried out at a temperature of about 380-420&#xb0; C. and a pressure of 9-15 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>-g in multiple fixed beds of zeolite catalyst. Ethylene exothermally reacts with benzene to form ethylbenzene, although undesirable chain and side reactions also occur. About 15% of the ethylbenzene formed further reacts with ethylene to form di-ethylbenzene isomers (DEB), tri-ethylbenzene isomers (TEB) and heavier aromatic products. All these chain reaction products are commonly referred as polyethylated benzenes (PEBs). In addition to the ethylation reactions, the formation of xylene isomers as trace products occurs by side reactions. This xylene formation in vapor phase processes may yield an ethylbenzene product with about 0.05-0.20 wt. % of xylenes. The xylenes show up as an impurity in the subsequent styrene product, and are generally considered undesirable.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0018">In order to minimize the formation of PEBs, a stoichiometric excess of benzene, about 400-2000% per pass, is applied, depending on process optimization. The effluent from the ethylation reactor contains about 70-85 wt. % of unreacted benzene, about 12-20 wt. % of ethylbenzene product and about 3-4 wt. % of PEBs. To avoid a yield loss, the PEBs are converted back to ethylbenzene by transalkylation with additional benzene, normally in a separate transalkylation reactor.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0019">By way of example, vapor phase ethylation of benzene over the crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite ZSM-5 is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,751,504 (Keown et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 3,751,506 (Burress), and U.S. Pat. No. 3,755,483 (Burress).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0020">In recent years the trend in industry has been to shift away from vapor phase reactors to liquid phase reactors. Liquid phase reactors operate at a temperature of about 180-270&#xb0; C., which is under the critical temperature of benzene (about 290&#xb0; C.). One advantage of the liquid phase reactor is the very low formation of xylenes and other undesirable byproducts. The rate of the ethylation reaction is normally lower compared with the vapor phase, but the lower design temperature of the liquid phase reaction usually economically compensates for the negatives associated with the higher catalyst volume. Thus, due to the kinetics of the lower ethylation temperatures, resulting from the liquid phase catalyst, the rate of the chain reactions forming PEBs is considerably lower; namely, about 5-8% of the ethylbenzene is converted to PEBs in liquid phase reactions versus the 15-20% converted in vapor phase reactions. Hence the stoichiometric excess of benzene in liquid phase systems is typically 150-400%, compared with 400-2000% in vapor phase.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0021">Liquid phase ethylation of benzene using zeolite beta as the catalyst is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,891,458 and European Patent Publication Nos. 0432814 and 0629549. More recently it has been disclosed that MCM-22 and its structural analogues have utility in these alkylation/transalkylation reactions, see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,992,606 (MCM-22), U.S. Pat. No. 5,258,565 (MCM-36), U.S. Pat. No. 5,371,310 (MCM-49), U.S. Pat. No. 5,453,554 (MCM-56), U.S. Pat. No. 5,149,894 (SSZ-25); U.S. Pat. No. 6,077,498 (ITQ-1); and U.S. Pat. No. 6,231,751 (ITQ-2).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0022">Although liquid phase ethylbenzene plants offer significant advantages over vapor phase processes, because they necessarily operate at lower temperatures, liquid phase processes tend to be more sensitive to catalyst poisons than their vapor phase counterparts, making them of limited utility with lower grade ethylene and benzene streams without significant feed pretreatment. However, the purification of alkylation feed streams is a costly business and hence there is considerable interest in developing processes that may operate with lower grade feed streams.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0023">After catalyst is brought on stream for a period of time, the catalyst normally will be deactivated due to coking, or depositing of hydrocarbons, especially nitrogen containing components. After deactivation, the catalyst normally needs to be regenerated to remove coke and poisons such as nitrogen and sulfur. Typically the regeneration is performed &#x201c;in-situ&#x201d; or &#x201c;ex-situ&#x201d; by burning the spent catalyst in air. Some catalyst is sensitive to the amount of moisture in the air. Also water is formed during the combustion process of removing the carbon from the catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0024">We have found that an inert gas rejuvenation instead of an air regeneration is adequate for removing the carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur compounds of the spent catalyst, especially for spent catalyst in an alkylation process.</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0060">The reactants used in the present process include an alkylatable aromatic compound and an alkene alkylating agent.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0061">The term &#x201c;aromatic&#x201d; in reference to the alkylatable compounds which are useful herein is to be understood in accordance with its art-recognized scope which includes alkyl substituted and unsubstituted mono- and polynuclear compounds. Compounds of an aromatic character which possess a heteroatom are also useful provided they do not act as catalyst poisons under the reaction conditions selected.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0062">Substituted aromatic compounds which may be alkylated herein must possess at least one hydrogen atom directly bonded to the aromatic nucleus. The aromatic rings may be substituted with one or more alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, alkoxy, aryloxy, cycloalkyl, halide, and/or other groups which do not interfere with the alkylation reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0063">Suitable aromatic hydrocarbons include benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, naphthacene, perylene, coronene, and phenanthrene, with benzene being preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0064">Generally the alkyl groups which may be present as substituents on the aromatic compound contain from about 1 to 22 carbon atoms and usually from about 1 to 8 carbon atoms, and most usually from about 1 to 4 carbon atoms.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0065">Suitable alkyl substituted aromatic compounds include toluene, xylene, isopropylbenzene, normal propylbenzene, alpha-methylnaphthalene, ethylbenzene, mesitylene, durene, cymenes, butylbenzene, pseudocumene, o-diethylbenzene, m-diethylbenzene, p-diethylbenzene, isoamylbenzene, isohexylbenzene, pentaethylbenzene, pentamethylbenzene; 1,2,3,4-tetraethylbenzene; 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene; 1,2,4-triethylbenzene; 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene, m-butyltoluene; p-butyltoluene; 3,5-diethyltoluene; o-ethyltoluene; p-ethyltoluene; m-propyltoluene; 4-ethyl-m-xylene; dimethylnaphthalenes; ethylnaphthalene; 2,3-dimethylanthracene; 9-ethylanthracene; 2-methylanthracene; o-methylanthracene; 9,10-dimethylphenanthrene; and 3-methyl-phenanthrene. Higher molecular weight alkylaromatic hydrocarbons may also be used as starting materials and include aromatic hydrocarbons such as are produced by the alkylation of aromatic hydrocarbons with olefin oligomers. Such products are frequently referred to in the art as alkylate and include hexylbenzene, nonylbenzene, dodecylbenzene, pentadecylbenzene, hexyltoluene, nonyltoluene, dodecyltoluene, pentadecytoluene, etc. Very often alkylate is obtained as a high boiling fraction in which the alkyl group attached to the aromatic nucleus varies in size from about C<sub>6 </sub>to about C<sub>12</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0066">Reformate or a cut thereof containing substantial quantities of benzene, toluene and/or xylene constitutes a particularly useful feed for the alkylation process of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0067">The alkylating agent useful in the present process includes an alkene, which can be present as substantially pure alkene feed or as a dilute feed containing at least one alkane and typically at least one alkane having the same number of carbon atoms as the alkene. For example, where the alkene is ethylene, the alkane may be ethane. Typically, the dilute alkene feed comprises at least 20 wt. % of the alkene, such as from about 20 to about 80 wt. %, for example from about 60 to about 80 wt. %, of the alkene. It is recognized that feed sources may undergo purification (for example by distillation) prior to being fed to the present process. One particularly useful feed is the dilute ethylene stream obtained as an off gas from the fluid catalytic cracking unit of a petroleum refinery.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0068">Preferably, the reactants in the present process are benzene and ethylene and the desired reaction product is ethylbenzene.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Vapor Phase Alkylation</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0069">The vapor phase alkylation typically the alkylatable aromatic compound includes benzene, the alkene includes ethylene and the alkylaromatic compound includes ethylbenzene, the conditions in the or each alkylation reaction zone of the first alkylation reaction system include a temperature of about 350&#xb0; C. to about 400&#xb0; C. and a pressure of about 2000 kPa-a to about 3500 kPa-a.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0070">In one embodiment, the alkylation catalyst employed in the or each alkylation reaction zone of the vapor phase alkylation reaction system comprises at least one medium pore molecular sieve having a Constraint Index of 2-12 (as defined in U.S. Pat. No. 4,016,218). Suitable medium pore molecular sieves include ZSM-5, ZSM-11, ZSM-12, ZSM-22, ZSM-23, ZSM-35, and ZSM-48. ZSM-5 is described in detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,702,886 and Re. 29,948. ZSM-11 is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 3,709,979. ZSM-12 is described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,832,449. ZSM-22 is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,556,477. ZSM-23 is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,076,842. ZSM-35 is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,016,245. ZSM-48 is more particularly described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,234,231.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0071">In a further embodiment, the alkylation catalyst employed in the or each alkylation reaction zone of the vapor phase alkylation reaction system comprises one or more large pore molecular sieves having a Constraint Index less than 2. Suitable large pore molecular sieves include zeolite beta, zeolite Y, Ultrastable Y (USY), Dealuminized Y (Deal Y), mordenite, ZSM-3, ZSM-4, ZSM-18, and ZSM-20. Zeolite ZSM-14 is described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,923,636. Zeolite ZSM-20 is described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,972,983. Zeolite Beta is described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,308,069, and Re. No. 28,341. Low sodium Ultrastable Y molecular sieve (USY) is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,293,192 and 3,449,070. Dealuminized Y zeolite (Deal Y) may be prepared by the method found in U.S. Pat. No. 3,442,795. Zeolite UHP-Y is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,401,556. Mordenite is a naturally occurring material but is also available in synthetic forms, such as TEA-mordenite (i.e., synthetic mordenite prepared from a reaction mixture comprising a tetraethylammonium directing agent). TEA-mordenite is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,766,093 and 3,894,104.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0072">Preferred molecular sieves for the vapor phase alkylation reaction comprise zeolite beta, molecular sieves having a Constraint Index of 2-12, especially ZSM-5, and molecular sieves of the MCM-22 family.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0073">The above molecular sieves may be used as the vapor phase alkylation catalyst without any binder or matrix, i.e., in so-called self-bound form. Alternatively, the molecular sieve may be composited with another material which is resistant to the temperatures and other conditions employed in the alkylation reaction. Such materials include active and inactive materials and synthetic or naturally occurring zeolites as well as inorganic materials such as clays and/or oxides such as alumina, silica, silica-alumina, zirconia, titania, magnesia or mixtures of these and other oxides. The latter may be either naturally occurring or in the form of gelatinous precipitates or gels including mixtures of silica and metal oxides. Clays may also be included with the oxide type binders to modify the mechanical properties of the catalyst or to assist in its manufacture. Use of a material in conjunction with the molecular sieve, i.e., combined therewith or present during its synthesis, which itself is catalytically active may change the conversion and/or selectivity of the catalyst. Inactive materials suitably serve as diluents to control the amount of conversion so that products may be obtained economically and orderly without employing other means for controlling the rate of reaction. These materials may be incorporated into naturally occurring clays, e.g., bentonite and kaolin, to improve the crush strength of the catalyst under commercial operating conditions and function as binders or matrices for the catalyst. The relative proportions of molecular sieve and inorganic oxide matrix vary widely, with the sieve content ranging from about 1 to about 90 percent by weight and more usually, particularly, when the composite is prepared in the form of beads, in the range of about 2 to about 80 weight percent of the composite.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0074">The effluent from the vapor phase alkylation reaction system comprises the desired alkylaromatic compound, together with polyalkylated species, such as di- and triethylbenzene, unreacted alkylatable aromatic compound, any unreacted alkene (overall alkene conversion is expected to be 98-99.99+%) and any unreactive impurities present in the original alkene and aromatic feeds. Examples of typical impurities include N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) and sulfolane typically present in benzene feedstocks and dimethylformamide (DMF) often present in ethylene feeds. Depending on the nature of these unreactive impurities, they could adversely affect the downstream liquid phase alkylation step and hence part or all of the vapor phase alkylation effluent treated before being fed to liquid phase alkylation system. In one embodiment, the treating step is carried out in a pretreater. The pretreater is designed to remove catalyst poisons from the vapor phase alkylation effluent and typically contains a material, such as clay, activated carbon, alumina and/or a molecular sieve, capable of removing sulfur and nitrogen-containing impurities from the effluent. The pretreater is typically operated at a temperature of about 25&#xb0; C. to about 200&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0075">After passage through the pretreater, the vapor phase alkylation effluent is fed to a product separation system where the unreacted alkylatable aromatic compound is separated from the desired alkylaromatic compound and any polyalkylated species before being fed to the liquid phase alkylation system. In some cases, prior to feeding the vapor phase alkylation effluent to the pretreater, it may be desirable to subject the effluent to an initial fractionation step to remove part of the unreacted alkylatable aromatic compound for recycle to the vapor phase alkylation system and, if necessary to remove water that may have been present in the fresh benzene feed.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Liquid Phase Alkylation</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0076">The liquid phase alkylation typically, where the alkylatable aromatic compound includes benzene, the alkene includes ethylene and the alkylaromatic compound includes ethylbenzene, the conditions in the or each liquid phase alkylation reaction zone include a temperature of about 120&#xb0; C. to about 270&#xb0; C. and a pressure of about 675 kPa-a to about 8300 kPa-a.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0077">The alkene feedstock employed in the second liquid phase alkylation reaction system can be the same as or different from the alkene feedstock employed in the first vapor phase alkylation reaction system, although the alkene component in each feedstock will generally be the same, such as ethylene. In particular, if the vapor phase alkene feedstock contains nitrogenous impurities, a different feedstock or the same feedstock but treated to remove the nitrogenous impurities will generally be used for the liquid phase reaction. Typically, the vapor phase alkene feedstock can contain up to 0.01 wt. % nitrogen-containing impurities as elemental nitrogen, whereas the liquid phase alkene feedstock should contain less than 0.001 wt. % nitrogen-containing impurities as elemental nitrogen.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0078">For example, treatment of the liquid phase alkene feedstock to remove nitrogenous impurities can be achieved by providing a by-passable reactive guard bed upstream of the second liquid phase alkylation reaction system. The reactive guard bed is also loaded with alkylation catalyst, which may be the same of different from the catalyst used in the or each liquid phase alkylation reaction zone, and is maintained under ambient or up to alkylation conditions. The alkylatable aromatic compound and at least a portion of the alkene feedstock are passed through the reactive guard bed prior to entry into the or the first liquid phase alkylation reaction zone. The reactive guard bed not only serves to effect the desired alkylation reaction but is also used to remove any reactive impurities in the feeds, such as nitrogen compounds, which could otherwise poison the remainder of the liquid phase alkylation catalyst. The catalyst in the guard bed is therefore subject to more frequent regeneration and/or replacement than the remainder of the liquid phase alkylation catalyst and hence the guard bed is normally provided with a by-pass circuit so that the alkylation feedstocks may be fed directly to the liquid phase alkylation reaction system when the guard bed is out of service.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0079">The alkylation catalyst employed in the or each alkylation reaction zone of the liquid phase alkylation reaction system can comprise one or more of any of the molecular sieves discussed above in relation to the vapor phase alkylation system and can be used with or without a binder or matrix. Generally, however, the liquid phase alkylation catalyst is selected from zeolite beta and a molecular sieve of the MCM-22 family.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0080">In addition to the desired alkylaromatic product, the effluent from the liquid phase alkylation step tends to contain significant quantities of unreacted alkylatable aromatic compound and, in some cases, it may be desirable to remove at least part of said unreacted alkylatable aromatic compound and recycle it to the liquid phase alkylation step.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Transalkylation</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0081">The effluent from the vapor phase alkylation system or the effluent from the liquid phase alkylation system, will tend to contain polyalkylated aromatic compounds. Thus the or each effluents are passed to the product separation system that not only serves to remove unreacted alkylated aromatic compound, and desired monoalkylated product, but also separates the polyalkylated species. The polyalkylated species are then fed to a transalkylation reactor, which is normally separate from the alkylation reactor, where additional monoalkylated product is produced by reacting the polyalkylated species with additional aromatic compound in the presence of a transalkylation catalyst. Typically, the transalkylation reactor is operated under conditions such that the polyalkylated aromatic compounds and the alkylatable aromatic compound are at least predominantly in the liquid phase.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0082">For example, suitable conditions for carrying out the liquid phase transalkylation of benzene with polyethylbenzenes may include a temperature of from about 150&#xb0; C. to about 260&#xb0; C., a pressure of 7000 kPa-a or less, a WHSV based on the weight of the total liquid feed to the reaction zone of from about 0.5 to about 100 hr<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and a mole ratio of benzene to polyethylbenzene of from about 1:1 to about 30:1. Particular conditions for carrying out the liquid phase transalkylation of benzene with polypropylbenzenes may include a temperature of from about 150&#xb0; C. to about 300&#xb0; C., a pressure of 5500 kPa-a or less, a WHSV based on the weight of the total liquid feed to the reaction zone of from about 0.1 to about 20.0 hr<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and a mole ratio of benzene to polypropylbenzene of from about 1.0 to about 10.0. Particular conditions for carrying out the liquid phase transalkylation of benzene with polybutylbenzenes may include a temperature of 100 to 300&#xb0; C., a pressure of 1000 to 7000 kPa-a, a weight hourly space velocity of 1 to 50 hr<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>on total feed, and a benzene to polybutylbenzene weight ratio of 1 to 10.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0083">The transalkylation catalyst can comprise one or more of any of the molecular sieves discussed above in relation to the vapor phase alkylation system and can be used with or without a binder or matrix. Generally, however, the transalkylation catalyst is selected from zeolite beta, zeolite Y, Ultrastable Y (USY), Dealuminized Y (Deal Y), mordenite, ZSM-3, ZSM-4, ZSM-5, ZSM-11, ZSM-18, and ZSM-20.</p>
