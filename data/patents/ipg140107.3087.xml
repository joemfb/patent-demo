<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an embodiment, the present invention provides an indicator device that improves the status display of a circuit breaker.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an embodiment the present invention provides an indicator device for displaying the status of switching contacts of a circuit breaker. The circuit breaker comprises an energy store to store energy for to pass over the switching contacts from a closed position into an opened position when the energy stored in the energy store is released. Further the circuit breaker comprises a latching device for closing the switching contacts. The indicator device comprises a lever with a display element, wherein the lever is moveable between a triggered position and a non-triggered position in dependence upon at least one operational parameter. Further the indicator device comprises a coupling element which is operatively connected to the lever such that the coupling element is movable between a triggered position and a non-triggered position by the lever. The coupling element is further operatively connected to a first actuator of the energy store such that if the energy is stored in the energy store, the first actuator moves the coupling element into the non-triggered position and wherein a release of the energy stored in the energy store does not move the coupling element from the non-triggered position into the triggered position. It is therefore possible to indicate a special status to an operator. If the lever moved into the triggered position when an operational parameter triggers the lever the display element indicates the status triggered. If the stored energy is released by other circumstances like high current, the coupling element will not move the lever in the triggered position. A further display element can be used to indicate this situation.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an embodiment the indicator device comprises a slider which is moved by a second actuator of the energy store into a block position to block the latching device when the stored energy is released. The circuit breaker cannot be switched on when a problem still occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an embodiment, the energy store is a spring-operating storage. A spring is a simple and cost-effective energy store.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an embodiment the operational parameter is a trigger from a shunt release and/or from an undervoltage release. A shunt release or an undervoltage release can be assigned to the circuit breaker as an additional device. The shunt release or shunt trip triggers the circuit breaker to release the main contacts if a current above a specified level occurs. The undervoltage release triggers the circuit breaker in case of an undervoltage-situation. It is also possible that both releases (shunt and undervoltage) can be assigned together to the circuit breaker to monitor the current and voltage of the main circuits. In an embodiment, the coupling element is triggered by an electronic release to move into the triggered position. An electronic release comprises additional electronic circuits and also monitors the current or voltage of the main circuits, but also other parameters can be monitored by an electronic release using e.g. current transformers or thermal sensors. The displayed status makes a troubleshooting easier, since the status itself is not visible from the outside of the switch, especially when displaying an undervoltage release or an operating current release.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an embodiment the circuit breaker is removably arranged in a framework and the coupling element is triggered to move into the triggered position when the circuit breaker is removed from the framework. This embodiment avoids switching on a circuit breaker which is not fully inserted into the framework. If the contact plugs are not fully inserted, a sparkover between different phases can occur when the current flows.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an embodiment the coupling element is triggered by a closing mechanism of the circuit breaker to move into the triggered position. A closing mechanism locks the circuit breaker so that it cannot be turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an embodiment the coupling element does not move the lever into the triggered position when the coupling element is triggered. The coupling element can be triggered by several inputs as described in the above mentioned embodiments. If the display element should only indicate a trigger from a shunt release or an undercurrent release, the coupling element must prevent the display element from moving into another position, if a trigger from another source (electronic release, etc.) occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an embodiment, the present invention also provides a circuit breaker with an energy store to store energy for to pass over the switching contacts from a closed position into an opened position when the energy stored in the energy store is released and a latching device for closing the switching contacts. The circuit breaker comprises an indicator device according to any of the prescribed embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a schematic depiction of a first embodiment of an indicator device in an operation readiness status. The indicator device comprises a lever <b>10</b> and a display device <b>11</b>, The display device <b>11</b> is fastened at one end of the lever <b>10</b>. The display device <b>11</b> indicates the status of the switching contacts <b>3</b> of a circuit breaker <b>1</b> to an operator. Therefore, symbols and/or text can be printed on the display device <b>11</b>. The lever <b>10</b> is rotatably mounted on a pivot <b>12</b>, if the lever <b>10</b> rotates, the display device <b>11</b> moves under a display window <b>13</b> of the circuit breaker <b>1</b> and indicates other information to the operator. The lever <b>10</b> is coupled to a coupling element <b>40</b>. The coupling element <b>40</b> is rotatably mounted on the circuit breaker such that if the lever <b>10</b> rotates on its pivot <b>12</b>, the coupling element <b>40</b> rotates. To couple the coupling element <b>40</b> with the lever <b>10</b>, the coupling element <b>40</b> comprises a crank <b>41</b> which is movably arranged in an acceptance <b>14</b> of the lever <b>10</b>. The U-formed acceptance <b>14</b> in this embodiment is able to move the crank <b>41</b> in two directions. If the lever <b>10</b> rotates clockwise or counterclockwise, it moves also the coupling element <b>40</b> in the opposite directions.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The lever <b>10</b> can be moved by an external trigger <b>7</b>, which can be a trigger from a shunt release or an undervoltage release. The trigger <b>7</b> is a force which can be transferred from the shunt/undervoltage release to the lever <b>10</b> by mechanical means. If the shunt release detects an overcurrent or the undervoltage release detects an undervoltage, it triggers <b>7</b> the lever <b>10</b> to move.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Another trigger <b>8</b> at the crank <b>41</b> moves the coupling element <b>40</b> in a position such that it also moves the lever <b>10</b> in the non-readiness position. The second trigger <b>8</b> comes e.g. from an electronic release, a closing mechanism or from an indicator that indicates that the circuit breaker is not correctly inserted into a framework.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts the situation when the lever <b>10</b> and the coupling element <b>40</b> are moved in a second position. After the lever <b>10</b> is moved to a second position, the display element <b>11</b> indicates to the operator through the display window <b>13</b> that the circuit breaker is not ready to operate because of an external trigger.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The coupling element <b>40</b> is further coupled to a first actuator <b>31</b> which is operatively connected to an energy store <b>30</b>. If the first actuator <b>31</b> is moved by the coupling element <b>40</b>, the energy stored in the energy store <b>30</b> is released and the switching contacts of the circuit breaker open. A second actuator <b>32</b> of the energy store <b>30</b> is operatively connected to a slider <b>2</b>. The slider <b>2</b> is adapted to block or to let pass the switch-on force <b>6</b> for a latching device <b>5</b>. If the slider <b>2</b> is moved to a first position according <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an external mechanical mechanism can switch-on a latching device <b>5</b> which closes the switching contacts of the circuit breaker by mechanical means. If the slider <b>2</b> is moved back into a second position according <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the switch-on force <b>6</b> cannot be transferred to the latching device <b>5</b>. It is therefore not possible to switch on the circuit breaker, if no energy is stored in the energy store <b>30</b> and the switching contacts are open. After energy is reloaded into the energy store, both actuators <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> are moved back to the positions according <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A spring force moves the slider <b>2</b> back to the first position to enable the switch-on force <b>6</b> to switch on the circuit breaker by the latching device <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">If the energy stored in the energy store <b>30</b> is released by other means, it cannot move the coupling device <b>40</b> into the second position according <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> because the coupling is only workable in one direction. This means that only the coupling device <b>40</b> is able to move the first actuator <b>31</b> of the energy store <b>30</b>. The first actuator <b>31</b> cannot move the coupling device <b>40</b>, because there is no mechanical area of contact available.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 6</figref> disclose a second embodiment of the invention. The difference between the first and the second embodiment is that the coupling element <b>40</b> is coupled to the lever <b>10</b> in a different way. The crank <b>41</b> is not able to move the acceptance <b>14</b>&#x2032; and the lever <b>10</b> to the non-readiness position because the second area of contact in the acceptance <b>14</b>&#x2032; is missing. Therefore, only the trigger <b>7</b> moves the lever <b>10</b> and the display element <b>13</b> to a second position which indicates now the release of a shunt or undervoltage release. It is possible to mount the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> and the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 6</figref> in parallel such that the operator is informed by two display elements <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts the situation that an overcurrent or undervoltage situation triggers <b>7</b> the lever <b>10</b> to display the status that an undervoltage or overcurrent situation is detected by the overcurrent or undervoltage release. The energy stored in the energy store <b>30</b> is released such that the switching contacts are open. The slider <b>2</b> is moved into the block position such that the latching device <b>5</b> cannot be activated by the switch-on force <b>6</b> to close the switching contacts.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts the situation that the energy stored in the energy store <b>30</b> is released without getting a trigger <b>7</b>, <b>8</b> from the external releases. The lever <b>10</b> and the display device <b>13</b> remains in the position no undervoltage/overcurrent release. The operator can now narrow the analysis of error.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> depicts the situation that an electronic release, a closing mechanism or an indicator that indicates that the circuit breaker is not correctly inserted into a framework triggers <b>8</b> the coupling mechanism <b>40</b>. The coupling element <b>40</b> moves the first actuator <b>31</b> to release the energy stored in the energy store <b>30</b> to open the switching contacts of the circuit breaker. The coupling element <b>40</b> does not move the lever <b>10</b> and the display device <b>13</b>. The display device <b>13</b> indicates that there is no trigger <b>7</b> from an undervoltage or overcurrent release.</p>
