<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An exemplary embodiment of an electronic device includes a cover including a first hole, and a heat dissipating assembly. The heat dissipating assembly includes a movable board including a second hole and slidably connected to the cover, and a heat magnifying device received inside the cover and adjacent to a heat element. The heat magnifying device includes a moving end secured with the movable board. When the heat element is maintained room temperature, the first hole and the second hole are staggered from each other to seal the cover. When heat generated by the heat element heats the heat magnifying device and causes the moving end of the heat magnifying device to move under thermal expansion and drive the movable board to slide relatively to the cover, and the first hole of the cover and the second hole of the movable board are communicated with each other.</p>

<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally, a housing of an electronic device defines a plurality of holes to dissipate heat generated by electronic elements enclosed in the housing. However, the plurality of holes unavoidably provide an entrance for dust to go into the housing and cover the electronic elements. Over a long period of time, the dust would reduce heat dissipating performance of the electronic device and lead to the electronic device functioning abnormally.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The disclosure is illustrated by way of example and not by way of limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numerals indicate similar elements. It should be noted that references to &#x201c;an&#x201d; or &#x201c;one&#x201d; embodiment in this disclosure are not necessarily to the same embodiment, and such references can mean &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, an electronic device <b>200</b> comprises a cover <b>210</b> defining a plurality of first holes <b>2101</b>, a printed circuit board (PCB) <b>220</b> received within the cover <b>210</b>, a heat element <b>230</b> configured on the PCB <b>220</b>, and a heat dissipating assembly <b>100</b> dissipating heat generated by the heat element <b>230</b> through the plurality of first holes <b>2101</b> of the cover <b>210</b>. In the embodiment, the heat element <b>230</b> is a central processing unit (CPU).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The heat dissipating assembly <b>100</b> comprises a movable board <b>10</b> defining a plurality of second holes <b>11</b> and movably connected to the cover <b>210</b>, and a heat magnifying device <b>20</b> configured within the cover <b>210</b> and adjacent to the heat element <b>230</b>. The heat magnifying device <b>20</b> comprises a moving end <b>26</b> secured with the movable board <b>10</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">When the heat element <b>230</b> is maintained at room temperature, the moving end <b>26</b> of the heat magnifying device <b>20</b> is in an initial position, the plurality of first holes <b>2101</b> of the cover <b>210</b> and the plurality of second holes <b>11</b> of the movable board <b>10</b> are staggered from each other. As a result, the plurality of first holes <b>2101</b> of the cover <b>210</b> are blocked by the movable board <b>10</b>, which prevents dust from entering into the cover <b>210</b>, and enables the heat element <b>230</b> to have a good performance, due to the dust not covering the heat element <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">When the heat element <b>230</b> works, heat generated by the heat element <b>230</b> is transmitted to the heat magnifying device <b>20</b> and heats the heat magnifying device <b>20</b>, which leads to the moving end <b>26</b> of the heat magnifying device <b>20</b> to become elongated under the effects of thermal expansion. At the same time, the moving end <b>26</b> of the heat magnifying device <b>20</b> moves and drives the movable board <b>10</b> to slide relative to the cover <b>210</b>. Subsequently, the first holes <b>2101</b> of the cover <b>210</b> and the second holes <b>11</b> of the movable board <b>10</b> are communicated with each other to dissipate the heat out of the cover <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the embodiment, the electronic device <b>200</b> comprises a heat sink <b>240</b>, and the heat magnifying device <b>20</b> abuts the heat sink <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In detail, the movable board <b>10</b> comprises a connecting post <b>12</b> projecting from the movable board <b>10</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The cover <b>210</b> defines a pair of sliding grooves <b>2102</b> and a through hole <b>2103</b>. In assembly, the movable board <b>10</b> is located upon the cover <b>210</b>, two sides of the board <b>10</b> are respectively received in the pair of sliding grooves <b>2102</b>, and the connecting post <b>12</b> of the movable board <b>10</b> is inserted through the through hole <b>2103</b> to be secured with the moving end <b>26</b> of the heat magnifying device <b>20</b>. With this structure, when the moving end <b>26</b> of the heat magnifying device <b>20</b> moves, the movable board <b>10</b> moves along the sliding grooves <b>2102</b> of the cover <b>210</b>, at the same time, the connecting post <b>12</b> moves along the through hole <b>2103</b>, which leads to the first holes <b>2101</b> of the cover <b>210</b> being opened or closed.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref>, the heat magnifying device <b>20</b> comprises a case <b>21</b> secured to the cover <b>210</b>, a thermal pad <b>22</b>, a plurality of bars <b>23</b>, and a plurality of connecting parts <b>24</b>. The case <b>21</b> comprises a housing <b>211</b>, and a lid <b>212</b> covering the housing <b>211</b> and defining a connecting hole <b>2121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the embodiment, the plurality of bars <b>23</b> comprises a primary bar <b>27</b>, a terminal bar <b>28</b>, and a plurality of secondary bars <b>29</b>.

In the embodiment, a thermal expansion coefficient of the bars <b>23</b> is higher than thermal coefficient of the case <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In assembly, each of the connecting parts <b>24</b> is connected between two neighboring bars <b>23</b>. The first positioning portion <b>241</b> of each of the connecting parts <b>24</b> is movably connected to the second end <b>232</b> of a previous one of two adjacent bars <b>23</b> of the plurality of bars <b>23</b>, and the second positioning portion <b>242</b> of the connecting part <b>24</b> is movably connected to the first end <b>231</b> of a next one of the two adjacent bars <b>23</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Subsequently, the linked plurality of bars <b>23</b> and connecting parts <b>24</b> are put in the housing <b>211</b> of the case <b>21</b>, the first end <b>231</b> of the primary bar <b>27</b> is fixed with the housing <b>211</b>, the second end <b>232</b> of the terminal bar <b>28</b> is exposed out of the housing <b>211</b> and formed as the moving end <b>26</b> of the heat magnifying device <b>20</b>, and the pivoting portion <b>243</b> of each of the plurality of connecting parts <b>24</b> is pivotally connected to the housing <b>211</b> of the case <b>21</b>.
