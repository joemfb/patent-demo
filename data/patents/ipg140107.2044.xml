<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Transmission electron microscopy is one of the most important techniques for the detailed examination and analysis of materials having small size. Transmission electron microscopy provides high-resolution imaging and material analysis of thin specimens. In transmission electron microscopy analysis, a transmission electron microscope (TEM) grid is used to support the specimens. The conventional TEM grid includes a metal grid such as a copper or nickel grid, a porous organic membrane covering on the metal grid, and an amorphous carbon film deposited on the porous organic membrane. However, in practical application, when a size of the specimen is less than a thickness of the supporting film, the amorphous carbon film induces high noise in the transmission electron microscopy imaging.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">What is needed, therefore, is to provide a TEM grid and a method for making the TEM grid, to overcome the above-described shortcomings.</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a method for making a TEM grid of one embodiment can include the following steps:

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0025">In step (a), the substrate acts as a carrier for forming the graphene layer thereon. The substrate can be a metal foil, a copper foil, an alloy foil, or a metallic oxide foil. In one embodiment, the substrate is a copper foil.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0026">In step (b), the graphene layer can be formed on a surface of the substrate by a low pressure chemical vapor deposition technology. The graphene layer can include a single layer of graphene or a plurality of layers of graphene. If the graphene layer includes a plurality of layers of graphene, the plurality of layers of graphene are stacked with each other. The graphene layer can be a continuous integrated structure. The term &#x201c;continuous integrated structure&#x201d; can be defined as a structure that is combined by a plurality of chemical bonds (e.g., sp<sup>2 </sup>bonds, sp<sup>1 </sup>bonds, or sp<sup>3 </sup>bonds) to form an overall structure. The shape of the graphene layer can be round, square, rectangular, oval, or other shapes. In one embodiment, the graphene layer includes one to three layers of graphene stacked with each other, and the shape of the graphene layer is round with a diameter from about 3 millimeters to about 2 centimeters.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0027">In step (c), the carbon nanotube film structure includes at least two stacked carbon nanotube films. The carbon nanotube film includes a plurality of carbon nanotubes aligned substantially along the same direction. An alignment direction of the carbon nanotube film is substantially paralleled to the alignment direction of the plurality of carbon nanotubes. The adjacent carbon nanotube films in the carbon nanotube film structure can align along different directions with an angle &#x3b1; therebetween. The carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube film are aligned substantially along the same direction. In the carbon nanotube film structure, the length directions of the carbon nanotubes in different carbon nanotube films can intersect with each other. The carbon nanotube film can be drawn from a carbon nanotube array.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0028">A method for making the carbon nanotube film includes: (c<b>11</b>) providing the carbon nanotube array capable of having a film drawn therefrom; and (c<b>12</b>) pulling/drawing out the carbon nanotube film from the carbon nanotube array. The pulling/drawing can be done by using a tool (e.g., adhesive tape, pliers, tweezers, or another tool allowing multiple carbon nanotubes to be gripped and pulled simultaneously).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0029">In step (c<b>11</b>), the carbon nanotube array can be formed by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. The carbon nanotube array includes a plurality of carbon nanotubes parallel to each other and approximately perpendicular to the substrate. The carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube array are closely packed together by van der Waals force. The carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube array can be single-walled carbon nanotubes, double-walled carbon nanotubes, multi-walled carbon nanotubes, or combinations thereof. The diameter of the carbon nanotubes can be in the range from about 0.5 nanometers to about 50 nanometers. The height of the carbon nanotubes can be in the range from about 50 nanometers to 5 millimeters. In one embodiment, the height of the carbon nanotubes can be in a range from about 100 microns to 900 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0030">In step (c<b>12</b>), the carbon nanotube film includes a plurality of carbon nanotubes, and there are interspaces between adjacent two carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube film can be substantially parallel to a surface of the carbon nanotube film. A distance between adjacent two carbon nanotubes can be larger than a diameter of the carbon nanotubes. The carbon nanotube film can be pulled/drawn by the following substeps: (c<b>121</b>) selecting a carbon nanotube segment having a predetermined width from the carbon nanotube array; and (c<b>122</b>) pulling the carbon nanotube segment at an even/uniform speed to achieve a uniform drawn carbon nanotube film.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0031">In step (c<b>121</b>), the carbon nanotube segment having a predetermined width can be selected by using an adhesive tape such as the tool to contact the carbon nanotube array. The carbon nanotube segment includes a plurality of carbon nanotubes parallel to each other. In step (c<b>122</b>), the pulling direction is substantially perpendicular to a growing direction of the carbon nanotube array.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0032">More specifically, during the pulling process, as the initial carbon nanotube segment is drawn out, other carbon nanotube segments are also drawn out end-to-end due to the van der Waals force between the ends of the adjacent segments. This process of drawing ensures that a continuous, uniform carbon nanotube film having a predetermined width can be formed. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the carbon nanotube film includes a plurality of carbon nanotubes joined end-to-end. The carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube film are parallel to the pulling/drawing direction of the drawn carbon nanotube film, and the carbon nanotube film produced in such manner can be selectively formed to have a predetermined width. The carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube film are joined end-to-end by van der Waals force therebetween to form a free-standing film. By &#x2018;free-standing&#x2019;, it is meant that the carbon nanotube structure does not have to be supported by a substrate and can sustain its own weight when it is hoisted by a portion thereof without tearing. In the carbon nanotube film, the adjacent two carbon nanotubes side by side may be in contact with each other or spaced apart from each other. Pores are defined in the carbon nanotube film by adjacent carbon nanotubes.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in step (c), at least two carbon nanotube films are stacked with each other along different directions with an angle &#x3b1; therebetween. A frame can be provided, and a first carbon nanotube film can be secured to the frame. One or more edges of the carbon nanotube film are attached to the frame, and other parts of the carbon nanotube film are suspended within the frame. A second carbon nanotube film can be placed on the first carbon nanotube film along another direction. By using the same manner, more than two carbon nanotube films can be stacked with each other on the frame. The carbon nanotube films can be respectively aligned along different directions, and can also be aligned along just two directions. The carbon nanotube film structure is a free-standing structure.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0034">Adjacent carbon nanotube films can be combined only by the van der Waals force therebetween, and a more stable carbon nanotube film structure is formed. The carbon nanotube film has an extremely large specific surface area, and is very sticky. The layer number of the carbon nanotube films in the carbon nanotube film structure is not limited. In one embodiment, the carbon nanotube film structure is two layers of carbon nanotube films. The angle &#x3b1; between the orientations of carbon nanotubes in the two carbon nanotube films aligned along different directions can be in a range from about 0 degree to about 90 degrees. In one embodiment, the angle &#x3b1; is about 90 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0035">If the carbon nanotube film structure is formed, step (c) further includes a step (c<b>2</b>) of covering the graphene layer on the substrate with the carbon nanotube film structure. Due to a stickiness of the carbon nanotube film structure, when the graphene layer is covered with the carbon nanotube film structure, the carbon nanotube film structure can adhere to the graphene layer firmly.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0036">After covering the carbon nanotube film structure on the graphene layer of the substrate, step (c) can further include an optional step (f) of treating the carbon nanotube film structure on the graphene layer of the substrate with an organic solvent. After the organic solvent is applied to the carbon nanotube film structure on the graphene layer of the substrate. The organic solvent can be evaporated from the carbon nanotube film structure, to enlarge the pores defined between adjacent carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube film structure and make the carbon nanotube film structure and the graphene layer adhere to each other more firmly. The organic solvent can be volatile at room temperature and can be ethanol, methanol, acetone, dichloroethane, chloroform, or any combination thereof. In one embodiment, the organic solvent is ethanol. The organic solvent should have a desirable wettability relative to the carbon nanotubes. The step (f) of applying the organic solvent to the carbon nanotube film structure on the graphene layer of the substrate, may include a step of dropping the organic solvent on a surface of the carbon nanotube film structure, with a dropper. Alternatively, immersing the entire carbon nanotube film structure on the graphene layer of the substrate into a container with the organic solvent therein may be employed. After the organic solvent is evaporated, the adjacent parallel carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube film will bundle together and the carbon nanotube film will adhere to the graphene layer more firmly, due to the surface tension of the organic solvent when the organic solvent volatilizes. The bundling will create substantially parallel and spaced carbon nanotube strings. The bundling will occur in a microscopic view, and the carbon nanotube film structure will sustain the film shape in a macroscopic view. The carbon nanotube strings also include a plurality of carbon nanotubes joined end-to-end by Van der Waals force therebetween. Due to the carbon nanotube films being aligned along different directions, the carbon nanotubes of different films shrink to form from carbon nanotube strings in different directions. The carbon nanotube strings intersect with each other and form larger pores. The size of the pores can range from about 1 nanometer to about 10 microns. In one embodiment, the size of the pores ranges from about 100 nanometers to about 1 micron. The more layers of carbon nanotube films, the smaller the size of the pores in the carbon nanotube film structure. Thus, by adjusting the number of the carbon nanotube films in the carbon nanotube structure, the desired size of the pores can be achieved. The step of treating the carbon nanotube film structure with the organic solvent is optional.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0037">In step (d), the graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure can be obtained by immersing the substrate with the carbon nanotube film structure on the graphene layer into a treatment fluid filled in a container. The treatment fluid is not limited, provided the treatment fluid can react with the substrate, and will not erode the graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure. Thus, if the substrate with the carbon nanotube film structure on the graphene layer is immersed in the treatment fluid for a determined time, the substrate can be removed. Alternatively, due to the carbon nanotube film structure being a free-standing structure, the carbon nanotube film structure can act as a carrier for supporting the graphene layer, and prevent the continuous integrated structure of the graphene layer from being destroyed. Generally, the treatment fluid can be acid solution, alkali solution, or salt solution. Furthermore, during the reaction between the treatment fluid and the substrate, a plurality of solid impurities can be formed on the graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0038">In one embodiment, the treatment fluid is ferric chloride solution. If the substrate is the copper foil, the ferric chloride solution can react with the copper foil substrate to remove the copper foil. The step of removing the copper foil includes a step of immersing the substrate with the carbon nanotube film structure on the graphene layer into a ferric chloride solution having a concentration of 0.5 g/ml for about 24 hours. Alternatively, the reaction time can be determined by the thickness of the substrate and the concentration of the treatment fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0039">If some solid impurities are deposited on the graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure, step (d) can further include an optional step (g) of cleaning the graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure with a cleaning liquid. The cleaning liquid can be an acid solution. The acid solution can be dilute sulfuric acid, dilute nitric acid, dilute hydrochloric acid, or any combination thereof. In one embodiment, the cleaning liquid is dilute hydrochloric acid. The step of applying the cleaning liquid on the graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure can include a step of immersing the entire graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure into the cleaning liquid filled in a container for about 1 minute to about 15 minutes. The cleaning liquid can wash away the plurality of solid impurities deposited on the graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure. Furthermore, the step (g) can further include an optional step of (h) applying a de-ionized water to wash away the cleaning liquid in the graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure. Steps (g) and (h) are optional.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0040">In step (d), the graphene layer and the carbon nanotube film structure are joined by van der Waals force. To join the graphene layer with the carbon nanotube by chemical bonds, step (d) can further includes an optional step (i) of irradiating the graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure with a laser or an ultraviolet beam, or bombarding the graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure with high-energy particles. In step (i), the graphene layer and the carbon nanotube film structure can be joined by a plurality of sp<sup>3 </sup>bonds, thus, the graphene layer can be fixed on the surface of the carbon nanotube film structure firmly.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0041">Step (d) can include an optional step (j) of covering another carbon nanotube film structure on the surface of the graphene layer away from the carbon nanotube film structure. Thus, the graphene layer can be sandwiched between the two carbon nanotube film structures to form a sandwich structure. In other embodiments, another carbon nanotube film structure can include one or more carbon nanotube films having a different or the same structure with the original carbon nanotube film structure. If the sandwich structure is obtained, step (j) can further include an optional step (k) of treating the sandwich structure with an organic solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0042">In step (e), a surface of the carbon nanotube film structure away from the graphene layer is in contact with the grid, thus, the carbon nanotube film structure can be sandwiched between the graphene layer and the grid. The grid can include at least one through hole. The at least one through hole is covered by the graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure. The graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure is suspended above the entire through hole. Each of the through holes has a diameter from about 10 microns to about 2 millimeters. The diameter of each through hole can be larger than the size of the pores in the carbon nanotube film structure. The grid can be made of metal, alloy, or ceramics. In one embodiment, the grid is a copper grid.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0043">If the area of the graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure is larger than the area of the grid, step (e) can be replaced with step (e&#x2032;). Step (e&#x2032;) includes the following steps: arranging a plurality of grids spaced from each other on a platform; covering the plurality of grids with one graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure; and cutting the graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure corresponding to the plurality of grids, resulting in a plurality of TEM grids can be obtained at one time. To cut the graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure corresponding to the grids, a laser beam can be provided to focus the graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure between two adjacent grids. The graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure between two adjacent grids irradiated by the laser beam can be burned away. The laser beam can have a power of about 5 watts to 30 watts (e.g., about 18 watts).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0044">Step (e) can further include an optional step (l) of treating the graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure on the grid with an organic solvent to adhere the graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure with the grid more tightly. The contact surface between the carbon nanotube film structure and the grid can be increased if the organic solvent treats the graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure on the grid. Thus, the carbon nanotube film structure can be adhered to the surface of the grid more firmly. The organic solvent can be volatile at room temperature, and can be ethanol, methanol, acetone, dichloroethane, chloroform, or any combination thereof. In one embodiment, the organic solvent is ethanol. The organic solvent should have a desirable wettability to the carbon nanotubes. In this embodiment, step (l) can include a step of applying the organic solvent on the surface of the graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure by dropping the organic solvent from a dropper; or immersing the entire graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure into an organic solvent filled in a container.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0045">The excess portion of the graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure not in contact with the grid can be removed by using a laser beam. The laser beam can focus on the excess portion of the graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure not in contact with the grid to remove the excess portion of the graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0046">The method for making the TEM grid can have at least the following advantages. First, the carbon nanotube film and the carbon nanotube film structure formed from the carbon nanotube film are free-standing and sticky. The carbon nanotube film and the carbon nanotube film structure can act as a carrier for supporting the graphene layer without destroying the entire structure of the graphene layer. Therefore, a large size (centimeter-sized) graphene layer on one surface of carbon nanotube film structure can be obtained. Further, the graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure can be formed in a solution, and the impurity can be easily cleaned up by adding a cleaning liquid. Second, by using the laser, ultraviolet, or high-energy particles to treat the graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure, the graphene layer and the carbon nanotube film structure can be combined firmly through chemical bonds. Third, the carbon nanotube film structure has a large specific surface area, and is sticky. Therefore, the carbon nanotube film structure can be directly adhered on the surface of the grid. Further, an organic solvent can treat the graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure on the grid. Thus, the carbon nanotube film structure can be firmly secured to the grid. Fourth, a plurality of grids can be covered by a graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure, to form a plurality of TEM grids at one time.</p>

The TEM photo can be used to analyze the size distribution of the specimens, and observe the self-assembling of the large amount of specimens on the surface of the graphene layer <b>124</b>. The graphene layer <b>124</b> covers the pore <b>126</b>, the graphene layer <b>124</b> carries the specimens, and thus, the specimens are uniformly distributed above the pore <b>126</b>, thereby increasing the carrying probability of the specimens. Alternatively, the size of the single specimen can be only a little smaller than the size of the pore <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0057">Second, the graphene layer <b>124</b> can cover all the pores <b>126</b> of the carbon nanotubes film structure, thereby, to achieve a maximum carrying probability of the specimens.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0058">Third, the graphene layer is very thin. The graphene has a thickness of about 0.335 nanometers. Therefore, the background noise during the TEM observation can be lowered, and the TEM photos having higher resolution can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0059">Fourth, due to a high purity of the carbon nanotube film drawn from the carbon nanotube array, the TEM grid <b>100</b>, including the carbon nanotube films, does not require elimination of impurities by using additional treating step.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0060">Furthermore, the carbon nanotube film structure <b>122</b> and the graphene layer <b>124</b> are both composed of carbon atoms, and have a similar structure (graphene) and properties. Therefore, the carbon nanotube film structure <b>122</b> can be joined together with the graphene layer <b>124</b> by sp<sup>3 </sup>bonds. The TEM grid <b>100</b> including the sp<sup>3 </sup>bonds can be more durable.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0061">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, a TEM grid <b>200</b>, which can be made by the above-described method, includes a grid <b>210</b> and a graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure <b>220</b> covered on the grid <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0062">The TEM grid <b>200</b> is similar to the TEM grid <b>100</b>. The difference is that the graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure <b>220</b> includes two carbon nanotube film structures <b>222</b> and a graphene layer <b>224</b> stacked with each other. The graphene layer <b>224</b> is sandwiched between the two adjacent carbon nanotube film structures <b>222</b>. The graphene layer <b>224</b> can be held by two carbon nanotube film structures <b>222</b> firmly.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0063">The graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure <b>220</b> can be located on the grid <b>210</b>. The portions of graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure <b>220</b> can be suspended across the through holes <b>212</b> in the grid <b>210</b>. The graphene layer <b>224</b> can cover a plurality of pores <b>226</b> in the carbon nanotube film structure <b>222</b>. The plurality of pores <b>226</b> are defined by the intercrossed carbon nanotube strings <b>228</b> in the carbon nanotube film structure <b>222</b>. The carbon nanotube strings <b>228</b> in the two adjacent carbon nanotube film structures <b>222</b> can firmly secure the graphene layer <b>224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0064">The graphene layer-carbon nanotube film composite structure <b>220</b> includes two carbon nanotube film structures <b>222</b> and a graphene layer <b>224</b> sandwiched between the two carbon nanotube film structures <b>222</b>. Thus, the TEM grid <b>200</b> can have a stable structure and can be more durable.</p>
