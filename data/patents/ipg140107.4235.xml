<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An electronic device such as an All-In-One computer comprising a host and a display integratedly formed, a tablet computer, or a personal digital assistant generally has viewing angles adjustable via a supporting mechanism. The typical supporting mechanism usually includes a locating member that requires many screws to selectively position the electronic device. The locating member has a complex structure, which increases the cost of the supporting mechanism, and makes it difficult and time consuming to adjust the angle of the display.</p>

In one embodiment, the length of the at least one sliding post <b>31</b> is greater than that of the at least one through hole <b>131</b>, so the first and second ends of the at least one sliding post <b>31</b> can extend out of the at least one through hole <b>131</b>. The present disclosure is not limited to such a configuration and the position thereof can be changed to allow movement of the supporting member <b>30</b>. For example, the length and the bend radius of the at least one sliding post <b>31</b> and the at least one through hole <b>131</b> can be adjusted according to the volume of the electronic device <b>50</b>, and the first supporting end <b>33</b> or the second supporting end <b>35</b> can be adjusted to a positioning base to directly support the electronic device <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in assembly, the first supporting end <b>33</b> can be secured to the first end of the two sliding posts <b>31</b> by screws or other joining means. The two sliding posts <b>31</b> are passed through the two through holes <b>131</b>, and the second supporting end <b>35</b> is secured to the second end of the two sliding posts <b>31</b> by screws or other joining means. Therefore, the first supporting end <b>33</b> is located on a first side of the retaining portion <b>13</b>, and the second supporting end <b>35</b> is located on an opposite second side of the retaining portion <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>, the supporting member <b>30</b> is rotatable relative to the retaining member <b>10</b> between a first position and a second position, to position the electronic device <b>50</b> in any position between the first and second positions.

In one embodiment, the acute angle is 30&#xb0;. Therefore the electronic device <b>50</b> can be conveniently utilized in a variety of viewing angles simply by sliding the at least one sliding post <b>31</b> through the at least one through hole <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the electronic device <b>50</b> is shown in a position between the first and second position, accomplished by sliding the sliding posts <b>31</b> relative to the retaining portion <b>13</b>. The first supporting end <b>33</b> is moved towards the retaining portion <b>131</b>, and the second supporting end <b>35</b> is moved away from the retaining portion <b>131</b>. The securing board <b>11</b>, attached to the electronic device <b>50</b>, and the supporting surface <b>60</b> can cooperatively define a comfortable angle, such as 75&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the sliding posts <b>31</b> are slid to a position in which the first and second supporting ends <b>33</b>, <b>35</b> simultaneously lay on the supporting surface <b>60</b> and support the electronic device <b>50</b>. A center portion of each sliding post <b>31</b> engages with the retaining portion <b>13</b>, a distance between the first supporting end <b>33</b> and the retaining member <b>10</b> is substantially equal to that of the second supporting end <b>35</b> and the retaining member <b>10</b>, and the electronic device <b>50</b> is substantially parallel to the supporting surface <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, another embodiment of the supporting member <b>40</b> includes two sliding posts <b>41</b>, a first supporting end <b>43</b> attached to a first end of each sliding post <b>41</b>, and a second supporting end <b>45</b> attached to a second end of each sliding post <b>41</b>. Each sliding post <b>41</b> has a hook <b>411</b> and a plurality of clipping holes <b>451</b> (only two shown) defined in the second supporting end <b>45</b> and corresponding to the hooks <b>411</b>. The two sliding posts <b>41</b> can be passed through the two through holes <b>131</b> and engage into the two clipping holes <b>451</b> to secure the supporting member <b>40</b> to the retaining member <b>10</b>.</p>
