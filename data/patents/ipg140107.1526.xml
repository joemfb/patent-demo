<heading id="h-0001" level="1">RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a national phase of PCT/JP2008/060383, filed Jun. 5, 2008, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to wind turbine blades and a wind power generator using the same to generate power.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Wind turbine blades used in a wind power generator are required to be light, strong, and easy to fabricate. These needs are met by using a composite structure, as shown, for example, in Patent Citation 1.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">This consists of two members, namely, a glass-fiber-reinforced plastic skin that defines the blade shape and a glass-fiber-reinforced plastic main beam that is disposed in the skin. By assembling and bonding them, a predetermined overall structure is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, considering the buckling strength, a sandwich-structured portion formed of fiber-reinforced plastic and solid foam (a core member) sandwiched therebetween is used in the skin or the main beam.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Conventionally, polyvinyl chloride foam having high mechanical strength (for example, trade name: Kiegecell (registered trademark), manufactured by Kanegafuchi Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) is used as solid foam serving as the core member.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Instead of solid foam, balsa is sometimes used as the core member.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Patent Citation 1: the Publication of Japanese Patent No. 3825346 (FIG. 5)</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Meanwhile, polyvinyl chloride foam needs to be relatively dense to exhibit sufficient strength. However, this makes the foam heavy and increases cost, significantly affecting the performance and manufacturing cost of wind turbines.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Furthermore, balsa is wood and the supply thereof is limited. Therefore, it is not suitable for stable mass production, and thus, the price may increase.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention has been made in view of the above-described circumstances, and an object thereof is to provide wind turbine blades using a core member that is light and low-cost while maintaining strength and to provide a wind power generator using such wind turbine blades.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In order to solve the above-described problems, the present invention employs the following solutions.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A first aspect of the present invention provides a wind turbine blade formed of a fiber-reinforced plastic skin. A sandwich-structured portion of the skin uses a core member formed integrally of fiber layers that are arranged so as to intersect in plan view and that each penetrate in the thickness direction to constitute flow paths for resin and plastic foam filling spaces between the fiber layers, in such a manner that the fiber layers are impregnated with the resin.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the wind turbine blade according to this aspect, the core member is used in the sandwich-structured portion of the skin in such a manner that the fiber layers are impregnated with the resin. Thus, the fiber layers constitute fiber-reinforced resin layers.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The fiber layers are arranged so as to intersect in plan view and each penetrate in the thickness direction. Thus, sufficient strength of the core member can be ensured.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Therefore, because it becomes unnecessary to require the plastic foam filling the spaces between the fiber layers to have high strength, it is possible to use light (low-density), low-cost plastic foam. Thus, the cost of the wind turbine blades can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Note that examples of such plastic foam include low-density foam composed of polyurethane and polyisocyanate.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Furthermore, the resin impregnated into the fiber layers functions to be bonded to the fiber layers on the front and back surfaces of the sandwich structure. Thus, the sandwich structure is more strongly integrated, whereby the durability can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the above-described aspect, it is preferable that the sandwich-structured portion be provided in a main beam disposed between the skin disposed so as to oppose each other.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">By doing so, buckling of the main beam can be prevented while reducing an increase in cost.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the above-described aspect, it is preferable that the sandwich-structured portion be provided on the skin.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">By doing so, buckling of the skin can be prevented while reducing an increase in cost.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the above-described aspect, it is preferable that the core member be formed in the shape of a portion where it is used.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">By doing so, the core member can be tightly fitted into a predetermined installation position.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the above-described aspect, it is preferable that the core member is configured to include a plurality of units and to be assembled from these units into the shape of a portion where it is used.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">By doing so, it is easy to cope with an increase in size of the core member by assembling these units.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the above-described configuration, it is preferable that the units be rectangular-parallelepiped-shaped and use correcting units for correcting the shape such that the units are formed in the shape of a portion where they are used.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">By doing so, the units have only a rectangular-parallelepiped shape. Thus, the units can be produced easily and at low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Note that, because the correcting units are used only in some parts, they may either have the same structure as the units or be formed of conventional solid foam or balsa.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A second aspect of the present invention provides a wind power generator that uses a wind turbine blade employing a light (low-density), low-cost core member capable of ensuring sufficient strength.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">By doing so, the wind power generator can have sufficient strength with a minimum increase in cost.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to the present invention, the fiber layers penetrating in the thickness direction of the core member constitute the fiber-reinforced resin layers and can ensure sufficient strength of the core member.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Therefore, because it becomes unnecessary to require the plastic foam to have high strength, it is possible to use light (low-density), low-cost plastic foam. Thus, the cost of the wind turbine blades can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Furthermore, the resin impregnated into the fiber layers functions to be bonded to the fiber layers on the front and back surfaces of the sandwich structure. Thus, the sandwich structure is more strongly integrated, whereby the durability can be increased.</p>

<p id="p-0050" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the wind power generator <b>1</b> includes a tower <b>3</b> installed upright on a foundation <b>11</b>, a nacelle <b>5</b> disposed on the top of the tower <b>3</b>, a rotor head <b>7</b> provided on the nacelle <b>5</b> so as to be rotatable about a substantially horizontal shaft, and a plurality of wind turbine blades <b>9</b> radially attached to the rotation shaft of the rotor head <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0066">The force of wind blowing against the wind turbine blades <b>9</b> in the direction of the rotation shaft of the rotor head <b>7</b> is converted into motive power that rotates the rotor head <b>7</b> about the rotation shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0067">Although not shown in the figure, an anemometer for measuring the ambient wind speed, an anemoscope for measuring the wind direction, and a lightning rod are provided at appropriate locations (for example, the upper part) on the outer circumferential surface of the nacelle <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0068">Although not shown in the figure, a generator connected to the rotor head <b>7</b> through a coaxial gearbox is disposed in the nacelle <b>5</b>. That is, by accelerating the rotation of the rotor head <b>7</b> with the gearbox to drive the generator, generator output power can be obtained from the generator.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a lateral cross-sectional view of the wind turbine blade <b>9</b>. The wind turbine blade <b>9</b> includes a skin <b>13</b> that defines the blade shape and main beams (sandwich-structured portions) <b>15</b> and <b>17</b> that reinforce the strength of the skin <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0070">The skin <b>13</b> is composed of two halved segments, namely, a ventral-side skin <b>13</b><i>a </i>and a dorsal-side skin <b>13</b><i>b</i>. The skin <b>13</b> is formed of glass-fiber-reinforced plastic (fiber-reinforced plastic).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0071">The ventral-side skin <b>13</b><i>a </i>and the dorsal-side skin <b>13</b><i>b </i>respectively have, on the inner surfaces thereof, middle sandwich-structured portions (sandwich-structured portions) <b>19</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> and <b>19</b><i>b </i>extending in the lengthwise direction of the wind turbine blade <b>9</b>, leading-edge-side girders (thick fiber portions) <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b </i>positioned on the leading-edge side of the middle sandwich-structured portions <b>19</b><i>a </i>and <b>19</b><i>b</i>, trailing-edge-side girders (thick fiber portions) <b>23</b><i>a </i>and <b>23</b><i>b </i>positioned on the trailing-edge side of the middle sandwich-structured portions <b>19</b><i>a </i>and <b>19</b><i>b</i>, leading-edge-side sandwich-structured portions (sandwich-structured portions) <b>25</b><i>a </i>and <b>25</b><i>b </i>positioned on the leading-edge side of the leading-edge-side girders <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b</i>, and trailing-edge-side sandwich-structured portions (sandwich-structured portions) <b>27</b><i>a </i>and <b>27</b><i>b </i>positioned on the trailing-edge side of the trailing-edge-side girders <b>23</b><i>a </i>and <b>23</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0072">Core members <b>29</b><i>a </i>and <b>29</b><i>b </i>are sandwiched inside the middle sandwich-structured portions <b>19</b><i>a </i>and <b>19</b><i>b</i>. Core members <b>31</b><i>a </i>and <b>31</b><i>b </i>are sandwiched inside the leading-edge-side sandwich-structured portions <b>25</b><i>a </i>and <b>25</b><i>b</i>. Core members <b>33</b><i>a </i>and <b>33</b><i>b </i>are sandwiched inside the trailing-edge-side sandwich-structured portions <b>27</b><i>a </i>and <b>27</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0073">For example, because the middle sandwich-structured portion <b>19</b><i>a </i>is formed so as to gradually decrease in height at both ends in the widthwise direction of the wind turbine blade <b>9</b> toward the ends, the core member <b>29</b><i>a </i>is also formed so as to gradually decrease in height at both ends in the widthwise direction toward the ends, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0074">In this case, the portion whose height is unchanged may be formed of rectangular-parallelepiped-shaped core units (units) <b>35</b>, and the portions whose height gradually decreases may be formed of triangular-rod-shaped correcting core units (correcting units) <b>37</b>. Because the correcting core units <b>37</b> are used only in some parts, they may be formed of conventional solid foam or balsa. This is because, as will be described below, the core units <b>35</b> have fiber layers lying in the thickness direction (height direction) and thus it is difficult to cut the core units <b>35</b> smoothly. In addition, decreasing the number of the fiber layers may prevent the effect thereof from being fully exerted.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0075">For example, because the middle sandwich-structured portion <b>19</b><i>a </i>is formed such that the height thereof changes in the lengthwise direction of the wind turbine blade <b>9</b>, the core member <b>29</b><i>a </i>is also formed such that the height thereof changes in the lengthwise direction, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In this case too, the portions whose height changes may be formed of the triangular-rod-shaped correcting core units <b>37</b>. The other portions are formed of the rectangular-parallelepiped-shaped core units <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0076">In this manner, the core member <b>29</b><i>a </i>is formed by assembling the core units <b>35</b> into a predetermined shape. Thus, it is easy to cope with an increase in size of the core member <b>29</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0077">The main beam <b>15</b> is disposed so as to extend in the lengthwise direction of the wind turbine blade <b>9</b>, from the base end to near the distal end, such that a surface portion extends between the leading-edge-side girder <b>21</b><i>a </i>and the leading-edge-side girder <b>21</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0078">The main beam <b>15</b> includes a core member <b>39</b> having a substantially rectangular cross-section, a leading-edge-side structural member <b>41</b> covering the leading-edge side of the core member <b>39</b>, and a trailing-edge-side structural member <b>43</b> covering the trailing-edge side of the core member <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0079">The leading-edge-side structural member <b>41</b> and the trailing-edge-side structural member <b>43</b> are configured to be bent toward the trailing edge at the ends at the leading-edge-side girder <b>21</b><i>a </i>and the leading-edge-side girder <b>21</b><i>b </i>and to be bonded to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0080">Bent portions <b>47</b> of the leading-edge-side structural member <b>41</b> are positioned on the outside and are strongly bonded to the leading-edge-side girders <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b </i>with an adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0081">The leading-edge-side structural member <b>41</b> and the trailing-edge-side structural member <b>43</b> are formed of glass-fiber-reinforced plastic.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0082">The main beam <b>17</b> is disposed so as to extend in the lengthwise direction of the wind turbine blade <b>9</b>, from the base end to near the distal end, such that a surface portion extends between the trailing-edge-side girder <b>23</b><i>a </i>and the trailing-edge-side girder <b>23</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0083">The main beam <b>17</b> includes a core member <b>49</b> having a substantially rectangular cross-section, a leading-edge-side structural member <b>51</b> covering the leading-edge side of the core member <b>49</b>, and a trailing-edge-side structural member <b>53</b> covering the trailing-edge side of the core member <b>49</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0084">The leading-edge-side structural member <b>51</b> and the trailing-edge-side structural member <b>53</b> are configured to be bent toward the leading edge at the ends at the trailing-edge-side girder <b>23</b><i>a </i>and the trailing-edge-side girder <b>23</b><i>b </i>and to be bonded to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0085">Bent portions of the trailing-edge-side structural member <b>53</b> are positioned on the outside and are strongly bonded to the trailing-edge-side girder <b>23</b><i>a </i>and the trailing-edge-side girder <b>23</b><i>b </i>with an adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0086">The leading-edge-side structural member <b>51</b> and the trailing-edge-side structural member <b>53</b> are formed of glass-fiber-reinforced plastic.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0087">Similarly to the core member <b>29</b><i>a</i>, the core members <b>39</b> and <b>49</b> are formed by assembling the core units <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0088">Note that the correcting core units <b>37</b> of various shapes may be used as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0089">Next, the structure of the core unit <b>35</b> will be described based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0090">The core unit <b>35</b> is substantially rectangular-parallelepiped-shaped. The core unit <b>35</b> includes fiber layers <b>55</b> and plastic foam members (plastic foam) <b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0091">The fiber layers <b>55</b> are a textile such as glass fiber fabric and can be impregnated with resin, e.g., epoxy resin, in the in-plane direction.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0092">Note that the fiber layers <b>55</b> need not be textile, but a mat-like member, roving, or textile using roving.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0093">Furthermore, instead of glass fiber, any suitable fiber used for reinforcement, such as carbon fiber or aramid fiber, may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0094">The plurality of fiber layers <b>55</b> are arranged in a grid-like pattern so as to intersect in the longitudinal direction (for example, the lengthwise direction of the wind turbine blades <b>9</b>) and the lateral direction (for example, the widthwise direction of the wind turbine blades <b>9</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0095">The fiber layers <b>55</b> each penetrate in the thickness direction of the core unit <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0096">The plastic foam members <b>57</b> are, for example, low-density foam using polyisocyanate. They may alternatively be low-density foam using polyurethane.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0097">The plastic foam members <b>57</b> are rectangular-parallelepiped-shaped and are formed in a size capable of being fitted into the spaces formed by the fiber layers <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0098">The plastic foam members <b>57</b> and the fiber layers <b>55</b> are bonded together with an adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0099">The arrangement of the fiber layers <b>55</b> is not limited to a grid-like pattern, but may be such that, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the fiber layers <b>55</b> lying in one direction are staggered with respect to each other in adjacent rows.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0100">Furthermore, the fiber layers <b>55</b> need not be formed so as to penetrate through the entire width, but may be formed, for example, in a size sufficient to cover the side surfaces of the plastic foam members <b>57</b> to bond them to one another. In any case, they should be configured such that the plastic foam members <b>57</b> are bonded to one another with the fiber layers <b>55</b> therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0101">A molding apparatus <b>59</b> that forms the main beams <b>15</b> and <b>17</b> and the skin <b>13</b> includes a lower mold <b>61</b>, an upper cover <b>63</b>, a suction tube <b>67</b> attached to the upper cover <b>63</b> so as to penetrate therethrough and connected to a vacuum pump (not shown), and a resin supply tube <b>65</b> that supplies resin. The space between the lower mold <b>61</b> and the upper cover <b>63</b> is sealed when the lower mold <b>61</b> and the upper cover <b>63</b> are closed.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0102">Next, a method for producing the wind turbine blade <b>9</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>8</b>, and <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0103">First, a necessary number of rectangular-parallelepiped-shaped plastic foam members <b>57</b> of predetermined size are produced. This is done by foaming polyisocyanate using a mold of predetermined size.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0104">Next, the fiber layers <b>55</b> of predetermined size are prepared, disposed between adjacent plastic foam members <b>57</b>, and bonded to the plastic foam members <b>57</b>. Thus, the fiber layers <b>55</b> are integrated with the plastic foam members <b>57</b> to form the core unit <b>35</b>. Thus, the core unit <b>35</b> is formed such that the fiber layers <b>55</b> intersect in the longitudinal and lateral directions and penetrate in the thickness direction.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0105">At this time, the fiber layers <b>55</b> are preferably disposed around the core unit <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0106">Furthermore, the correcting core units <b>37</b> are produced as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0107">These core units <b>35</b> and the correcting core units <b>37</b> are assembled together to form the core members <b>29</b>, <b>31</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>39</b>, and <b>49</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0108">This is done according to the preparation conditions of the molding apparatus <b>59</b>. Alternatively, this may be done when the core unit is disposed on the molding apparatus <b>59</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a sectional view showing the molding apparatus <b>59</b> while it forms the main beam <b>15</b>. Glass fibers are stacked on the lower mold <b>61</b>, following its shape. The amount stacked is until the leading-edge-side structural member <b>41</b> has a required thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0110">The core member <b>39</b> is disposed thereon, at a predetermined position. Then, glass fibers are stacked thereon until the trailing-edge-side structural member <b>43</b> has a required thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0111">Once the above is done, the upper cover <b>63</b> is moved toward the lower mold <b>61</b>, and they are closed.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0112">In this state, the vacuum pump is activated to evacuate air from the mold. In this state, for example, liquid epoxy resin is supplied through the resin supply tube <b>67</b>. The epoxy resin is impregnated into the glass fibers in the leading-edge-side structural member <b>41</b> and the trailing-edge-side structural member <b>43</b>, as well as the fiber layers <b>55</b> in the core member <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0113">Then, the epoxy resin is heated by heating means (not shown) for curing.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0114">Thus, the leading-edge-side structural member <b>41</b>, the trailing-edge-side structural member <b>43</b>, and the core member <b>39</b> are strongly integrated by the epoxy resin. The main beam <b>17</b> is formed in the same manner.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0115"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a sectional view showing the molding apparatus <b>59</b> while it forms the ventral-side skin <b>13</b><i>a</i>. Glass fibers are stacked on the lower mold <b>61</b>, following its shape, until the outside portion of the ventral-side skin <b>13</b><i>a </i>has a required thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0116">The core members <b>29</b><i>a</i>, <b>31</b><i>a</i>, and <b>33</b><i>a </i>are disposed thereon at predetermined positions. Glass fibers are stacked thereon until the inside portion of the ventral-side skin <b>13</b><i>a </i>has a required thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0117">Then, they are integrally formed in the same manner as the above-described main beam <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0118">Furthermore, the dorsal-side skin <b>13</b><i>b </i>is formed in the same manner.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0119">The dorsal-side skin <b>13</b><i>b </i>is disposed with the inside facing up. One end of the main beam <b>15</b> is bonded to a predetermined position of the leading-edge-side girder <b>21</b><i>b</i>, and one end of the main beam <b>17</b> is bonded to a predetermined position of the trailing-edge-side girder <b>23</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0120">Then, the ventral-side skin <b>13</b><i>a </i>is disposed with the inside facing down. The other end of the main beam <b>15</b> is bonded to a predetermined position of the leading-edge-side girder <b>21</b><i>a</i>, and the other end of the main beam <b>17</b> is bonded to a predetermined position of the trailing-edge-side girder <b>23</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0121">Then, the leading edge portions and the trailing edge portions of the ventral-side skin <b>13</b><i>a </i>and the dorsal-side skin <b>13</b><i>b </i>are bonded.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0122">In this manner, the fiber layers <b>55</b> of the core members <b>29</b>, <b>31</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>39</b>, and <b>49</b> are impregnated with resin, e.g., epoxy resin. Thus, the fiber layers <b>55</b> constitute fiber-reinforced resin layers.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0123">Because the fiber layers <b>55</b> are arranged so as to intersect in the longitudinal and lateral directions in plan view and each penetrate in the thickness direction, sufficient strength of the core members <b>29</b>, <b>31</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>39</b>, and <b>49</b> can be ensured.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0124">Therefore, because it becomes unnecessary to require the plastic foam <b>57</b> filling the spaces between the fiber layers <b>55</b> to have high strength, it is possible to form light, low-cost, and low-density foam; for example, it is possible to use polyisocyanate. Thus, the cost of the wind turbine blades <b>9</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0125">Because the epoxy resin impregnated into the fiber layers <b>55</b> functions to bond the core members <b>29</b>, <b>31</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>39</b>, and <b>49</b> to the fiber layers on the front and back surfaces of the sandwich structure covering the core members, the core members <b>29</b>, <b>31</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>39</b>, and <b>49</b> are integrated therewith. Thus, the durability can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0126">Furthermore, because the resin impregnated therein is the same epoxy resin, they are more strongly bonded. Thus, the durability can be further increased.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0127">Although the core members <b>29</b>, <b>31</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>39</b>, and <b>49</b> are used in the main beams <b>15</b> and <b>17</b>, the middle sandwich-structured portion <b>19</b>, the leading-edge-side sandwich-structured portion <b>25</b>, and the trailing-edge-side sandwich-structured portion <b>27</b> in this embodiment, the core member may be used in any one of these portions alone so long as the required strength can be obtained or so long as the cost allows.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0128">Note that the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment, but may be modified within a scope not departing from the spirit thereof.</p>
