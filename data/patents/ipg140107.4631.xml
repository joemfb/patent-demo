<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a power distribution system, substantial digital signal processing may be utilized to conduct data communications between endpoints and a distribution substation, central office, billing center, or the like. Processing data received from hundreds or thousands of endpoints in a power distribution system on a three phase waveform may utilize considerable digital signal processing (DSP) resources. Consequently, communication of data between multiple DSP's employed to process a three phase waveform becomes increasingly complex as the number of DSP's increases.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, shown is a block diagram of one link of an exemplary power distribution system <b>100</b> distributing power between a distribution substation <b>103</b> and an endpoint <b>104</b>, which can be incorporated with a customer device and/or electrical system at a power consumer's premises or site. The power distribution system <b>100</b>, or distribution plant as it is sometimes referred to, can be that part of an electric power system that receives power from a power generator via high-voltage transmission lines, reduces or steps down the voltage, and then distributes the power to an endpoint <b>104</b> at the premises of a power consumer. Within the power distribution system <b>100</b>, distribution lines may conduct electricity from the distribution substation to the endpoints. Distribution lines may include underground cable, aerial cable, or overhead open-wire conductors carried on poles, or some combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Depending on the particular configuration, there may be one or more layers of distribution substations <b>103</b> connected in series between the power generator and the endpoint <b>104</b>, where each consecutive distribution substation further steps down the voltage of the electricity being transmitted. Additionally, the depicted distribution substation <b>103</b> can also represent any other central office, data center, and/or other supplier infrastructure used to deliver electricity, telecommunications services, phone, internet, or other services. As a non-limiting example, the depicted distribution substation <b>103</b> can be replaced and/or supplemented with a digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM) implemented in accordance with the same or analogous principles as disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Additionally, the power generators, distribution substations <b>103</b>, and endpoints <b>104</b> may be organized in a network where the various power generators supplying power can be taken on or off line and the distribution substation (through which a particular endpoint receives its electricity) can be changed without a loss or interruption of power. Distribution transformers (not shown) may be connected in the distribution line between the distribution substation <b>103</b> and the endpoint <b>104</b>, which the distribution transformers serve to further step-down the voltage to a level that is used by consumers. These step-down transformers, often referred to as pole transformers may be configured to supply a consumer or group of consumers with electricity over a secondary circuit. Each consumer may be connected to the secondary circuit through its service leads and meter.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The distribution substation <b>103</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be configured to provide power to a consumer device (not shown) and/or endpoint <b>104</b> via a distribution line <b>106</b>. The distribution line <b>106</b> may be coupled to one or more step-down transformers before reaching the depicted endpoint <b>104</b>. The distribution line <b>106</b> may be configured to receive power from the distribution substation <b>103</b> and provide at least a portion of that power to the endpoint <b>104</b>. For a variety of reasons, it may be desirable to communicate information from the distribution substation <b>103</b> to one or more endpoints, such as the endpoint <b>104</b>. As a non-limiting example, it may be desirable to control and/or monitor a usage metering device, which may be located at or near the endpoint <b>104</b> to determine the power consumption at the endpoint <b>104</b>. Additionally, control information may be configured to provide the ability to control and/or alter the operation of the usage metering device and/or individual loads at the customer premise. As an additional non-limiting example, other services aside from power, such as telecommunications, internet, and/or other data services can also be provided via the distribution line and may utilize bi-directional communication between the distribution substation <b>103</b> and endpoint <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Other more general information, including, but not limited to, information to display or store the price of power at the customer premise, the date and time, the temperature and/or other information capable of being received and translated at the customer premise may also be transmitted along the distribution line. As a non-limiting example, the time displayed on an electronic device at the customer premise could be periodically adjusted to display an accurate time as transmitted by the utility station.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As three phase electronic power systems can be frequently employed for power distribution, such power systems can include three conductors carrying time offset waveforms. Accordingly, data can be transmitted via three substantially identical waveforms that can be reconciled by a transceiver, and/or data can be separately transmitted in each of the three waveforms. Data can be embedded in any or all of the waveforms by employing frequency-shift keying (FSK) or other modulation schemes that should be appreciated whereby digital information can be transmitted on any or all of the waveforms employed in a power distribution system that may act as a carrier wave in such a scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Various embodiments disclosed herein may be configured to communicate control signals and general information signals to endpoints <b>104</b> via the distribution line <b>106</b> to control customer devices and provide more general information to the customer. Information from the customer device also may be sent via the distribution line <b>106</b> to the distribution substation <b>103</b>, thereby creating a two-way or bi-directional communications link via the distribution line <b>106</b>. The aforementioned examples of control signal applications where control signals (and/or general information signals) are provided by the distribution substation to an endpoint <b>104</b> are merely representative of the various uses that such control signals provide. Therefore, the examples provided herein are merely exemplary, as the disclosed embodiments are not limited to the transmission of any particular signal or service.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In providing control information and/or other data at the distribution substation <b>103</b>, a power line carrier (PLC) transceiver <b>109</b> is used to drive control signals and/or other data along the distribution line <b>106</b> to an endpoint transceiver <b>112</b> at the endpoint <b>104</b>. The endpoint transceiver <b>112</b> may be configured to recognize the signals transmitted by the PLC transceiver <b>109</b>. Similarly, the PLC transceiver <b>109</b> may be configured to receive information transmitted on the distribution line <b>106</b> from the endpoint transceiver <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The electrical distribution system <b>100</b> including the distribution line <b>106</b> may be configured to provide a full-duplex or bi-directional link between the distribution substation <b>103</b> and the endpoint <b>104</b>. Full duplex in this non-limiting example may refer to simultaneous (and/or substantially simultaneous) communications in both directions, although the information sent in one direction may travel at a speed different from that of the information provided in the opposite direction. This full-duplex link via the distribution line <b>106</b> may be configured to provide for transmission of control information, without the need for additional wiring over and above such a distribution line <b>106</b> that may be utilized for the transmission of electrical power.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">It should be appreciated that the depicted electrical distribution system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is merely a depiction of a single exemplary link in such a system. It should further be appreciated that additional complexities utilized for the bulk distribution of electricity or other services can be incorporated into an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, shown is an alternative depiction of a distribution substation <b>103</b> in accordance with the disclosure. It should be noted, as is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, that in operation, a distribution substation <b>103</b> can be coupled to more than one endpoint <b>104</b>. As a non-limiting example, a distribution substation <b>103</b> may be coupled to hundreds or thousands of endpoints <b>104</b> configured in a unidirectional or bidirectional communications link over a distribution line <b>106</b>. It should also be noted that in a multiple endpoint <b>104</b> configuration, various wiring configurations can be employed to connect a distribution substation <b>103</b> to endpoints <b>104</b>. As a non-limiting example, in the depicted environment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a main distribution line <b>106</b> as well as various spoke distribution lines <b>201</b> are employed to connect endpoints <b>104</b> to the distribution substation <b>103</b>. However, alternative wiring schemes may also be employed. As an additional non-limiting example, the distribution substation <b>103</b> as well as endpoints <b>104</b> may be connected serially.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As the distribution substation <b>103</b> and multiple endpoints <b>104</b> can be configured to form a communication link therebetween via distribution line <b>106</b>, a communications protocol can be established to substantially ensure that signals originating from one endpoint <b>104</b><i>a </i>do not interfere with those originating from another endpoint <b>104</b><i>b</i>. Accordingly, each endpoint <b>104</b> in such an environment can be assigned a channel in a frequency modulation scheme in which it may transmit data. As a non-limiting example, an endpoint <b>104</b> can be assigned an approximate 2-3 mHz channel within approximately 50 Hz to 60 Hz of bandwidth that is typically employed for power distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Accordingly, the PLC transceiver <b>109</b> can communicate with each endpoint <b>104</b> individually by sending and/or receiving signals in a particular channel or frequency assigned to an endpoint <b>104</b>. As noted above, there may be hundreds or thousands of endpoints <b>104</b> coupled to a distribution substation <b>103</b>. A PLC transceiver <b>109</b> in accordance with embodiments of this disclosure are capable of interpreting and processing data that may be sent from multiple endpoints <b>104</b>. Such processing of a three phase analog waveform can utilize substantial digital signal processing resources. Accordingly, the PLC transceiver <b>109</b> may include at least one advanced digital signal processing card (ADC) <b>204</b>, which is configured to receive the three offset phases of a three phase signal from various endpoints <b>104</b> that are coupled to the distribution substation <b>103</b> or a subset thereof. The ADC <b>204</b> may be configured to receive, filter, and/or separate a predetermined frequency range (e.g. approximately a 60 Hz and/or 50 Hz range) into one or more channels that are assigned to various endpoints <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, the ADC <b>204</b> can include one or more digital signal processors that are configured to receive and/or process channels assigned to endpoints <b>104</b> that are encoded in an analog waveform. As another non-limiting example, an ADC <b>204</b> can include a plurality of digital signal processors that can receive the various phases of a three phase waveform embedded with encoded data from a plurality of endpoints <b>104</b> and extract at least one channel of data corresponding to the various endpoints <b>104</b> in an environment such as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As the communications theories employed to extract such various channels of digital data from an analog waveform should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, further detail need not be discussed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A PLC transceiver <b>109</b> can further include one or more ADC's <b>204</b> to perform digital signal processing to receive and/or process signals received from other and/or additional endpoints <b>104</b>. As a non-limiting example, the distribution substation <b>103</b> and PLC transceiver <b>109</b> may be coupled to a number of endpoints <b>104</b> that is greater than can be handled by a single ADC <b>204</b>; therefore, additional ADCs <b>204</b> may be incorporated into a PLC transceiver <b>109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A PLC transceiver <b>109</b> may further include a single board computer (SBC) <b>206</b> and/or other device that can handle higher level tasks of a distribution substation <b>103</b> aside from the digital signal processing operations of the ADC's <b>204</b>. As a non-limiting example, the SBC <b>206</b> may be configured to receive digital signals extracted by the ADC's <b>204</b> corresponding to each endpoint <b>104</b> coupled to a distribution substation <b>103</b>. Such data can include, but is not limited to: metering data, outage data, status information and other data. Accordingly, the SBC <b>206</b> can process such data for billing, maintenance or other purposes. As an alternative non-limiting example, SBC <b>206</b> can forward such data to central billing and/or operations systems for such processing.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Additionally, SBC <b>206</b> can issue commands to ADC's <b>204</b> of the PLC transceiver <b>109</b>. As a non-limiting example, an SBC <b>206</b> can configure digital signal processing resources of an ADC <b>204</b> by initiating a software flash and/or other programming processes of one or more digital signal processors or other programmable components residing on an ADC <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which depicts a non-limiting exemplary embodiment of an ADC <b>204</b>. The depicted ADC <b>204</b> includes multiple digital signal processors <b>302</b> that are coupled to a corresponding memory <b>304</b>. One or more of the digital signal processors <b>302</b> may be configured to perform at least a portion of tasks for receiving and processing data from various endpoints <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in a power distribution system. As noted above, as there may be hundreds or thousands of endpoints <b>104</b> in such a system, each of which can be assigned a channel in a three phase waveform, substantial digital signal processing resources may be desired to receive and extract digital signals corresponding to the endpoints <b>104</b> in the system.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Accordingly, the ADC <b>204</b> can include one or more &#x201c;off the shelf&#x201d; DSP's that are configured and/or programmed in a way to divide digital signal processing tasks necessary to extract at least one channel of data from a three phase waveform used in a power distribution system. Additionally, each digital signal processor <b>302</b> may possess an internal memory or can be configured with an external memory for the purpose of assisting with the digital signal processing of signals received from a distribution line <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Because such division of labor may be employed in the ADC <b>204</b> among the digital signal processors (DSP) <b>302</b>, the various digital signal processors <b>302</b> may also be configured to communicate data among one another. As a non-limiting example, if the DSP's <b>302</b> of an ADC <b>204</b> are configured to perform piecewise processing of a signal in an assembly line fashion in order to isolate channels embedded therein, it may be desired to transmit data from one DSP (e.g. <b>302</b><i>a</i>) to another DSP (e.g. <b>302</b><i>b</i>) in the ADC <b>204</b>. Consequently, the DSP's <b>302</b> of the ADC <b>204</b> can transmit data among one another to facilitate digital signal processing necessary to process signals on a distribution line <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">More specifically, the digital signal processors <b>302</b> may be configured to access the memory <b>304</b> of other digital signal processors <b>302</b> in an ADC <b>204</b>. As a non-limiting example, the DSP <b>302</b><i>a </i>can be configured to access the memory <b>304</b><i>b </i>that is coupled to the DSP <b>302</b><i>b</i>. Such access can include writing and/or reading data from or to the memory <b>304</b><i>b</i>. In the above non-limiting example, the DSP <b>302</b><i>a </i>is configured to act as a master processor with reference to the DSP <b>302</b><i>b</i>, as it has access to the memory of the DSP <b>302</b><i>b</i>. Additionally, the DSP <b>302</b><i>b </i>can be likewise configured to access the memory <b>304</b><i>a </i>that is coupled to DSP <b>302</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, DSP's <b>302</b><i>a </i>and <b>302</b><i>b </i>(or any of the DSP's in the ADC <b>204</b>) can be configured as a master processor and a slave processor by accessing memory of another DSP while substantially simultaneously providing access to its own memory.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As an additional non-limiting example, DSP <b>302</b><i>a </i>may be configured as a master processor relative to DSP <b>302</b><i>b </i>and a slave processor relative to a third DSP, such as DSP <b>302</b><i>c</i>. Whether a DSP requires configuration as a master processor and/or a slave processor relative to another DSP may be dependent on configuration or programming of the DSP's and the tasks performed by each in order to process a three phase waveform in a power distribution system. In other words, each DSP <b>302</b> in an ADC <b>204</b> can be configured to act as a master processor and/or a slave processor relative to any other DSP <b>302</b> in the system. In addition, a DSP configured as a slave processor relative to a first DSP may not be simultaneously configured as a slave processor relative to a second DSP. In other words, a master processor should have exclusive access to the memory of a slave processor relative to other potential master processors in the system.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Because each DSP <b>302</b> of the ADC <b>204</b> can be configured as a master processor or a slave processor relative to any other DSP <b>302</b> in the system, fabrication of such a system can be facilitated with the use of a field programmable gate array (FGPA) arbiter <b>306</b> that can arbitrate and/or route such requests and data transfers among the DSP's <b>302</b>. Rather than wiring individual DSP's <b>302</b> to one another directly, the ADC <b>204</b> employs FPGA arbiter <b>306</b> and bus <b>307</b> to facilitate the flexible master-slave architecture of the ADC <b>204</b> disclosed herein. To this end, the FPGA arbiter <b>306</b> maintains DSP status <b>308</b>, which, for at least one of the DSP's <b>302</b> in an ADC <b>204</b>, includes data regarding whether a DSP is presently claimed as a slave processor by another DSP in the ADC <b>204</b>. In other words, if a particular DSP <b>302</b> is claimed as a slave processor, the DSP can cause the FGPA arbiter <b>306</b> to reflect that it is presently exclusively claimed as a slave processor by another DSP acting as a master processor. Additionally, the DSP status <b>308</b> includes data regarding which DSP <b>302</b> in the ADC <b>204</b> has exclusively claimed a DSP as a slave processor.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Therefore, if a DSP <b>302</b> attempts to claim another DSP <b>302</b> in an ADC <b>204</b> as a slave processor, the requesting DSP <b>302</b> can make such a request to the FPGA arbiter <b>306</b>, which can, on the basis of the DSP status <b>308</b> grant and/or reject the request based upon whether the requested DSP is presently busy or claimed as a slave processor by another DSP in the system. As a non-limiting example, if DSP <b>302</b><i>a </i>wishes to claim DSP <b>302</b><i>b </i>as a slave processor, DSP <b>302</b><i>a </i>can request to claim DSP <b>302</b><i>b </i>by submitting a request to the FPGA arbiter <b>306</b>. If DSP status <b>308</b> reflects that DSP <b>302</b><i>b </i>is not busy and not claimed as a slave processor by another DSP, the FPGA arbiter <b>306</b> can reserve DSP <b>302</b><i>b </i>as a slave processor for DSP <b>302</b><i>a </i>and update DSP status <b>308</b> accordingly. As a result, DSP <b>302</b><i>a </i>can act as a master processor relative to DSP <b>302</b><i>b </i>and access memory <b>304</b><i>b </i>for digital signal processing operation of the ADC <b>204</b>. When DSP <b>302</b><i>a </i>has completed acting as a master processor relative to DSP <b>302</b><i>b</i>, it can inform the FPGA arbiter <b>306</b>, which can update DSP status <b>308</b> accordingly, or &#x201c;release&#x201d; DSP <b>302</b><i>b </i>for claiming as a slave processor by any DSP <b>302</b> in the ADC <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The above non-limiting examples describing interactions between various DSP's <b>302</b> in an ADC <b>204</b> are merely exemplary and other permutations of DSP's acting as a master processor and/or slave processor are possible depending on the particular configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In facilitating the above-described flexible master-slave architecture, one or more of the DSP's <b>302</b> in the ADC <b>204</b> has a master port <b>310</b> and a slave port <b>312</b>. As a non-limiting example, the master port <b>310</b> may include a port through which the DSP <b>302</b> may access memory of another DSP in an ADC <b>204</b>, and a slave port <b>312</b> is a port through which a DSP <b>302</b> allows access to its own memory. Therefore, as noted above, such discrete master port <b>310</b> and slave port <b>312</b> allows a DSP <b>302</b> to substantially simultaneously act as a master processor and a slave processor through its respective master port <b>310</b> and slave port <b>312</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, which depicts an alternative illustration of the ADC <b>204</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In the depicted <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a non-limiting example of an implementation of DSP status <b>308</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is shown. As noted above, the FPGA arbiter maintains DSP status <b>308</b> regarding the DSP's <b>302</b> in an ADC <b>204</b> in order to arbitrate requests from DSP's <b>302</b> to claim other DSP'S in an ADC <b>204</b> as slave processors and further access memory of another DSP. Accordingly, in the depicted non-limiting example, the FPGA arbiter <b>306</b> includes DSP status <b>308</b> data for at least one of the DSP's <b>302</b> in the ADC <b>204</b>. Each DSP status <b>308</b> entry includes a slave busy flag <b>402</b> that reflects whether a DSP <b>302</b> corresponding to the DSP status <b>308</b> entry is claimed by another DSP as a slave processor. In the depicted example, the DSP status <b>308</b><i>a </i>reflects that the DSP corresponding to the entry is not claimed as a slave processor. Therefore, slave busy flag <b>402</b><i>a </i>is cleared.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The DSP status <b>308</b> entries may further include a master identity field <b>404</b> that reflects the identity of a master processor that has claimed the DSP <b>302</b> corresponding to the DSP status <b>308</b> entry. In the depicted non-limiting example, master identity field <b>404</b><i>a </i>contains no meaningful data as slave busy flag <b>402</b><i>a </i>reflects that the corresponding DSP is not claimed as a slave processor. Master identify field <b>404</b><i>b </i>may be configured to reflect that the corresponding DSP is claimed as a slave processor by a DSP <b>302</b> in the ADC <b>204</b> corresponding to the value stored therein. Accordingly, the DSP corresponding to the value in master identity field <b>404</b><i>b </i>may act as a master processor and the FPGA arbiter <b>306</b> may be configured to not grant other DSP's <b>302</b> in the ADC <b>204</b> access to the memory <b>304</b> of the DSP <b>302</b> until the master processor relinquishes its claim as a master processor.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It should be again noted that the above non-limiting examples are but some possibilities of an implementation of DSP status <b>308</b>. DSP status <b>208</b> can be implemented using various flags, registers and/or other structures that can be employed by the FPGA arbiter <b>306</b> to arbitrate requests by DSP's to communicate with other DSP's in the ADC <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which depicts an alternative illustration of an advanced digital signal processing card (ADC) <b>504</b>. The depicted ADC <b>504</b> illustrates one non-limiting example of an implementation in a power distribution system <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), whereby the ADC <b>504</b> divides processing tasks necessary to receive and process a three phase waveform. As noted above, the ADC <b>504</b> is configured to process a three phase waveform having data from various endpoints in a power distribution system <b>100</b> embedded thereon. Because such a power distribution system may have hundreds or thousands of endpoints in communication with an ADC <b>504</b> residing in a distribution substation <b>103</b> and/or PLC transceiver <b>109</b>, considerable digital signal processing tasks may be required in order to extract data from such a number of endpoints that can potentially transmit data embedded in a three phase waveform.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the depicted non-limiting embodiment DSP <b>505</b> is configured to communicate with an RS-232 interface <b>550</b> with an SBC <b>206</b> that can be in a PLC transceiver <b>109</b>. As noted above, the SBC <b>206</b> can perform various functions such as communicating with a central billing system, issuing commands and/or other directives to the ADCs in a PLC transceiver <b>109</b>, and other tasks. In addition, the SBC <b>206</b> can configure and/or program the ADC <b>504</b> as well as the DSP's (<b>505</b>-<b>513</b>) and FPGA arbiter <b>520</b> residing thereon. This configuration and/or programming which can include issuing new software for flashing on a hardware device, information regarding endpoints, distribution line <b>106</b> conditions, and other data. It should also be noted that the DSP <b>505</b> may communicate with the SBC <b>206</b> via interfaces other than RS-232 interface <b>550</b>, which may include, but are not limited to Ethernet or other serial and/or parallel data interfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Accordingly, DSP <b>505</b> may be configured to act as a gateway to the SBC <b>206</b> for the ADC <b>504</b> as well as other hardware and software components thereon. Consequently, the DSP <b>505</b> may be configured to understand and/or execute a command set or other protocol necessary for such gateway communications. Additionally, the DSP <b>505</b> is further configured to translate and/or forward commands or data from the SBC <b>206</b> to other DSP's in the ADC <b>504</b>, which can include but is not limited software to execute in the memory or flash memory of a DSP (<b>505</b>-<b>513</b>) or configuration data. Accordingly, DSP <b>505</b> may be configured to use the master-slave architecture facilitated by the FPGA arbiter <b>520</b> that allows it to claim other DSP's (<b>507</b>-<b>513</b>) in the ADC <b>504</b> as slave processors for the purpose of accessing memory of the DSP's (<b>507</b>-<b>513</b>). In addition, the DSP <b>505</b> can transmit digital data extracted from various channels of the three phase waveform received on a distribution line <b>106</b> to the SBC <b>206</b> via the RS-232 interface <b>550</b>. As a channel can correspond to an endpoint <b>104</b> in the power distribution system, the SBC <b>206</b> can forward and/or further process the extracted data for billing, status, outage detection and/or other purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">DSP <b>513</b> in the depicted ADC <b>504</b> is configured to receive a three phase waveform on a distribution line <b>106</b> that is converted into digital signals by an analog to digital converter (A/D) <b>560</b>. The A/D <b>560</b> is configured to receive three phases of a three phase waveform and convert the phases into a digital signal for processing by the ADC <b>504</b>. The DSP <b>513</b> can perform digital signal processing tasks to begin the channel extraction process. As a non-limiting example, the DSP <b>513</b> can combine the three phases of the three phase waveform and filter the combined waveform such that extraneous data at frequencies above and below an area of interest are removed. As a non-limiting example, in a 60 Hz power distribution system, frequencies above and below a 60 Hz area of interest can be filtered from the combined waveform by DSP <b>513</b> so that channels can be extracted therefrom. Likewise, the same principle can be applied in a 50 Hz power distribution system, as frequencies above and below a 50 Hz area of interest can be filtered from the combined waveform. In this way, DSP <b>513</b> can perform such pre-processing (<b>505</b>-<b>513</b>) so that additional DSP's in the ADC <b>504</b> can further process the waveform to extract data from channels corresponding to endpoints in a power distribution system.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Accordingly, the DSP <b>513</b> can employ the master-slave architecture to send the filtered data to the remaining DSP's <b>507</b>, <b>509</b>, <b>511</b> to perform digital signal processing tasks to extract data corresponding to endpoints. As there may be hundreds or thousands of endpoints in a power distribution system, the DSP's <b>507</b>, <b>509</b>, <b>511</b> may be assigned various distinct portions of the filtered waveform received from DSP <b>513</b> to extract such data from channels assigned to various endpoints. As a non-limiting example, an endpoint can be an approximate 2-3 mHz channel of approximately 50 Hz or 60 Hz of bandwidth that can be employed for power distribution. The DSP's <b>507</b>, <b>509</b>, <b>511</b> can utilize the master-slave architecture of the ADC <b>504</b> to forward extracted channels to the DSP <b>505</b>, which can forward the data in channels corresponding to power distribution system endpoints to the SBC <b>206</b> for additional processing for billing, metering, status, or other purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, shown is one example of a process in accordance with the disclosure. In box <b>602</b>, a request is received from a first DSP <b>302</b>/<b>505</b> to claim a second DSP <b>302</b>/<b>513</b> as a slave processor. In other words, the first DSP <b>302</b>/<b>505</b> may request to be a master processor relative to the second DSP <b>302</b>/<b>513</b>. As noted above, such a relationship grants the first DSP <b>302</b>/<b>505</b>, as a master processor, exclusive access to alter the memory of the second DSP <b>302</b>/<b>513</b>, as a slave processor. In box <b>604</b>, it is determined whether the second DSP is already claimed as a slave processor by another DSP in an ADC <b>204</b>/<b>504</b>, for example. Because the master-slave relationship gives a master processor exclusive access to the memory of a slave processor, a given slave processor can have no more that one master processor at a time.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In box <b>606</b>, it is determined whether, if the second DSP <b>302</b>/<b>513</b> is already claimed as a slave processor, its master processor is the first DSP <b>302</b>/<b>505</b>. If so, then the first DSP <b>302</b>/<b>505</b> can continue to have exclusive access to memory of the second DSP <b>302</b>/<b>513</b> as a master processor. If the first DSP <b>302</b>/<b>505</b> is not the master processor relative to the second DSP <b>302</b>/<b>513</b>, then the master processor can wait in box <b>607</b> until the second DSP <b>302</b>/<b>513</b> is available to be claimed. In box <b>608</b>, if the second DSP <b>302</b>/<b>513</b> is available to be claimed, then the request to claim it is granted by the arbiter <b>306</b>/<b>520</b>. In box <b>610</b>, the arbiter <b>306</b>/<b>520</b> updates DSP status data <b>308</b> to reflect that the slave processor is claimed and the identity of its master processor. In box <b>612</b>, the arbiter <b>306</b>/<b>520</b> facilitates memory transfers between the first DSP <b>302</b>/<b>505</b> and second DSP <b>302</b>/<b>513</b> in the master-slave relationship.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In box <b>614</b>, it is determined whether the master processor has released the slave processor so that it is available to be claimed by other DSP's <b>302</b>/<b>505</b>-<b>513</b> in an ADC, for example. If so, the arbiter <b>306</b>/<b>520</b> updates its DSP status <b>308</b> to reflect that the DSP <b>302</b>/<b>505</b>-<b>513</b> is available to be claimed as a slave processor.</p>
