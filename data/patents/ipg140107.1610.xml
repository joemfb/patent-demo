<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a U.S. National Phase Application of PCT International Application No. PCT/KR2010/005680, filed Aug. 25, 2010. The contents of this application are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an apparatus and a method for an electronic dart game using an Internet communication network, and more particularly to an apparatus and a method for an electronic dart game using an internet communication network, which can notify users of various competitions and provide a method of participating in the various competitions by using a plurality of electronic dart game apparatuses directly connected to the internet communication network without a separate means such as a homepage.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, a dart refers to a small arrow and a dart game corresponds to a game in which a user throws darts at a circular target having numbers and obtains scores. The dart game has an advantage in that someone with only arrow shaped darts and a dart target can enjoy the dart game any time and anywhere in all seasons.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A conventional dart board is made of timber or pulp. In the dart game, users throw the arrow shaped darts at a target made of cork or wood materials and earn scores according to the positions of the darts, which determines a winner.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, the dart game has been growing as a worldwide leisure activity due to the development of various ways the dart game proceeds and the arrangement of scoring methods, so that anyone can conveniently enjoy the dart game without distinction of sex or age. The darts have various weights and one dart weighs 18 g to 30 g. The dart consists of a pointy and sharp point (tip) made of a metal material, a barrel (grip), a shaft (bar), and a flight (wing).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The dart target made of wood materials is divided into 20 areas having fan-like shapes and the 20 areas are allocated scores of 1 to 20 points. The points are arranged such that a lower point score is located next to a higher point score in order to allow a user to obtain points only when the user accurately hits a number. Also, the dart target is divided into a single area (the number of the area hit by the user equals the points gained), a double area (double the a number of the area hit by the user equals the points gained), a triple area (triple the number of the area hit by the user equals the points gained), a single bull area (an outer area of a central circle, the value generally being 25 points), and a double bull area (an inner area of the central circle, the value generally being 50 points), in concentric circles from the outside to the inside of the dart target.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to keep pace with the popularization of such dart game, competitions participated in by many players are often held beyond simple dart games.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Up to now, when a dart game competition is held, players first register in the competition through the internet and then have preliminary games in a shop holding the competition.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Specifically, a host holding the competition notifies of the competition through a homepage. In most cases, the finals are generally held at one time in a particular venue, in which dozens to hundreds of dart game apparatuses are installed but preliminary rounds are held in various shops having conventional dart game apparatuses. Accordingly, after the competition is notified, locations of the shops in which players can participate in the preliminary rounds and times and dates of the preliminary rounds are notified.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">After such a competition is notified, the player fills out a participation application for the competition in which the player desires to participate and pays an entry fee. In this event, the player fills out the participation application on a homepage and then goes to a bank to remit the entry fee or directly goes to the competition venue to pay the entry fee. After the registration in the competition, the player goes to a designated location to participate in the competition according to the notice. Next, the player continuously plays the game during the competition period.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Then, the player enters the homepage again and enters his/her scores obtained during the game. Further, the player can identify whether the player has reached the finals through the homepage. If his/her name is included in the list of finalists, the player may participate in the finals according to the notice in the homepage.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, a player who desires to participate in the competition should actively search for information on the competition through a homepage, register for the competition through the internet, go to the bank to pay the competition entry fee, and then visit the shop at which the player can participate in the competition to play the game. As such, the process is very cumbersome for the player. Therefore, except for active players, general players occasionally playing the game for fun after simply seeing the dart game apparatus in a shop usually do not participate in competitions.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Accordingly, the present invention has been made to solve the above-mentioned problems occurring in the prior art, and an aspect of the present invention provides a method of offering a one-stop service, which can implement functions from competition information search to competition registration and competition participation in a dart game apparatus, so that it is possible to induce players who only desire to occasionally play the dart game after simply seeing the dart game apparatus installed in a shop to participate in the competition as well as active players.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of controlling a plurality of dart game apparatuses connected with a server through a network, the method including inputting information by receiving an input of player information on players who desire to participate in a competition and competition information on a competition in which players desire to participate, by using a dart game apparatus; transmitting information including the player information and the competition information to the server by the dart game apparatus; processing a payment by registering that a competition entry fee corresponding to the competition information is paid, by the server; and registering a player by registering the player information as a player participating in the competition corresponding to the competition information, by the server.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The method may further include extracting a competition for participation by extracting a competition in which the player information has been registered as the player, by the server; receiving a result of a game played by the player from the dart game apparatus, by the server; and storing the received result of the game in association with the extracted competition by the server.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The method may further include calculating a competition ranking by calculating a ranking for each player for the extracted competition, by the server; and transmitting a ranking by transmitting competition ranking information including a ranking corresponding to the player to a portable terminal of the player by using the calculated ranking for each player.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Processing of the payment may include calculating reserved money corresponding to the player by the server; and subtracting reserved money by subtracting from the competition entry fee the calculated reserved money.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Processing of the payment may include extracting a portable terminal number corresponding to the player by the server; transmitting an authentication number to the extracted portable terminal number by the server; inputting an authentication number by receiving an input of the authentication number by the dart game apparatus; and comparing authentication numbers by receiving the input authentication number from the dart game apparatus and comparing the received authentication number with the transmitted authentication number by the server.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Processing of the payment may include inputting cash by receiving an input of cash by the dart game apparatus; and transmitting settlement information containing information on the input cash to the server by the dart game apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Processing of the payment may include transmitting credit card information to a payment agency by the server; and authenticating a credit card by receiving payment authentication information from the payment agency by the server.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The server may include one or more sets of credit card information corresponding to the player and the credit card information may correspond to information extracted from the credit card information corresponding to the input player information from the server.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The method may further include checking whether the player is eligible to participate in the competition, wherein checking of whether the player is eligible to participate in the competition comprises registering the player only when it is checked that the player is eligible to participate in the competition.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The server may include information on a competition venue corresponding to the competition information and, in checking whether the player is eligible to participate in the competition, the participation may be determined by comparing information on a position where the dart game apparatus is installed and information on the competition venue corresponding to the competition information.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In receiving the input of the player information, the player information may be fetched by the dart game apparatus through a card having the input player information.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a dart game system including a plurality of dart game apparatuses connected with a server through a network, wherein the dart game apparatus includes an input unit for receiving an input of player information which is information on players who desire to participate in a competition and competition information which is information on competitions in which players desire to participate; a target unit comprising a plurality of scoring areas which darts hit; a sensing unit for detecting the plurality of scoring areas which the darts hit; a network connector for transmitting the player information and the competition information to the server; and a controller for controlling such that the competition information and the player information input through the input unit are transmitted through the network connector, wherein the server includes a payment processor for processing payment for the competition entry fee corresponding to the competition information; and a registration unit for registering the player information as a player who participates in the competition corresponding to the competition information.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The server may further include a participation competition extractor for extracting a competition in which the player information has been registered; a game result receiver for receiving a result of a game played by the player from the dart game apparatus; and a game result storing unit for storing the received result of the game in association with the extracted competition.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Hereinafter, an exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram schematically illustrating an electronic dart game apparatus using an internet network according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a plurality of electronic dart game apparatuses <b>1</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention are connected through an internet communication network <b>2</b> to allow players to enjoy a dart game in different places (shops) or different countries.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Of course, as described above, a plurality of players can enjoy the dart game in different places by using the electronic dart game apparatuses <b>1</b> according to the embodiment of the present invention online, but the players also can independently enjoy the dart game in each shop offline.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Further, since the individual electronic dart game apparatus <b>1</b> accesses a server <b>3</b> through the internet communication network <b>2</b>, the electronic dart game apparatus <b>1</b> can download the latest program for the dart game and check data. Furthermore, the server <b>3</b> includes a database to store shop information, personal information on each player, a dart game ranking, a game result of a player, and scores of the player in real time. Here, the server <b>3</b> is provided by a manufacturer of the electronic dart game apparatus <b>1</b> according to the embodiment of the present invention or an internet company related to the electronic dart game apparatus. Once the electronic dart game apparatus <b>1</b> according to the embodiment of the present invention performs an access online (each apparatus has a registered inherent machine ID and a shop purchasing the apparatus also has a registered separate ID and a password), the electronic dart game apparatus <b>1</b> is directly connected to the server <b>3</b> and can receive all services related to the dart game.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a front view of an individual electronic dart game apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a construction of the electronic dart game apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The electronic dart game apparatus <b>1</b> includes a selector <b>300</b> for selecting a plurality of different dart games according to operations of players, a dart target <b>100</b> having a plurality of scoring areas to be hit by darts thrown by the players, a sensor <b>101</b> for detecting the plurality of scoring areas hit by the darts, and a controller for grasping a dart game status for an individual player from the dart game selected from the selector <b>300</b> and scores detected from the sensor <b>101</b> in real time and outputting the grasped dart game status to a display unit <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Also, the electronic dart game apparatus <b>1</b> further includes a voice outputting unit <b>30</b> for outputting voice, a memory <b>20</b> for storing various dart game programs or data, a communication unit <b>40</b> having a communication interface for the connection with the internet communication network <b>2</b>, and a power supply unit <b>50</b> for applying power. The voice outputting unit is equipped with a woofer system to provide dynamic sounds.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">When the electronic dart game apparatus is turned on with power supplied by the power supply unit <b>50</b>, the display unit <b>200</b> automatically displays an image. The display unit <b>200</b> displays all corresponding screens involved with the progress of the game, which is from the start to the end of the game, such as a main screen to select game categories, an option button screen, an option selection screen, and a real time dart game status screen. Of course, such a display of the screen is automatically displayed under a control of the controller <b>10</b> according to an output from the sensor <b>101</b> for sensing scores of the target <b>100</b> and the selector <b>300</b>, which is an input unit. That is, different screens are displayed according to various games selected by the selector <b>300</b> and values corresponding to scoring areas of the target <b>100</b> hit by the dart thrown by player according to each game are calculated and displayed in real time.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The selector <b>300</b>, which is the input unit, is installed in a lower part of the target <b>100</b> and includes top, bottom, left, and right direction keys <b>310</b>, an option button, and a selection button <b>312</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The selector <b>300</b> having the above construction is electrically connected with the display unit <b>200</b> and the controller <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">When the top and bottom keys are pressed in a main screen to select competition categories, a corresponding competition, in which a player desires to participate, may be selected by the selection button <b>312</b> while a cursor is moved. When the right key is pressed, a submenu of a corresponding category appears, and, when the left key is pressed, the screen returns to a menu of a previous stage. When the option button <b>311</b> is pressed, a help menu of the electronic dart game apparatus <b>1</b> according to the embodiment of the present invention appears, and, when the option button is pressed in a game submenu of the category, the help topics for a corresponding menu appear.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The circular dart target <b>100</b> has a bull area <b>101</b> located in the center of the dart target and the circumferential area is divided into 20 areas in a circumferential direction to form fan shaped areas. The fan shaped areas include four areas in a radial direction, that is, a single line area <b>103</b>, a triple line area <b>104</b>, another single line area <b>105</b>, and a double line area <b>106</b> from the center. Of course, an outermost numbered area <b>107</b> allocated a plurality of numbers is defined as a foul line (out-of-bounds) area. Further, the bull area <b>101</b> includes a double bull area <b>101</b>-<b>1</b> and a single bull area <b>101</b>-<b>2</b>. Furthermore, the numbered area <b>107</b> has a number of &#x201c;20&#x201d; on the top of the numbered area and has numbers in an order of &#x201c;5&#x201d;, &#x201c;12&#x201d;, &#x201c;9&#x201d;, &#x201c;14&#x201d;, &#x201c;11&#x201d;, &#x201c;8&#x201d;, &#x201c;16&#x201d;, &#x201c;7&#x201d;, &#x201c;19&#x201d;, &#x201c;3&#x201d;, &#x201c;17&#x201d;, &#x201c;2&#x201d;, &#x201c;15&#x201d;, &#x201c;10&#x201d;, &#x201c;6&#x201d;, &#x201c;13&#x201d;, &#x201c;4&#x201d;, &#x201c;18&#x201d;, and &#x201c;1&#x201d; in a counterclockwise direction.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In calculating actual scores, for example, obtained scores are calculated as 20 points, 60 points, 20 points, 40 points, and 0, respectively when the darts hit the single line area <b>103</b>, the triple line area <b>104</b>, the other single line area <b>105</b>, the double line area <b>106</b>, and the foul line area <b>107</b> in the fan-like shaped area corresponding to the number &#x201c;20&#x201d;. Of course, the double bull area <b>101</b>-<b>1</b> and the single bull area <b>101</b>-<b>2</b> are fixed to 50 points and 25 points, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Further, when a player throws a dart at the dart target <b>100</b>, a signal is transferred to the controller <b>10</b> and scores are electronically calculated while the dart target is moved and the sensor <b>101</b> in the rear senses the dart target. The sensor <b>101</b> can play a role of transferring a signal from the target <b>100</b> to the controller <b>10</b> by using a general matrix sensor and play a role of recognizing that a player has thrown the dart by detecting fouls using a general vibration sensor when the dart hits other areas (foul areas) without hitting predetermined areas of the target <b>100</b>, but the present invention does not limit types of the sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the electronic dart game apparatus <b>1</b> according to the embodiment of the present invention further includes an RF-ID (Radio Frequency Identification) card reader <b>400</b> and a coin inserter <b>410</b> for allowing coins to be inserted, which are installed in the electronic dart game apparatus <b>1</b>. Here, an RF-ID card system uses a system, which can receive and transmit various data using a regular frequency band in a wireless method, and has recently been widely used for a pass card for collecting fees for a parking lot or subway. The RF-ID card reader <b>400</b> can act as an input unit by being brought into contact with the RF-ID card reader <b>400</b> and receive transmissions of a ranking, statistics, and a play result of a corresponding player through the memory <b>20</b> or the database of the server <b>3</b> when the RF-ID card is brought into contact with the RF-ID card reader <b>400</b>. That is, an authentication procedure to fetch information on each player from the database is performed through the RF-ID card reader, so that the ranking, the statistics, and the play result of the corresponding player may be transmitted. Of course, the ranking, the statistics, and the play result of the corresponding player may be stored in the RF-ID card itself in real time, but the present invention is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Through an access to a homepage (server) of a manufacturer of the electronic dart game apparatus <b>1</b> according to the embodiment of the present invention or an internet company related to the electronic dart game apparatus, an access to a member page may be performed by inputting a card number printed in the back of the card. Through the member page, an access to various data may be simply performed and it is possible to inquire about a ranking, search for clubs, find friends, join a club, send a message, and manage a league. That is, by simply bringing the RF-ID card into contact with the RF-ID card reader <b>400</b>, an access to the database of the server is automatically performed, and a game result and scores are recorded. Further, it is possible to identify whether a person (player) who is a member of the same club is accessing the server <b>3</b> through the internet communication network <b>2</b> by using a mobile terminal such as a cellular phone to currently play the game.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Furthermore, although not illustrated in the drawings, the electronic dart game apparatus <b>1</b> according to the embodiment of the present invention is equipped with a web camera or a digital camera to photograph a person playing the game in real time and display a game situation through the internet communication network in real time. Of course, it is possible to watch the person playing the game through a mobile phone in real time.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart for describing a method of participating in a competition using a dart game apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Once the dart game apparatus installed in a shop is started, a menu is displayed in the display unit within the dart game apparatus and an input is received from a player through the selector within the dart game apparatus, and thus a competition is selected from the menu in step S<b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Thereafter, lists of currently ongoing competitions are arranged in the dart game apparatus in step S<b>220</b>. A competition operator or a host holding the competition stores the lists of competitions in the database within the server and can read information on the lists to display it in the dart game apparatus connected with the server through the network.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A selection of one competition among the arranged lists of the competitions is input by a player through the selector in step S<b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The competition information stored in the server largely contains the date and time of the competition, the competition venue, eligible participants, and a competition entry fee.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Next, when a user selects a competition in which the user desires to participate among the arranged lists of competitions, the user determines whether the current date is prior to the competition's date in step S<b>242</b>. If it is past the competition's date (S<b>242</b>-N), a next step is not performed and a message stating &#x201c;The competition has already concluded&#x201d; is displayed. Similarly, if the competition has not yet started, it is processed in the same way. Of course, it is possible to set the participation applications to be submitted in advance or separately add a variable, which is an available date to participate in the competition, so that periods within which players can register and periods during which the actual competition is held are different.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Next, it is determined whether the position of the shop having the dart game apparatus to which a user currently provides an input is included in the competition venue in step S<b>244</b>. As described above, each of the dart game apparatuses has a registered inherent machine ID and a shop purchasing the dart game apparatus also has a registered separate ID and a password. Accordingly, the server can determine the position where a corresponding dart game apparatus is installed and thus also can determine whether the corresponding position where the dart game is installed is included in the competition venue. For example, if the place of the competition corresponds to all shops having the dart game apparatus within Seoul and the position where the dart game apparatus to which the player provides an input is installed is Incheon, a next step is not performed and a guide message is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Next, it is determined whether information on the player satisfies conditions for eligible participants in step S<b>246</b>. As described above, the database in the server stores personal information on each player, a dart game ranking, a game result and scores of the player in real time. Accordingly, it is possible to know a ranking of the player who desires to participate in the competition by receiving an input of an ID through the input unit within the dart game apparatus or receiving the input of the ID through a card having an inherent ID for each player by means of the card reader before the player submits an application for the competition participation. Therefore, if the competition in which the player desires to participate is available only for players having ranks higher than class A, a ranking of the player who desires to participate in the competition is inquired and then a next step is performed only when the conditions are satisfied. When the conditions are not satisfied, the next step is not performed and a guide message is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Of course, only lists of available competitions can be displayed in step S<b>220</b> after the date, the venue, and the player information are searched in advance without steps S<b>242</b>, S<b>244</b>, and S<b>246</b>. However, it is preferable to display all of the currently ongoing competitions from a business perspective.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">After steps S<b>242</b>, S<b>244</b>, and S<b>246</b>, when it is determined that the player can participate in the competition, the player selects a payment method for the entry fee and receives a guide for detailed contents of the competition in step S<b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In this event, the players should select one of the payment methods, which correspond to a method of subtracting reserved money, a method of paying with a mobile phone, a method of paying with a credit card, and a method of inserting cash, in order to enable the player to directly pay while in front of the dart game apparatus and it will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">When the player selects the payment method, a payment process suitable for the corresponding payment method is performed and the payment is processed in step S<b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">When the payment has been completed, the corresponding player is registered in the selected competition in step S<b>270</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">When the corresponding player is registered in the competition, the player can participate in the competition. For example, when the player goes to a shop included in the competition venue and interacts with the dart game apparatus within the competition periods, a competition participation menu is displayed. Through selecting the corresponding menu, the player can participate in the corresponding competition. The game played while the player participates in the competition is transmitted to the server and recorded as a competition record. The competition record can be used as a reference to select a winner of the competition or the finals (higher competition) from players participating in the competition.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Meanwhile, when the player is registered in the competition, ID card information of the user who desires to participate in the competition, an ID of the dart game apparatus touched by the card, an ID of a shop in which the dart game apparatus is installed, and authentication information of a mobile phone of the user may be registered together. Accordingly, when the user registered in the competition participates in a future competition, if the competition is available in any location, the user can participate in the competition as long as an authentication process through the ID card and the mobile phone of the user is passed.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As described above, it has been described that the registration is possible within the available registration period through checking of the competition period in the competition registration. Similarly, after registering in the competition, the user may have a limitation in participating in the competition since the user should play the game within the corresponding period. At this time, not only is the period limited but also the execution number is limited. That is, the user can participate in the competition only 10 times within the competition period.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">When the user can participate in the competition only using the apparatus touched by the user, an ID of the dart game apparatus registered in the competition and an ID of the dart game apparatus touched for the competition participation are compared. Similarly, when the competition is available only in the shop having the apparatus which the user touched, an ID of the shop registered in the competition and an ID of the shop having the apparatus touched for the competition participation are also compared.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Meanwhile, the server frequently records rankings of competition participants during the competition and transmits information on the rankings or records of the competition to a portable terminal of each player whenever the rankings of the competition participants are changed or at particular time points. Accordingly, it is possible to induce a player whose ranking is changed into a lower ranking to visit the shop and play the game by stimulating the players' strong desire to win. Of course, the player does not have to bring the card into contact with the card reader all the time as described above and can sometimes directly input information such as an inherent ID of the user by using the input unit of the dart game apparatus to participate in the competition.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Meanwhile, as described above, it is also possible to show a dynamic image of the game executed by the user other than the rankings or records of the competition. The dart game apparatus has a camera installed therein and the camera can record the dart game played by the user in the form of the dynamic image. The recorded dynamic image is stored in the server. When the dynamic image is stored in the server, an ID card number of the user, a user name, a shop name, an ID of the dart game apparatus are stored together with the dynamic image. The stored dynamic image is sent to the user through an e-mail. Alternatively, the stored dynamic image may be sent to a mobile phone of the user using an MMS.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart for describing an entry fee payment process according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As described above, the dart game apparatus according to the embodiment of the present invention provides a function of allowing the player to directly participate in the competition by using the dart game apparatus and accordingly the entry fee payment also should be directly conducted using the dart game apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">First, when the user selects the method of subtracting from the entry fee the reserved money as the payment method (S<b>310</b>-Y), it is determined whether the remaining reserved money of the player is larger than the entry fee in S<b>312</b>. The reserved money of the player may be stored in the database within the server of the competition operator or may be stored in a storage medium of a player card carried with the player. When the reserved money stored in a form of electric money is larger than the entry fee, the payment is processed through the method of subtracting from the competition entry fee the reserved money.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">When the user selects the method of paying the entry fee with the mobile phone (S<b>320</b>-Y), an authentication number is transmitted to the mobile phone of the player in step S<b>322</b>. As described above, since the server of the competition operator stores personal information on the player, the authentication number can be issued to the mobile phone number of the player. After the transmission of the authentication number, a display screen is displayed to input the authentication number and then the authentication number is input by the player through the selector in step S<b>324</b>. When the input authentication number corresponds to the transmitted authentication number (S<b>326</b>-Y), the payment is complemented and a next step is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">When the user selects the method of inserting cash (S<b>330</b>-Y), it is identified whether the player inserts cash into the dart game apparatus in step S<b>332</b>. The dart game apparatus has a coin inserter, which allows coins to be inserted, installed therein. The payment is performed by receiving the coins but it is preferable to further install a bill inserter for convenience. When the insertion of cash has been identified, the information is transmitted to the server. The competition entry fees are not incomes of the shop having the dart game apparatus but are incomes of the competition operator hosting the competition. The cash inserted into the dart game apparatus should be calculated at the predetermined date and time and accordingly the information should be transmitted to the server.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">When the user selects the method of paying the entry fee with a credit card as the payment method (S<b>340</b>-Y), credit card information is input by the player and the information is transmitted to a payment agency (PG) in step S<b>342</b>. As described above, since the dart game apparatus has the card reader, the dart game apparatus can read the information by bringing the card into contact with the corresponding card reader, and pre-storing the card information of the player in the server to use the pre-stored card information, or have the player input the card information through the selector.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Next, payment authentication information is received from the payment agency in step S<b>344</b>. When the authentication has been identified (S<b>346</b>-Y), the payment processing is complemented and a next step is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 9</figref> are examples of a menu screen displayed in the display unit of the dart game apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the player selects a competition menu after executing the dart game.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, lists of currently ongoing competitions are displayed and the player can select a competition in which the player desires to participate from the lists of competitions.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates information on the selected competition and the user selects a method of paying the competition entry fee from the information.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a screen in the case where the method of paying the entry fee with the mobile phone is selected and the screen is provided to input an authentication number transmitted to the mobile phone of the player.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">So far, the method of controlling the dart game apparatus, which allows the player to directly participate in the competition using the dart game apparatus connected to the network, and the system using the same according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention have been described.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Although an exemplary embodiment of the present invention has been described for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims.</p>
