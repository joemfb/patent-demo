In addition, the expected use of Clostridial toxins, such as, e.g., BoNTs and TeNT, in therapeutic and cosmetic treatments of humans and other mammals is anticipated to expand to an ever widening range of diseases and ailments that can benefit from the properties of these toxins.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Clostridial toxin therapies are successfully used for many indications. Generally, administration of a Clostridial toxin treatment is well tolerated. However, toxin administration in some applications can be challenging because of the larger doses required to achieve a beneficial effect. Larger doses can increase the likelihood that the toxin may move through the interstitial fluids and the circulatory systems, such as, e.g., the cardiovascular system and the lymphatic system, of the body, resulting in the undesirable dispersal of the toxin to areas not targeted for toxin treatment. Such dispersal can lead to undesirable side effects, such as, e.g., inhibition of neurotransmitter release in neurons not targeted for treatment or paralysis of a muscle not targeted for treatment. For example, a patient administered a therapeutically effective amount of a BoNT/A treatment into the neck muscles for torticollis may develop dysphagia because of dispersal of the toxin into the oropharynx. Thus, there remains a need for improved Clostridial toxins that are effective at the site of treatment, but have negligible to minimal effects in areas not targeted for a toxin treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The growing clinical, therapeutic and cosmetic use of Clostridial toxins in therapies requiring larger doses necessitates the pharmaceutical industry to develop modified Clostridial toxins that are effective at the target site of the application, but reduce or prevent the undesirable side-effects associated with the dispersal of the toxins to an unwanted location or locations. The present invention provides novel Clostridial toxins that reduce or prevent unwanted side-effects associated with toxin dispersal into non-targeted areas. These and related advantages are useful for various clinical, therapeutic and cosmetic applications, such as, e.g., the treatment of neuromuscular disorders, neuropathic disorders, eye disorders, pain, muscle injuries, headache, cardiovascular diseases, neuropsychiatric disorders, endocrine disorders, cancers, otic disorders and hyperkinetic facial lines, as well as, other disorders where a Clostridial toxin administration to a mammal can produce a beneficial effect.</p>

The release process can be described as comprising two steps: 1) vesicle docking, where the vesicle-bound SNARE protein of a vesicle containing neurotransmitter molecules associates with the membrane-bound SNARE proteins located at the plasma membrane; and 2) neurotransmitter release, where the vesicle fuses with the plasma membrane and the neurotransmitter molecules are exocytosed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows a schematic of the intoxication mechanism for tetanus and botulinum toxin activity in a central and peripheral neuron. This intoxication process can be described as comprising four steps: 1) receptor binding, where a Clostridial toxin binds to a Clostridial receptor system and initiates the intoxication process; 2) complex internalization, where after toxin binding, a vesicle containing the toxin/receptor system complex is endocytosed into the cell; 3) light chain translocation, where multiple events are thought to occur, including, e.g., changes in the internal pH of the vesicle, formation of a channel pore comprising the H<sub>N </sub>domain of the Clostridial toxin heavy chain, separation of the Clostridial toxin light chain from the heavy chain, and release of the active light chain and 4) enzymatic target modification, where the activate light chain of Clostridial toxin proteolytically cleaves its target SNARE substrate, such as, e.g., SNAP-25, VAMP or Syntaxin, thereby preventing vesicle docking and neurotransmitter release.</p>

<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention discloses modified Clostridial toxins that exhibit enhanced binding activity for cells targeted by naturally-occurring Clostridial toxins. Enhanced binding activity is achieved by replacing a naturally-occurring binding domain of a Clostridial toxin with a binding domain showing enhanced binding activity for a Clostridial toxin target cell. This enhanced binding activity for a target cell should allow lower effective doses of a modified Clostridial toxin to be administered to an individual because more toxin will be delivered to a target cell. Thus modified Clostridial toxins with enhanced binding activity will reduce the undesirable dispersal of the toxin to areas not targeted for treatment, thereby reducing or preventing the undesirable side-effects associated with diffusion of a Clostridial toxin to an unwanted location.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Aspects of the present invention provide modified Clostridial toxins comprising a Clostridial toxin enzymatic domain, a Clostridial toxin translocation domain and an enhanced targeting domain, wherein the modified Clostridial toxin exhibits an enhanced targeting activity for a Clostridial toxin target cell relative to a naturally-occurring Clostridial toxin. It is envisioned that the location of the enhanced targeting domain in the modified Clostridial toxins of the present specification can be located at the amino terminus of the toxin, between the enzymatic and translocation domains or at the carboxyl terminus of the toxin. Thus, a modified Clostridial toxins disclosed in the present specification can comprise an amino to carboxyl domain arrangement of, e.g., an enhanced targeting domain, a Clostridial toxin translocation domain and a Clostridial toxin enzymatic domain; an enhanced targeting domain, a Clostridial toxin enzymatic domain and a Clostridial toxin translocation domain; a Clostridial toxin enzymatic domain, an enhanced targeting domain and a Clostridial toxin translocation domain; a Clostridial toxin translocation domain, an enhanced targeting domain and a Clostridial toxin enzymatic domain; a Clostridial toxin enzymatic domain, a Clostridial toxin translocation domain and an enhanced targeting domain; and a Clostridial toxin translocation domain, a Clostridial toxin enzymatic domain and an enhanced targeting domain.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Other aspects of the present invention provide polynucleotide molecules encoding modified Clostridial toxins comprising a Clostridial toxin enzymatic domain, a Clostridial toxin translocation domain and an enhanced targeting domain, wherein the modified Clostridial toxin exhibits an enhanced targeting activity for a Clostridial toxin target cell relative to a naturally-occurring Clostridial toxin. It is envisioned that the location of the enhanced targeting domain of the modified Clostridial toxins encoded by polynucleotide molecules of the present specification can be located at the amino terminus of the toxin, between the enzymatic and translocation domains or at the carboxyl terminus of the toxin.

Other aspects of the present invention provide methods of producing a modified Clostridial toxin disclosed in the present specification, the method comprising the steps of introducing in a cell an expression construct comprising a polynucleotide molecule encoding a modified Clostridial toxin comprising a Clostridial toxin enzymatic domain, a Clostridial toxin translocation domain and an enhanced targeting domain, wherein the modified Clostridial toxin exhibits an enhanced targeting activity for a Clostridial toxin target cell relative to a naturally-occurring Clostridial toxin and expressing the expression construct in the cell.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Clostridia toxins produced by <i>Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium tetani, Clostridium baratii </i>and <i>Clostridium butyricum </i>are the most widely used in therapeutic and cosmetic treatments of humans and other mammals. Strains of <i>C. botulinum </i>produce seven antigenically-distinct types of Botulinum toxins (BoNTs), which have been identified by investigating botulism outbreaks in man (BoNT/A, /B, /E and /F), animals (BoNT/C1 and /D), or isolated from soil (BoNT/G). While all seven botulinum toxins (BoNT) serotypes have similar structure and pharmacological properties, each also displays heterogeneous bacteriological characteristics. In contrast, tetanus toxin (TeNT) is produced by a uniform group of <i>C. tetani</i>. Two other species of Clostridia, <i>C. baratii </i>and <i>C. butyricum</i>, also produce toxins similar to BoNT/F and BoNT/E, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Clostridia toxins possess approximately 35% amino acid identity with each other and share the same functional domain organization and overall structural architecture. Clostridial toxins are each translated as a single chain polypeptide of approximately 150 kDa that is subsequently cleaved by proteolytic scission within a disulfide loop by a naturally-occurring protease, such as, e.g., an endogenous Clostridial toxin protease or a naturally-occurring protease produced in the environment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). This posttranslational processing yields a di-chain molecule comprising an approximately 50 kDa light chain (LC) and an approximately 100 kDa heavy chain (HC) held together by a single disulfide bond and noncovalent interactions. Each mature di-chain molecule comprises three functionally distinct domains: 1) an enzymatic domain located in the LC that includes a metalloprotease region containing a zinc-dependent endopeptidase activity which specifically targets core components of the neurotransmitter release apparatus (Table 1); 2) a translocation domain contained within the amino-terminal half of the HC (H<sub>N</sub>) that facilitates release of the LC from intracellular vesicles into the cytoplasm of the target cell (Table 1); and 3) a binding domain found within the carboxyl-terminal half of the HC (H<sub>C</sub>) that determines the binding activity and binding specificity of the toxin to the receptor complex located at the surface of the target cell (Table 1).</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The binding, translocation and enzymatic activity of these three functional domains are all necessary for toxicity. While all details of this process are not yet precisely known, the overall cellular intoxication mechanism whereby Clostridial toxins enter a neuron and inhibit neurotransmitter release is similar, regardless of serotype or subtype. Although the applicants have no wish to be limited by the following description, the intoxication mechanism can be described as comprising at least four steps: 1) receptor binding, 2) complex internalization, 3) light chain translocation, and 4) enzymatic target modification (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The process is initiated when the H<sub>C </sub>domain of a Clostridial toxin binds to a toxin-specific receptor system located on the plasma membrane surface of a target cell. The binding specificity of a receptor complex is thought to be achieved, in part, by specific combinations of gangliosides and protein receptors that appear to distinctly comprise each Clostridial toxin receptor complex. Once bound, the toxin/receptor complexes are internalized by endocytosis and the internalized vesicles are sorted to specific intracellular routes. The translocation step appears to be triggered by the acidification of the vesicle compartment. This process seems to initiate two important pH-dependent structural rearrangements that increase hydrophobicity and promote formation di-chain form of the toxin. Once activated, light chain endopeptidase of the toxin is released from the intracellular vesicle into the cytosol where it appears to specifically targets one of three known core components of the neurotransmitter release apparatus. These core proteins, vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)/synaptobrevin, synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) and Syntaxin, are necessary for synaptic vesicle docking and fusion at the nerve terminal and constitute members of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-attachment protein-receptor (SNARE) family. BoNT/A and BoNT/E cleave SNAP-25 in the carboxyl-terminal region, releasing a nine or twenty-six amino acid segment, respectively, and BoNT/C1 also cleaves SNAP-25 near the carboxyl-terminus. The botulinum serotypes BoNT/B, BoNT/D, BoNT/F and BoNT/G, and tetanus toxin, act on the conserved central portion of VAMP, and release the amino-terminal portion of VAMP into the cytosol. BoNT/C1 cleaves syntaxin at a single site near the cytosolic membrane surface. The selective proteolysis of synaptic SNAREs accounts for the block of neurotransmitter release caused by Clostridial toxins in vivo. The SNARE protein targets of Clostridial toxins are common to exocytosis in a variety of non-neuronal types; in these cells, as in neurons, light chain peptidase activity inhibits exocytosis, see, e.g., Yann Humeau et al., <i>How Botulinum and Tetanus Neurotoxins Block Neurotransmitter Release, </i>82(5) Biochimie. 427-446 (2000); Kathryn Turton et al., <i>Botulinum and Tetanus Neurotoxins: Structure, Function and Therapeutic Utility, </i>27(11) Trends Biochem. Sci. 552-558. (2002); Giovanna Lalli et al., <i>The Journey of Tetanus and Botulinum Neurotoxins in Neurons, </i>11(9) Trends Microbiol. 431-437, (2003).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Aspects of the present invention provide, in part, a modified Clostridial toxin. As used herein, the term &#x201c;modified Clostridial toxin&#x201d; means any polypeptide that can execute the overall cellular mechanism whereby a Clostridial toxin enters a neuron and inhibits neurotransmitter release and encompasses the binding of a Clostridial toxin to a low or high affinity receptor complex, the internalization of the toxin, the translocation of the Clostridial toxin light chain into the cytoplasm and the enzymatic modification of a Clostridial toxin substrate. A modified Clostridial toxin disclosed in the present specification is distinguished from a naturally-occurring Clostridial toxin by the fact that a modified Clostridial toxin lacks the cell binding activity of a naturally-occurring binding domain found in a Clostridial toxin. Instead, a modified Clostridial toxin disclosed in the present specification comprises an enhanced targeting domain that determines the binding activity of the modified Clostridial toxin to an endogenous Clostridial toxin receptor system located at the surface of the target cell. By definition, a naturally-occurring Clostridial toxin lacks an enhanced targeting domain.</p>

Thus, a Clostridial toxin enzymatic domain specifically targets a Clostridial toxin substrate and encompasses the proteolytic cleavage of a Clostridial toxin substrate, such as, e.g., SNARE proteins like a SNAP-25 substrate, a VAMP substrate and a Syntaxin substrate.

Such Clostridial toxin light chain chimerics are described in, e.g., Lance E. Steward et al., Leucine-based Motif and Clostridial Toxins, U.S. Patent Publication 2003/0027752 (Feb. 6, 2003); Lance E.

The light chains of Clostridial toxins are approximately 420-460 amino acids in length and comprise an enzymatic domain (Table 1). Research has shown that the entire length of a Clostridial toxin light chain is not necessary for the enzymatic activity of the enzymatic domain. As a non-limiting example, the first eight amino acids of the BoNT/A light chain (residues 1-8 of SEQ ID NO: 1) are not required for enzymatic activity. As another non-limiting example, the first eight amino acids of the TeNT light chain (residues 1-8 of SEQ ID NO: 8) are not required for enzymatic activity. Likewise, the carboxyl-terminus of the light chain is not necessary for activity. As a non-limiting example, the last 32 amino acids of the BoNT/A light chain (residues 417-448 of SEQ ID NO: 1) are not required for enzymatic activity. As another non-limiting example, the last 31 amino acids of the TeNT light chain (residues 427-457 of SEQ ID NO: 8) are not required for enzymatic activity. Thus, aspects of this embodiment can include Clostridial toxin light chains comprising an enzymatic domain having a length of, e.g., at least 350 amino acids, at least 375 amino acids, at least 400 amino acids, at least 425 amino acids and at least 450 amino acids.

The H<sub>N </sub>regions from the heavy chains of Clostridial toxins are approximately 410-430 amino acids in length and comprise a translocation domain (Table 1). Research has shown that the entire length of a H<sub>N </sub>region from a Clostridial toxin heavy chain is not necessary for the translocating activity of the translocation domain. Thus, aspects of this embodiment can include Clostridial toxin H<sub>N </sub>regions comprising a translocation domain having a length of, e.g., at least 350 amino acids, at least 375 amino acids, at least 400 amino acids and at least 425 amino acids.

<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Aspects of the present invention provide, in part, an enhanced targeting domain. As used herein, the term &#x201c;enhanced targeting domain&#x201d; means any polypeptide that can selectively bind to an endogenous Clostridial toxin receptor system found on a Clostridial toxin target cell and initiate the overall internalization mechanism whereby a Clostridial toxin intoxicates a target cell with the proviso that an enhanced targeting domain is not a naturally-occurring binding domain from a naturally occurring Clostridial toxin. As used herein, the term &#x201c;selectively&#x201d; means having a highly preferred activity or effect. As used herein, the term &#x201c;selectively bind&#x201d; means a molecule is able to bind its target receptor system under physiological conditions, or in vitro conditions substantially approximating physiological conditions, to a statistically significantly greater degree relative to other, non-target receptor systems. Thus, with reference to an enhanced targeting domain of the present specification, there is a discriminatory binding of the enhanced targeting domain to an endogenous Clostridial toxin receptor system.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">An enhanced targeting domain disclosed in the present specification facilitates the binding activity of the modified Clostridial toxins disclosed in the present specification to an endogenous Clostridial toxin receptor system located at the surface of a Clostridial toxin target cell. As used herein, the term &#x201c;binding activity&#x201d; means that one molecule is directly or indirectly contacting another molecule via at least one intermolecular or intramolecular force, including, without limitation, a covalent bond, an ionic bond, a metallic bond, a hydrogen bond, a hydrophobic interaction, a van der Waals interaction, and the like, or any combination thereof. &#x201c;Bound&#x201d; and &#x201c;bind&#x201d; are considered terms for binding.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">As used herein, the term &#x201c;binding affinity&#x201d; means how strong a molecule's binding activity is for a particular receptor system. In general, high binding affinity results from greater intermolecular force between a binding domain and its receptor system while low binding affinity involves less intermolecular force between the ligand and its receptor. High binding affinity involves a longer residence time for the binding domain at its receptor binding site than is the case for low binding affinity. As such, a molecule with a high binding affinity means a lower concentration of that molecule is required to maximally occupy the binding sites of a receptor system and trigger a physiological response. Conversely, low binding affinity means a relatively high concentration of a molecule is required before the receptor binding sites of a receptor system is maximally occupied and the maximum physiological response is achieved. Thus, modified Clostridial toxins with increased binding activity due to high binding affinity will allow administration of reduced doses of the toxin, thereby reducing or preventing unwanted side-effects associated with toxin dispersal into non-targeted areas.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">As used herein, the term &#x201c;binding specificity&#x201d; means how specific a molecule's binding activity is one particular receptor system. In general, high binding specificity results in a more exclusive interaction with one particular receptor system or subgroup of receptor systems while low binding specificity results in a more promiscuous interaction with a larger group of receptor systems. As such, a molecule with a high binding specificity means that molecule will occupy the binding sites of a particular receptor system and trigger a physiological response. Conversely, low binding specificity means a molecule will occupy the binding sites of a many receptor systems and trigger a multitude of physiological responses. Thus, modified Clostridial toxins with increased binding activity due to high binding specificity will only target a subgroup of Clostridial toxin target cells, thereby reducing the side effects associated with the targeting of all Clostridial toxin target cells.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">It is envisioned that any and all enhanced targeting domains can be used to practice aspects of the present invention, including, without limitation, an enhanced targeting domain that increases binding affinity for an endogenous Clostridial toxin receptor system present on a naturally-occurring Clostridial toxin target cell; and an enhanced targeting domain that increases binding specificity for a subgroup of endogenous Clostridial toxin receptor systems present on a naturally-occurring Clostridial toxin target cell. As used herein, the term &#x201c;Clostridial toxin target cell&#x201d; means a cell that is a naturally occurring target cell for a naturally occurring Clostridial toxin, including, without limitation, motor neurons.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">An example of an enhanced targeting domain that increases binding activity for an endogenous Clostridial toxin receptor system present on a naturally-occurring Clostridial toxin target cell, includes, without limitation, a modified Clostridial toxin binding domain with enhanced binding activity, such as, e.g., a modified BoNT/A binding domain with enhanced binding activity, a modified BoNT/B binding domain with enhanced binding activity, a modified BoNT/C1 binding domain with enhanced binding activity, a modified BoNT/D binding domain with enhanced binding activity, a modified BoNT/E binding domain with enhanced binding activity, a modified BoNT/F binding domain with enhanced binding activity, a modified BoNT/G binding domain with enhanced binding activity and a modified TeNT binding domain with enhanced binding activity. Examples of a modified Clostridial toxin binding domain that increase binding activity include, e.g., a modified Clostridial toxin binding domain that increases binding affinity for an endogenous Clostridial toxin receptor system present on a naturally-occurring Clostridial toxin target cell and a modified Clostridial toxin binding domain that increases binding specificity for a subgroup of endogenous Clostridial toxin receptor systems present on a naturally-occurring Clostridial toxin target cell.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The three-dimensional crystal structures of BoNT/A, BoNT/B and the H<sub>C </sub>domain of TeNT indicate that the three functional domains of Clostridial neurotoxins are structurally distinct. The HEXXH consensus motif of the light chain forms the tetrahedral zinc binding pocket of the catalytic site located in a deep cleft on the protein surface that is accessible by a channel. The structure of the H<sub>N </sub>and H<sub>C </sub>domains consists primarily of &#x3b2;-sheet topologies that are linked by a single &#x3b1;-helix. The cylindrical-shaped H<sub>N </sub>domain comprises two long amphipathic &#x3b1;-helices that resemble the coiled-coil motif found in some viral proteins. The H<sub>N </sub>domain also forms a long unstructured loop called the &#x2018;translocation belt,&#x2019; which wraps around a large negatively charged cleft of the light chain that blocks access of the zinc atom to the catalytic-binding pocket of active site. The H<sub>C </sub>domain comprises two distinct structural features of roughly equal size that indicate function. The first, designated the H<sub>CN </sub>subdomain, is located in the amino half of the H<sub>C </sub>domain. The H<sub>CN </sub>subdomain forms a &#x3b2;-barrel, jelly-roll fold. The H<sub>CC </sub>subdomain is the second subdomain that comprises the H<sub>C </sub>domain. This carboxy-terminal subdomain comprises a modified &#x3b2;-trefoil domain which forms three distinct carbohydrate binding regions that resembles the carbohydrate binding moiety found in many sugar-binding proteins, such as, e.g., serum amyloid P, sialidase, cryia, insecticidal &#x3b1;-endotoxin and lectins. Biochemical studies indicate that the &#x3b2;-trefoil domain structure of the H<sub>CC </sub>subdomain appears to mediate the binding to specific carbohydrate containing components of the Clostridial toxin receptor system on the cell surface, see, e.g., Krzysztof Ginalski et al., <i>Structure</i>-<i>based Sequence Alignment for the Beta</i>-<i>Trefoil Subdomain of the Clostridial Neurotoxin Family Provides Residue Level Information About the Putative Ganglioside Binding Site, </i>482(1-2) FEBS Lett. 119-124 (2000). The H<sub>C </sub>domain tilts away from the H<sub>N </sub>domain exposing the surface loops and making them accessible for binding. No contacts occur between the light chain and the H<sub>C </sub>domain.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Proteins containing the structural &#x3b2;-trefoil domain represents a diverse group of proteins, see, e.g., C. A. Orengo et al., <i>Protein Superfamilies and Domain Superfolds, </i>372 Nature 631-634 (1994). The &#x3b2;-trefoil domain comprises a six-stranded &#x3b2;-barrel closed off at one end by three &#x3b2;-hairpin structures that exhibits a characteristic pseudo-threefold axis symmetry. The monomeric structural unit of this three-fold symmetry is referred to as the &#x3b2;-trefoil fold that contains four &#x3b2;-sheets organized as a pair of antiparallel &#x3b2;-sheets. Dividing each of these &#x3b2;-trefoil folds is a &#x3b2;-hairpin turn. Therefore, in a linear fashion, a &#x3b2;-trefoil domain comprises four &#x3b2;-sheets of the first &#x3b2;-trefoil fold (&#x3b1;-fold), a &#x3b2;-hairpin turn, four &#x3b2;-sheets of the second &#x3b2;-trefoil fold (&#x3b2;-fold), a second &#x3b2;-hairpin turn four &#x3b2;-sheets of the third &#x3b2;-trefoil fold (&#x3b3;-fold) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Because the first hairpin turn is located between the fourth and fifth &#x3b2;-sheets of the &#x3b2;-trefoil domain, it is designated the &#x3b2;4/&#x3b2;5 &#x3b2;-hairpin turn. Likewise, since the second hairpin turn is located between the eight and ninth &#x3b2;-sheets of the &#x3b2;-trefoil domain, it is designated the &#x3b2;8/&#x3b2;9 &#x3b2;-hairpin turn.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Continuing research has elucidated that &#x3b2;4/&#x3b2;5 and &#x3b2;8/&#x3b2;9 &#x3b2;-hairpin turns are important in conferring the proper pseudo-threefold axis symmetry observed in the &#x3b2;-trefoil domain. Additionally, this work has demonstrated that amino acid changes in these two &#x3b2;-hairpin turns can increase the stability of the &#x3b2;-trefoil domain, which in turn results in increased binding activity, see, e.g., Stephen R. Brych et al., <i>Structure and Stability Effects of Mutations Designed to Increase the Primary Sequence Symmetry Within the Core Region of a &#x3b2;</i>-<i>trefoil, </i>10 Protein Sci. 2587-2599 (2001); Jaewon Kim et al., <i>Alternative Type I and I' Turn Conformations in the &#x3b2;</i>8/&#x3b2;9 &#x3b2;-<i>hairpin of Human Acidic Fibroblast Growth Factor, </i>11 Protein Sci. 459-466 (2002); Jaewon Kim et al., <i>Sequence swapping Does Not Result in Conformation Swapping for the &#x3b2;</i>4/&#x3b2;5 <i>and &#x3b2;</i>8/&#x3b2;9 &#x3b2;-<i>hairpin Turns in Human Acidic Fibroblast Growth Factor, </i>14 Protein Sci. 351-359 (2005). As a non-limiting example, replacement of an amino acid comprising either the &#x3b2;4/&#x3b2;5 hairpin turn or &#x3b2;8/&#x3b2;9 &#x3b2;-hairpin turn with a glycine results in increased stabilization of the &#x3b2;-trefoil domain. Therefore, replacement of amino acids located in the &#x3b2;4/&#x3b2;5 and &#x3b2;8/&#x3b2;9 &#x3b2;-hairpin turns of the &#x3b2;-trefoil domains present in the binding domain of Clostridial toxins will increase binding activity of such a modified Clostridial toxin by increasing the structural stability of the &#x3b2;-trefoil domain. The amino acid sequences comprising the &#x3b2;-trefoil domains found in various Clostridial toxins are shown in Table 2.</p>

<p id="p-0124" num="0123">As is typical for proteins containing a &#x3b2;-trefoil fold, the overall amino acid sequence identity of the H<sub>CC </sub>subdomain between Clostridial toxins is low. However, key residues essential for binding activity have been identified by structural analysis and mutagenesis experiments, see, e.g., Krzysztof Ginalski et al., <i>Structure</i>-<i>based Sequence Alignment for the Beta</i>-<i>Trefoil Subdomain of the Clostridial Neurotoxin Family Provides Residue Level Information About the Putative Ganglioside Binding Site, </i>482(1-2) FEBS Lett. 119-124 (2000). For example, analysis of the H<sub>CC </sub>subdomain structure by crystallography identified five highly conserved residues critical for forming a shallow surface pocket of a carbohydrate binding moiety. These polar residues make hydrogen bonds with the carbohydrate ring. In BoNT/A these five polar residues are Glu 1203, Phe 1252, Ser 1264, Tyr 1267 and Gly 1279, while in TeNT, these residues are Asp 1222, Thr 1270, Ser 1287, Tyr 1290 and Gly 1300. Additionally, tyrosine residues forming the hydrophilic wall of this pocket were also important (Trp 1266 of BoNT/A and Trp 1289 of TeNT) and tryptophan fluorescence quenching experiments indicated that Trp 1266 of BoNT/A bound carbohydrate molecules. In another studies, photoaffinity labeling experiments revealed that Gln 1270 of BoNT/A and His 1293 of TeNT were also involved in binding carbohydrate molecules. Mutagenesis experiments designed to assay loss-of-function binding activity mutations confirmed the importance of many of the residues described above for BoNT/A and TeNT and extended this analysis to BoNT/B (Glu 1190, His 1241, Typ 1262, Tyr 1263), see, e.g., Andreas Rummel et al., <i>The H</i><sub>CC</sub>-<i>Domain of Botulinum Neurotoxins A and B Exhibits a Singular Ganglioside Binding Site Displaying Serotype Specific Carbohydrate Interaction, </i>51(3) Mol. Microbiol. 631-643 (2004).</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">As used herein, the term &#x201c;Clostridial toxin binding domain&#x201d; is synonomous with &#x201c;Clostridial toxin H<sub>C </sub>region&#x201d; and means any naturally occurring Clostridial toxin polypeptide that can execute the cell binding step of the intoxication process, including, e.g., the binding of the Clostridial toxin to a toxin-specific receptor system located on the plasma membrane surface of a target cell. As used herein, the term &#x201c;modified Clostridial toxin binding domain&#x201d; is synonomous with &#x201c;modified Clostridial toxin H<sub>C </sub>region&#x201d; and means a naturally occurring Clostridial toxin binding domain modified to enhance its cell binding activity for an endogenous Clostridial toxin receptor system, such as, e.g., a binding affinity or a binding specificity, to a statistically significantly degree relative to the unmodified naturally occurring Clostridial toxin binding domain from which the modified Clostridial toxin binding domain was derived. By definition, a modified Clostridial toxin binding domain has at least one amino acid change from the corresponding region of the disclosed reference sequences (see Table 1) and can be described in percent identity to the corresponding region of that reference sequence.

<p id="p-0127" num="0126">It is also envisioned that any of a variety of modified Clostridial toxin H<sub>C </sub>region fragments comprising a binding domain with enhanced binding activity can be useful in aspects of the present invention with the proviso that these active fragments can provide enhanced binding activity of the toxin to the receptor system located at the surface of the target cell. The H<sub>C </sub>regions from the heavy chains of Clostridial toxins are approximately 400-440 amino acids in length and comprise a binding domain (Table 1). Research has shown that the entire length of a H<sub>C </sub>region from a Clostridial toxin heavy chain is not necessary for the binding activity of the binding domain. Thus, aspects of this embodiment can include Clostridial toxin H<sub>C </sub>regions comprising a binding domain having a length of, e.g., at least 350 amino acids, at least 375 amino acids, at least 400 amino acids and at least 425 amino acids. Other aspects of this embodiment can include Clostridial toxin H<sub>C </sub>regions comprising a binding domain having a length of, e.g., at most 350 amino acids, at most 375 amino acids, at most 400 amino acids and at most 425 amino acids.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Any of a variety of sequence alignment methods can be used to determine percent identity of a modified Clostridial toxin H<sub>C </sub>region relative to a naturally-occurring Clostridial toxin H<sub>C </sub>region, including, without limitation, global methods, local methods and hybrid methods, such as, e.g., segment approach methods. Protocols to determine percent identity are routine procedures within the scope of one skilled in the art and from the teaching herein.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">One general approach well known to one skilled in the art on how to modify a Clostridial toxin binding domain in order to increase its binding activity for a naturally-occurring Clostridial toxin receptor system present on a naturally-occurring Clostridial toxin target cell involves changing specifically-identified amino acids. As described above, amino acids essential to binding activity have been identified and methods useful for determining which amino acid substitutions will enhance binding activity are known to one skilled in the art. For example, recent advances in computational protein design algorithims have markedly improved capabilities for generating novel proteins with optimized properties, including, enhanced stability, altered substrate specificity, improved binding affinity and optimized pharmacokinetics, see, e.g., Tanja Kortemme et al., Computational redesign of protein-protein interaction specificity, 11(4) Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 371-379 (2004); Tanja Kortemme and David Baker, Computational design of protein-protein interactions, 8(1) Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 91-97 (2004); Motomu Shimaoka et al., Computational design of an integrin I domain stabilized in the open high affinity conformation; 7(8) Nat. Struct. Biol. 674-678 (2000); Lo&#xef;c Martin et al., <i>Rational Design of a CD</i>4 <i>Mimic that Inhibits HIV</i>-1 <i>Entry and Exposes Cryptic Neutralization Epitopes, </i>21(1) Nat.

<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In addition, methods capable of altering an amino acid present in a Clostridial toxin binding domain, include, without limitation, site-directed mutagenesis, oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and site-specific mutagenesis. Non-limiting examples of specific mutagenesis protocols for making mutations in a Clostridial toxin are described in, e.g., Mutagenesis, pp. 13.1-13.105 (Sambrook and Russell, eds., Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual, Vol. 3, 3<sup>rd </sup>ed. 2001). In addition, non-limiting examples of well-characterized mutagenesis protocols available from commercial vendors include, without limitation, Altered Sites&#xae; II in vitro Mutagenesis Systems (Promega Corp., Madison, Wis.); Erase-a-Base&#xae; System (Promega, Madison, Wis.); GeneTailor&#x2122; Site-Directed Mutagenesis System (Invitrogen, Inc., Carlsbad, Calif.); QuikChange&#xae; II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kits (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.); and Transformer&#x2122; Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (BD-Clontech, Mountain View, Calif.).</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Lastly, methods to test the binding activity of modified Clostridial toxins comprising a modified Clostridial toxin binding domain with enhanced binding activity are also well known to one skilled in the art, see, e.g., Lutea A. A. de Jong et al., <i>Receptor</i>-<i>Binding Assays: Technologies and Applications, </i>829 J. Chromatogr. B 1-25 (2005). It is envisioned that heterogeneous assay types, homogeneous assay types and non-separating homogeneous assay types can be used to determine the binding activity of a modified Clostridial toxin with enhanced binding activity disclosed in the present specification. In a heterogeneous assay, the free ligand is separated from the bound ligand by, e.g., filtration, centrifugation or dialysis, before measurement of the binding activity. In a homogeneous assay, no separation of the free ligand from the bound ligand is required before measurement of the binding activity. In non-separating homogeneous assays, either the ligand or the receptor is immobilized on a solid phase support, in addition to the no separation aspect of all homogeneous assay. Non-limiting examples of heterogeneous, homogeneous and non-separating homogeneous assays include, e.g., radioactive heterogeneous assays, such as, e.g., filtration assays using radioactive energy transfer, SPA/flash plate assays using radioactive energy transfer; and non-radioactive heterogeneous assays, such as, e.g., filtration assays using fluorescence, FRET assays using fluorescence energy transfer, FP assays using light polarization, single-cell FMAT assays and flow cytometry. In addition, non-limiting examples of well-characterized receptor binding protocols available from commercial vendors include, without limitation, Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescense-based receptor binding assays (HTRF&#xae;; Cisbio International, Bedford, Mass.); DELFIA&#xae;-based receptor binding assays (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Boston, Mass.); and AlphaScreen&#x2122;-based receptor binding assays (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Boston, Mass.).</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">It is further envisioned that the binding activity of a modified Clostridial toxin with enhanced binding activity disclosed in the present specification can be determined by affinity chromotography using immobilized receptors and interfacial optical assays, such as, e.g., total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Non-limiting examples of these assays include, e.g., FCS using diffusion mediated intensity fluctuations, SPR using a mass-dependent refractive index, TIRF using a mass-independent refractive index, microarrays using optical intensity changes and QAC using retention volume.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">As another general approach well known to one skilled in the art on how to modify a Clostridial toxin binding domain in order to increase its binding activity for a naturally-occurring Clostridial toxin receptor system present on a naturally-occurring Clostridial toxin target cell involves directed-evolution methods, see, e.g., Andre Koltermann et al., Process for Generating Sequence-Specific Proteases by Directed Evolution and Uses Thereof, U.S. Patent Publication 2004/0072276 (Apr. 15, 2004); Lance E. Steward and Kei Roger Aoki, Evolved Clostridial Toxins with Altered Protease Activity, U.S. Patent Publication 2004/0115727 (Jun. 17, 2004); and L Yuan et al., Laboratory-directed protein evolution, 69(3) Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 373-392 (2005).</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Often the first step of directed evolution is error-prone PCR amplification of the gene of interest or gene recombination when a family of related genes is available. In this case, the gene corresponding to full-length Clostridial toxin or the H<sub>C </sub>binding domain alone would be amplified under conditions that yield one to three amino acid substitutions per molecule. The protein would then be expressed and screened for the desired activity (i.e., receptor binding and/or enhanced activity). Any constructs with even a nominal improvement in receptor binding, regardless of the magnitude of the change, would be submitted for additional rounds of evolution. As a result of the random mutagenesis studies, any amino acids displaying improved binding or even dramatically reduced binding could then be submitted to saturation mutagenesis. This is a process in which the codon of interest it completely randomized so that different constructs containing each of the 20 amino acids substituted at the site of interest are generated.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">For improvement of receptor binding characteristics, several different screening approaches could be utilized. If the receptor is known the soluble portion of the receptor can be expressed recombinantly for use in SPR binding assays. For example, the soluble portion of the receptor can be expressed as a fusion to streptavidin, polyhistidine tag, etc. and the receptor can then be immobilized on an appropriate sensor chip. Utilizing a SPR instrument, changes in local refractive index as a result of receptor binding are measured as a change in the SPR angle. The rates of change in the SPR angle can then be analyzed to determine association and dissociation phases and therefore equilibrium constants. This type of assay could be measured either with the full-length Clostridial toxin or the H<sub>C </sub>domain. Additionally, binding type assays relying on affinity pull-down experiments with affinity tagged receptors acting as a &#x201c;bait molecule&#x201d; could be used. The modified Clostridial toxin or H<sub>C </sub>domains could then be labeled with radioisotopes for analysis of the amount of target protein associated with the bait. Alternatively, radiolabeled ligands can be competed with Clostridial toxin or Hc domain variants that are not labeled.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">If the receptor is not known, variants of full-length Clostridial toxins can be screened using cells that are known to be sensitive to treatment with native the Clostridial toxin. In this case there are several potential readouts for improved receptor binding, including the presence of the Clostridial toxin in the cell, measurement of cleaved SNARE protein by, e.g., Western blot or cell-based FRET activity assay, or inhibition of exocytosis, e.g., a neurotransmitter release assay.</p>

<p id="p-0242" num="0241">Another example of an enhanced targeting domain that increases binding activity for an endogenous Clostridial toxin receptor system present on a naturally-occurring Clostridial toxin target cell, includes, without limitation, non-toxin associated proteins of Clostridial toxins, such as, e.g., non-toxic non-hemagglutinin (NTNH), hemagglutinin-17 (HA-17), hemagglutinin-33 (HA-33) and hemagglutinin-70 (HA-70). In vivo, Clostridial bacteria produce a toxin complex comprising the approximately 150-kDa Clostridial toxin and other proteins collectively called nontoxin associated proteins (NAPs). Identified NAPs include proteins possessing hemaglutination activity, such, e.g., a hemagglutinin of approximately 17-kDa (HA-17), a hemagglutinin of approximately 33-kDa (HA-33) and a hemagglutinin of approximately 70-kDa (HA-70); as well as non-toxic non-hemagglutinin (NTNH), a protein of approximately 130-kDa, see, e.g., Eric A. Johnson and Marite Bradshaw, <i>Clostridial botulinum and its Neurotoxins: A Metabolic and Cellular Perspective, </i>39 Toxicon 1703-1722 (2001); and Stephanie Raffestin et al., <i>Organization and Regulation of the Neurotoxin Genes in Clostridium botulinum and Clostridium tetani, </i>10 Anaerobe 93-100 (2004). The toxin complex is important for the intoxication process because it provides protection from adverse environmental conditions, resistance to protease digestion, and appears to facilitate internalization and activation of the toxin.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">Recent crystallography experiments have revealed that HA-17, HA-33 and NTNH from various Clostridial bacteria contain a region comprising &#x3b2;-trefoil domains very similar to the single &#x3b2;-trefoil domain present in the binding domain of Clostridial toxins, see, e.g., Kaoru Inoue et al., <i>Structural Analysis by X</i>-<i>Ray Crystallography and calorimtry of a Haemagglutinin Component </i>(<i>HA</i>1) <i>of the Progenitor Toxin from Clostridium botulinum, </i>149 Microbiol. 3361-3370 (2003); and Joseph W. Arndt et al., <i>The Structure of the Neurotoxin</i>-<i>Associated Protein HA</i>33<i>/A from Clostridial botulinum Suggests a Reoccurring &#x3b2;</i>-<i>trefoil Fold in the Progenitor Toxin Complex, </i>346 J. Mol. Biol. 1083-1093 (2005). For example, HA-33 from <i>Clostridium botulinum </i>serotype A has two &#x3b2;-trefoil domains, each of which consists of three potential carbohydrate binding moieties or &#x3b2;-trefoil folds, designated 1&#x3b1; (amino acids 10-55 of SEQ ID NO: 9), 1&#x3b2; (amino acids 56-102 of SEQ ID NO: 9) and 1&#x3b3; (amino acids 103-144 of SEQ ID NO: 9) for the first &#x3b2;-trefoil domain and 2&#x3b1; (amino acids 151-197 of SEQ ID NO: 9), 2&#x3b2; (amino acids 198-245 of SEQ ID NO: 9) and 2&#x3b3; (amino acids 246-293 of SEQ ID NO: 9) for the second &#x3b2;-trefoil domain. Mutations in conserved amino acids of the carbohydrate binding moiety result in a loss of carbohydrate binding, see, e.g., Kaoru Inoue et al., <i>Structural Analysis by X</i>-<i>Ray Crystallography and calorimetry of a Haemagglutinin Component </i>(<i>HA</i>1) <i>of the Progenitor Toxin from Clostridium botulinum, </i>149 Microbiol. 3361-3370 (2003).</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">These &#x3b2;-trefoil domains are also found in the HA-33 proteins produced by <i>Clostridium botulinum </i>serotype B, serotype C1 and serotype D and sequence alignments revealed that amino acids essential for overall carbohydrate binding are conserved. The amino acids predicted to be essential for carbohydrate binding are as follows Asp 263, Tyr 265, Gln 268, Gln 276, Phe 278 and Gln 286 of HA-33/A1 of SEQ ID NO: 9, HA-33/A2 of SEQ ID NO: 10, HA-33/A3 of SEQ ID NO: 11, HA-33/A5 of SEQ ID NO: 12 and HA-33/B2 of SEQ ID NO: 15; Asp 264, Tyr 266, Gln 269, Gln 277, Phe 279 and Gln 287 of HA-33/A4 of SEQ ID NO: 12; Asp 262, Tyr 264, Gln 267, Gln 275, Phe 277 and Gln 285 of HA-33/B1 of SEQ ID NO: 14; Asp 255, Val 257, Gly 260, Gln 268, Typ 270 and Gln 278 of HA-33/C1 of SEQ ID NO: 16; and Asp 256, Tyr 258, Gln 261, Ise 269, Asp 271 and Gln 279 of HA-33/C2 of SEQ ID NO: 17 and HA-33/D of SEQ ID NO: 18. Immunoaffinity column chromatography and pull-down assays have shown that HA-33 can bind synaptotagmin II, a putative Clostridial toxin receptor, see, e.g., Yu Zhou et al., <i>Haemagglutinin</i>-33 <i>of Type Q Botulinum Neurotoxin Complex Binds with Synaptotagmin II, </i>272 FEBS Lett. 2717-2726 (2005). The amino acid sequences comprising the &#x3b2;-trefoil domains found in various Clostridial HA-33 proteins are shown in Tables 3 and 4.</p>

<p id="p-0247" num="0246">Further analysis of the &#x3b2;-trefoil domain sequence of HA-33 also identified &#x3b2;-trefoil domains in HA-17 and NTNH, see, e.g., Joseph W.

Mol. Biol. 1083-1093 (2005). The HA-17 comprises a single &#x3b2;-trefoil domain containing three carbohydrate binding moieties or &#x3b2;-trefoil folds. The carbohydrate binding moieties of HA-17 exhibits the greatest sequence similarity with the 2&#x3b3; carbohydrate binding moiety of HA-33. These &#x3b2;-trefoil domains are also found in the HA-17 proteins produced by <i>Clostridium botulinum </i>serotype B, serotype C1 and serotype D and sequence alignments revealed that amino acids essential for overall carbohydrate binding are conserved. The amino acids predicted to be essential for carbohydrate binding are as follows Tyr 110, Typ 112, Tyr 115, Pro 130, Phe 132 and Asn 138 of HA-17/A of SEQ ID NO: 19, HA-17/B of SEQ ID NO: 20, HA-17/C1 of SEQ ID NO: 21 and HA-17/D of SEQ ID NO: 22.

<p id="p-0249" num="0248">NTNH from various Clostridial bacteria shows significant sequence similarity to the &#x3b2;-trefoil domains present in the cell binding domain of BoNT/A and TeNT. The high degree of structural similarity is interesting in light of the low sequence similarity between NTNH and the Clostridial toxins. Furthermore, since NTNH of the various serotypes have greater sequence similarity than the Clostridial toxins, it is likely that the NTNH produced by other Clostridial strains will also have &#x3b2;-trefoil domains exhibiting high structural similarity with the binding domains of Clostridial toxins. The &#x3b2;-trefoil domains of various Clostridial NTNHs are as follows: amino acids 1050-1193 of NTNH/A1 of SEQ ID NO: 23; amino acids 1050-1198 of NTNH/A2 of SEQ ID NO: 24; amino acids 1050-1193 of NTNH/A3 of SEQ ID NO: 25; amino acids 1049-1197 of NTNH/B of SEQ ID NO: 26; amino acids 1049-1196 of NTNH/C1 of SEQ ID NO: 27; amino acids 1049-1196 of NTNH/D of SEQ ID NO: 28; amino acids 1014-1162 of NTNH/E of SEQ ID NO: 29; amino acids 1016-1159 of NTNH/F1 of SEQ ID NO: 30; amino acids 1017-1165 of NTNH/F2 of SEQ ID NO: 31; and amino acids 1050-1198 of NTNH/G of SEQ ID NO: 32. The amino acid sequences comprising the &#x3b2;-trefoil domains found in various Clostridial NTNH proteins are shown in Table 6.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">The &#x3b2;-trefoil domains present in the Clostridial toxin, HA-33, HA-17 and NTNH collectively form nearly half the mass of a Clostridial toxin complex and underlies the apparent importance of carbohydrate binding in the cell binding step of the intoxication process. This observation is further enhanced by the fact that a Clostridial toxin alone is not as effective in intoxicating a cell as the entire toxin complex. One potential explanation for this enhanced binding activity is the presence, both in type and in quantity, of the &#x3b2;-trefoil domains present in HA-33, HA-17 and NTNH. Therefore, the high prediction of structural similarity of the &#x3b2;-trefoil domains present in HA-33, HA-17 and NTNH relative to the &#x3b2;-trefoil domain found in Clostridial toxins provides a potential source of binding domains useful for developing modified Clostridial toxins with enhanced binding activity. As a non-limiting example, a carbohydrate binding moiety or a &#x3b2;-trefoil fold from HA-33, HA-17 or NTNH can be substituted for the naturally occurring carbohydrate binding moiety present in a Clostridial toxin. As another non-limiting example, a carbohydrate binding moiety or a &#x3b2;-trefoil fold from HA-33, HA-17 or NTNH can be added in addition to the naturally occurring carbohydrate binding moiety present in a Clostridial toxin. As yet another non-limiting example, a multiple carbohydrate binding moieties or a &#x3b2;-trefoil folds from HA-33, HA-17 or NTNH can be substituted for the naturally occurring carbohydrate binding moiety present in a Clostridial toxin. As still another non-limiting example, multiple carbohydrate binding moieties or a &#x3b2;-trefoil folds from HA-33, HA-17 or NTNH can be added in addition to the naturally occurring carbohydrate binding moiety present in a Clostridial toxin. As another non-limiting example, multiple carbohydrate binding moieties or a &#x3b2;-trefoil folds from a Clostridial toxin binding domain can be added in addition to the naturally occurring carbohydrate binding moiety present in a Clostridial toxin.</p>

<p id="p-0252" num="0251">As used herein, the term &#x201c;Non-toxin Associated Protein&#x201d; is synonymous with &#x201c;NAP&#x201d; and means a Clostridial NAP with selective binding activity, such as, e.g., a binding affinity or a binding specificity, for an endogenous Clostridial toxin receptor system. It is envisioned that both naturally occurring NAPs as well as NAPs with enhanced binding activity can be used to practice aspects of the present invention. As used herein, the term &#x201c;NAP with enhanced binding activity&#x201d; means a Clostridial NAP with enhanced binding activity for an endogenous Clostridial toxin receptor system, such as, e.g., a binding affinity or a binding specificity, to a statistically significantly degree relative to an unmodified naturally occurring Clostridial toxin binding domain from a Clostridial toxin. By definition, a NAP with enhanced binding activity has at least one amino acid change from the corresponding region of the disclosed reference sequences (see Table 3-6) and can be described in percent identity to the corresponding region of that reference sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">Any of a variety of sequence alignment methods can be used to determine percent identity of a modified Clostridial NAP relative to a naturally-occurring Clostridial NAP, including, without limitation, global methods, local methods and hybrid methods, such as, e.g., segment approach methods. Protocols to determine percent identity are routine procedures within the scope of one skilled in the art and from the teaching herein.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">Approaches well known to one skilled in the art on how to modify a Clostridial NAP in order to increase its binding activity for an endogenous Clostridial toxin receptor system present on a naturally-occurring Clostridial toxin target cell. As described above, one approach involves identifying amino acids using computational protein design algorithims; changing specifically-identified amino acids using, without limitation, site-directed mutagenesis, oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and site-specific mutagenesis; and testing the binding activity of modified Clostridial toxins comprising a modified Clostridial NAP with enhanced binding activity using, e.g., heterogeneous assays, homogeneous assays and non-separating homogeneous assays. It is further envisioned that the binding activity of a modified Clostridial toxin with enhanced binding activity disclosed in the present specification can be determined by affinity chromotography using immobilized receptors and interfacial optical assays. In another approach described above, a binding activity of a modified Clostridial NAP for a naturally-occurring Clostridial toxin receptor system present on a naturally-occurring Clostridial toxin target cell can be achieved using directed-evolution methods.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">A Clostridial NAP includes, without limitation, naturally occurring Clostridial NAP variants, such as, e.g., Clostridial NAP isoforms and Clostridial NAP subtypes; non-naturally occurring Clostridial NAP variants, such as, e.g., conservative Clostridial NAP variants, non-conservative Clostridial NAP variants, Clostridial NAP chimerics, active Clostridial NAP fragments thereof, or any combination thereof.</p>

As another example, there are presently three Clostridial botulinum serotype A NTNH-33 variants, NTNH/A1, NTNH/A2 and NTNH/A3 (Table 6), with specific NTNH variant showing various degrees of amino acid divergence when compared to another NTNH variant.

<p id="p-0511" num="0510">Another example of an enhanced targeting domain that increases binding activity for an endogenous Clostridial toxin receptor system present on a naturally-occurring Clostridial toxin target cell, includes, without limitation, ligands that bind the same receptor systems as naturally-occurring Clostridial toxins. Recent studies are revealing components of the endogenous receptor systems used by a Clostridial toxin during the intoxication process. As a non-limiting example, fibroblast growth factor 3 receptor (FGFR3) serves as a BoNT/A receptor, see, e.g., Ester Fernandez-Salas et al., Botulinum Toxin Screening Assays, PCT Patent Application No. 2005/006421 (Sep. 9, 2005). As another non-limiting example, synaptotagmin I serves as a BoNT/B receptor and as a BoNT/G receptor, see, e.g., Min Dong et al., <i>Synaptotagmins I and II mediate entry of botulinum neurotoxin B into cells, </i>162(7) J. Cell Biol. 1293-1303 (2003); and Andreas Rummel et al., <i>Synaptotagmins I and II act as nerve cell receptors for botulinum neurotoxin G, </i>279(29) J. Biol. Chem. 30865-30870 (2004). As yet another non-limiting example, synaptotagmin II serves as a BoNT/B receptor and as a BoNT/G receptor, see, e.g., Min Dong et al., supra, (2003); and Andreas Rummel et al., supra, (2004). The selection of a ligand domain as an enhanced binding region will depend on the Clostridial toxin being modified. As non-limiting examples, ligands that selectively bind to a FGFR3 could be used as an enhanced targeting domain for a modified BoNT/A, whereas ligands that selectively bind a Synaptotagmin I or Synaptotagmin II could be used as an enhanced targeting domain for a modified BoNT/B or a modified BoNT/G.</p>
<p id="p-0512" num="0511">Fibroblast growth factors (FGF) participate in many developmental, differentiation and growth and repair processes of cells through complex combinatorial signaling pathways. Presently, at least 23 ligands (FGF1-23) are known to signal through a family of five transmembrane tyrosine kinase FGF receptors (FGFR1-5). Affinity of FGFRs for their ligands is highly diverse with different affinities for each family member of growth factors, see, e.g., C. J. Powers et al., <i>Fibroblast growth factors, their receptors and signaling, </i>7(3) Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 165-197 (2000). This diversity is achieved in part by the generation of alternatively spliced variants encoding distinct receptor isoforms, see, e.g., Bernhard Reuss &#x26; Oliver von Bohlen and Halbach, <i>Fibroblast growth factors and their receptors in the central nervous system, </i>313(2) Cell Tissue Res. 139-157 (2003). The protein region that appears to have the highest influence on ligand binding selectivity is a portion of the IgIII domain, for which isoforms encoded by three different splice variants have been identified. These three isoforms, designated IgIIIa, IgIIIb and IgIIIc, have relative binding affinities for different FGFR family members. Alternative splicing in the FGFR ligand binding domain, designated a and b, generates additional receptor isoforms with novel ligand affinities. Isoforms for IgIIIa, IgIIIb and IgIIIc have been identified for both FGFR1 and FGFR2. Thus far, the IgIIIa isoform of FGFR3 and the IgIIIa and IgIIIb isoforms of FGFR4 and FGFR5 have not been reported.</p>
<p id="p-0513" num="0512">Currently, several FGFs have been shown to selectively bind FGFR3, such as, e.g., FGF-1, FGF-2, FGF-4, FGF-8, FGF-9, FGF-17 and FGF-18, see, e.g., Hecht et al., 1995; Ornitz et al., 1996; and Xu et al., 2000. Additional studies have revealed that FGF-1 and FGF9 preferentially bind FGFR3IIIb, whereas FGF-1 FGF-2, FGF-4, FGF-8, and FGF9 preferentially bind FGFR3IIIc. Studies have shown that each of these ligands is present in various vertebrate species with a high degree of sequence identity which suggests functional equivalence or similarity. As a non-limiting example, FGF-8 is found in fish, birds and mammals and each of these FGF-8 ligands have over 80% amino acid sequence identity. As another non-limiting example, FGF-18 is found in fish, birds and mammals and each of these FGF-18 ligands have over 70% amino acid sequence identity. Crystallographic studies have revealed that all FGFs are structurally organized into a &#x3b2;-trefoil domain. The amino acid sequences comprising the &#x3b2;-trefoil domains found in various FGF ligands that bind FGFR3 are shown in Table 7.</p>

<p id="p-0515" num="0514">As used herein, the term &#x201c;Fibroblast Growth Factor&#x201d; is synonymous with &#x201c;FGF&#x201d; and means a polypeptide with selective binding activity, such as, e.g., a binding affinity or a binding specificity, for a receptor system, including endogenous Clostridial toxin receptor systems such as, e.g., a receptor system comprising FGFR3. It is envisioned that both naturally occurring FGFs as well as FGFs with enhanced binding activity can be used to practice aspects of the present invention. As used herein, the term &#x201c;FGF with enhanced binding activity&#x201d; means a FGF with enhanced binding activity for an endogenous Clostridial toxin receptor system, such as, e.g., a binding affinity or a binding specificity, to a statistically significantly degree relative to an unmodified naturally occurring Clostridial toxin binding domain from a Clostridial toxin. By definition, a FGF with enhanced binding activity has at least one amino acid change from the corresponding region of the disclosed reference sequences (see Table 7) and can be described in percent identity to the corresponding region of that reference sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0516" num="0515">Any of a variety of sequence alignment methods can be used to determine percent identity of a modified FGF relative to a naturally-occurring FGF, including, without limitation, global methods, local methods and hybrid methods, such as, e.g., segment approach methods. Protocols to determine percent identity are routine procedures within the scope of one skilled in the art and from the teaching herein.</p>
<p id="p-0517" num="0516">Approaches well known to one skilled in the art on how to modify a FGF in order to increase its binding activity for an endogenous Clostridial toxin receptor system present on a naturally-occurring Clostridial toxin target cell. As described above, one approach involves identifying amino acids using computational protein design algorithims; changing specifically-identified amino acids using, without limitation, site-directed mutagenesis, oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and site-specific mutagenesis; and testing the binding activity of modified Clostridial toxins comprising a modified FGF with enhanced binding activity using, e.g., heterogeneous assays, homogeneous assays and non-separating homogeneous assays. It is further envisioned that the binding activity of a modified Clostridial toxin with enhanced binding activity disclosed in the present specification can be determined by affinity chromotography using immobilized receptors and interfacial optical assays. In another approach described above, a binding activity of a modified FGF for a naturally-occurring Clostridial toxin receptor system present on a naturally-occurring Clostridial toxin target cell can be achieved using directed-evolution methods.</p>
<p id="p-0518" num="0517">A FGF includes, without limitation, naturally occurring FGF variants, such as, e.g., FGF isoforms and FGF subtypes; non-naturally occurring FGF variants, such as, e.g., conservative FGF variants, non-conservative FGF variants, FGF chimerics, active FGF fragments thereof, or any combination thereof.</p>

Examples of properties include, without limitation, similar size, topography, charge, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, lipophilicity, covalent-bonding capacity, hydrogen-bonding capacity, a physicochemical property, of the like, or any combination thereof. A conservative FGF variant can function in substantially the same manner as the reference FGF on which the conservative FGF variant is based, and can be substituted for the reference FGF in any aspect of the present invention.

<p id="p-0602" num="0601">In is envisioned that any and all protease cleavage sites can be used to convert the single-chain polypeptide form of a Clostridial toxin into the di-chain form, including, without limitation, endogenous di-chain loop protease cleavage sites and exogenous protease cleavage sites.</p>
<p id="p-0603" num="0602">As used herein, the term &#x201c;endogenous di-chain loop protease cleavage site&#x201d; is synonymous with a &#x201c;naturally occurring di-chain loop protease cleavage site&#x201d; and means a naturally occurring protease cleavage site found within the di-chain loop region of a naturally occurring Clostridial toxin and includes, without limitation, naturally occurring Clostridial toxin di-chain loop protease cleavage site variants, such as, e.g., Clostridial toxin di-chain loop protease cleavage site isoforms and Clostridial toxin di-chain loop protease cleavage site subtypes. Non-limiting examples of an endogenous protease cleavage site, include, e.g., a BoNT/A di-chain loop protease cleavage site, a BoNT/B di-chain loop protease cleavage site, a BoNT/C1 di-chain loop protease cleavage site, a BoNT/D di-chain loop protease cleavage site, a BoNT/E di-chain loop protease cleavage site, a BoNT/F di-chain loop protease cleavage site, a BoNT/G di-chain loop protease cleavage site and a TeNT di-chain loop protease cleavage site.</p>
<p id="p-0604" num="0603">As mentioned above, Clostridial toxins are translated as a single-chain polypeptide of approximately 150 kDa that is subsequently cleaved by proteolytic scission within a disulfide loop by a naturally-occurring protease. This posttranslational processing yields a di-chain molecule comprising an approximately 50 kDa light chain (LC) and an approximately 100 kDa heavy chain (HC) held together by a single disulphide bond and noncovalent interactions. While the identity of the protease is currently unknown, the di-chain loop protease cleavage site for many Clostridial toxins has been determined. In BoNTs, cleavage at K448-A449 converts the single polypeptide form of BoNT/A into the di-chain form; cleavage at K441-A442 converts the single polypeptide form of BoNT/B into the di-chain form; cleavage at K449-T450 converts the single polypeptide form of BoNT/C1 into the di-chain form; cleavage at R445-D446 converts the single polypeptide form of BoNT/D into the di-chain form; cleavage at R422-K423 converts the single polypeptide form of BoNT/E into the di-chain form; cleavage at K439-A440 converts the single polypeptide form of BoNT/F into the di-chain form; and cleavage at K446-5447 converts the single polypeptide form of BoNT/G into the di-chain form. Proteolytic cleavage of the single polypeptide form of TeNT at A457-5458 results in the di-chain form. Such a di-chain loop protease cleavage site is operably-linked in-frame to a modified Clostridial toxin as a fusion protein. However, it should also be noted that additional cleavage sites within the di-chain loop also appear to be cleaved resulting in the generation of a small peptide fragment being lost. As a non-limiting example, BoNT/A single-chain polypeptide cleave ultimately results in the loss of a ten amino acid fragment within the di-chain loop.</p>
<p id="p-0605" num="0604">Thus, in an embodiment, a protease cleavage site comprising an endogenous Clostridial toxin di-chain loop protease cleavage site is used to convert the single-chain toxin into the di-chain form. In aspects of this embodiment, conversion into the di-chain form by proteolytic cleavage occurs from a site comprising, e.g., a BoNT/A di-chain loop protease cleavage site, a BoNT/B di-chain loop protease cleavage site, a BoNT/C1 di-chain loop protease cleavage site, a BoNT/D di-chain loop protease cleavage site, a BoNT/E di-chain loop protease cleavage site, a BoNT/F di-chain loop protease cleavage site, a BoNT/G di-chain loop protease cleavage site or a TeNT di-chain loop protease cleavage site.</p>
<p id="p-0606" num="0605">In other aspects of this embodiment, conversion into the di-chain form by proteolytic cleavage occurs from a site comprising, e.g., a di-chain loop region of BoNT/A comprising amino acids 430-454 of SEQ ID NO: 1; a di-chain loop region of BoNT/B comprising amino acids 437-446 of SEQ ID NO: 2; a di-chain loop region of BoNT/C1 comprising amino acids 437-453 of SEQ ID NO: 3; a di-chain loop region of BoNT/D comprising amino acids 437-450 of SEQ ID NO: 4; a di-chain loop region of BoNT/E comprising amino acids 412-426 of SEQ ID NO: 5; a di-chain loop region of BoNT/F comprising amino acids 429-445 of SEQ ID NO: 6; a di-chain loop region of BoNT/G comprising amino acids 436-450 of SEQ ID NO: 7; or a di-chain loop region of TeNT comprising amino acids 439-467 of SEQ ID NO: 8.</p>
<p id="p-0607" num="0606">It is also envisioned that an exogenous protease cleavage site can be used to convert the single-chain polypeptide form of a modified Clostridial toxin disclosed in the present specification into the di-chain form. As used herein, the term &#x201c;exogenous protease cleavage site&#x201d; is synonymous with a &#x201c;non-naturally occurring protease cleavage site&#x201d; and means a protease cleavage site that is not normally present in a di-chain loop region from a naturally occurring Clostridial toxin. Non-limiting examples of exogenous protease cleavage sites include, e.g., an enterokinase cleavage site (Table 9); a Thrombin cleavage site (Table 9); a Factor Xa cleavage site (Table 9); a human rhinovirus 3C protease cleavage site (Table 9); a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site (Table 9); a dipeptidyl aminopeptidase cleavage site; a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)/ubiquitin-like protein-1 (ULP-1) protease cleavage site, such as, e.g., MADSEVNQEAKPEVKPEVKPETHINLKVSDGSSEIFFKIKKTTPLRRLMEAFAKRQGK EMDSLRFLYDGIRIQADQTPEDLDMEDNDIIEAHREQIGG (SEQ ID.

<p id="p-0609" num="0608">As mentioned above, a Clostridial toxin is converted from a single polypeptide form into a di-chain molecule by proteolytic cleavage. While the naturally-occurring protease is currently not known, cleavage occurs within the di-chain loop region between the two cysteine residues that form the disulfide bridge (see Table 8). Replacement of an endogenous protease cleavage site with an exogenous protease cleavage site will enable cleavage of a modified Clostridial toxin disclosed in the present specification when expressed in an organism that does not produce the naturally-occurring protease used to cleave the di-chain loop region of a toxin. Similarly, an addition of an exogenous protease cleavage site in the di-chain loop region will also enable cleavage of a modified Clostridial toxin disclosed in the present specification when expressed in an organism that does not produce the naturally-occurring protease used to cleave the di-chain loop region of a toxin.</p>
<p id="p-0610" num="0609">It is envisioned that an exogenous protease cleavage site of any and all lengths can be useful in aspects of the present invention with the proviso that the exogenous protease cleavage site is capable of being cleaved by its respective protease. Thus, in aspects of this embodiment, an exogenous protease cleavage site can be, e.g., at least 6 amino acids in length, at least 7 amino acids in length, at least 8 amino acids in length, at least 9 amino acids in length, at least 10 amino acids in length, at least 15 amino acids in length, at least 20 amino acids in length, at least 25 amino acids in length, at least 30 amino acids in length, at least 40 amino acids in length, at least 50 amino acids in length or at least 60 amino acids in length. In other aspects of this embodiment, an exogenous protease cleavage site can be, e.g., at most 6 amino acids in length, at most 7 amino acids in length, at most 8 amino acids in length, at most 9 amino acids in length, at most 10 amino acids in length, at most 15 amino acids in length, at most 20 amino acids in length, at most 25 amino acids in length, at most 30 amino acids in length, at most 40 amino acids in length, at most 50 amino acids in length or at most 60 amino acids in length.</p>
<p id="p-0611" num="0610">In aspects of this embodiment, a di-chain loop region can be modified to substitute a naturally-occurring protease cleavage site for an exogenous protease cleavage site. In this type of modification, the naturally-occurring protease cleavage site is made inoperable and thus can not be cleaved by its protease. Only the exogenous protease cleavage site can be cleaved by its corresponding exogenous protease. In this type of modification, the exogenous protease site is operably-linked in-frame to a modified Clostridial toxin as a fusion protein and the site can be cleaved by its respective exogenous protease. As a non-limiting example, a single-chain modified BoNT/A comprising an exogenous protease cleavage site in the di-chain loop region can be cleaved by its respective exogenous protease to produce the di-chain form of the toxin.</p>
<p id="p-0612" num="0611">In other aspects of this embodiment, a di-chain loop region can be modified to include an exogenous protease cleavage site in addition to the naturally-occurring protease cleavage site. In this type of modification, both cleavage sites are operably-linked in-frame to a modified Clostridial toxin as a fusion protein and both sites can be cleaved by their respective proteases. As a non-limiting example, a single-chain modified BoNT/A that comprises a di-chain loop containing both the naturally-occurring BoNT/A di-chain loop protease cleavage site and an exogenous protease cleavage site can be cleaved by either the naturally occurring di-chain loop protease or by the appropriate exogenous protease to produce the di-chain form of the toxin.</p>
<p id="p-0613" num="0612">A naturally-occurring protease cleavage site can be made inoperable by altering at least the two amino acids flanking the peptide bond cleaved by the naturally-occurring di-chain loop protease. More extensive alterations can be made, with the proviso that the two cysteine residues of the di-chain loop region remain intact and can still form the disulfide bridge. Non-limiting examples of an amino acid alteration include deletion of an amino acid or replacement of the original amino acid with a different amino acid. Thus, in one embodiment, a naturally-occurring protease cleavage site is made inoperable by altering the two amino acids flanking the peptide bond cleaved by a naturally-occurring protease. In other aspects of this embodiment, a naturally-occurring protease cleavage site is made inoperable by altering, e.g., at least three amino acids including the two amino acids flanking the peptide bond cleaved by a naturally-occurring protease; at least four amino acids including the two amino acids flanking the peptide bond cleaved by a naturally-occurring protease; at least five amino acids including the two amino acids flanking the peptide bond cleaved by a naturally-occurring protease; at least six amino acids including the two amino acids flanking the peptide bond cleaved by a naturally-occurring protease; at least seven amino acids including the two amino acids flanking the peptide bond cleaved by a naturally-occurring protease; at least eight amino acids including the two amino acids flanking the peptide bond cleaved by a naturally-occurring protease; at least nine amino acids including the two amino acids flanking the peptide bond cleaved by a naturally-occurring protease; at least ten amino acids including the two amino acids flanking the peptide bond cleaved by a naturally-occurring protease; at least 15 amino acids including the two amino acids flanking the peptide bond cleaved by a naturally-occurring protease; or at least 20 amino acids including the two amino acids flanking the peptide bond cleaved by a naturally-occurring protease.</p>

<p id="p-0659" num="0658">The methods disclosed in the present specification include, in part, introducing into a cell a polynucleotide molecule. A polynucleotide molecule introduced into a cell can be transiently or stably maintained by that cell. Stably-maintained polynucleotide molecules may be extra-chromosomal and replicate autonomously, or they may be integrated into the chromosomal material of the cell and replicate non-autonomously. It is envisioned that any and all methods for introducing a polynucleotide molecule disclosed in the present specification into a cell can be used. Methods useful for introducing a nucleic acid molecule into a cell include, without limitation, chemical-mediated transfection such as, e.g., calcium phosphate-mediated, diethyl-aminoethyl (DEAE) dextran-mediated, lipid-mediated, polyethyleneimine (PEI)-mediated, polylysine-mediated and polybrene-mediated; physical-mediated tranfection, such as, e.g., biolistic particle delivery, microinjection, protoplast fusion and electroporation; and viral-mediated transfection, such as, e.g., retroviral-mediated transfection, see, e.g., Introducing Cloned Genes into Cultured Mammalian Cells, pp. 16.1-16.62 (Sambrook &#x26; Russell, eds., Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual, Vol. 3, 3<sup>rd </sup>ed. 2001). One skilled in the art understands that selection of a specific method to introduce an expression construct into a cell will depend, in part, on whether the cell will transiently contain an expression construct or whether the cell will stably contain an expression construct. These protocols are routine procedures within the scope of one skilled in the art and from the teaching herein.</p>
<p id="p-0660" num="0659">In an aspect of this embodiment, a chemical-mediated method, termed transfection, is used to introduce a polynucleotide molecule encoding a modified Clostridial toxin into a cell. In chemical-mediated methods of transfection the chemical reagent forms a complex with the nucleic acid that facilitates its uptake into the cells. Such chemical reagents include, without limitation, calcium phosphate-mediated, see, e.g., Martin Jordan &#x26; Florian Worm, Transfection of adherent and suspended cells by calcium phosphate, 33(2) Methods 136-143 (2004); diethyl-aminoethyl (DEAE) dextran-mediated, lipid-mediated, cationic polymer-mediated like polyethyleneimine (PEI)-mediated and polylysine-mediated and polybrene-mediated, see, e.g., Chun Zhang et al., Polyethylenimine strategies for plasmid delivery to brain-derived cells, 33(2) Methods 144-150 (2004). Such chemical-mediated delivery systems can be prepared by standard methods and are commercially available, see, e.g., CellPhect Transfection Kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.); Mammalian Transfection Kit, Calcium phosphate and DEAE Dextran, (Stratagene, Inc., La Jolla, Calif.); Lipofectamine&#x2122; Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen, Inc., Carlsbad, Calif.); ExGen 500 Transfection kit (Fermentas, Inc., Hanover, Md.), and SuperFect and Effectene Transfection Kits (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, Calif.).</p>
<p id="p-0661" num="0660">In another aspect of this embodiment, a physical-mediated method is used to introduce a polynucleotide molecule encoding a modified Clostridial toxin into a cell. Physical techniques include, without limitation, electroporation, biolistic and microinjection. Biolistics and microinjection techniques perforate the cell wall in order to introduce the nucleic acid molecule into the cell, see, e.g., Jeike E. Biewenga et al., Plasmid-mediated gene transfer in neurons using the biolistics technique, 71(1) J. Neurosci. Methods. 67-75 (1997); and John O'Brien &#x26; Sarah C. R. Lummis, Biolistic and diolistic transfection: using the gene gun to deliver DNA and lipophilic dyes into mammalian cells, 33(2) Methods 121-125 (2004). Electroporation, also termed electropermeabilization, uses brief, high-voltage, electrical pulses to create transient pores in the membrane through which the nucleic acid molecules enter and can be used effectively for stable and transient transfections of all cell types, see, e.g., M. Golzio et al., In vitro and in vivo electric field-mediated permeabilization, gene transfer, and expression, 33(2) Methods 126-135 (2004); and Oliver Gresch et al., New non-viral method for gene transfer into primary cells, 33(2) Methods 151-163 (2004).</p>
<p id="p-0662" num="0661">In another aspect of this embodiment, a viral-mediated method, termed transduction, is used to introduce a polynucleotide molecule encoding a modified Clostridial toxin into a cell. In viral-mediated methods of transient transduction, the process by which viral particles infect and replicate in a host cell has been manipulated in order to use this mechanism to introduce a nucleic acid molecule into the cell. Viral-mediated methods have been developed from a wide variety of viruses including, without limitation, retroviruses, adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses, herpes simplex viruses, picornaviruses, alphaviruses and baculoviruses, see, e.g., Armin Blesch, Lentiviral and MLV based retroviral vectors for ex vivo and in vivo gene transfer, 33(2) Methods 164-172 (2004); and Maurizio Federico, From lentiviruses to lentivirus vectors, 229 Methods Mol.

<p id="p-0663" num="0662">Adenoviruses, which are non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses, are often selected for mammalian cell transduction because adenoviruses handle relatively large polynucleotide molecules of about 36 kb, are produced at high titer, and can efficiently infect a wide variety of both dividing and non-dividing cells, see, e.g., Wim T. J. M. C. Hermens et al., Transient gene transfer to neurons and glia: analysis of adenoviral vector performance in the CNS and PNS, 71(1) J. Neurosci. Methods 85-98 (1997); and Hiroyuki Mizuguchi et al., Approaches for generating recombinant adenovirus vectors, 52(3) Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 165-176 (2001). Transduction using adenoviral-based system do not support prolonged protein expression because the nucleic acid molecule is carried from an episome in the cell nucleus, rather than being integrated into the host cell chromosome. Adenoviral vector systems and specific protocols for how to use such vectors are disclosed in, e.g., ViraPower&#x2122; Adenoviral Expression System (Invitrogen, Inc., Carlsbad, Calif.) and ViraPower&#x2122; Adenoviral Expression System Instruction Manual 25-0543 version A, Invitrogen, Inc., (Jul. 15, 2002); and AdEasy&#x2122; Adenoviral Vector System (Stratagene, Inc., La Jolla, Calif.) and AdEasy&#x2122; Adenoviral Vector System Instruction Manual 064004f, Stratagene, Inc.</p>
<p id="p-0664" num="0663">Nucleic acid molecule delivery can also use single-stranded RNA retroviruses, such as, e.g., oncoretroviruses and lentiviruses. Retroviral-mediated transduction often produce transduction efficiencies close to 100%, can easily control the proviral copy number by varying the multiplicity of infection (MOI), and can be used to either transiently or stably transduce cells, see, e.g., Tiziana Tonini et al., Transient production of retroviral- and lentiviral-based vectors for the transduction of Mammalian cells, 285 Methods Mol. Biol. 141-148 (2004); Armin Blesch, Lentiviral and MLV based retroviral vectors for ex vivo and in vivo gene transfer, 33(2) Methods 164-172 (2004); Felix Recillas-Targa, Gene transfer and expression in mammalian cell lines and transgenic animals, 267 Methods Mol. Biol. 417-433 (2004); and Roland Wolkowicz et al., Lentiviral vectors for the delivery of DNA into mammalian cells, 246 Methods Mol. Biol. 391-411 (2004). Retroviral particles consist of an RNA genome packaged in a protein capsid, surrounded by a lipid envelope. The retrovirus infects a host cell by injecting its RNA into the cytoplasm along with the reverse transcriptase enzyme. The RNA template is then reverse transcribed into a linear, double stranded cDNA that replicates itself by integrating into the host cell genome. Viral particles are spread both vertically (from parent cell to daughter cells via the provirus) as well as horizontally (from cell to cell via virions). This replication strategy enables long-term persistent expression since the nucleic acid molecules of interest are stably integrated into a chromosome of the host cell, thereby enabling long-term expression of the protein. For instance, animal studies have shown that lentiviral vectors injected into a variety of tissues produced sustained protein expression for more than 1 year, see, e.g., Luigi Naldini et al., In vivo gene delivery and stable transduction of non-dividing cells by a lentiviral vector, 272(5259) Science 263-267 (1996). The Oncoretroviruses-derived vector systems, such as, e.g., Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV), are widely used and infect many different non-dividing cells. Lentiviruses can also infect many different cell types, including dividing and non-dividing cells and possess complex envelope proteins, which allows for highly specific cellular targeting.</p>

Bacteria containing expression constructs are identified as Kanamycin resistant colonies. Candidate constructs are isolated using an alkaline lysis plasmid mini-preparation procedure and analyzed by restriction endonuclease digest mapping to determine the presence and orientation of the insert. This cloning strategy yielded a pET29 expression construct comprising the polynucleotide molecule encoding the BoNT/A of SEQ ID NO: 1 operably-linked to a carboxyl terminal polyhistidine affinity binding peptide.</p>

<p id="p-0678" num="0767">To construct a modified BoNT/A comprising a modified binding domain with enhanced binding activity, specific amino acids influencing binding activity will be changed. It is already known that amino acids Trp 1101, Gly 1102, Leu 1105, Tyr 1111, Tyr 1112, Gly 1158, Ile 1163, Asp 1179, Glu 1203, Phe 1252, Ser 1264, Trp 1266, Tyr 1267, Gln 1270, Gly 1279 and Trp 1282 of SEQ ID NO: 1 are important for function. To determine which amino acid substitutions could enhance the binding activity of a BoNT/A binding domain, computational protein design algorithims will generate novel proteins with optimized properties. The crystal structure of a BoNT/A binding domain will be used as the starting template for computational calculations. Potential amino acid candidates will be identified using a combined output from Protein Design Automation&#xae; (PDA&#xae;) and Sequence Prediction Algorithm&#x2122; (SPA&#x2122;) calculations. For PDA calculations, the conformations of amino acids at variable positions will be represented as a set of backbone-independent side chain rotamers derived from the rotamer library. The energies of all possible combinations of the considered amino acids at the chosen variable positions will be calculated using a force field containing terms describing van der Waals, solvation, electrostatic, and hydrogen bond interactions. The optimal (ground state) sequence will be determined using a Dead End Elimination (DEE) algorithm, and a Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm will be used to evaluate the energies of similar sequences around the predicted ground state. SPA calculations utilize a genetic algorithm to screen for low energy sequences, with energies being calculated during each round of &#x201c;evolution&#x201d; for those sequences being sampled. The conformations of amino acids will be represented as a set of side chain rotamers derived from a backbone-independent rotamer library using a flexible rotamer model. SPA calculations will generate sequences which will be subsequently clustered computationally into groups of similar sequences using a nearest neighbor single linkage hierarchical clustering algorithm. Critical contact amino acids will be fixed in both sequence and conformation and calculations will be carried out to evaluate single and combinatorial substitutions at variable amino acids. All amino acids in contact with these residues will be floated, that is the amino acid conformation but not the amino acid identity will be allowed to vary to allow for conformational adjustments. Final experimental substitutions will be chosen based on their predicted energies relative to the naturally occurring BoNT/A binding domain and their occupancy, that is the number times the substitution occurred in the set of 1000 MC or genetic algorithm sequences. Two sets of design calculations will be carried out using Rosetta to identify substitutions predicted to stabilize the BoNT/A binding domain. In the first round, only single amino acid substitutions will be modeled. In a second round, interface amino acids will be allowed to change to all 20 naturally occurring amino acids including the native amino acid type, but excluding cysteine, simultaneously. In each case, amino acid side chains contacting the substituted amino acid side chains will be repacked (allowing all rotamers of the native amino acid type). Sequences and conformations with low energies will be selected using a Monte-Carlo simulated annealing procedure. All resulting protein complex models will be rescored by computing a predicted binding energy. Final sequences were selected for the lowest binding energy</p>
<p id="p-0679" num="0768">Identified candidate amino acids will be changed using site-directed in vitro mutagenesis. A 50 &#x3bc;L reaction will be assembled using pET29/BoNT/A as a template, sense and antisense oligonucleotides encoding the desired amino acid change identified above, and reagents included with the QuickChange&#xae;II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mix will contain 5 &#x3bc;L of 10&#xd7; Buffer, 1 &#x3bc;L of deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs), 1 &#x3bc;L of PfuUltra&#x2122; High Fidelity DNA polymerase (2.5 units/&#x3bc;L), 125 ng of each primer, 100 ng of template DNA, and nuclease-free water to a final volume of 50 &#x3bc;L. The thermocycler conditions will be: one cycle of 95&#xb0; C. for 60 seconds; 16 cycles of 95&#xb0; C. for 30 seconds, 55&#xb0; C. for 60 seconds, and 72&#xb0; C. for 10 minutes; one cycle of 72&#xb0; C. for 5 minutes; and 4&#xb0; C. to hold. Following thermocycling, 1 &#x3bc;L of DpnI restriction enzyme (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.) will be added to the reaction and will be incubated for 1 hour at 37&#xb0; C. to digest the template DNA. The reaction will be purified by QIAquick kit (QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, Calif.) and will be analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis to determine that the reaction produced full-length plasmid.

Candidate mutagenesis constructs will be isolated as Ampicillin resistant colonies and will be analyzed using an alkaline lysis plasmid mini-preparation procedure to isolate the expression construct and restriction endonuclease digests to determine the presence of the insert. The incorporation of the point mutation will be determined by sequence analysis of candidate plasmid constructs.</p>
<p id="p-0680" num="0769">To test the binding activity of modified BoNT/A candidates with enhanced binding activity, the soluble portion of FGFR3 will be expressed recombinantly for use in surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding assays, e.g., Biacore&#xae; (Biacore Inc., Piscataway, N.J.). The soluble portion of FGFR3 will be expressed as a fusion to streptavidin and the receptor will then be immobilized on an appropriate sensor chip. Utilizing a Biacore&#xae; instrument, changes in local refractive index as a result of receptor binding will be measured as a change in the SPR angle. The rates of change in the SPR angle will then be analyzed to determine association rate (K<sub>on</sub>), dissociation rate (K<sub>off</sub>) and the dissociation equilibrium constant (K<sub>D</sub>=K<sub>off</sub>/K<sub>on</sub>). Modified BoNT/A candidates with enhanced binding activity will exhibit either an increased association rate, a decreased dissociation rate, both an increased association rate and a decreased dissociation rate, or a decreased dissociation equilibrium constant relative to the measurements obtained from the naturally occurring BoNT/A from which the modifeid BoNT/A with enhanced binding activity was derived.</p>

<p id="p-0705" num="0794">To construct pET29/BoNT/A-F18, a pUCBHB1/BoNT/A-F18&#x3b3; construct is digested with restriction endonucleases that 1) excise the insert comprising the open reading frame encoding BoNT/A-F18&#x3b3;; and 2) enable this insert to be operably-linked to a pET29 vector (EMD Biosciences-Novagen, Madison, Wis.). This insert is subcloned using a T4 DNA ligase procedure into a pET29 vector that is digested with appropriate restriction endonucleases to yield pET29/BoNT/A-F18&#x3b3;. The ligation mixture is transformed into chemically competent <i>E. coli </i>DH5&#x3b1; cells (Invitrogen, Inc, Carlsbad, Calif.) using a heat shock method, plated on 1.5% Luria-Bertani agar plates (pH 7.0) containing 50 &#x3bc;g/mL of Kanamycin, and placed in a 37&#xb0; C. incubator for overnight growth. Bacteria containing expression constructs are identified as Kanamycin resistant colonies. Candidate constructs are isolated using an alkaline lysis plasmid mini-preparation procedure and analyzed by restriction endonuclease digest mapping to determine the presence and orientation of the insert. This cloning strategy yielded a pET29 expression construct comprising the polynucleotide molecule encoding BoNT/A-F18&#x3b3; operably-linked to a carboxyl terminal polyhistidine affinity binding peptide.</p>

<p id="p-0709" num="0798">The following example illustrates methods useful for purification and quantification of any modified Clostridial toxins disclosed in the present specification.</p>
<p id="p-0710" num="0799">For immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) protein purification, <i>E. coli </i>BL21 (DE3) cell pellets used to express a modified Clostridial toxin, as described in Example 7, are resuspended in Column Binding Buffer (25 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N&#x2032;-(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (HEPES), pH 7.8; 500 mM sodium chloride; 10 mM imidazole; 2&#xd7; Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Set III (EMD Biosciences-Calbiochem, San Diego Calif.); 5 units/mL of Benzonase (EMD Biosciences-Novagen, Madison, Wis.); 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X&#xae; 100, 4-octylphenol polyethoxylate; 10% (v/v) glycerol), and then are transferred to a cold Oakridge centrifuge tube. The cell suspension is sonicated on ice (10-12 pulses of 10 seconds at 40% amplitude with 60 seconds cooling intervals on a Branson Digital Sonifier) in order to lyse the cells and then is centrifuged (16,000 rpm at 4&#xb0; C. for 20 minutes) to clarify the lysate. An immobilized metal affinity chromatography column is prepared using a 20 mL Econo-Pac column support (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif.) packed with 2.5-5.0 mL of TALON&#x2122; SuperFlow Co<sup>2+</sup> affinity resin (BD Biosciences-Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif.), which is then equilibrated by rinsing with 5 column volumes of deionized, distilled water, followed by 5 column volumes of Column Binding Buffer. The clarified lysate is applied slowly to the equilibrated column by gravity flow (approximately 0.25-0.3 mL/minute). The column is then washed with 5 column volumes of Column Wash Buffer (N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N&#x2032;-(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (HEPES), pH 7.8; 500 mM sodium chloride; 10 mM imidazole; 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X&#xae; 100, 4-octylphenol polyethoxylate; 10% (v/v) glycerol). The modified Clostridial toxin is eluted with 20-30 mL of Column Elution Buffer (25 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N&#x2032;-(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (HEPES), pH 7.8; 500 mM sodium chloride; 500 mM imidazole; 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X&#xae; 100, 4-octylphenol polyethoxylate; 10% (v/v) glycerol) and is collected in approximately twelve 1 mL fractions. The amount of modified Clostridial toxin contained in each elution fraction is determined by a Bradford dye assay. In this procedure, 20 &#x3bc;L aliquots of each 1.0 mL fraction is combined with 200 &#x3bc;L of Bio-Rad Protein Reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif.), diluted 1 to 4 with deionized, distilled water, and then the intensity of the colorimetric signal is measured using a spectrophotometer. The five fractions with the strongest signal are considered the elution peak and are combined together. Total protein yield is determined by estimating the total protein concentration of the pooled peak elution fractions using bovine gamma globulin as a standard (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif.).</p>
<p id="p-0711" num="0800">For purification of a modified Clostridial toxin using a FPLC desalting column, a HiPrep&#x2122; 26/10 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.) is pre-equilibrated with 80 mL of 4&#xb0; C. Column Buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5). After the column is equilibrated, a modified Clostridial toxin sample is applied to the size exclusion column with an isocratic mobile phase of 4&#xb0; C. Column Buffer and at a flow rate of 10 mL/minute using a BioLogic DuoFlow chromatography system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif.). The desalted modified Clostridial toxin sample is collected as a single fraction of approximately 7-12 mL.</p>
<p id="p-0712" num="0801">For purification of a modified Clostridial toxin using a FPLC ion exchange column, a modified Clostridial toxin sample that has been desalted following elution from an IMAC column is applied to a 1 mL Q1&#x2122; anion exchange column (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif.) using a BioLogic DuoFlow chromatography system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif.). The sample is applied to the column in 4&#xb0; C. Column Buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5) and is eluted by linear gradient with 4&#xb0; C. Elution Buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, 1 M sodium chloride, pH 6.5) as follows: step 1, 5.0 mL of 5% Elution Buffer at a flow rate of 1 mL/minute; step 2, 20.0 mL of 5-30% Elution Buffer at a flow rate of 1 mL/minute; step 3, 2.0 mL of 50% Elution Buffer at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/minute; step 4, 4.0 mL of 100% Elution Buffer at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/minute; and step 5, 5.0 mL of 0% Elution Buffer at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/minute. Elution of modified Clostridial toxin from the column is monitored at 280, 260, and 214 nm, and peaks absorbing above a minimum threshold (0.01 au) at 280 nm are collected. Most of the modified Clostridial toxin will elute at a sodium chloride concentration of approximately 100 to 200 mM. Average total yields of modified Clostridial toxin will be determined by a Bradford assay.</p>
