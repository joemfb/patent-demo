<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method for applying a light-blocking material onto an imagewise exposed lithographic printing plate is disclosed. The exposed plate comprises on a substrate a photosensitive layer having hardened areas and non-hardened areas (for negative plate) or solubilized areas and non-solubilized areas (for positive plate). The non-hardened or solubilized areas of said photosensitive layer are removable with ink and/or fountain solution on a lithographic press. The light-blocking material is applied to the plate preferably from a solution or dispersion containing such material. The application of the light-blocking material prevents at least a portion of the room light in a certain wavelength (such as ultraviolet) range from reaching the photosensitive layer, thus allowing improved room light stability of the exposed plate.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to lithographic printing plate. More particularly, it relates to a method of applying a light-blocking material to an on-press developable lithographic plate after imagewise exposure and before on-press development with ink and/or fountain solution.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Lithographic printing plates (after process) generally consist of ink-receptive areas (image areas) and ink-repelling areas (non-image areas). During printing operation, an ink is preferentially received in the image areas, not in the non-image areas, and then transferred to the surface of a material upon which the image is to be produced. Commonly the ink is transferred to an intermediate material called printing blanket, which in turn transfers the ink to the surface of the material upon which the image is to be produced.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">At the present time, lithographic printing plates (processed) are generally prepared from lithographic printing plate precursors (also commonly called lithographic printing plates) comprising a substrate and a photosensitive coating deposited on the substrate, the substrate and the photosensitive coating having opposite surface properties. The photosensitive coating is usually a photosensitive material, which solubilizes or hardens upon exposure to an actinic radiation. In positive-working systems, the exposed areas become more soluble and can be developed to reveal the underneath substrate. In negative-working systems, the exposed areas become hardened and the non-exposed areas can be developed to reveal the underneath substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Traditionally, the plate is exposed with an ultraviolet light from a lamp through a separate photomask film having predetermined imaging pattern that is placed between the light source and the plate. Laser sources have been increasingly used to imagewise expose a printing plate that is sensitized to a corresponding laser wavelength, allowing the elimination of the photomask film. Suitable lasers include, for example, infrared lasers (such as laser diode of about 830 nm and NdYAG laser of about 1064 nm), visible lasers (such as frequency-doubled NdYAG laser of about 532 nm and violet laser diode of about 405 nm), and ultraviolet laser (such as ultraviolet laser diode of about 370 nm). Laser sensitive plates generally have higher sensitivity (than conventional plates) because of the limited power of current laser imagers.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, the exposed plate is developed with a liquid developer to bare the substrate in the non-hardened or solubilized areas. On-press developable lithographic printing plates have been disclosed in recent years. Such plates can be directly mounted on press after imagewise exposure to develop with ink and/or fountain solution during the initial prints and then to print out regular printed sheets. No separate development process before mounting on press is needed, allowing the reduction of labor and the elimination of hazardous waste. Among the patents describing on-press developable lithographic printing plates are U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,258,263, 5,516,620, 5,561,029, 5,616,449, 5,677,110, 5,811,220, 6,014,929, 6,071,675, and 6,482,571.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An on-press developable plate is designed to be developed on a lithographic printing press in a pressroom, which is generally under regular office light (white light). The imagewise exposed plate typically sees the white light during the handling and on-press development. Therefore, the plate must be designed so that it is stable enough under regular office light within a certain time period (such as 30 minutes). Plates that are not stable enough under regular office light are not suitable for on-press development application in the common pressroom lighting condition. Such an office light stability requirement makes it very difficult to design an on-press developable plate with fast photospeed or suitable for laser exposure.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There has been a desire to develop a method that would eliminate the office light stability requirement of an on-press developable plate after imagewise exposure and before on-press development.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the present invention, there has been provided a method of lithographically printing images on a receiving medium, comprising in order:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0009">(a) providing a lithographic printing plate comprising on a substrate a photosensitive layer capable of hardening (for negative plate) or solubilization (for positive plate) upon exposure to a radiation, the non-hardened or solubilized areas of said photosensitive layer being soluble or dispersible in ink and/or fountain solution;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0010">(b) imagewise exposing said plate with said radiation to cause hardening or solubilization of said photosensitive layer in the exposed areas;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0011">(c) applying a light-blocking material onto said plate on at least the photosensitive layer coated side, wherein said light-blocking material as applied to said plate prevents at least a portion of light within the wavelength range of from 200 to 780 nm from reaching said photosensitive layer;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0012">(d) developing said plate with ink and/or fountain solution on a lithographic press to remove the non-hardened or solubilized areas of said photosensitive layer; and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0013">(e) lithographically printing images from said plate to the receiving medium.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0014">The radiation is preferably a laser having a wavelength selected from 200 to 1200 nm, more preferably a violet or ultraviolet laser (200 to 430 nm) or an infrared laser (750 to 1200 nm), most preferably a violet or ultraviolet laser. The plate can be a negative plate or positive plate, preferably a negative plate.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0015">Preferably, the light-blocking material as applied to said plate prevents at least 50%, more preferably at least 90% and most preferably at least 99%, of light in the wavelength range of from 300 to 450 nm from reaching said photosensitive layer. Here, the term reaching the photosensitive layer means reaching the top of the photosensitive layer. In the case that the light-blocking material also diffuses into the photosensitive layer, the light-blocking material prevents more light from reaching the bottom of the photosensitive layer than from reaching the top of the photosensitive layer; it is preferable that the light-blocking material as applied to said plate prevents at least 90% of light in the wavelength range of from 300 to 450 nm from reaching the bottom of said photosensitive layer.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0016">The light-blocking material is applied to the plate on at least the photosensitive layer coated side by any means, preferably from a solution or dispersion, more preferably an aqueous solution or dispersion. The plate applied with the light-blocking material from a solution or dispersion is preferably dried to remove any excess water and/or organic solvent so that the plate is free of any wet-looking surface, after application of said solution or dispersion and before said on-press development.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0017">The light-blocking material, by itself or together with other materials applied with said light-blocking material, can form a thin layer on said plate, or can diffuse into the photosensitive layer, and/or overcoat if any. Alternatively, a portion of said light-blocking material, by itself or together with other materials applied with said light-blocking material, forms a thin layer on said plate, and the rest of said light-blocking material diffuses into the photosensitive layer, and/or overcoat if any. Preferably, the light-blocking material forms a thin layer on said plate on at least the photosensitive layer coated side, with or without part of the light-blocking material diffusing into the photosensitive layer and/or overcoat.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0018">The light-blocking material can be any material capable of blocking (usually by absorbing and/or scattering) light in a certain wavelength range in the ultraviolet and visible regions. Preferably, the light-blocking material is capable of blocking light in the ultraviolet region (more preferably from 300 to 450 nm), and is substantially transparent in most of the visible region (more preferably from 500 to 780 nm). More preferably, the light-blocking material is an ultraviolet light absorbing dye or ultraviolet absorbing and/or scattering pigment, or a combination of such dye and pigment. Most preferably, the light-blocking material is a dye or pigment, or combination of such dye and pigment, having an absorption maximum or a scattering peak within the wavelength range of from 300 to 450 nm. Such light-blocking material is preferably applied to the plate through a solution or dispersion containing such light-blocking material.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0019">In this patent, the term development means selective removal of the non-hardened (for negative plate) or solubilized (for positive plate) areas of the photosensitive layer (without removing the hardened or non-solubilized areas). The term monomer includes both monomer and oligomer, and the term (meth)acrylate includes both acrylate and methacrylate (A monomer means a monomer or an oligomer, and a (meth)acrylate monomer means an acrylate monomer, a methacrylate monomer, or a monomer with both acrylate and methacrylate groups.). The term &#x201c;comprises a . . . &#x201d; means &#x201c;comprises at least one . . . &#x201d;; for example, the term &#x201c;comprising a monomer&#x201d; means &#x201c;comprising at least one monomer.&#x201d; The term yellow or red light means yellow light, red light, or any light with color between yellow and red such as orange light. The term safe light means a light with a certain wavelength range being cut off so that it does not cause hardening (for negative plate) or solubilization (for positive plate) of a certain photosensitive layer at least within a certain amount of time required for certain typical handling and process (such as 2 hours). For most photosensitive layer, a safe light is a yellow or red light. The term white light means a white fluorescent light, white incandescent light, sunlight, or any regular office light. The term &#x201c;substantially no radiation&#x201d; means the intensity of the radiation is less than 1% of that for a regular 100-watt incandescent light (for home use, not focused) at a distance of 2 meters. The term &#x201c;substantial darkness&#x201d; means the intensity of the radiation is less than 1% of that for a 100-watt incandescent light at a distance of 2 meters.

Preferred are dyes or pigments which can effectively block light in the wavelength range of from 200 to 550 nm, more preferably from 250 to 500 nm, and most preferably from 300 to 450 nm. It is noted that, for a dye, the reduction of the transmission of light is generally through absorption; and for a pigment, it is generally through both absorption and scattering. In other words, a dye generally blocks light by absorbing light in a certain wavelength range, and a pigment generally blocks light by both absorbing and scattering light in a certain wavelength range. For simplicity, in this application, a pigment which effectively absorbs and/or scatters light in the ultraviolet (or visible) region is also called an ultraviolet (or visible) absorbing pigment.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0025">The light-blocking material can be applied to the lithographic plate by any means, preferably from a solution or dispersion containing such light-blocking material, and more preferably from an aqueous solution or dispersion.

<p id="p-0022" num="0026">The solution or dispersion containing the light-blocking material for applying to the plate after imagewise exposure and before development is called light-blocking solution or dispersion in this application. A preferred light-blocking solution or dispersion is an aqueous solution or dispersion comprising an ultraviolet light absorbing dye or pigment and at least 60% by weight of water. One or more water soluble polymers are preferably added into the light-blocking solution or dispersion. Other additives, such as surfactant, defoamer, bactericide, colorant, inorganic micro particles (such as talc or silicon oxide powder), organic micro particles (such as latex), and rheology modifier, can also be added.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0027">The plate applied with the light-blocking material from a solution or dispersion is preferably dried to remove any excess water and/or organic solvent so that the plate is free of any wet-looking surface, after application of said solution or dispersion and before said on-press development. The plate can be dried by any means, such as by forced room temperature air, forced hot air, infrared heater, hot plate, and natural drying (by leaving uncovered at room temperature). Preferably, the plate is dried by forced hot air. Upon drying, the light-blocking solution or dispersion may form a dry layer on the plate on the photosensitive layer coated side; such a dry layer is called light-blocking layer in this application.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0028">In addition to its capability of blocking light, the light-blocking solution or dispersion is preferably also capable of deactivating the photosensitive layer, changing the color of the photosensitive layer primarily or only in the non-hardened or solubilized areas, enhancing the hydrophilicity of the substrate, or increasing the on-press developability with ink and/or fountain solution. A deactivating agent, a discoloring agent, a hydrophilizing agent, or a development enhancer, may be added into the light-blocking solution or dispersion. Various deactivating agents, discoloring agents, hydrophilizing agents, and development enhancers are described in U.S. patent application Ser.

By automatic application, preferably, the plate passes through a light-blocking material application device which is capable of applying the light-blocking solution or dispersion onto the plate on the photosensitive layer coated side; the light-blocking solution or dispersion can be applied to the plate on the device by any means, preferably by contacting with a roller carrying the light-blocking solution or dispersion, by dipping through the light-blocking solution or dispersion in a tank, or by spraying the light-blocking solution or dispersion onto the plate; the plate applied with the light-blocking solution is preferably further dried to remove any excess water or organic solvent by passing through a drying unit on the device, preferably a drying unit using forced hot air.</p>

Preferably, the photosensitive layer exhibits an affinity or aversion substantially opposite to the affinity or aversion of the substrate to at least one printing liquid selected from the group consisting of ink and an abhesive fluid for ink (as for plates with non-phase-switchable photosensitive layer, which can be wet plate or waterless plate). More preferably, the plate has a hydrophilic substrate and an oleophilic photosensitive layer (as for wet plate with non-phase-switchable photosensitive layer). An abhesive fluid for ink is a fluid that repels ink. Fountain solution is the most commonly used abhesive fluid for ink. A wet plate is printed on a wet press equipped with both ink and fountain solution, while a waterless plate is printed on a waterless press equipped with ink.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0031">Usually, as for most printing plates described in the literature, the photosensitive layer exhibits an affinity or aversion substantially opposite to the affinity or aversion of the substrate to at least one printing liquid selected from the group consisting of ink and an adhesive fluid for ink, and does not switch its affinity or aversion upon exposure to an actinic radiation. However, certain photosensitive layer exhibits substantially the same affinity or aversion as the substrate and is capable of switching to opposite affinity or aversion upon exposure to a radiation, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,331,375, 5,910,395, 6,720,464, and 6,136,503. Both non-phase-switchable photosensitive layer and phase-switchable photosensitive layer can be used for the current invention.

More preferred is an oleophilic photosensitive layer (coated on a hydrophilic substrate).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0032">The substrate employed in the lithographic plates of this invention can be any lithographic support.

Particularly preferred is an aluminum support that has been grained and anodized (with or without deposition of a barrier layer). Polyester film is a preferred polymeric support. A surface coating may be coated to achieve desired surface properties. For wet plate, the substrate should have a hydrophilic surface (for oleophilic photosensitive layer) or oleophilic surface (for hydrophilic photosensitive layer); preferably, a wet lithographic plate has a hydrophilic substrate and an oleophilic photosensitive layer. For waterless plate, the substrate should have an oleophilic surface (for oleophobic photosensitive layer) or oleophobic surface (for oleophilic photosensitive layer).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0033">Particularly suitable hydrophilic substrate for a wet lithographic plate is an aluminum support that has been grained and anodized, preferably with further hydrophilic treatment. Surface graining can be achieved by mechanical graining or brushing, chemical etching, and/or AC electrochemical graining. The grained aluminum is typically treated with a basic or acidic solution to remove the smut, and then subjected to an electrochemical anodization process utilizing an acid such as sulfuric acid and/or phosphoric acid. The roughened and anodized aluminum surface can be further treated with a hydrophilic material to form a hydrophilic barrier layer. Suitable hydrophilic materials include metal silicate such as sodium silicate, phosphate fluoride (formed from a solution containing sodium dihydrogen phosphate and sodium fluoride), phosphoric acid, and hydrophilic polymer such as polyvinyl phosphonic acid, polyacrylamide, polyacrylic acid, polybasic organic acid, copolymers of vinyl phosphonic acid and acrylamide. Polyvinyl phosphonic acid and its copolymers are preferred hydrophilic polymers. The hydrophilic material can be formed on the aluminum surface by thermal or electrochemical method. By thermal method, the grained and anodized aluminum passes through or is immersed for a certain time in a solution containing the hydrophilic material at a certain temperature including elevated and room temperature, preferably an elevated temperature. By electrochemical method, a DC or AC electricity is applied to the aluminum while passing through or immersed in the solution containing the hydrophilic material. Processes for surface graining, anodization, and hydrophilic treatment of aluminum in lithographic printing plate application are well known in the art, and examples can be found in U.S. Pat.

Such photosensitive layer is preferably soluble or dispersible in ink and/or fountain solution in the non-hardened or solubilized areas. Here hardening means becoming insoluble and non-dispersible in ink and/or fountain solution (negative-working); and solubilization means becoming soluble or dispersible in ink and/or fountain solution (positive-working). In this invention, hardening or solubilization can be achieved through any means. Preferably, hardening is achieved through crosslinking or polymerization of polymers and/or monomers, and solubilization is achieved through decomposition of polymer and/or compound. The radiation can be a conventional light such as ultraviolet light from a lamp (which usually requires a photomask), or can be a laser (which directly images according to digital imaging information). Preferably, the photosensitive layer is sensitive to a laser and exposed with such laser.

<p id="p-0046" num="0050">Various surfactants may be added into the photosensitive layer to, for example, improve the coatability or developability. Both polymeric and small molecule surfactants can be used. However, it is preferred that the surfactant has low or no volatility so that it will not evaporate from the photosensitive layer of the plate during storage and handling. Nonionic surfactants are preferred. Preferred nonionic surfactants are polymers and oligomers containing one or more polyether (such as polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, and copolymer of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol) segments. Examples of preferred nonionic surfactants are block copolymers of propylene glycol and ethylene glycol (also called block copolymer of propylene oxide and ethylene oxide); ethoxylated or propoxylated acrylate oligomers; and polyethoxylated alkylphenols and polyethoxylated fatty alcohols. The nonionic surfactant is preferably added at from 0.1 to 10% by weight of the photosensitive layer, and more preferably from 0.5 to 5%.</p>

Such a plate configuration is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,014,929, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Preferred releasable interlayer comprises a water-soluble polymer. Polyvinyl alcohol (including various water-soluble derivatives of polyvinyl alcohol) is a preferred water-soluble polymer. Usually pure water-soluble polymer is coated. However, one or more surfactants and/or other additives (such as bactericide, defoamer, and water soluble dye) may be added. The releasable interlayer preferably has an average coverage of 1 to 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, more preferably 2 to 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, and most preferably 4 to 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup>.

No. 6,242,156, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0054">A water soluble or dispersible overcoat can be coated on the photosensitive layer to, for example, improve the photospeed, surface durability, and/or on-press developability of the plate. The overcoat preferably comprises a water-soluble polymer, such as polyvinyl alcohol (including various water-soluble derivatives of polyvinyl alcohol). Combination of two or more water-soluble polymers (such as a combination of polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinylpyrrolidone) may also be used. Polyvinyl alcohol is a preferred water-soluble polymer. Various additives, such as surfactant, wetting agent, defoamer, leveling agent and dispersing agent, can be added into the overcoat formulation to facilitate, for example, the coating or development process. Examples of surfactants useful in the overcoat of this invention include polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, and copolymer of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, polysiloxane surfactants, perfluorocarbon surfactants, alkylphenyl ethylene oxide condensate, sodium dioctylsulfosuccinate, sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, and ammonium laurylsulfate.

<p id="p-0063" num="0067">Infrared lasers useful for the imagewise exposure of the thermosensitive plates of this invention include laser sources emitting in the near infrared region, i.e., emitting in the wavelength range of from 750 to 1200 nm, and preferably from 800 to 1100 nm. Particularly preferred infrared laser sources are laser diodes emitting around 830 nm or a Nd/YAG laser emitting around 1060 nm. The plate is exposed at a laser dosage that is sufficient to cause hardening or solubilization in the exposed areas but not high enough to cause substantial thermal ablation. The exposure dosage is preferably from 1 to 500 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, more preferably from 10 to 300 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, and most preferably from 50 to 200 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, depending on the sensitivity of the thermosensitive layer.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0068">Visible lasers useful for the imagewise exposure of the visible light sensitive plates of this invention include any laser emitting in the wavelength range of from 390 to 600 nm. Examples of suitable visible lasers include frequency-doubled Nd/YAG laser (about 532 nm), argon ion laser (about 488 nm), violet diode laser (about 405 nm), and visible LEDs. Violet laser diode is especially useful because of its small size and relatively lower cost. The exposure dosage is preferably from 0.001 to 2 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>(1 to 2000 &#x3bc;J/cm<sup>2</sup>), more preferably from 0.005 to 0.4 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>(5 to 400 &#x3bc;J/cm<sup>2</sup>), and most preferably from 0.02 to 0.20 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>(20 to 200 &#x3bc;J/cm<sup>2</sup>), depending on the sensitivity of the photosensitive layer.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0069">Ultraviolet lasers useful for the imagewise exposure of the ultraviolet light sensitive plates of this invention include any laser having a wavelength of from 200 to 390 nm.

<p id="p-0066" num="0070">Among the visible and ultraviolet lasers, violet or ultraviolet laser with a wavelength selected from 200 to 430 nm is particularly useful.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0071">Laser imaging devices are currently widely available commercially. Any device can be used which provides imagewise laser exposure according to digital imaging information. Commonly used imaging devices include flatbed imager, internal drum imager, and external drum imager, all of which can be used for the imagewise laser exposure in this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0072">The plate is exposed on an exposure device, applied with a light-blocking material preferably on a light-blocking material application device, and then mounted on press to develop with ink and/or fountain solution and then print out regular printed sheets. Preferably, the plate is under a safe light or in substantial darkness during imagewise exposure and application of the light-blocking material, and is under white light during on-press development and printing. The ink and/or fountain solution solubilized or dispersed photosensitive layer (and overcoat if any) can be mixed into the ink and/or the fountain solution on the rollers, and/or can be transferred to the blanket and then the receiving medium (such as paper). The fountain solution roller is engaged (to the plate cylinder as for conventional inking system or to the ink roller as for integrated inking system) for preferably 0 to 100 rotations, more preferably 1 to 50 rotations and most preferably 5 to 20 rotations (of the plate cylinder), and the ink roller is then engaged to the plate cylinder for preferably 0 to 100 rotations, more preferably 1 to 50 rotations and most preferably 5 to 20 rotations before engaging the plate cylinder and feeding the receiving medium. Good quality prints should be obtained preferably under 40 initial impressions, more preferably under 20 impressions, and most preferably under 5 impressions.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0073">For conventional wet press, usually fountain solution is applied (to contact the plate) first, followed by contacting with ink roller. For press with integrated inking/dampening system, the ink and fountain solution are emulsified by various press rollers before being transferred to the plate as emulsion of ink and fountain solution. However, in this invention, the ink and fountain solution may be applied at any combination or sequence, as needed for the plate. There is no particular limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0074">The ink used in this application can be any ink suitable for lithographic printing. Most commonly used lithographic inks include &#x201c;oil based ink&#x201d; which crosslinks upon exposure to the oxygen in the air and &#x201c;rubber based ink&#x201d; which does not crosslink upon exposure to the air. Specialty inks include, for example, radiation-curable ink and thermally curable ink. An ink is an oleophilic, liquid or viscous material which generally comprises a pigment dispersed in a vehicle, such as vegetable oils, animal oils, mineral oils, and synthetic resins. Various additives, such as plasticizer, surfactant, drier, drying retarder, crosslinker, and solvent may be added to achieve certain desired performance. The compositions of typical lithographic inks are described in &#x201c;The Manual of Lithography&#x201d; by Vicary, Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, and Chapter 8 of &#x201c;The Radiation Curing: Science and Technology&#x201d; by Pappas, Plenum Press, New York, 1992.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0075">The fountain solution used in this application can be any fountain solution used in lithographic printing. Fountain solution is used in the wet lithographic printing press to dampen the hydrophilic areas (non-image areas), repelling ink (which is hydrophobic) from these areas. Fountain solution contains mainly water, generally with addition of certain additives such as gum arabic and surfactant. Small amount of alcohol such as isopropanol can also be added in the fountain solution. Water is the simplest type of fountain solution. Fountain solution is usually neutral to mildly acidic. The type of fountain solution used depends on the type of the plate substrate as well as the photosensitive layer. Various fountain solution compositions are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,030,417 and 4,764,213.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0076">The plate of this invention is on-press developed with ink and/or fountain solution. Preferably, the plate is a wet plate which is on-press developed with ink and/or fountain solution, or a waterless plate which is on-press developed with ink. More preferably, the plate is a wet plate which is on-press developed with ink and/or fountain solution. Most preferably, the plate is a wet plate with oleophilic photosensitive layer and hydrophilic substrate and is on-press developed with both ink and fountain solution.</p>

<p id="p-0083" num="0087">The thermosensitive layer coated plate was further coated with a water-soluble overcoat OC-1 using a #6 Meyer rod, followed by hot air blow drying and baking in an oven at 100&#xb0; C. for 2 min. The plate was coated and handled under a yellow room light.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0088">The coated plate was exposed with an infrared laser imager equipped with laser diodes emitting at about 830 nm (Lotem 400 from Creo) at a dosage of about 300 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>. The exposed areas of the plate showed brown color, while the non-exposed areas remain light green.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0089">Half of the above laser exposed plate was applied with a layer of NO-AD Maximum Sun Block Lotion (SPF 45 for UVA and UVB, from Solar Cosmetic Labs, Inc., Miami Lakes, Fla.), with the other half not applied with anything. The plate was further exposed to the white room light (from white fluorescent lamps with 80 watts in total) for 2 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0090">The plate was then tested on a lithographic press (AB Dick 360) under white fluorescent light. The plate was directly mounted on the plate cylinder of the press. After starting the press, the fountain roller was engaged for 20 rotations, the ink roller (carrying emulsion of ink and fountain solution) was applied to the plate cylinder for 20 rotations, and the plate cylinder was then engaged with the blanket cylinder and printed with paper for 200 impressions. The half of the plate applied with the sun block lotion showed clean background in the laser non-exposed areas and good inking in the laser exposed areas. In contrast, the half of the plate not applied with the sun block lotion showed background toning in the laser non-exposed areas and good inking in the laser exposed areas.</p>
