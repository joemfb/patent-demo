<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of communications technologies, and in particular, to a method, a base station, a base station controller and a system for setting up a radio link.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a WCDMA system, a NodeB (base station of the WCDMA system) performs signaling interaction with an RNC (Radio Network Controller, radio network controller or base station controller) to enable the RNC to learn resources and capabilities of the NodeB, and set up, add or reconfigure a radio link according to the resources and capabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">After establishing a local cell, the NodeB actively initiates a resource status indication message, in order to notify the RNC of resources and capabilities established by the NodeB in the cell. The message includes an HSUPA (High Speed Uplink Packet Access, high speed uplink packet access) E-DCH (Enhanced Dedicated Channel, enhanced dedicated channel) capability consumption rule, that is, an E-DCH CE (Channel Element, channel element) consumption rule. According to the resource status indication message reported by the NodeB, the RNC sets a GBR (Guaranteed BitRate, guaranteed bit rate) of a radio link that is to be set up or reconfigured, and initiates a radio link setup, addition or reconfiguration process.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When the resources and capabilities of the NodeB change, the NodeB actively requests the RNC to initiate an audit request message used for auditing the changed resources and capabilities of the NodeB, or when the RNC detects that resources and capabilities of the NodeB which are maintained by itself are not consistent with those reported by the NodeB side or are abnormal, the RNC actively initiates an audit request message to the NodeB, and the NodeB reports the changed resources and capabilities through an audit response message in response to the audit request message initiated by the RNC, where an HSUPA E-DCH capability consumption rule is included.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, when mixed insertion of new and old baseband boards occurs in the NodeB, as the new and old baseband boards have different E-DCH CE consumption rules, a problem that which E-DCH CE consumption rule is used for reporting to the RNC arises. Currently, a solution to this problem is mainly: the NodeB selects an E-DCH CE consumption rule for reporting, according to the principle of highest processing capability. For example, generally, the new baseband board has a higher processing capability than the old baseband board, and consumes less CEs under the same SF (Spread Factor, spread factor); therefore, the CE consumption rule of the new baseband board is used for reporting to the RNC. The RNC maintains a set of CE resource use status of the NodeB according to the received CE consumption rule, mainly including the number of consumed CEs and the number of remaining CEs.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The inventor finds that the prior art has at least the following problems: when mixed insertion of new and old baseband boards occurs in the NodeB, as the CE consumption rule maintained by the RNC side is not completely consistent with the CE consumption rules in the NodeB side of different baseband boards, a problem of false admission of the RNC side arises as the number of accessing users increases.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments of the present invention provide a method, a base station, a base station controller and a system for setting up a radio link, which can effectively ensure the uniformity of channel element resources maintained by the base station side and the base station controller side, thereby avoiding the problem of false admission of a base station controller side in the prior art which results from accumulative errors caused by inconsistency of channel elements maintained by the base station controller side and the base station side.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The technical solutions according to the embodiments of the present invention will be clearly and comprehensively described in the following with reference to the accompanying drawings. It is obvious that the embodiments to be described are only a part rather than all of the embodiments of the present invention. All other embodiments obtained by persons of ordinary skill in the art based on the embodiments of the present invention without creative efforts shall fall within the protection scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the prior art of the embodiments of the present invention, when mixed insertion of new and old baseband boards occurs in a NodeB, the NodeB generally needs to select a CE consumption rule of the new baseband board (referred to as new board for short below, the old baseband board being referred to as old board for short below) for reporting to an RNC, according to the principle of highest processing capability; an RNC side may maintain the CE consumption rule of the new board, and deliver a radio link setup request to the NodeB according to the CE consumption rule of the new board. As the CE consumption rules of the new and old baseband boards are not consistent, when the RNC uses resources of the old board in the NodeB to set up a radio link, a problem of mismatching of the CE consumption rule of the new board and CEs of the old board exists, resulting in false admission of the RNC side. In view of the problem in the prior art, the embodiments of the present invention provide a method, a base station and a base station controller for setting up a radio link, which can effectively ensure the uniformity of CE resources maintained by the NodeB side and the RNC side, thereby desirably solving the problem in the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">To make the technical solutions of specific embodiments of the present invention more comprehensible, the technical solutions are described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a specific embodiment of the present invention provides a method (1) for setting up a radio link from the view of a base station. The method may include the following steps.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Step <b>101</b>: Send a message to a base station controller, where the message includes channel element consumption rules of a new board and an old board in a base station.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Step <b>102</b>: Instruct the base station controller to set up a radio link according to the channel element consumption rule of the old board when determining that the actual number of assignable channel elements of the old board does not satisfy a radio link setup request sent according to the channel element consumption rule of the new board by the base station controller.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In an implementation scenario, the specific process of step <b>101</b> may include:</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">(1) generating an audit response message that includes the channel element consumption rules of the new board and the old board and is in response to an audit request message received from the base station controller; or generating a resource status indication message including the channel element consumption rules of the new board and the old board after a local cell is established; and</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">(2) sending the audit response message or the resource status indication message to the base station controller.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Specifically, the resource status indication message is a report message used by the base station to notify the base station controller of resources and capabilities established in the local cell after the local cell is established, and the base station controller delivers a radio link setup request to the base station according to the resources and capabilities reported by the base station.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The audit response message is a response message in response to a received audit request message initiated by the base station controller. A process of sending the audit request message is as follows: when the resources and capabilities of the NodeB change, the NodeB actively requests the RNC to send an audit request message used for auditing the changed resources and capabilities of the NodeB, so that the RNC obtains the latest resources and capabilities of the NodeB, and sets up a radio link according to the latest resources and capabilities; or when resources and capabilities maintained by the RNC are not consistent with those reported by the NodeB, the RNC actively sends an audit request message to the NodeB, so as to obtain the latest resources and capabilities of the NodeB.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In an implementation scenario, after step <b>101</b> is completed, generally, a radio link setup request sent by the base station controller is received, where the request includes the theoretical number of channel elements required to be consumed for radio link setup and the theoretical number is determined according to the channel element consumption rule of the new board.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In an implementation scenario, the specific process of step <b>102</b> may include:</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">judging, according to the received radio link setup request sent according to the channel element consumption rule of the new board by the base station controller, whether the actual number of assignable channel elements of the old board satisfies the theoretical number of channel elements in the radio link setup request (that is, whether to satisfy the radio link setup request), and when determining, according to the channel element consumption rule of the old board, that the actual number of channel elements required to be consumed for radio link setup is larger than the number of assignable channel elements of the old board, sending a setup failure response to the base station controller, where the setup failure response may carry the actual number of channel elements required to be consumed for radio link setup and a setup failure cause being insufficient channel elements of the old board, so as to instruct the base station controller to set up a radio link according to the channel element consumption rule of the old board.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Further, the method according to the embodiment of the present invention may further include:</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">when determining, according to the channel element consumption rule of the new board or the old board, that the actual number of channel elements of the new board or the old board, where the channel elements are required to be consumed for radio link setup, is smaller than or equal to the actual number of assignable channel elements of the new board or the old board, determining that the radio link setup request sent according to the channel element consumption rule of the new board or the old board by the base station controller is satisfied; and sending a setup success response to the base station controller, where the setup success response includes the actual number of channel elements consumed when channel elements of the new board or the old board are used for radio link setup, so that the base station controller uses the actual number of channel elements to replace the theoretical number of channel elements in the radio link setup request, and obtains the actual number of remaining assignable channel elements.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Specifically, as the NodeB carries the channel element consumption rules of the new board and the old board through the resource status indication message or the audit response message, the RNC side maintains new and old CE consumption rules. According to the principle of highest processing capability, the RNC preferentially initiates a radio link setup request to the NodeB according to the CE consumption rule of the new board. Upon receiving the radio link setup request, the base station side preferentially uses CEs of the new board, and makes a determination regarding CE resources of the new board or the old board in the base station, so as to determine whether the CE resources of the new board or the old board in the base station satisfy the setup request. In an implementation scenario, the base station determines the actual number of CEs, which are required to be consumed, of the new board or the old board for radio link setup, according to the actual number of assignable CEs of the new board or the old board in the base station on the basis of the CE consumption rule of the new board or the old board; compares the actual number of CEs, which are required to be consumed, of the new board or the old board with the actual number of assignable CEs of the new board or the old board in the base station, and when the actual number of CEs required to be consumed is smaller than or equal to the actual number of assignable CEs of the new board or the old board in the base station, that is, the actual number of assignable CEs are sufficient for the radio link setup, it indicates that the radio link setup request is satisfied, and then a setup success response is sent to the base station controller.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">For example, the base station delivers, to the base station, a setup request of adding an SF16 radio link, according to the CE consumption rule of the new board. The base station preferentially uses CEs of the new board (there are five CEs on the new board) for setup. As CE resources of the new board match the CE consumption rule of the new board, the base station determines, according to the CE consumption rule of the new board, that the actual number of CEs consumed is 4, which is equal to the theoretical number being 4 in the setup request. As the actual number of assignable resources of the new board in the base station satisfies the setup request, the problem of accumulative errors of resources does not occur. The base station feeds back, to the base station controller, a setup success response message carrying the actual number of CEs consumed for setup of SF16, where the actual number is 4.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Specifically, when all CEs of the new board are consumed and CEs of the old board start to be used for radio link setup, the base station controller can only learn the number of remaining channel elements but does not learn the specific assignment of CEs of the new board and the old board, so that when the base station uses CEs of the old board for radio link setup according to the CE rule of the new board, as the processing capability of CEs of the old board is weaker than that of CEs of the new board, the actual number of CEs consumed during radio link setup is larger than the theoretical number of CEs determined according to the CE rule of the new board. Specifically, the following two cases may be included.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">(1) When the base station controller sends a radio link setup request to the base station according to the CE consumption rule of the new board, if the actual number of CEs required to be consumed, where the actual number of CEs is determined by the base station according to the CE consumption rule of the old board, is smaller than or equal to the actual number of assignable channel elements of the old board in the base station, the number of CEs required to be consumed in the setup request is satisfied as the number of remaining CEs of the old board is large enough. In this case, the base station feeds back a setup success response to the base station controller, and carries the actual number of consumed CEs in the message, so as to ensure that the base station controller side can obtain the actual remaining number.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">For example, the number of CEs of the old board in the base station is 3, the base station controller delivers, to the base station, a setup request of adding an SF32 radio link, and the base station determines, according to the CE consumption rule of the old board, that the actual number of CEs required to be consumed is 3, which is larger than the theoretical number of CEs that is 2 in the setup request and is determined according to the CE consumption rule of the new board, and is equal to the number of CEs of the old board being 3 in the base station, so that the setup request can be satisfied. In this case, a setup success response carrying the actual number of CEs consumed for setup of SF32 is sent to the base station controller, where the actual number is 3.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">(2) When the base station controller delivers a radio link setup request according to the number of remaining CEs maintained by the base station controller and according to the CE consumption rule of the new board, the base station determines, according to the CE consumption rule of the old board, the actual number of CEs required to be consumed for radio link setup, and when judging that the actual number of CEs required to be consumed is larger than the actual number of assignable CEs of the old board, determines that CEs of the old board are insufficient, and sends a setup failure response to the base station controller, where the setup failure response carries the actual number of channel elements and a failure cause being insufficient channel elements of the old board. After receiving the setup failure response, the base station controller determines that the failure cause is insufficient CE resources of the old board, and delivers a radio link setup request to the base station according to the CE consumption rule of the old board maintained by the base station controller. In this way, the uniformity of resources of the base station side and the RNC side is ensured, thereby avoiding introduction of accumulative errors.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">For example, the number of remaining CEs maintained by the base station controller side is 4, and the base station controller sends, to the base station, a request of adding an SF16 radio link, according to the number of remaining CEs and according to the CE consumption rule of the new board. After receiving the request, the base station determines, according to the CE consumption rule of the old board, that the number of channel elements required to be consumed for setup of SF16 is 6, which is larger than the theoretical number being 4 in the request, and is larger than the actual number of remaining assignable CEs being 4, that is, the request is not satisfied, and a failure response message (that is, a setup failure response) is sent to the base station controller, so as to instruct the base station controller to set up a radio link according to the CE consumption rule of the old board, where an SF32 radio link may be set up.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In an implementation scenario, a private interface field may be added in the message sent to the base station controller to carry the channel element consumption rule of the old board. The embodiments of the present invention are not limited to the manner of adding a private interface field to carry the CE consumption rule of the old board, and all other means for carrying the CE consumption rule of the old board fall within the protection scope of the embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the method according to the embodiment of the present invention, the CE consumption rule of the old board is carried in the resource status indication message or the audit response message sent to the base station, so as to notify the RNC that new and old baseband boards are mixed at the base station side; when the number of CEs of the base station side satisfies the setup request delivered by the RNC, the actual number of CEs consumed at the base station side is carried in a setup response message sent to the base station, so that the RNC can obtain the actual condition of remaining resources; by maintaining the channel element consumption rule of the old board at the RNC side, when the setup request fails due to insufficient CEs of the old board of the base station side, the RNC, attempts to use the CE consumption rule of the old board to initiate radio link setup, so as to ensure consistency of resources and rules of the base station side in time, thereby avoiding accumulative errors.</p>

<p id="p-0116" num="0115">To better illustrate the technical solutions of the present invention, specific embodiments are illustrated below.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Embodiment 1 of the Present Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the embodiment of the present invention is illustrated through an example that CE consumption rules of a new board and an old board of a base station are carried in a resource status indication message sent by the base station to a base station controller.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Step <b>501</b>: A NodeB reports a resource status indication message to an RNC, where the message carries CE consumption rules of a new board and an old board of a base station.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In an implementation scenario, when mixed insertion of new and old baseband boards occurs in the base station, an E-DCH CE consumption rule of the new baseband board is selected according to the principle of highest processing capability and reported to the RNC; the CE consumption rule of the old board may be sent to the RNC by adding a private interface field in the message.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Step <b>502</b>: The RNC receives the resource status indication message, and sends a request of setting up an SF16 RL (radio link), that is, a radio link setup request of setting up an SF16 RL, to the NodeB according to the CE consumption rule of the new board.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Specifically, the RNC saves the resource status indication message, and maintains the new and old CE consumption rules. For example, the RNC learns, according to the resource status indication message reported by the NodeB, that the NodeB has a total of 20 CEs (the new and old boards each have 10 CEs), and preferentially selects the CE consumption rule of the new board and considers to use the rule in full configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Step <b>503</b>: The NodeB receives an SF16 RL signaling, and returns a setup success response message (that is, setup success response).</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">After receiving the SF16 RL signaling message, the NodeB preferentially selects to set up the RL on the new baseband board, determines, according to the CE consumption rule of the new baseband board, that the actual number of CEs consumed for setup of SF16 is 4, which is smaller than the actual number of assignable CEs of the new board being 10, indicating that the SF16 RL request is satisfied. Then, a setup success response is fed back to the RNC, and the actual number of CEs consumed for setup of SF16 being 4 is carried by adding a private interface field in the setup success response message (that is, the setup success response).</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Step <b>504</b>: The RNC uses the actual number of CEs being 4 in the private interface field to update the number of consumed CEs to 4, according to the received setup success response.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">As the base station preferentially uses the new baseband board for radio link setup, the theoretical number of CEs determined according to the CE consumption rule of the new board is equal to the actual number of CEs consumed at the base station side (the CE number being 4).</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Step <b>505</b>: The RNC delivers an RL addition signaling to add an SF16 RL.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Step <b>506</b>: The NodeB preferentially selects to set up the RL on the new baseband board, and returns a setup success response.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">A private interface field in the setup success response carries the actual number of CEs consumed for setup of SF16 being 4 which is determined by the base station according to the CE consumption rule of the new and the actual number of CEs being 4 is smaller than the actual number of remaining assignable CEs of the new board being 6.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Step <b>507</b>: The RNC uses the actual number of CEs being 4 in the private interface field to update the number of consumed CEs to 8, according to the setup success response received from the NodeB.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Step <b>508</b>: The RNC delivers an RL setup signaling, that is, a radio link setup request, to set up an SF32 RL.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Step <b>509</b>: The NodeB preferentially selects to set up the RL on the new baseband board, and returns a setup success response.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">A private interface field in the setup success response carries the actual number of CEs consumed for setup of SF32 being 2 which is determined according to the CE consumption rule of the new board, and the actual number of CEs being 2 is equal to the number of CEs of the new board being 2.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Step <b>510</b>: The RNC uses the actual number being 2 in the private interface field to update the number of consumed CEs to 10, according to the received setup success response.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Step <b>511</b>: The RNC delivers an RL setup signaling, to set up an SF32 RL.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Step <b>512</b>: As all CE resources on the new baseband board are consumed, the NodeB selects to set up the RL on the old baseband board, and returns a setup success response according to the CE consumption rule of the old baseband board.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">A private interface field in the response message carries the actual number of CEs consumed for setup of SF32 being 3 which is determined by the base station according to the consumption rule of the old board, and the actual number of CEs being 3 is smaller than the actual number of assignable CEs of the old board being 10.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Step <b>513</b>: The RNC uses the actual number of CEs being 3 in the private interface field to update the number of consumed CEs to 13, according to the received setup success response.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">The theoretical number of consumed CEs determined by the RNC side according to the CE consumption rule of the new board is 2, so that if the actual number of consumed CEs is not used to update the theoretical number of consumed CEs, accumulative errors are caused. The application of the embodiment of the present invention avoids this problem.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Step <b>514</b>: The RNC delivers an RLS reconfiguration signaling, to reconfigure an RL, which is set up previously, from SF32 to SF16.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Step <b>515</b>: A resource management module of the NodeB selects to reconfigure an SF16 RL on the old baseband board, and returns a setup success response according to the CE consumption rule of the old baseband board.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">A private interface field in the setup success response carries the actual number of CEs consumed for setup of SF32 being 6 which is determined by the base station according to the CE consumption rule of the old board, and the actual number of CEs being 6 is smaller than the actual number of remaining assignable CEs of the old board being 10 (the number of CEs required to be consumed for setup of SF16 in the CE consumption rule of the old baseband board is 6, and the number of CEs required to be consumed for setup of SF16 on the new baseband board is 4).</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Step <b>516</b>: The RNC uses the actual number being 6 in the private interface field to update the number of consumed CEs to 16, according to the received setup success response.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Step <b>517</b>: The RNC delivers an RL setup signaling, that is, a radio link setup request, to set up an SF32 RL.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Step <b>518</b>: The NodeB selects to set up the RL on the old baseband board, and returns a setup success response according to the CE consumption rule of the old baseband board.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">A private interface field in the setup success response carries the actual number of CEs consumed for setup of SF32 being 3 which is determined by the base station according to the CE consumption rule of the old board, and the actual number of CEs being 3 is smaller than the number of remaining CEs of the old board being 4 (the number of CEs required to be consumed for setup of SF32 is 3 in the CE consumption rule of the old baseband board, and is 4 in the CE consumption rule of the new baseband board).</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Step <b>519</b>: The RNC uses the actual number of CEs being 3 in the private interface field to update the number of consumed CEs to 19, according to the received setup success response.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Step <b>520</b>: The RNC detects that the number of used CEs is 19 and no more SF32 or SF16 RL setup requests can be satisfied, and accordingly, setup of an RL is no longer initiated.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">If the method according to the embodiment of the present invention is not used, the RNC can only set up or reconfigure an RL according to the CE consumption rule reported by the NodeB (the CE consumption rule of the new baseband board), and uses the CE consumption rule of the new baseband board for matching even if CEs on the old baseband board are used. In this way, after the above 19 steps are completed, it is determined that there are still <b>4</b> idle CEs in the NodeB (in fact, the remaining CEs on the new and old baseband boards do not allow admission any more), and therefore admission of new RLs in the NodeB may be allowed; however, at this time, neither the new baseband board nor the old baseband board in the NodeB can provide CEs required for admission of one RL, resulting in false admission.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">If can be seen from the above embodiments that the channel element consumption rule of the old board carried in the resource status indication message sent to the base station controller is not used, because in Embodiment 1, a case, in which the base station determines that the channel elements of either the new board or the old board in the base station can satisfy the setup request after the base station receives the radio link setup request delivered by the base station controller, is used as an application scenario of this embodiment, and Embodiment 2 may clearly illustrate the process of using the channel element consumption rule of the old board.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">As the channel element consumption rule of the old board carried in the resource status indication message sent by the base station controller is not used in the above embodiment, step <b>501</b> may be omitted, and in the case where the base station determines that the channel elements of either the new board or the old board in the base station can satisfy the setup request after the base station receives the radio link setup request delivered by the base station controller, the actual number of consumed CEs may still be carried in the setup success response returned to the base station controller, so as to enable the base station controller to learn the actual number of available CEs.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Embodiment 2 of the Present Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the embodiment of the present invention is illustrated through an example that a base station sends a resource status indication message to a base station controller, and is another application scenario of Embodiment 1.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Embodiment 2 is different from Embodiment 1 in that, when the base station controller send a setup request to the base station according to the channel element consumption rule of the new board, and the actual number of assignable channel elements of the old board of the base station side is insufficient for setup of a radio link (the actual number of CEs, where the CEs are required to be consumed and the actual number of CEs is determined according to the channel element consumption rule of the old board, is larger than the number of channel elements of the old board), a setup failure response is sent to the base station controller.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">A specific process is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Step <b>601</b>: A NodeB actively sends a resource status indication message to an RNC after a local cell is established, where the message carries a channel element consumption rule of an old board.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">In the embodiment of the present invention, a private interface field is added in the resource status indication message to carry the CE consumption rule of the old board for reporting to the RNC.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Step <b>602</b>: After receiving the resource status indication message sent by the NodeB, the RNC delivers a radio link setup message according to a CE consumption rule of a new board.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Step <b>603</b>: After receiving the radio link setup message, the NodeB returns a setup failure response carrying a failure cause being insufficient CE resources of the old board when the NodeB determines that the actual number of assignable CEs of the old board is insufficient.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">After the NodeB receives the radio link setup message delivered by the RNC, when the number of CEs of the new board or the old board maintained by the NodeB is larger than or equal to the actual number of CEs that is specified according to channel elements of the old board, the NodeB feeds back a success response message to the RNC, carries the actual number of CEs, consumed while admission is allowed, in the success response message, uses the actual number of CEs consumed to replace the theoretical number of CEs determined by the RNC side according to the CE consumption rule of the new board, and determines the actual number of remaining CEs (which is the same as the technical solution described in Embodiment 1).</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">When the NodeB uses CEs of the old board, and determines, according to the CE consumption rule of the old board, that the actual number of consumed CEs is larger than the number of CEs of the old board, the NodeB feeds back a failure response message to the RNC, and carries, in the failure response message, the actual number of CEs required to be consumed and a failure cause being insufficient CEs of the old board.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Step <b>604</b>: The RNC checks the failure cause after receiving the failure response, and if determining that the actual number of assignable CE resources of the old board is insufficient, the RNC attempts to use a maintained CE consumption rule of the old board to reinitiate a radio link setup message.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">The embodiment of the present invention clearly illustrates another special condition of Embodiment 1, and in an application scenario where insufficient resources of the old board leads to admission failure, the importance of maintaining both the new and old CE consumption rules at the base station controller is indicated, and the uniformity of resources of the base station side and the controller side is ensured.</p>

<p id="p-0163" num="0162">When resources and capabilities of a NodeB change, a private interface field is added in an audit response message in response to an audit request message delivered by an RNC. A specific process is as follows.</p>

<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Step <b>702</b>: The NodeB adds a private interface field between the RNC and the NodeB to the audit response message, and if new and old baseband boards have different CE consumption rules, reports the CE consumption rule of the old board through the private interface field.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">Step <b>703</b>: The RNC initiates a radio link setup message to the NodeB according to the CE consumption rule of the new board.</p>
