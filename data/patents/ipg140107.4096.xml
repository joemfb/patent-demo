<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Using fixed-layout document format (e.g., XPS) in a printing solution generally involves creation of a fixed-layout document (e.g., XPS document) that is later passed as a spool file to the print sub-system. Often, this fixed-layout document contains font resources used to reproduce the fixed-layout document. Including font resources is helpful when the fixed-layout document is sent from a client to another computing device (e.g., print server), since the other computing device might not have fonts to which the client had access. Embedding all the fonts in the fixed-layout document can generate a large file that is time consuming to create and communicate between components. Subsetting the fonts (i.e., creating a smaller version of the same font that contains only the necessary font elements (e.g., glyphs) used in the file) can reduce the size of the file; however, subsetting the fonts can delay the start of the printing.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Returning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an exemplary operating environment suitable for practicing an embodiment of the invention is depicted and identified generally by reference numeral <b>210</b>. Environment <b>210</b> includes documents <b>214</b>, <b>226</b>, and <b>228</b>, a subsetting optimizer <b>230</b>, a font subsetter <b>232</b>, and a print subsystem <b>234</b>. In an embodiment of the present invention, subsetting optimizer <b>230</b> and font subsetter <b>232</b> process documents <b>214</b>, <b>226</b>, and <b>228</b> on a per document basis prior to each document <b>214</b>, <b>226</b>, and <b>228</b> being sent to print subsystem <b>234</b>. For example, when document <b>214</b> is being converted to a printer-friendly format (e.g., XPS or other fixed-layout document format), subsetting optimizer <b>230</b> and font subsetter <b>232</b> cooperate to subset fonts <b>218</b>, <b>236</b>, and <b>238</b> in a manner that optimizes spool-file size and an amount of time that passes before printing is initiated (i.e., print start time). Documents <b>214</b>, <b>226</b>, <b>228</b> might include a variety of formats, such as DIRECT2D, that are convertible to a fixed-layout document format when being printed.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Each of documents <b>214</b>, <b>226</b>, and <b>228</b> <b>238</b> are depicted to include a font type <b>218</b>, <b>236</b>, and <b>238</b>. Likewise, each font type <b>218</b>, <b>236</b>, and <b>238</b> includes a font file <b>216</b>, <b>240</b>, and <b>242</b>. Generally, a font file defines a font type by including a set of elements (e.g., glyphs, characters, symbols, etc) that are usable by a computing device to produce renderings of the font type. For example, font file <b>216</b> includes a set of elements that are usable to render font type <b>218</b> within document <b>214</b>. For illustrative purposes, font type <b>218</b> is depicted as &#x201c;font type A,&#x201d; font type <b>236</b> is also depicted as &#x201c;font type A,&#x201d; and font type <b>238</b> is depicted as &#x201c;font type ZX.&#x201d; In an embodiment of the present invention, font file <b>216</b>, <b>240</b>, and <b>242</b> includes a complete set of elements that are used to render a respective font, regardless of whether a glyph of the font type is included in a respective document. For example, font file <b>216</b> includes a complete set of elements that are used to render font type <b>218</b>, regardless of whether a glyph of font type <b>218</b> is included in document <b>214</b>. Only one font type of each document is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>; however, each of documents <b>214</b>, <b>226</b>, and <b>228</b> might also include additional font types. That is, although for illustrative purposes each document <b>214</b>, <b>226</b>, and <b>228</b> is depicted with one font type, a document often includes multiple different font types on each page and throughout the document. In addition, each of documents <b>214</b>, <b>226</b>, and <b>228</b> include a quantity of pages <b>220</b>, <b>244</b>, and <b>246</b>. That is, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates that document <b>214</b> includes 17 pages and that page 1 of 17 is being depicted Likewise, document <b>226</b> includes 22 pages, and page 1 of 22 is being depicted. Document <b>228</b> includes 14 pages, and page 1 of 14 is being depicted.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In another embodiment, subsetting optimizer <b>230</b> determines whether a font file (e.g., <b>216</b>, <b>240</b>, and <b>242</b>) should be subsetted. Subsetting a font file includes, when generating a fixed-layout document, including only those elements (e.g., glyphs, characters, symbols, etc.) of a font that are included in the document. Moreover, subsetting optimizer <b>230</b> determines how a font file should be subsetted. Subsetting optimizer <b>230</b> includes a page-number evaluator <b>248</b>, which determines whether a number of pages (e.g., <b>220</b>, <b>244</b>, and <b>246</b>) included in a document satisfies a subsetting-optimization threshold (described in more detail hereinafter). For example, when a number of pages in a document satisfies a subsetting-optimization threshold, a font file is subsetted. Subsetting optimizer <b>230</b> also includes a font-size evaluator <b>252</b>, which determines whether a font size exceeds a font-size threshold. For example, when a size of a font exceeds a font-size threshold, the font file is subsetted based on use throughout the entire document&#x2014;as opposed to subsetting the font file as the font is used in pages sets.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to further describe a subsetting-optimization threshold. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts various test-group documents <b>312</b>, <b>314</b>, <b>316</b>, and <b>318</b>. As depicted by arrows <b>320</b>, <b>322</b>, <b>324</b>, and <b>326</b>, each test-group document is subsetted, such that a plurality of subsetted font files are generated for each test-group document. Then, each subsetted font file is provided to a respective print subsystem <b>346</b>, <b>348</b>, <b>350</b>, and <b>352</b>. For example, when test-group document <b>312</b> is subset, four subsetted font files <b>328</b>, <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, and <b>334</b> are generated. That is, test-group document <b>312</b> includes 20 pages and is subset in 5-page blocks, thereby generating four subsetted font files <b>328</b>, <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, and <b>334</b>. The four subsetted font files <b>328</b>, <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, and <b>334</b> each apply to a respective range of pages within the 20 pages of document <b>312</b>. That is, subsetted font file <b>328</b> includes elements of a font type that are included within pages 1-5 of document <b>314</b> and omits elements that are not included within pages 1-5.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Test-group document <b>314</b> is subsetted in page blocks that are different than the 5-page blocks applied to document <b>314</b>. As depicted by arrow <b>322</b>, document <b>314</b> is subsetted in 4-page blocks, thereby generating five subsetted font files <b>336</b>, <b>338</b>, <b>340</b>, <b>342</b>, and <b>344</b>. The five subsetted font files <b>336</b>, <b>338</b>, <b>340</b>, <b>342</b>, and <b>344</b> each apply to a respective range of pages within the 20 pages of document <b>314</b>. For example, subsetted file <b>336</b> includes elements of a font type that are included within pages 1-4 of document <b>314</b> and omits elements that are not included within pages 1-4. Test-group document <b>316</b> is subsetted in page blocks that are different than both document <b>312</b> and document <b>314</b>. Document <b>318</b> and arrow <b>326</b> illustrate that a test-group document could include any number of pages (i.e., 1&#x2212;N) and could be subsetted in page blocks having any number of pages (i.e., 1&#x2212;Z).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Subsetting test-group documents <b>312</b>, <b>314</b>, <b>316</b>, and <b>318</b>, which have different page numbers, has varying effects on overall print performance, when considering various print-performance metrics, such as efficiency, time required to print a document, and time prior to initiation of printing. For example, subsetting in 4-page blocks versus 5-page blocks might allow subsetted font file <b>336</b> of document <b>314</b> to be submitted to a print subsystem faster (e.g., time is depicted by arrow <b>345</b>) than a subsetted font file <b>328</b>, since subsetting five pages takes longer than subsetting four pages. Also important is the fact that the font batch cannot be sent to the printer until all drawing of a set of pages have been completed. So, a delay might include, not only the time it takes to prepare the subsetted font, but to prepare all of the next page. However, subsetting in 4-page blocks might generate a higher (i.e., undesirable) amount of subsetted-font-element overlap between each of subsetted files <b>336</b>, <b>338</b>, <b>340</b>, <b>342</b>, and <b>344</b>. For example, if document <b>314</b> is a word processing document, pages 1-4 of document <b>314</b> and pages 5-8 of document <b>314</b> might include a lot of the same elements (e.g., letters) of a font, such that when subsetting in 4-page blocks the same elements are being repeatedly subset. Repeatedly subsetting a same element can result in undesired inefficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">An embodiment of the present invention is directed to balancing print-performance metrics, such as printing start time and efficiency. For example, print-performance metrics are balanced by controlling a size (e.g., page numbers) of document that is allowed to be subsetted. In addition, metrics are balanced by controlling a quantity of subsetted files that are generated for a font, as well as a size (i.e., page-number size) of page sets that are subsetted, i.e., by controlling how many pages are subset prior to batching. Moreover, metrics are balanced by controlling a size of font files that are subsetted. That is, data generated by subsetting and printing documents <b>312</b>, <b>314</b>, <b>316</b>, and <b>318</b> is submitted to subsetting-optimization analyzer <b>354</b>. Exemplary data that is collected by subsetting-optimization analyzer <b>354</b> includes an amount of time that is taken to generate a spool file, an amount of time that it takes to start a print request, an amount of time that it takes to finish a print request, a size of a spool file, and an amount of subsetted-font-element overlap.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an embodiment, subsetting-optimization analyzer <b>354</b> processes collected data to heuristically determine optimal subsetting parameters. Subsetting-optimization analyzer <b>354</b> includes information <b>370</b>, which is depicted in an exploded view <b>372</b> for illustrative purposes. Exploded view <b>372</b> depicts that optimal subsetting parameters include an optimal quantity of page sets per document <b>356</b> and an optimal number of pages in a page set <b>358</b>. For example, optimal quantity of page sets per document <b>356</b> might provide a quantity of page sets per document that typically yield an amount of subsetted-font-element overlap that satisfies an element-overlap threshold. Moreover, optimal number of pages in a page set <b>358</b> might typically be subsetted in a duration of time satisfies a time-duration threshold, which sets a maximum time desired to generate a spool file. A product of optimal quantity of page sets per document <b>356</b> and optimal number of pages in a page set <b>358</b> yields a subsetting-optimization threshold <b>360</b>, which can be used to manage subsetting related to other documents. Exploded view <b>372</b> depicts an exemplary embodiment in which an optimal quantity of pages sets (k) is equal to 4 sets per document, and an optimal quantity of pages in a set (x) is equal to 5 pages per set, such that a subsetting-optimization threshold (Y) is equal to 20 pages.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In addition to analyzing quantity of page sets and quantity of pages per page set, subsetting-optimization analyzer <b>354</b> might consider other factors that impact print-performance metrics. For example, subsetting-optimization analyzer <b>354</b> might analyze how font size should be taken into consideration when determining how to subset. That is, sometimes a font includes a large font size and a large superset of elements that are actually used in a document. In such a scenario, it might be determined that print-performance metrics are optimized by converting the document in its entirety, as opposed to in page blocks. As such, subsetting-optimization analyzer <b>354</b> might determine a font-size threshold, and when a font size of a font type exceeds the font-size threshold, the document is subsetted in its entirety. While printing initiation might be delayed when subsetting the document in its entirety, advantages in font-processing time and spool size are realized when the font includes a large font size and a large superset of elements that are actually used in a document.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, page-number evaluator <b>248</b> includes information <b>250</b>. In an embodiment, information <b>250</b> includes a subsetting-optimization threshold, such as subsetting-optimization threshold <b>360</b> described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As such, when processing a print request, page-number evaluator <b>248</b> can reference a subsetting-optimization threshold to determine whether a number of pages to be printed is either above or below the subsetting-optimization threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Subsetting optimizer <b>230</b> also includes a font-size evaluator <b>252</b>, which is usable to determine whether a font size of a font type (e.g., font type A) exceeds a font-size threshold. In an embodiment of the present invention, when a font size of a font type exceeds a font-size threshold, the font type is subsetted throughout the entire document, such that one subsetted font file is generated, as opposed to subsetting the font type in page sets. In an alternative embodiment, font-size evaluator <b>252</b> might include a list of font types that are known to have a font size that exceeds a font-size threshold. As such, when font-size evaluator <b>252</b> receives a font file, font-size evaluator <b>252</b> might reference the list to determine whether the font file has already been deemed to include a font size that prompts subsetting of the font in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A further embodiment includes font subsetter <b>232</b>, which subsets font files consistent with directions from subsetting optimizer <b>230</b>. For example, generating a subsetted font file might include generating a plurality of subsetted font files, each of which applies to a respective page set of a document. In such a scenario, font subsetter <b>232</b> might provide a first subsetted font file to be used to print a document prior to generation of a second subsetted font file. In this respect, printing can be initiated before spooling is completed. For example, printing of a first page can be initiated without waiting for a first batch of pages to be spooled, i.e., printing can be initiated while a font of the batch of pages is being subset. The respective page set of the document might be determined based on an optimal quantity of pages in a page set (e.g., <b>358</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). In a further embodiment, once a subsetted file has been provided to the print subsystem, font subsetter <b>232</b> communicates a subset-discard instruction, which notifies the print subsystem to discard the subsetted font file. By providing a subset-discard instruction, the print subsystem can manage its memory resources more efficiently because it knows this particular font file will not be referenced again during this print job.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In another embodiment, the font subsetter <b>232</b> subsets a font throughout all of a document, as opposed to subsetting in page blocks. For example, when a font size of the font type exceeds a font-size threshold, font subsetter <b>232</b> subsets the font type throughout the entire document, such that one subsetted font file is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a flow diagram is depicted that outlines a set of operations performed in an embodiment of the present invention. The set of operations is generally depicted by reference numeral <b>410</b> and, when describing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, reference might also be made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. Operations <b>410</b> are directed to providing font-rendering information that is usable to print a document. Operation <b>411</b> includes determining a subsetting-optimization threshold. For example, a subsetting-optimization threshold might be determined according to the description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Likewise, a subsetting-optimization threshold might be determined by referencing a stored value, such as when subsetting optimizer <b>230</b> references information <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a further embodiment, operation <b>412</b> includes receiving a font file that defines a font type included in the document, which, when printed, generates a quantity of pages. For example, any of font files <b>216</b>, <b>240</b>, and <b>242</b> might be received by subsetting optimizer <b>230</b>. That is, lines <b>215</b>, <b>227</b>, and <b>229</b> each depict a respective font file being communicated to subsetting optimizer <b>230</b>. Font file <b>216</b> defines font type <b>218</b> in document <b>214</b>, which, when printed, generates 17 pages. Font file <b>240</b> defines font type <b>236</b> in document <b>226</b>, which, when printed, generates 22 pages. As depicted font files <b>216</b> and <b>240</b> both define a same font type, which includes &#x201c;font type A.&#x201d; Font file <b>242</b> defines font type <b>238</b> in document <b>228</b>, which, when printed, generates 14 pages. Font file <b>242</b> defines &#x201c;font type ZX,&#x201d; which is different than a font type defined by font files <b>216</b> and <b>240</b>. As previously indicated, although each document <b>214</b>, <b>226</b>, and <b>228</b> is depicted with one font type, a document often includes multiple different font types on each page and throughout the document.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Operation <b>414</b> includes determining whether the quantity of pages satisfies a subsetting-optimization threshold, such as a subsetting-optimization threshold described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. For example, if a subsetting-optimization threshold is defined to be 20 pages, subsetting optimizer <b>230</b> might determine that quantity of pages <b>220</b> (which depicts &#x201c;17&#x201d; pages) does not exceed the subsetting-optimization threshold. Likewise, if a subsetting-optimization threshold is defined to be 20 pages, subsetting optimizer <b>230</b> might determine that quantity of pages <b>246</b> (which depicts &#x201c;14&#x201d; pages) does not exceed the subsetting-optimization threshold. On the other hand, if a subsetting-optimization threshold is defined to be 20 pages, subsetting optimizer <b>230</b> might determine that quantity of pages <b>244</b> (which depicts &#x201c;22&#x201d; pages) exceeds a subsetting-optimization threshold. In scenarios in which a quantity of pages exceeds a subsetting-optimization threshold, all of a font type is embedded in the fixed-layout document, such as depicted in operation <b>415</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Operation <b>416</b> includes determining whether a font size of the font type exceeds a font-size threshold. For example, font-size evaluator <b>252</b> might determine whether a font size of font type <b>218</b>, <b>236</b>, or <b>238</b> exceed a font-size threshold. That is, if a font-size threshold included 10 MB, and font type <b>218</b> was 5 MB, font-size evaluator <b>252</b> might determine that the font size of font type <b>218</b> does not exceed a font-size threshold. In another example, font type <b>238</b> might be 15 MB, such that font-size evaluator <b>252</b> would determine the size of font type <b>238</b> exceeds a 10 MB threshold. In a further embodiment, a font-size threshold is dynamic, such as by applying a threshold percentage. For example, a font-size threshold might be 60%, such that if a font file is 10 MB and a font type contains 5 MB, the font file is subset. However, in this example, if the font type contains 7 MB, the font is sent in its entirety. In another embodiment, font-size evaluator <b>252</b> might reference a list of known font types, which include a font size higher than a font-size threshold, to determine if font type <b>218</b>, <b>236</b>, or <b>238</b> is listed.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Operations <b>410</b> also include either generating a subsetted font file of a page block <b>418</b> or generating a subsetted font file of an entire document <b>420</b>. For example, information <b>254</b>, information <b>256</b>, and information <b>258</b> are being communicated from subsetting optimizer. Information <b>254</b> is identified as &#x201c;Doc. 1&#x201d; and corresponds to document <b>214</b>. Information <b>256</b> is identified as &#x201c;Doc. 3&#x201d; and corresponds to document <b>228</b>. Information <b>258</b> is identified as &#x201c;Doc. 2&#x201d; and corresponds to document <b>226</b>. Font subsetter <b>232</b> subsets &#x201c;Doc. 1&#x201d; consistent with directions provided by subsetting optimizer. For example, when quantity of pages <b>220</b> of document <b>214</b> does not exceed a subsetting-optimization threshold, and when a font size of font type <b>218</b> does not exceed a font-size threshold, font type <b>218</b> is subsetted in page blocks (i.e., operation <b>418</b>), thereby generating a plurality of subsetted font files <b>222</b>, <b>260</b>, <b>262</b>, and <b>264</b>. Each of the plurality of subsetted font files applies to a respective range of pages of document <b>214</b>. For example, subsetted font file <b>222</b> includes only elements (e.g., glyphs) of font type <b>218</b> that are included in pages 1-5 of document <b>214</b> and excludes elements that are not included in pages 1-5.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In a further embodiment, when a first subsetted font file (e.g., <b>222</b>) is generated, the first subsetted font file is forwarded to a print subsystem prior to generation of a second subsetted font file (e.g., <b>260</b>), thereby initiating printing earlier than if the entire document was subsetted. As previously described, a number of pages in a page block might be based on an optimal quantity of pages in a page set as determined by subsetting-optimization analyzer <b>354</b>. In a further embodiment, after subsetted font file <b>222</b>, <b>260</b>, <b>262</b>, and <b>264</b> is passed to print subsystem <b>234</b>, a discard control instruction <b>266</b>, <b>268</b>, <b>270</b>, and <b>272</b> is also communicated. That is, after subsetted font file <b>222</b> is passed, discard control instruction <b>266</b> is sent, thereby instructing print subsystem <b>234</b> to discard font resources that have been provided up to that point in time.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As another example, when quantity of pages <b>246</b> of document <b>228</b> does not exceed a subsetting-optimization threshold, and when a font size of font type <b>238</b> does exceed a font-size threshold, font type <b>238</b> is subset based on its use throughout Doc. 3, thereby generating a single subsetted font file <b>274</b> (i.e., operation <b>420</b>). In a further example yet, when quantity of pages <b>244</b> (i.e., &#x201c;22&#x201d; pages) of document <b>226</b> exceeds a subsetting-optimization threshold (e.g., 20 pages), Doc. 2 is not subsetted. Instead, all of font type <b>236</b> is embedded in a fixed-layout document to be printed (i.e., operation <b>415</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Operation <b>422</b> includes providing the subsetted font file to be used to print the document. For example, subsetted font files <b>222</b>, <b>260</b>, <b>262</b>, <b>264</b>, and <b>274</b> are provided to print subsystem <b>234</b>. As previously indicated, after subsetted font file <b>222</b>, <b>260</b>, <b>262</b>, and <b>264</b> is passed to print subsystem <b>234</b>, a discard control instruction <b>266</b>, <b>268</b>, <b>270</b>, and <b>272</b> is also communicated.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">One embodiment of the present invention is directed to a method of providing font-rendering information that is usable to print a document. The method includes receiving a font file that defines a font type included in the document, which, when printed, generates a quantity of pages. Further, a determination is made that the quantity of pages does not exceed a subsetting-optimization threshold. The method also includes generating a subsetted font file of the font type that does not include elements of the font type that are not in at least a portion of the document. The subsetted font file is provided to be used to print the document.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Another embodiment of the present invention is directed to one or more computer-readable media having computer executable instructions stored thereon that, when executed, facilitate a method of providing font-rendering information that is usable to print a document. The method includes determining a subsetting-optimization threshold based on one or more test-group documents, wherein a test-group document is divisible into a quantity of page sets and a page set includes a respective set of pages to be printed. The subsetting-optimization threshold is equal to a product of an optimal quantity of page sets and an optimal quantity of pages in a set of pages. A font file is received that defines a font type included in the document to be printed, which includes a quantity of pages. A determination is made that the quantity of pages does not exceed the subsetting-optimization threshold. The method also includes generating a subsetted font file of a page set of the document, wherein a page-number size of the page set is based on the optimal quantity of pages. The subsetted font file is provided to a print subsystem.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A further embodiment is directed to a system that is implemented using a computing device and that facilitates providing font-rendering information that is usable to print a document. The system includes a subsetting optimizer that receives a font file defining a font type included in the document to be printed, which includes a quantity of pages. The system also includes a page-number evaluator that determines whether the quantity of pages exceeds a subsetting-optimization threshold. The system further includes a font subsetter that generates a subsetted font file of the font type that does not include elements of the font type that are not in at least a portion of the document, wherein the subsetted font file is provided to a print subsystem.</p>
