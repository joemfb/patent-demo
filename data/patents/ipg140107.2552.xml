<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a U.S. national stage application claiming the benefit of International Application No. PCT/JP2008/063743, filed on Jul. 31, 2008, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a reaction apparatus including a capillary having an inner surface to which a probe molecule that specifically binds to an analyte is immobilized, and relates to a process of the reaction.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Reaction apparatuses utilizing affinity detection, which uses a substance that selectively binds to a specific molecule for selectively detecting a substance that corresponds to the molecule, have been developed. For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2002-202305 (Patent Document 1) discloses an affinity detection/analysis chip having a structure in which a plurality of capillaries having inner surfaces to which a probe molecule that specifically binds to an analyte to be detected is immobilized are bundled and discloses a detection system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Specifically, in the detection system disclosed in Patent Document 1, a sample to be analyzed is allowed to flow in the plurality of capillaries so that an analyte molecule contained in the sample binds to the capillary inner surfaces through a specific bond between the analyte molecule and the probe molecule. The bond formed in the insides of the capillaries is observed and analyzed using a light absorption observation device.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When a reaction apparatus for binding (immobilizing) an analyte is thus configured with capillaries having inner surfaces to which a probe molecule that specifically binds to the analyte is immobilized, a common pump, such as a syringe pump or a piston pump, is necessarily provided at the outside of the capillary for allowing a fluid (sample) containing the analyte to flow into the insides of the capillaries.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, since the apparent viscosity of a fluid flowing in the microscopic passage of a capillary is significantly high, it is difficult for a common pump to precisely control the transfer of a fluid sample present at any position (in particular, at a position far from the pump) in a passage. Consequently, the throughput time for completing the binding reaction may become longer.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, the fluid sample has to have a volume at least for flowing in the piping such as the inside of a pump. This also causes the problem that the efficiency of sample use is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Furthermore, in the conventional structure, for example, when the amount of an analyte molecule to be detected that is contained in a sample is small, in order to allow the analyte molecule to sufficiently bind to a probe molecule on a capillary inner surface, the binding opportunity has to be increased by increasing the volume of the sample flowing in the capillary, resulting in the problem that a large amount of a sample is necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, the present invention has been accomplished under these circumstances, and it is an object thereof to provide a new reaction apparatus including a capillary having an inner surface to which a probe molecule that specifically binds to an analyte is immobilized, allowing a short throughput time for completing the binding reaction, and achieving a highly efficient reaction using a small amount of a sample and to provide a process of the reaction.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Means for Solving the Problems</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A reaction apparatus of the present invention includes a capillary having an inner surface to which a probe molecule that specifically binds to an analyte is immobilized; a columnar magnetic body that is disposed in a fluid containing the analyte in the state that the fluid is placed in the capillary; end-fixing means for fixing one end of the columnar magnetic body in the capillary using a DC magnetic field; and end-moving means for moving the other end of the columnar magnetic body using an AC magnetic field so as to transfer the fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The end-moving means applies an AC magnetic field in a direction approximately parallel to the fluid transfer direction to allow the other end to reciprocate in the fluid transfer direction and the opposite direction such that the magnetic body moves as a pendulum using the one end as the fulcrum.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The end-moving means can allow the other end reciprocate at different rates in the outward movement and the homeward movement.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The columnar magnetic body may be formed by magnetically binding a plurality of magnetic particles in a columnar shape by the DC magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A reaction process of the present invention includes the steps of, in the state that a fluid containing an analyte is placed in a capillary having an inner surface to which a probe molecule that specifically binds to the analyte is immobilized, fixing one end of a columnar magnetic body disposed in the fluid in a subject apparatus by a DC magnetic field; and moving the other end of the columnar magnetic body by an AC magnetic field so as to transfer the fluid.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Advantages</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the reaction apparatus and process of the present invention, though a capillary having an inner surface to which a probe molecule that specifically binds to an analyte is immobilized is used, the throughput time for completing the binding reaction can be short, and a highly efficient reaction is possible using a small amount of a sample.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Best Modes For Carrying Out The Invention</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">An embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(A)</figref> is a diagram schematically illustrating a rough structure of a reaction apparatus <b>1</b> according to the embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As shown in the drawing, the reaction apparatus <b>1</b> includes a microcapillary tube <b>10</b> having an inner surface to which a probe molecule <b>51</b> that specifically binds to an analyte <b>50</b> (for example, a physiologically active substance such as a protein or a DNA) is immobilized and a passage (circulation passage) <b>11</b> for connecting both ends of the microcapillary tube <b>10</b>. In the drawing, one microcapillary tube <b>10</b> is shown, but a plurality of microcapillary tubes <b>10</b> that is accumulated may be used. In addition, for illustrative purposes, in the drawing, the direction from the left to the right is the X-axis, the direction from the bottom to the top is the Y-axis, and the direction from the front to the back is the Z-axis.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The microcapillary tube <b>10</b> can be produced by a known method (for example, Patent Document 1). Specifically, the microcapillary tube <b>10</b> can be produced from a vitreous material (silica glass or borosilicate glass), an organic material, a plastic material (polyetheretherketone, polyethylene, or polypropylene), or a carbon nanotube, and the size thereof can be, for example, about 10 to 100 &#x3bc;m in the inner diameter and about 1 to 5 mm in the length.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The passage <b>11</b> is a channel for circulating a fluid (for example, a gas, liquid, or gel, which is selected according to a purpose, and hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;sample&#x201d;) containing an analyte <b>50</b> and is configured such that a sample discharged from one end (outlet end <b>12</b>) of the microcapillary tube <b>10</b> is sent to the other end (inlet end <b>13</b>). The material of the passage <b>11</b> may be any known material such as glass, silicon, or plastic, and the size thereof can be determined according to the size of the microcapillary tube <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Furthermore, a feeding channel <b>14</b> for feeding a sample into the reaction apparatus <b>1</b> is connected near the inlet end <b>13</b> of the microcapillary tube <b>10</b>, and the connection is provided with a valve (not shown) so that the circulating sample does not flow into the feeding channel.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(B)</figref> is a diagram schematically illustrating the appearance of the microcapillary tube <b>10</b> in the state that a sample is placed in the reaction apparatus <b>1</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The probe molecule <b>51</b> can be immobilized to the inner surface of the microcapillary tube <b>10</b> via a linker, as in known techniques. Exemplary embodiments of the immobilization include that by binding a linker (for example, glutaraldehyde) coupled to the probe molecule <b>51</b> to a reactive group (for example, a silanol group) formed on the inner surface of the microcapillary tube <b>10</b> and that by binding a linker (for example, succinic acid) to a reactive group present on the inner surface of the microcapillary tube <b>10</b> and synthesizing the probe molecule <b>51</b> on the linker material.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1(A) and 1(B)</figref>, the reaction apparatus <b>1</b> of this embodiment further includes magnetic bodies <b>20</b> disposed in a sample in the state that the sample is placed in the reaction apparatus <b>1</b> (specifically, in the microcapillary tube <b>10</b> and the passage <b>11</b>) and end-fixing means <b>31</b> and end-moving means <b>32</b> as a controller <b>30</b> for controlling the behavior of the magnetic bodies <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In addition, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(A)</figref>, the end-fixing means <b>31</b> and the end-moving means <b>32</b> are arranged on the Z-axis plus direction side and the Y-axis minus direction side, respectively, with respect to the microcapillary tube <b>10</b> in the drawing, but these means may be arranged at any positions that allow application of a DC magnetic field <b>40</b> and an AC magnetic fields <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>, which are described below, according to the design.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> schematically shows a structure of the magnetic body <b>20</b>. As shown in the drawing, the magnetic body <b>20</b> is composed of a plurality of magnetic particles <b>21</b> that are magnetically bonded in a columnar shape and includes two ends <b>22</b> and <b>23</b> that corresponds both ends of a column.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">One end <b>22</b> of the magnetic body <b>20</b> is fixed by the end-fixing means <b>31</b> so as to be in contact with the microcapillary tube <b>10</b>, as described below. The other end <b>23</b> of the magnetic body <b>20</b> is not fixed and is controlled by the end-moving means <b>32</b> so as to, for example, reciprocate, as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The magnetic particles <b>21</b> can be produced by a known method and may be particles of composite containing a magnetic body, as well as particles of magnetic body itself. The magnetic particles <b>21</b> can be in various shapes such as a grain, plate, box, or needle-like shape (for example, magnetic carbon nanotube (CNT)), and the size thereof can be determined according to the size of the microcapillary tube <b>10</b>, the type of the sample, and the required fluid-transferring and stirring abilities (in the present application, the term &#x201c;fluid-transferring&#x201d; is used for transferring not only a liquid sample but also a sample other than a liquid).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The end-fixing means <b>31</b> is a device for applying a DC magnetic field <b>40</b> to a direction (for example, the Z-axis minus direction in the coordinate system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) approximately orthogonal to the tube channel direction of the microcapillary tube <b>10</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(A)</figref>). Such a device can be realized by controlling, for example, a permanent magnet or an electromagnet, with a controller, as in conventional methods.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">It is known that application of a DC magnetic field to magnetic particles dispersed in a fluid binds the magnetic particles to one another to form a columnar shape having the incident side of the magnetic field as a bottom (for example, refer to &#x201c;Field-Induced Structures in Ferrofluid Emulsions&#x201d;, PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS, Volume 74, Number 14, 3 April 1995 that is incorporated in this application by reference). The distance between the &#x201c;columns&#x201d; and the height thereof can be controlled by regulating, for example, the magnitude of the DC magnetic field applied.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The magnetic body <b>20</b> in this embodiment is formed by utilizing the above-described phenomenon. That is, the magnetic particles <b>21</b> are induced and dispersed in a sample, and then the DC magnetic field <b>40</b> is applied to a direction approximately orthogonal to the tube channel direction of the microcapillary tube <b>10</b> by the end-fixing means <b>31</b> to magnetically bind the magnetic particles <b>21</b> to one another into a columnar shape having the bottom (the fixed end <b>22</b>) on the incident side of the magnetic field of the microcapillary tube <b>10</b>. As a result, the magnetic body <b>20</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Here, the microcapillary tube <b>10</b> may be applied with a magnetic particle or a magnetic thin film in advance on the incident side of the magnetic field. The application may be performed by a known method such as adhesion. In such a case, since the magnetic particles <b>21</b> are magnetically bound to one another using the magnetic particle or the like applied in advance as the bottom of a column, the position where the magnetic body <b>20</b> is formed can be determined in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The end-moving means <b>32</b> is a device for applying an AC magnetic field <b>41</b> that is approximately parallel to the tube channel direction (the Y-axis direction in the coordinate system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the microcapillary tube <b>10</b> or applying' an AC magnetic field <b>42</b> such that the direction of the magnetic field rotates 360&#xb0; in a predetermined plane (for example, the X-Y plane in the coordinate system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3(B) and 3(C)</figref>). This device can be realized by controlling the magnetic field generated by AC current with a controller, as conventionally known.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The end <b>23</b> of the magnetic body <b>20</b> is not fixed to the microcapillary tube <b>10</b> and therefore moves by the influence of the AC magnetic field <b>41</b> applied by the end-moving means <b>32</b> to move.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In addition, since the end <b>22</b> of the magnetic body <b>20</b> is also influenced by the AC magnetic field <b>41</b> applied by the end-moving means <b>32</b>, the magnitude of the DC magnetic field <b>40</b> applied by the end-fixing means <b>31</b> is set to be sufficiently higher than that of the AC magnetic field <b>41</b> applied by the end-moving means <b>32</b> so that the end <b>22</b> is fixed to the microcapillary tube <b>10</b> regardless of such influence.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Examples of the reaction process using the reaction apparatus <b>1</b> in this embodiment will be specifically described below.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In Example 1, an increase in reaction efficiency is attempted by using the magnetic body <b>20</b> as a nano-pump.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">First, the magnetic particles <b>21</b> are mixed with a sample containing the analyte <b>50</b> and dispersed in, the sample (step <b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Subsequently, the sample including the dispersed magnetic particles <b>21</b> is fed into the reaction apparatus <b>1</b> (microcapillary tube <b>10</b>) from the feeding channel (step <b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Then, a DC magnetic field <b>40</b> is applied in a direction approximately orthogonal to the tube channel direction of the microcapillary tube <b>10</b> by the end-fixing means <b>31</b> (step <b>3</b>). The DC magnetic field <b>40</b> herein is applied in the Z-axis minus direction in the coordinate system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The application of such DC magnetic field <b>40</b> magnetically binds the magnetic particles <b>21</b> dispersed in the sample to one another to form a magnetic body <b>20</b> having a columnar shape with the bottom (fixed end <b>22</b>) on the back side surface (the surface on the Z-axis plus direction side), which is the side that the DC magnetic field enters, of the microcapillary tube <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The distance between the magnetic bodies <b>20</b> (distance between ends <b>22</b>) and the height (the binding number of the magnetic particles <b>21</b>) formed on the back-side surface of the microcapillary tube <b>10</b> are determined depending on the diameter, magnetic moment, and type (such as Fe, Co, or Ni) of the magnetic particles <b>21</b>. Specifically, the distance and the height can be determined according to, for example, the size of the microcapillary tube <b>10</b>, the type of the sample, the required fluid-transferring and stirring abilities, and the density of the probe molecule <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Subsequently, an AC magnetic field <b>41</b> is applied by the end-moving means <b>32</b> in a fluid-transfer operation mode (step <b>4</b>). In the fluid-transfer operation mode, the AC magnetic field <b>41</b> is applied in a direction approximately parallel to the tube channel direction of the microcapillary tube <b>10</b> (the Y-axis direction in the coordinate system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The application of such AC magnetic field <b>41</b> allows the end <b>23</b> of the magnetic body <b>20</b> to reciprocate in the direction of the AC magnetic field <b>41</b>, namely, in the Y-axis minus direction (the fluid transfer direction) and the Y-axis plus direction (the opposite direction of the fluid transfer direction) in the coordinate system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The reciprocation of the end <b>23</b> can be controlled by the waveform of the applied AC magnetic field <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">For example, when the movement in the fluid transfer direction is defined as the outward movement and the movement in the direction opposite to the fluid transfer direction is defined as the homeward movement, the waveform of the AC magnetic field <b>41</b> can be set such that the transfer rate of the end <b>23</b> in the outward movement is greater than that in the homeward movement. Specifically, the waveform of the AC magnetic field <b>41</b> in the outward movement is set such that a relatively sharp magnetic gradient (a change in density of magnetic flux) is generated, so that the end <b>23</b> moves at a relatively high rate. In addition, the waveform of the AC magnetic field <b>41</b> in the homeward movement is set such that a relatively moderate magnetic gradient is generated, so that the end <b>23</b> moves at a relatively low rate.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">By controlling the reciprocation of the end <b>23</b> such that the transfer rate in the outward movement is greater than that in the homeward movement, the magnetic body <b>20</b> moves as a pendulum using the fixed end <b>22</b> as the fulcrum to transfer the sample (functions as a nano-pump). This fluid-transferring effect allows the sample to circulate in the microcapillary tube <b>10</b> and the passage <b>11</b> in a predetermined direction.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> schematically shows the manner that the magnetic body <b>20</b> in a sample functions as a nano-pump. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(A)</figref> is a view of the columnar magnetic body <b>20</b> viewed from a side, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(B)</figref> is a view of the columnar magnetic body <b>20</b> viewed from the above. The magnetic body <b>20</b> in each drawing is schematically illustrated, and, therefore, the size ratio is not limited to those shown in the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Furthermore, the difference in the reciprocation speed in the fluid transfer operation mode can be determined according to the type of the sample and the required fluid-transferring ability. When the fluid transfer effect is not necessary, the application of the AC magnetic field <b>41</b> may be terminated.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the reaction apparatus <b>1</b> in Example 1, since the sample can be transferred by the movement of the magnetic body <b>20</b> in the sample, a pump in a conventional manner is unnecessary. Consequently, it is unnecessary that the sample has a volume for flowing in the piping of a pump, which is conventionally needed. As a result, the efficiency of sample use can be increased. In addition, the elimination of machinery, namely, the pump can avoid the shortening of the operating life of the apparatus due to breakdown or the like of the machinery.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Furthermore, since the magnetic bodies <b>20</b> serving as nano-pumps are dispersed in the sample in the microcapillary tube <b>10</b>, the fluid transfer can be precisely controlled over the entire microcapillary tube <b>10</b>. This allows the sample to smoothly flow in the microcapillary tube <b>10</b>, resulting in shortening of the throughput time for completing the binding reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In addition, since the sample is repeatedly brought into contact with the probe molecule <b>51</b> by circulating in the microcapillary tube <b>10</b> via the passage <b>11</b>, the binding opportunity between the analyte <b>50</b> and the probe molecule <b>51</b> can be increased without increasing the volume of the sample fed into the reaction apparatus <b>1</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">EXAMPLE 2</heading>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In Example 2, an increase in reaction efficiency is attempted by using the magnetic body <b>20</b> as a nano-pump and a nano-stirrer.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In Example 2, steps <b>1</b> to <b>4</b> are the same as those in Example 1. However, in Example 2, when the microcapillary tube <b>10</b> is filled with the sample, the end-moving means <b>32</b> is changed from step <b>4</b> to step <b>5</b> and vice versa described below, and both steps are repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Specifically, in step <b>5</b>, application of an AC magnetic field <b>42</b> in the stirring operation mode is performed by the end-moving means <b>32</b>. The application direction and the magnitude of the AC magnetic field <b>42</b> in the stirring operation mode can be determined according to the type of the sample and the required stirring ability.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">For example, the waveform of the AC magnetic field <b>42</b> can be set such that the direction of the magnetic field for the end <b>23</b> rotates 360&#xb0; in a predetermined plane (for example, the X-Y plane in the coordinate system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(C)</figref>). In this case, the end <b>23</b> of the magnetic body <b>20</b> moves approximately in a circle in the plane. As a result, the magnetic body <b>20</b> moves as a conical pendulum using the fixed end <b>22</b> as the fulcrum and thereby functions so as to stir the fluid (functions as a nano-stirrer).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> schematically shows the manner that the magnetic body <b>20</b> in a sample functions as a nano-stirrer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(A)</figref> is a view of the columnar magnetic body <b>20</b> viewed from a side, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(B)</figref> is a view of the columnar magnetic body <b>20</b> viewed from the above. The magnetic body <b>20</b> in each drawing is schematically illustrated, and, therefore, the size ratio is not limited to those shown in the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">For example, the rotation speed of the magnetic field in the stirring operation mode can be determined according to the type of the sample and the required stirring ability. Furthermore, when the stirring operation is unnecessary, the application or the AC magnetic field <b>42</b> may be terminated. The execution times of step <b>4</b> and step <b>5</b> may be different from each other. Furthermore, each execution time may vary according to time elapsed.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The reaction apparatus <b>1</b> of Example 2 can exhibit the same effects as in Example 1. Furthermore, since the magnetic body <b>20</b> can be provided with a function as a nano-stirrer for stirring the sample in the microcapillary tube <b>10</b> by controlling the AC magnetic field <b>42</b> applied to the microcapillary tube <b>10</b>, the binding opportunity between the analyte <b>50</b> and the probe molecule <b>51</b> can be increased without increasing the volume of the sample fed into the reaction apparatus <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The present invention is not limited to the above embodiment and can be variously modified for application. For example, in the above-mentioned embodiment, the AC magnetic fields <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> are uniformly applied to the entire microcapillary tube <b>10</b>, but it may be configured such that an AC magnetic field is locally applied. Alternatively, it may be configured that an AC magnetic field is uniformly or locally applied to the passage <b>11</b>, in addition to or instead of the microcapillary tube <b>10</b>. That is, the magnetic body <b>20</b> disposed in the sample in the passage <b>11</b> can be provided with a function as a nano-pump or a nano-stirrer by applying a DC magnetic field in a direction approximately orthogonal to the fluid transfer direction of the passage <b>11</b> by the end-fixing means and applying an AC magnetic field in a direction according to the fluid transfer direction of the passage <b>11</b> by the end-moving means.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the above-mentioned embodiment, Example 1 describes a mode in which the magnetic body <b>20</b> functions as a nano-pump, and Example 2 describes a mode in which the magnetic body <b>20</b> functions as a nano-pump and a nano-stirrer, but a mode in which the magnetic body <b>20</b> functions only as a nano-stirrer may be employed. In also such a case, by the function of the magnetic body <b>20</b> as a nano-stirrer and the circulation of the sample in the microcapillary tube <b>10</b> via the passage <b>11</b>, the binding opportunity between the analyte <b>50</b> and the probe molecule <b>51</b> can be increased without increasing the volume of the sample fed into the reaction apparatus <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Furthermore, the reaction apparatus may have a structure for detecting the binding of an analyte in the microcapillary tube <b>10</b> or a structure including a unit for data processing of detection results. Exemplary embodiments of the process of detecting the binding include that using a light absorption observation device as in a known method and that determining the amount of the binding from a change in the impedance of the microcapillary tube <b>10</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As described above, the reaction apparatus and process of the present invention can exhibit fluid-transferring and stirring functions by controlling the behavior of the magnetic body <b>20</b> in a sample and, therefore, can be broadly applied to various reaction apparatuses including capillaries</p>
