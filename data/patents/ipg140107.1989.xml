<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a semiconductor manufacturing process, a desired pattern is formed on a wafer by selectively removing thin films deposited through etching. The thin films may include silicon dioxide films, silicon nitride films, or photoresists. The oxide and nitride film allow for better etching. However, improvements in semiconductor substrate processing are still required.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">One type of plasma etching apparatus includes a shower head provided at an upper part of a susceptor. The susceptor supports a wafer in a process chamber and the shower head includes a plurality of gas feeding holes. In this arrangement, a lower surface of the shower head is used as an upper electrode and the susceptor is used as a lower electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">During processing, a high frequency is provided by an RF generator between the upper and lower electrodes to generate a plasma, and a source gas is supplied in the process chamber from the shower head. A process such as etching (or deposition) is then performed using the plasma. The effectiveness of this and other semiconductor processes depend, in part, on temperatures of the process chamber, upper electrode, and lower electrode. It is often the case that the temperatures of the upper and lower electrodes increase because the wafer is placed on the lower electrode and the upper electrode is directly exposed to the plasma during the plasma process.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows one embodiment of a substrate processing apparatus that may improve the processing of substrates. This apparatus includes a process chamber <b>120</b>, a shower head <b>160</b> at an upper part of the process chamber to supply source gas, and an electrode plate <b>140</b> at a lower part facing the shower head. A substrate (S) is placed on the electrode plate <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In addition, a supply line <b>180</b> is connected to an upper part of the shower head and source gas is supplied into a vacant space in the shower head through the supply line. The supply line is opened and closed by a valve <b>182</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The shower head includes a diffusion plate <b>164</b> that divides an inside of the shower head into two spaces. Source gas supplied through the supply line flows in the upper part of the diffusion plate and is diffused below the diffusion plate through a plurality of diffusion holes <b>166</b>. A plurality of spray nozzles <b>162</b> are formed at a lower surface of the shower head and the diffused source gas is supplied between the shower head and electrode plate through the spray nozzles.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The shower head <b>160</b> is preferably used as an upper electrode for generating plasma, and a high frequency is applied to the shower head from an RF generator (operating, for example, at 13.56 MHz).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The electrode plate <b>140</b> is provided on a bottom surface of the process chamber <b>120</b>, and substrate (S) is placed on an upper surface of the electrode plate. A plurality of installation holes <b>142</b> are formed on the bottom surface of the electrode plate and a thermoelectric module <b>10</b> is installed in each installation hole.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A sealing member <b>144</b> is provided at an edge of the bottom surface of the electrode plate to seal the bottom surfaces of the electrode plate and process chamber. The thermoelectric module may be shielded from plasma formed at the upper part of the electrode plate. A plurality of through-holes <b>124</b> are formed on the bottom surface of the process chamber. The bottom surface is provided under the installation holes. Wires for applying power to the thermoelectric modules are connected respectively through the through-holes <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The electrode plate <b>140</b> is used as a lower electrode for generating plasma and is grounded.
