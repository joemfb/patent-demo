<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to crushing devices for crushing materials such as rock, building materials and ore and, more particularly, to a gyratory cone crusher.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Various types of gyratory cone crushers are currently in use although they display inherent deficiencies. One deficiency is the drive mechanism of the crusher which includes several moving parts (e.g. a gear and pinion assembly) which is prone to wear and tear and requires regular maintenance. The spacial adjustment between the crushing surfaces is achieved by complicated mechanisms requiring regular maintenance.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The inventor therefore believes that a need exists for providing a gyratory cone crusher having fewer parts than conventional crushers, thereby alleviating at least some of the problems associated with current crushers.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to the invention, there is provided a gyratory cone crusher including:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0005">a support frame having a vertical axis X;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0006">a receiving formation mounted rigidly in the frame, a central vertical axis of the receiving formation being in line with vertical axis X;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0007">a crushing head slideably engaged with the receiving formation and having a first, upwardly presented conical crushing surface;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0008">a crushing bowl having a second, downwardly presented funnel-shaped second crushing surface spaced apart from the first crushing surface, the crushing bowl being mounted in an eccentric housing so that a central axis Z of the crushing bowl is positioned at an angle oblique to vertical axis X;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0009">a flywheel mounted rotatably about vertical axis X, the flywheel including a passage having a central axis located in line with axis Z for receiving the housing therein, the housing being inhibited from rotating with the flywheel by a retaining formation; and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0010">a drive means for driving the flywheel; wherein rotation of the flywheel causes the housing and thereby the crushing bowl and second crushing surface to gyrate about axis Z.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0011">The gyratory motion of the crushing bowl about axis Z is eccentric so that the crushing bowl performs a wobbling motion which results in the spacing between the first and second crushing surfaces changing continuously as the bowl gyrates.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0012">It is to be appreciated, that the angle between axis Z and axis X may be selected during manufacture of the crusher to either accentuate or reduce the wobbling action of the crushing bowl by increasing or decreasing this angle, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0013">The receiving formation may include a hollow cylinder in which a piston is located to be displaceable along vertical axis X to facilitate displacement of the crushing head, thereby allowing adjustment of the spacing between the first and second crushing surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0014">The piston may be pneumatically, hydraulically or mechanically driven. In the event of the crushing surfaces being blocked by crushed material or material to be crushed which has become wedged between the crushing surfaces, the piston will automatically move downwards, thereby increasing the spacing between the crushing surfaces and allowing the material to become freed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0015">The first and second crushing surfaces may be defined by replaceable wear surfaces. The wear surfaces may be manufactured from any suitable material that will result in an extended life span of the wear parts during the crushing action. The wear surfaces may be manufactured from any suitable alloy steel</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0016">The wear surfaces may be provided in sections. This allows quick and easy replacement of the entire wear surfaces without the need for stripping the entire apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0017">The support frame may include releaseably connectable upper and lower portions to permit access to working parts of the crusher. The upper and lower portions may be include complementary male and female engaging formations and may in use be additionally secured by a retaining ring fitted over the engagement zone.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0018">The retaining formation may be in the form of a torque arm connected to the eccentric housing and which may be anchored to the support frame.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0019">The flywheel may be mounted on the upper portion of the support frame.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0020">The flywheel may be mounted on the support frame via a low-friction mounting arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0021">The low-friction mounting arrangement may be selected from: bearings and bushings.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0022">The bearing may be a ball bearing, roller bearing, jewel bearing, fluid bearing, electromagnetic bearing, or flexure bearing. Alternatively, the bearing may be a plain bearing such as a bushing which may be manufactured from bronze alloy or any readily available bushing material suitable to this application.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0023">The drive means may be an electric motor. Rotational force may be conveyed from the motor to the flywheel by means of one or more V-belts passing around a drive shaft of the drive means and an exterior surface of the flywheel or by the use of a gear, shaft and pinion assembly driving the flywheel.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0024">A feed chute may extend from the crushing bowl for feeding material to be crushed towards the first and second crushing surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0025">A dust cover may be mounted over the support frame. The dust cover may engage the upper portion of the support frame so as to cover the flywheel (and therewith the eccentric housing and crushing bowl) as well as the drive means and V-belts. An opening is defined in the cover for the feed chute to pass through.</p>
