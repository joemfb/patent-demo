<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to bicycle brakes and more particularly to a sensor type brake operating device of an electric bicycle.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A conventional brake operating device of electric bicycle is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and comprises a housing <b>71</b>, a brake lever <b>72</b> rotatably mounted on the housing <b>71</b>, a cable <b>73</b> having one end secured to the brake lever <b>72</b>, a control line <b>74</b> having one end fastened in the housing <b>71</b> and the other end electrically connected to a DC motor (not shown), and a contact switch <b>75</b> provided at one end of the control line <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an inoperative state of the brake operating device, the brake lever <b>72</b> presses against the contact switch <b>75</b> to enable the control line <b>74</b>. In response to pressing the brake lever <b>72</b> against a grip (not shown), the contact switch <b>75</b> elastically moves away from the control line <b>74</b> to open the circuit. As a result, a braking force is transmitted from the cable <b>73</b> to the brake near the wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, a number of drawbacks have been found in the conventional brake operating device of electric bicycle. In detail, the contact switch is poor in sensitivity. Further, the contact switch is neither robust nor durable. Furthermore, the brake operation is not as effective as desired. Thus, the need for improvement still exists.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is therefore one object of the invention to provide a brake operating device of an electric bicycle comprising a brake lever comprising a projecting plate at one end, and a bifurcated cable anchoring member pivotably secured to the projecting plate; a magnetic member adhered to one side of the cable anchoring member; a housing pivotably secured to the brake lever and comprising a hydraulic cylinder and a cylindrical socket including an opening distal the brake lever, and internal threads proximate the opening; a spring depressible sensor comprising a sensing member disposed in the socket, and an electric wire extending from the sensing member; and a hollow threaded fastener adjustably threadedly secured to the internal threads of the socket to engage the sensing member; wherein the electric wire passes the fastener and leaves the housing.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 5</figref>, a brake operating device <b>1</b> of electric bicycle in accordance with a first preferred embodiment of the invention comprises the following components as discussed in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A brake lever <b>2</b> comprises a gripping portion <b>21</b>, a pivot portion <b>22</b>, a projecting plate <b>23</b>, and a bifurcated cable anchoring member <b>24</b> pivotably secured to the projecting plate <b>23</b>. A magnetic ring <b>4</b> formed of permanent magnet is adhered to one side of the cable anchoring member <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A housing <b>3</b> comprises a pivot portion <b>31</b> pivotably secured to the pivot portion <b>22</b> using a pivot (not numbered), a hydraulic cylinder <b>32</b>, and a cylindrical socket <b>33</b> adjacent to and parallel to the hydraulic cylinder <b>32</b>, the socket <b>33</b> having an opening <b>331</b> distal the brake lever <b>2</b> and including internal threads <b>332</b> proximate the opening <b>331</b>. The hydraulic cylinder <b>32</b> is a part of a conventional hydraulic brake system of an electric bicycle. Thus, detailed description of the hydraulic cylinder <b>32</b> and associated parts is omitted herein for the sake of brevity.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A helical spring <b>6</b> is anchored at bottom of the socket <b>33</b>. A sensor <b>5</b> comprises an enlarged sensing member <b>51</b> disposed in the socket <b>33</b> and engaging the spring <b>6</b>, and an electric wire <b>52</b> extending from the sensing member <b>51</b>. A hollow fastener <b>70</b> includes an externally threaded shank <b>701</b> adjustably threadedly secured to the internal threads <b>332</b> to engage the sensing member <b>51</b>. Further, the electric wire <b>52</b> passes the fastener <b>70</b> and leaves the housing <b>3</b> to be electrically connected to a DC (direct current) motor (not shown) of the electric bicycle.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Preferably, the sensor <b>5</b> is a Hall-effect sensor. Finally, a cylindrical member <b>8</b> is releasably mounted proximate to the opening <b>331</b> and secured to the fastener <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">For adjusting brake sensitivity, an individual may turn the fastener <b>70</b> to change the position of the sensing member <b>51</b> relative to the magnetic ring <b>4</b> so as to change a magnetic force exerted upon the sensing member <b>51</b> by the magnetic ring <b>4</b> (i.e., changing magnetic field).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Moreover, an individual may press the brake lever <b>2</b> against a grip to pivot the brake lever <b>2</b> (and thus the magnetic ring <b>4</b>). As such, a relative position of the magnetic ring <b>4</b> and the sensing member <b>51</b> is changed because the magnetic ring <b>4</b> may move as a curve when the brake lever <b>2</b> pivots. As a result, the magnetic field is changed too.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a brake operating device of electric bicycle in accordance with a second preferred embodiment of the invention is shown. The characteristics of the second preferred embodiment are substantially the same as that of the first preferred embodiment except the following: The magnetic ring <b>4</b> of the first preferred embodiment is replaced with a solid magnetic cylinder <b>4</b>. Further, one hole through the projecting plate <b>23</b> of the first preferred embodiment is replaced with two parallel holes <b>231</b> in which one hole <b>231</b> is for pivotably connecting the main body of the brake lever <b>2</b> and the cable anchoring member <b>24</b> together and the other hole <b>231</b> is for disposing the magnetic cylinder <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">While the invention has been described in terms of preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modifications within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.</p>
