<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">This embodiment provides a putter head which imparts back spin, that is smaller in amount than in a general putter, to a ball upon striking the ball, to eventually facilitate creation of top spin of the ball, and exhibits a degree of top spin, that has a small temperature dependence.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 4</figref> show a putter head <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment. The putter head <b>1</b> is provided with a recessed portion <b>2</b>H in the front surface (face surface) of a head body <b>2</b>, and a face insert <b>3</b> is disposed in the recessed portion <b>2</b>H. In this embodiment, the head body <b>2</b> is made of a metal such as an aluminum alloy, a titanium alloy, a copper alloy, or stainless steel. The body portion (a portion other than viscoelastic materials <b>3</b><i>b</i>; to be described later) of the face insert <b>3</b> is made of a synthetic resin such as polyester, nylon, or urethane, or a metal such as an aluminum alloy, a copper alloy, or stainless steel. The front surface of the face insert <b>3</b> is flush with that of the head body <b>2</b> around the recessed portion <b>2</b>H.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The recessed portion <b>2</b>H and face insert <b>3</b> have an elongated, almost rectangular shape. The recessed portion <b>2</b>H has a uniform depth as a whole, and the face insert <b>3</b> has a uniform thickness as a whole as well. However, the recessed portion <b>2</b>H and face insert <b>3</b> may be partly provided with a deep portion and thick portion, respectively, or conversely, a shallow portion and thin portion, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The face insert <b>3</b> has a horizontal dimension and vertical dimension that is slightly smaller than the recessed portion <b>2</b>H, so a small gap <b>4</b> is formed between upper, lower, left, and right side surfaces <b>3</b>S of the face insert <b>3</b> and a peripheral surface <b>2</b>S of the recessed portion <b>2</b>H. The width of the gap <b>4</b> is preferably 0.3 to 1.5 mm and more preferably about 0.4 to 1.0 mm. As for the size of the face insert <b>3</b>, its vertical dimension is preferably 16 to 30 mm and more preferably about 18 to 25 mm, its horizontal dimension is preferably 50 to 150 mm and more preferably about 70 to 100 mm, and its thickness is preferably 2 to 10 mm and more preferably about 3 to 8 mm. However, the size of the face insert <b>3</b> is not limited to these specific values.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The face insert <b>3</b> is provided with slits <b>3</b><i>a </i>which are vertically aligned in multiple stages so as to extend horizontally, and each of which is filled with a viscoelastic material <b>3</b><i>b</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 4</figref>. Rubber, an elastomer, or a soft synthetic resin, for example, is used as the viscoelastic material <b>3</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The slit <b>3</b><i>a </i>extends from the vicinity of the left end of the face insert <b>3</b> to that of its right end. The slit <b>3</b><i>a </i>has a relatively small vertical dimension on the side of the face surface, and has a relatively large vertical dimension on the side of the rear surface. The vertical dimension of the slit <b>3</b><i>a </i>increases stepwise in the middle of the thickness direction of the face insert <b>3</b>. The body portion of the face insert <b>3</b> immediately above each slit <b>3</b><i>a </i>has an inverted L-shaped cross-section having a depending portion <b>3</b><i>c </i>on the side of the face surface.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The vertical dimension of the slit <b>3</b><i>a </i>on the side of the face surface is preferably 0.8 to 2.0 nm and more preferably about 1.0 to 1.6 mm. The vertical dimension of the slit <b>3</b><i>a </i>on the side of the rear surface is preferably about 1.4 to 4 times that on the side of the face surface. The thickness of the depending portion <b>3</b><i>c </i>(its thickness in a direction perpendicular to the face surface) is preferably 0.5 to 2.0 mm and more preferably about 0.8 to 1.2 mm. The array pitch of the slits <b>3</b><i>a </i>in the vertical direction is preferably 2.4 to 5.8 mm and more preferably about 3.4 to 4.6 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The face insert <b>3</b> is disposed in the recessed portion <b>2</b>H such that its left side surface when viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> becomes the face front surface of the putter, and its opposite surface is bonded to the bottom wall surface of the recessed portion <b>2</b>H using an adhesive. Although an epoxy adhesive, a rubber adhesive, or a double-faced tape, for example, is suitable as an adhesive, the present invention is not limited to these specific adhesives.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A putter is formed by connecting a shaft to a hosel portion <b>1</b><i>h </i>of the thus formed putter head <b>1</b>. Upon putting with this putter (striking a ball on a green with the face surface), the depending portions <b>3</b><i>c </i>of the face insert <b>3</b> slightly recede upon hitting the ball, thereby easily imparting top spin to the ball. Thus, the hit ball exhibits good rectilinear movement characteristics. The temperature has little influence on the degree of recession of the depending portions <b>3</b><i>c</i>, so the degree of top spin has little temperature dependence.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Although the rear surface of the depending portion <b>3</b><i>c </i>is almost vertical in the above-described embodiment, the rear surfaces of depending portions <b>11</b><i>c </i>to <b>14</b><i>c </i>may have shapes different from that of the depending portion <b>3</b><i>c</i>, like face inserts <b>11</b> to <b>14</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5D</figref>, respectively. In an example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the rear surface of the depending portion <b>11</b><i>c </i>is an inclined surface which is continuous with the face surface and obliquely ascends from the contact portion with it to the rear surface of the face insert <b>11</b>. In an example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the rear surface of the depending portion <b>12</b><i>c </i>is inclined more to the rear toward its upper portion from the middle portion of the face insert <b>12</b> in its thickness direction. In an example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, the rear surface of the depending portion <b>13</b><i>c </i>is a concavely curved surface. In an example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, the rear surface of the depending portion <b>14</b><i>c </i>is inclined more to the front toward its upper portion from the middle portion of the face insert <b>14</b> in its thickness direction.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In all of the examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5D</figref>, slits <b>11</b><i>a </i>to <b>14</b><i>a </i>are filled with viscoelastic materials <b>11</b><i>b </i>to <b>14</b><i>b</i>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Although the body portion of the face insert and the front surface of the viscoelastic material are flush with each other, and the front surface of the face insert is flat in the above-described embodiment, the viscoelastic member may recede from the body portion of the face insert by about 0.05 to 1.1 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Although the gap <b>4</b> is formed around the face insert <b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a viscoelastic material <b>8</b> such as rubber, an elastomer, or a synthetic resin may be disposed in the gap <b>4</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Also, like a putter head <b>1</b>&#x2032; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>, the face insert <b>3</b> may be formed to tightly fit in the recessed portion <b>2</b>H so as to generate no gap <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Other arrangements in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 7B</figref> are the same as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref>, and the same reference numerals denote the same parts. When the gap <b>4</b> or the viscoelastic material <b>8</b> is provided between the side surfaces <b>3</b>S of the face insert <b>3</b> and the peripheral surface <b>2</b>S of the recessed portion <b>2</b>H, this prevents generation of residual stress in the face insert, thus producing an effect of obtaining rebound characteristics of the face insert, which comply with the design.</p>

The putter head <b>21</b> is provided with a recessed portion <b>22</b>H in the front surface (face surface) of a head body <b>22</b>, and a face insert <b>23</b> is disposed in the recessed portion <b>22</b>H. In this embodiment, the head body <b>22</b> is made of a metal such as an aluminum alloy, a titanium alloy, a copper alloy, or stainless steel. The body portion (a portion other than viscoelastic materials <b>23</b><i>b</i>; to be described later) of the face insert <b>23</b> is made of a synthetic resin such as polyester, nylon, or urethane, or a metal such as an aluminum alloy, a copper alloy, or stainless steel.

However, the recessed portion <b>22</b>H and face insert <b>23</b> may be partly provided with a deep portion and thick portion, respectively, or conversely, a shallow portion and thin portion, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The face insert <b>23</b> has a horizontal dimension and vertical dimension slightly smaller than the recessed portion <b>22</b>H, so a small gap <b>24</b> is formed between upper, lower, left, and right side surfaces <b>23</b>S of the face insert <b>23</b> and a peripheral surface <b>22</b>S of the recessed portion <b>22</b>H. The width of the gap <b>24</b> is preferably 0.3 to 1.5 mm and more preferably about 0.4 to 1.0 mm.

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The face insert <b>23</b> is provided with slits <b>23</b><i>a </i>which are vertically aligned in multiple stages so as to extend horizontally, and each of which is filled with a viscoelastic material <b>23</b><i>b</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 to 11</figref>.

The vertical dimension of the slit <b>23</b><i>a </i>increases stepwise in the middle of the thickness direction of the face insert <b>23</b>. The body portion of the face insert <b>23</b> immediately above each slit <b>23</b><i>a </i>has an L-shaped cross-section having a raised portion <b>23</b><i>c </i>on the side of the face surface.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The vertical dimension of the slit <b>23</b><i>a </i>on the side of the face surface is preferably 0.8 to 2.0 nm and more preferably about 1.0 to 1.6 mm. The vertical dimension of the slit <b>23</b><i>a </i>on the side of the rear surface is preferably about 1.4 to 4 times that on the side of the face surface.

The array pitch of the slits <b>23</b><i>a </i>in the vertical direction is preferably 2.4 to 5.8 mm and more preferably about 3.4 to 4.6 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The face insert <b>23</b> is disposed in the recessed portion <b>22</b>H such that its left side surface when viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> becomes the face front surface of the putter, and its opposite surface is bonded to the bottom wall surface of the recessed portion <b>22</b>H using an adhesive. Although an epoxy adhesive, a rubber adhesive, or a double-faced tape, for example, is suitable as an adhesive, the present invention is not limited to these specific adhesives.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A putter is formed by connecting a shaft to a hosel portion <b>21</b><i>h </i>of the thus formed putter head <b>21</b>. Upon putting with this putter (striking a ball on a green with the face surface), the raised portions <b>23</b><i>c </i>of the face insert <b>23</b> slightly recede upon hitting the ball. This reduces the amount of top spin on the ball, thus easily imparting back spin to the ball. Therefore, in a slightly rough green or a green with good rolling properties, the feel of distance can easily be adjusted by lowering the rolling property. That is, in general, a ball hit with a putter moves by sliding on the green surface with no rotation or low-speed rotation immediately after separating from the face surface of the putter, and, after a while, rolls without sliding on the green by friction between the ball and the green surface (the peripheral velocity and moving velocity of the ball become equal to each other). When a force which acts on a ball in the top spin direction upon hitting it with a putter head reduces, or when a force acts on a ball in the back spin direction upon hitting it with the putter head, the distance of sliding movement with no rotation or low-speed rotation immediately after the hitting increases. If the green surface is rough, the influence that the green surface exerts on the ball reduces during sliding movement with no rotation or low-speed rotation immediately after hitting. As a result, the total rolling distance until the ball stops becomes nearly equal to that in a general green. Also, in a green with good rolling properties (more specifically, a green in which lawn grass is cut short or a green tightened by, for example, a roller), rolling of the ball immediately after hitting it is suppressed as top spin is reduced or back spin is generated. Thus, the total rolling distance until the ball stops becomes nearly equal to that in a general green. From the foregoing description, the putter head according to the present invention allows the player to easily adjust the feel of distance in a slightly rough green or a green with good rolling properties, that is, allows the ball to roll only by a distance intended by the player.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Although the rear surface of the raised portion <b>23</b><i>c </i>is almost vertical in the above-described embodiment, the rear surfaces of raised portions <b>31</b><i>c </i>to <b>34</b><i>c </i>may have shapes different from that of the raised portion <b>23</b><i>c</i>, like face inserts <b>31</b> to <b>34</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A to 12D</figref>, respectively. In an example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, the rear surface of the raised portion <b>31</b><i>c </i>is an inclined surface which is continuous with the face surface and obliquely descends from the contact portion with it to the rear surface of the face insert <b>31</b>. In an example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, the rear surface of the raised portion <b>32</b><i>c </i>is inclined more to the rear toward its lower portion from the middle portion of the face insert <b>32</b> in its thickness direction. In an example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref>, the rear surface of the raised portion <b>33</b><i>c </i>is a concavely curved surface. In an example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</figref>, the rear surface of the raised portion <b>34</b><i>c </i>is inclined more to the front toward its lower portion from the middle portion of the face insert <b>34</b> in its thickness direction.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In all of the examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A to 12D</figref>, slits <b>31</b><i>a </i>to <b>34</b><i>a </i>are filled with viscoelastic materials <b>31</b><i>b </i>to <b>34</b><i>b</i>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Although the body portion of the face insert and the front surface of the viscoelastic material are flush with each other, and the front surface of the face insert is flat in the above-described embodiment, the viscoelastic member may recede from the body portion of the face insert by about 0.05 to 1.1 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Although the gap <b>24</b> is formed around the face insert <b>23</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, a viscoelastic material <b>28</b> such as rubber, an elastomer, or a synthetic resin may be disposed in the gap <b>24</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. Also, like a putter head <b>21</b>&#x2032; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref>, the face insert <b>23</b> may be formed to tightly fit in the recessed portion <b>22</b>H so as to generate no gap <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Other arrangements in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 to 14B</figref> are the same as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A to 8C</figref>, and the same reference numerals denote the same parts. When the gap <b>24</b> or the viscoelastic material <b>28</b> is provided between the side surfaces <b>23</b>S of the face insert <b>23</b> and the peripheral surface <b>22</b>S of the recessed portion <b>22</b>H, this prevents generation of residual stress in the face insert, thus producing an effect of obtaining rebound characteristics of the face insert, which comply with the design.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Third Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">This embodiment provides a putter head which imparts back spin, that is smaller in amount than in a general putter, to a ball upon striking the ball, to eventually facilitate creation of top spin of the ball.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A to 17C</figref> show a putter head <b>41</b> according to the third embodiment. The putter head <b>41</b> is provided with a recessed portion <b>42</b>H in the front surface (face surface) of a head body <b>42</b>, and a face insert <b>43</b> is disposed in the recessed portion <b>42</b>H. In this embodiment, the head body <b>42</b> is made of a metal such as an aluminum alloy, a titanium alloy, a copper alloy, or stainless steel. The face insert <b>43</b> includes a face insert body <b>44</b> formed from a viscoelastic body, and a plurality of blades <b>45</b> buried in the face insert body <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The recessed portion <b>42</b>H and face insert body <b>44</b> have an elongated, almost rectangular shape. The recessed portion <b>2</b>H has a uniform depth as a whole, and the face insert body <b>44</b> has a uniform thickness as a whole as well. However, the recessed portion <b>42</b>H and face insert body <b>44</b> may be partly provided with a deep portion and thick portion, respectively, or conversely, a shallow portion and thin portion, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The face insert body <b>44</b> has a horizontal dimension and vertical dimension slightly smaller than the recessed portion <b>42</b>H, so a small gap <b>46</b> is formed between upper, lower, left, and right side surfaces <b>43</b>S of the face insert body <b>44</b> and a peripheral surface <b>42</b>S of the recessed portion <b>42</b>H. The width of the gap <b>46</b> is preferably 0.3 to 1.5 mm and more preferably about 0.4 to 1.0 mm. As for the size of the face insert body <b>44</b>, its vertical dimension is preferably 16 to 30 mm and more preferably about 18 to 25 mm, its horizontal dimension is preferably 50 to 150 mm and more preferably about 70 to 100 mm, and its thickness is preferably 2 to 10 mm and more preferably about 3 to 8 mm. However, the size of the face insert <b>3</b> is not limited to these specific values.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">A material such as rubber, an elastomer, or a soft synthetic resin is used as a viscoelastic material which forms the face insert body <b>44</b>. These materials may be a foam material such as foam rubber.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In this embodiment, the blades <b>45</b> have a flat plate shape and are vertically aligned in multiple stages with predetermined spacings between them. Each blade <b>45</b> has its front end positioned on the front surface (face surface) of the face insert body <b>44</b>. Each blade <b>45</b> is tilted higher toward its rear end portion. The tilt angle &#x3b8; of each blade <b>45</b> while the front surface of the face insert body <b>44</b> is kept vertical is preferably 20&#xb0; to 70&#xb0; and more preferably about 30&#xb0; to 60&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The array pitch of the blades <b>45</b> in the vertical direction is preferably 0.9 to 2.5 mm and more preferably about 1.0 to 1.5 mm. Stainless steel, titanium, or a titanium alloy, for example, is suitable as the material of the blades <b>45</b>. The thickness of the blade <b>45</b> is preferably 0.4 to 0.7 mm and more preferably about 0.45 to 0.65 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The face insert <b>43</b> is disposed in the recessed portion <b>42</b>H such that its left side surface when viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> becomes the face front surface of the putter, and its opposite surface is bonded to the bottom wall surface of the recessed portion <b>2</b>H using an adhesive. Although an epoxy adhesive, a rubber adhesive, or a double-faced tape, for example, is suitable as an adhesive, the present invention is not limited to these specific adhesives.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">A putter is formed by connecting a shaft to a hosel portion <b>41</b><i>h </i>of the thus formed putter head <b>41</b>. Upon putting with this putter (striking a ball on a green with the face surface), the front end sides of the blades <b>45</b> are displaced downward and obliquely backward upon hitting the ball, thereby facilitating production of top spin. Thus, the hit ball exhibits good rectilinear movement characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Although the front surface of the face insert <b>43</b> is flat in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>, recessed portions <b>44</b><i>h </i>or <b>44</b><i>g </i>may be provided in the face insert body <b>44</b> between the blades <b>45</b>, like face inserts <b>43</b>&#x2032; and <b>43</b>&#x2033; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17B and 17C</figref>, respectively. The recessed portions <b>44</b><i>h </i>have a uniform depth between the blades <b>45</b>. The recessed portions <b>44</b><i>g </i>have an almost arcuated longitudinal section. The depths of the recessed portions <b>44</b><i>h </i>and <b>44</b><i>g </i>are preferably about 0.5 to 1.0 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Note that to fabricate the face insert <b>43</b>, the blades <b>45</b> are preferably inserted into the face insert body <b>44</b> formed from a viscoelastic body. In this case, the blades <b>45</b> may be individually inserted into the face insert body <b>44</b> one by one. Alternatively, the face insert <b>43</b> may be fabricated by stacking the blades <b>45</b> via appropriate spacers between them to form a stacked body, inserting the proximal ends of the blades <b>45</b> of the stacked body into the face insert body <b>44</b>, and then removing the spacers.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Instead of using such spacers, the face insert <b>43</b> may be fabricated by fabricating, in advance, a blade unit <b>49</b> in which the side portions of the plurality of blades <b>45</b> to each other by a plate portion <b>48</b>, and inserting the blade unit <b>49</b> into the face insert body <b>44</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 to 20</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Also, the face insert <b>43</b> may be fabricated by temporarily fixing the distal ends of the blades <b>45</b> to connecting members <b>50</b> using, for example, an adhesive to form a blade unit <b>51</b>, inserting the blades <b>45</b> of the blade unit <b>51</b> into the face insert body <b>44</b>, and then, for example, dissolving the adhesive in a solvent to remove the connecting members <b>50</b>, as in an example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Note that the face insert <b>43</b> may be fabricated by setting the blades <b>45</b> in a mold, and injecting a viscoelastic body into the mold.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Although the blades <b>45</b> have a flat plate shape in the above-described embodiment, blades <b>54</b> having an L-shaped cross-section may be used, like a face insert <b>53</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. Each blade <b>54</b> includes a horizontal portion <b>54</b><i>a </i>which almost horizontally extends in the face insert body <b>44</b>, and a depending portion <b>54</b><i>b </i>which depends from the front end of the horizontal portion <b>54</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Also, blades <b>56</b> having a curved plate shape which is convexly curved upward so that it is curved more acutely toward the front end may be used, like a face insert <b>55</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Although the gap <b>46</b> is formed around the face insert <b>43</b> in an example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>, it may be filled with a viscoelastic material such as rubber, an elastomer, or a synthetic resin. Also, the face insert body <b>44</b> may be formed to tightly fit in the recessed portion <b>42</b>H so as to generate no gap <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">While the present invention has been described with reference to exemplary embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed exemplary embodiments. The scope of the following claims is to be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and equivalent structures and functions.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">This application claims the benefit of Japanese Patent Applications No. 2010-281803, filed Dec. 17, 2010, No. 2010-281806, filed Dec. 17, 2010, and No. 2010-287827, filed Dec. 24, 2010, which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.</p>
