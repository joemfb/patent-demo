The unit <b>176</b> further sets up a friend object <b>144</b> for the avatar <b>142</b> of the friend user to indicate that the avatar is that of a friend. The lobby display control unit <b>176</b> sets up the avatar <b>142</b> in the screen data for the lobby <b>140</b> so that the avatar <b>142</b> is displayed at the initial display position determined by the initial display position determination unit <b>180</b> described later.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The lobby display control unit <b>176</b> further defines a created room name for a room object <b>146</b> corresponding to the room and sets up the room object <b>146</b> in the screen data for the lobby <b>140</b>. In this process, the unit <b>176</b> sets up the room object <b>146</b> in the screen data for the lobby <b>140</b> so that the room object <b>146</b> is displayed at the position indicated by the coordinate data acquired by the lobby entry processing unit <b>174</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The management server <b>400</b> communicates the user name of the user newly entering the lobby <b>140</b> to the table-top game devices <b>100</b> of the users already in the lobby. The lobby update processing unit <b>178</b> in the table-top game device <b>100</b> of the notified users acquires communicated information from the management server <b>400</b> via the cable communication unit <b>128</b> and the communication control unit <b>114</b>. The lobby update processing unit <b>178</b> directs the lobby display control unit <b>176</b> to set up the communicated user name for the avatar <b>142</b> corresponding to the user newly entering the lobby and to set up the avatar <b>142</b> in the screen data for the lobby <b>140</b>. This allows the avatar of the user &#x201c;Taro&#x201d; to be displayed in the lobby <b>140</b> that the user &#x201c;Jiro&#x201d;, already in the lobby <b>03</b>, is viewing, as the user &#x201c;Taro&#x201d; enters the lobby <b>03</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Further, as described above, the user can create a new room object <b>146</b> in the lobby <b>140</b>. The lobby update processing unit <b>178</b> detects that the user requests addition of a new room object <b>146</b> in the lobby <b>140</b> via the user operation determination unit <b>112</b>. In this process, the lobby update processing unit <b>178</b> directs the lobby display control unit <b>176</b> to set up the new room object <b>146</b> in the screen data for the lobby <b>140</b>. Further, the lobby update processing unit <b>178</b> communicates the name of the new room object <b>146</b> and the positional data thereof to the management server <b>400</b> via the communication control unit <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The management server <b>400</b> stores the name of the new room object <b>146</b> and the positional data communicated from the table-top game device <b>100</b> and communicates the name and the data to the other table-top game devices <b>100</b>. Each of the lobby update processing unit <b>178</b> in the other data processing units <b>110</b> acquires the communication via the communication control unit <b>114</b> and directs the lobby display control unit <b>176</b> to add the new room object <b>146</b> at the position in the lobby <b>140</b> indicated by the positional data. In this way, the display of the room object <b>146</b> is synchronized between the table-top game devices <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A &#x201c;room comment&#x201d;, a character string indicating the purpose of the room or the game type to the lobby users, is set up for the room object <b>146</b> by the user creating that room object. The room comment is not shown in the figure and can be acquired from the management server <b>400</b> and stored in the storage unit <b>122</b>. The lobby display control unit <b>176</b> may set up the screen data for the lobby so that the room comment is displayed when the user moves the mouse pointer over the room object <b>146</b> in the lobby <b>140</b>. Like the room object name, the room comment is communicated to the other table-top game devices <b>100</b> in the lobby so that the display of the room comment is synchronized.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A description will now be given of the method of determining the position that the avatar <b>142</b> is displayed. The initial position determination unit <b>180</b> locally determines the position of the avatar <b>142</b> displayed in the lobby in the initial status where the user enters the lobby. In other words, the initial position determination unit <b>180</b> in each of the table-top game devices <b>100</b> determines the initial position where the avatar <b>142</b> is displayed in the lobby <b>140</b> displayed locally. Therefore, when the user &#x201c;Taro&#x201d; displays the object of the lobby <b>140</b> initially, the avatar <b>142</b> in the lobby <b>140</b> is displayed at a position different from that of the user &#x201c;Jiro&#x201d; in the lobby <b>140</b>. After determining the initial display position of the avatars <b>142</b>, the initial position determination unit <b>180</b> causes the storage unit <b>122</b> to store the position.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> shows a screen of the lobby <b>140</b> displayed on the display of the second user. The figure shows a screen displayed on the display of the user &#x201c;Jiro&#x201d;, who is already in the lobby <b>03</b>, when the user &#x201c;Taro&#x201d; enters the lobby <b>03</b>. For the reason described above, the position that the avatar <b>142</b> is displayed in the figure is different from that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Thus, by allowing the initial position determination unit <b>180</b> to locally determine the initial display position of the associated avatar <b>142</b> in the lobby <b>140</b>, the volume of data exchanged in the information exchange system <b>100</b> is reduced. For synchronization of the position of the avatar <b>142</b> between different table-top game devices <b>100</b>, the management server <b>400</b> needs to manage not only entering users but also the positional data for the avatars <b>142</b> of the users and to communicate the data to the table-top game devices <b>100</b>. In contrast, the embodiment is capable of reducing the load imposed on the management server <b>400</b> and the network and reducing the amount of resources consumed because the management server <b>400</b> only needs to make the users in the lobby <b>140</b> known. The inventive approach is particularly suitable when a large number of users enter the lobby <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Further, as described above, the lobby <b>140</b> is designed so that users can chat with each other. The lobby chat processing unit <b>182</b> detects, via the user operation determination unit <b>112</b>, that a character string for a message from a user to another is entered and that a chat is requested. Upon the detection, the lobby chat processing unit <b>182</b> communicates the message character string to the lobby display control unit <b>176</b> and displays an object showing the message character string in the neighborhood of the avatar <b>142</b> of the user originating the message. Along with this, the lobby chat processing unit <b>182</b> transmits the originating user name and the message character string to the management server <b>400</b> via the communication control unit <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The management server <b>400</b> communicates the originating user name and the message character string to the other table-top game devices <b>100</b>. The lobby chat processing unit <b>182</b> in the other table-top game devices <b>100</b> acquires the communication via the communication control unit <b>114</b> and directs the lobby display control unit <b>176</b> to display the message character string in the neighborhood of the avatar <b>142</b> of the originating user. This allows communication between users. For example, users can exchange information about the online game, etc. with other users. Alternatively, users can encourage other users to enter the room.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">For convenience of user communication, the lobby <b>140</b> is designed so that the user can move the display position of the user's avatar <b>142</b>. The movement processing unit <b>184</b> detects, via the user operation determination unit <b>112</b>, that the user requests the movement of the avatar <b>142</b> in the lobby <b>140</b>. Upon the detection, the movement processing unit <b>184</b> communicates the position of movement destination designated by the user to the lobby display control unit <b>176</b>, moving the avatar <b>142</b> directed by the user to be moved to the position of the destination. Along with this, the movement processing unit <b>184</b> transmits the user name of the avatar <b>142</b> directed to be moved and positional data for the destination of the movement to the management server <b>400</b> via the communication control unit <b>114</b>. Hereinafter, the user name of the avatar <b>142</b> directed to be moved may be referred to as &#x201c;moved user name&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The management server <b>400</b> communicates the moved user name and the positional data for the destination of the movement to the other table-top game devices <b>100</b>.

As a result, the display position of the moved avatar <b>142</b> is synchronized in all of the table-top game devices <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In this embodiment, the user can request designated avatar movement for moving the user's avatar <b>142</b> to &#x201c;a position adjacent to a designated avatar <b>142</b>&#x201d; or designated arbitrary position movement for moving the user's avatar <b>142</b> to &#x201c;an arbitrary position in the lobby <b>140</b>&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Upon detecting a direction for designated avatar movement, the movement processing unit <b>184</b> informs the management server <b>400</b> of the positional data for the destination of movement by transmitting the user name set up for the avatar <b>142</b> at the destination of movement (hereinafter, also referred to as &#x201c;movement destination user name&#x201d;).

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">When informed by the management server <b>400</b> of the positional data for the destination of movement, i.e., the movement destination user name, the movement processing unit <b>184</b> acquires the display position of the avatar <b>142</b> associated with the movement destination user from the storage unit <b>122</b> and determines a position adjacent the acquired position as the new display position of the avatar <b>142</b> associated with the moved user. The movement processing unit <b>184</b> causes the storage unit <b>122</b> to store the new display position of the avatar <b>142</b> of the moved user. Along with this, the unit <b>184</b> directs the lobby display control unit <b>176</b> to move the avatar <b>142</b> of the moved user to the new display position.</p>

The series of steps described above are performed between a plurality of portable game terminals <b>200</b> so that a virtual ad-hoc network is formed between the portable game terminals <b>200</b>. Subsequently, a plurality of users can play the online game in the same virtual space provided by the portable game terminals <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The communication control unit <b>114</b> in the connection source table-top game device <b>100</b> and the connection destination table-top game device <b>100</b> informs the room update processing unit <b>190</b> of the user name of the user originating the connection and the fact that the request for connection from the portable game terminal <b>200</b> is accepted. In this process, the room update processing unit <b>190</b> directs the room display control unit <b>188</b> to display a portable game terminal object <b>168</b>, which indicates that preparation in the portable game terminal <b>200</b> of the user originating the connection is completed. The room display control unit <b>188</b> sets up screen data for the room <b>160</b> so that the portable game terminal object <b>168</b> is displayed in the neighborhood of the avatar <b>162</b> of the user originating the connection in the room <b>160</b>. In this way, the display of the portable game terminal object <b>168</b> in the room <b>160</b> is synchronized so that the room users can know the timing to start the online game.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The communication control unit <b>114</b> in the connection source table-top game device <b>100</b> and the connection destination table-top game device <b>100</b> may also inform the lobby update processing unit <b>18</b> of the room name entered by the user originating the connection and the fact that the request for connection from the portable game terminal <b>200</b> is accepted. The lobby update processing unit <b>18</b> may set up a message for the room comment of the room thus communicated to indicate that preparation in the portable game terminal <b>200</b> is completed. In this way, the lobby user requesting immediate participation in the online game can view the room comment of the rooms created in the lobby <b>140</b> and select the room with the message as the room to enter.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows a screen of the room <b>160</b> displayed on the display of the user. The figure shows a status occurring after the online game is started in the status of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> by the room user in the room A.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">When the online game is started, users participating in the game tend to care only about controlling the portable game terminal <b>200</b> and rarely are the status of the lobby <b>140</b> or the room <b>160</b> known by the user. However, users may want to give a message to another user during the game. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the user &#x201c;Goro&#x201d; gives notification that the user &#x201c;Rokuro&#x201d; will take over using the chat function. To let the other users know the message, the user &#x201c;Goro&#x201d; uses the game controller to cause his or her table-top game device <b>100</b> to output sound to call the attention of the users (hereinafter, also referred to &#x201c;attention-calling sound&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Upon detecting that user operation to output attention-calling sound is performed via the input and output unit <b>124</b>, the user operation determination unit <b>112</b> requests the sound output control unit <b>194</b> to output attention-calling sound (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;sound output request&#x201d;). The sound output control unit <b>194</b> causes the locally connected speaker to output attention-calling sound via the input and output unit <b>124</b>. Along with this, the unit <b>194</b> transmits a sound output request to the other table-top game devices <b>100</b> via the communication control unit <b>114</b> and the cable communication unit <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Upon receiving the sound output request via the cable communication unit <b>128</b>, the communication control unit <b>114</b> in the other table-top game devices <b>100</b> sends the request to the sound output control unit <b>194</b>. The sound output control unit <b>194</b> causes the locally connected speaker to output attention-calling sound via the input and output unit <b>124</b>. This causes attention-calling sound to be output from the speakers of the user &#x201c;Taro&#x201d; and the user &#x201c;Saburo&#x201d; in accordance with the user operation of the user &#x201c;Goro&#x201d;. The &#x201c;Taro&#x201d; user and the &#x201c;Saburo&#x201d; user can know the status of the room <b>160</b> and know the message from &#x201c;Goro&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Since attention-calling sound can be output from other devices by local user operation, the likelihood that a user fails to notice a message of another user in user-to-user communication is reduced. In other words, reliability of information transmission is improved. Separation of the screen of a community site from the game screen according to the embodiment is particularly suitable because user can focus attention on the game screen during the game.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The information exchange system <b>1000</b> of the embodiment aids communication between a plurality of users at dispersed locations by providing users with information exchange service in a community site. Users can know the status of the lobby <b>140</b> after entering a room or during the game and so can communicate with other users depending on the status of the lobby <b>140</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows that the user &#x201c;Goro&#x201d; knows that the user &#x201c;Rokuro&#x201d; enters the lobby <b>140</b> and gives out a message to the user &#x201c;Taro&#x201d; and the user &#x201c;Saburo&#x201d; to indicate &#x201c;Rokuro&#x201d; will take over.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Described above is an explanation based on an exemplary embodiment. The embodiment is intended to be illustrative only and it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various modifications to constituting elements and processes could be developed and that such modifications are also within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">A description will be given of a first variation.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The portable game terminal <b>200</b> may further comprise an SSID setting unit for setting a service set ID (SSID) including a game ID uniquely defined for the game run in the terminal. The SSID identifies a group of terminals communicating with each other in a wireless network, i.e., a network identifier. The wireless communication unit <b>126</b> transmits and receives a data packet including the SSID set by the SSID setting unit to and from the portable game terminal <b>200</b>. The storage unit <b>122</b> stores the game ID included in the SSID and the online game name, associating the ID and the name with each other. Upon detecting the SSID including the game ID in the data packet received by the wireless communication unit <b>126</b>, the communication control <b>114</b> communicates the game ID to the lobby update processing unit <b>178</b>. The lobby update processing unit <b>178</b> refers to the storage unit <b>122</b>, acquires the online game name associated with the game ID, and sets up the acquired name as a room comment. In this way, a suitable room comment is automatically set even when user do not set up any room comments. In other words, the name of the online game about to be played by the room user is automatically set up as a room comment so that convenience of room users and lobby users is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">A description will be given of a second variation.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Referring to the first variation, upon detecting the SSID including the game ID in the packet received by the wireless communication unit <b>126</b>, the communication control unit <b>114</b> may communicate the game ID to the other table-top game devices <b>100</b>. Each of the communication control units <b>114</b> in the other table-top game devices <b>100</b> communicates the game ID to the wireless communication unit <b>126</b>. Each of the wireless communication units <b>126</b> in the other table-top game devices <b>100</b> determines whether the game ID is included in the SSID of the data packet when the data packet is received from the portable game terminal <b>200</b>. When it is determined that the game ID is included, the wireless communication unit <b>126</b> continues wireless communication with the portable game terminal <b>200</b>. When it is determined that the game ID is not included, the wireless communication unit <b>126</b> terminates wireless communication with the portable game terminal <b>200</b>. In this case, data packets from the portable game terminal <b>200</b> may be discarded. By performing a filtering process using a game ID, room users are prevented from starting to play different games. Also, the second variation avoids a trouble that could occur when the portable game terminal <b>200</b> receives game data that the terminal is not supposed to receive.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">A description will be given of a third variation.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In this variation, as in the foregoing variations, the storage unit <b>122</b> stores the game ID that should be included in the SSID and the online game name, associating the ID and the name with each other. When creating the room object <b>146</b> in the lobby <b>140</b>, the lobby user designates the name of the game that should be run by the room users of the room as in the case of a room comment. The user may select a specific game name from a pulldown menu in a wizard for creating a room object. The game name is stored in the management server <b>400</b> as a room attribute. When the user enters the room, the room entry processing unit <b>186</b> acquires the game name from the management server <b>400</b> and informs the communication control unit <b>114</b> of the name. The communication control unit <b>114</b> refers to the storage unit <b>122</b> to identify the game ID that should be included in the SSID and communicates the identified name to the wireless communication unit <b>126</b>. As in the second variation, the wireless communication unit <b>126</b> performs a filtering process by determining whether the SSID of the data packet received from the portable game terminal <b>200</b> includes the game ID. According to the mode described above, the wireless communication unit <b>126</b> may be configured to filter users entering the room automatically, using the setting of the room object <b>146</b> done by the room user. In another variation, a game name may be defined for a lobby. In this case, the wireless communication unit <b>126</b> may be configured to filter users entering the lobby, using similar processes performed in the lobby entry processing unit <b>174</b> and the communication control unit <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">A description will be given of a fourth variation.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The description of the embodiment gives a friend user as an example of friend attribute. It is assumed in the embodiment that a friend object <b>144</b> is set up for the avatar <b>142</b> of a friend user in the lobby <b>140</b>. In one variation, other attributes may be defined as user attributes. Objects corresponding to those attributes may be associated with the avatar <b>142</b> in the lobby <b>140</b> or the avatar <b>162</b> in the room <b>160</b>. Examples of attributes include sex, age, occupation, current state of mind, favorite game genre, favorite game title, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">A description will be given of a fifth variation.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">According to the embodiment, the image of the room <b>160</b> is displayed in a semitransparent fashion and superimposed on the image of the lobby <b>140</b>. In other words, the image of the room <b>160</b> and the image of the lobby <b>140</b> are superimposed on one another both temporarily and spatially. In one variation, the images may be superimposed only temporarily. For example, the image of the room <b>160</b> and the image of the lobby <b>140</b> may be displayed side by side without superimposing the images. Alternatively, the images may be superimposed only spatially. For example, the images may be switched in cycles such that the image of the room <b>160</b> is displayed for 10 seconds and then the image of the lobby <b>140</b> is displayed for several seconds. In any of the fashions described above, the room user can know the status of the lobby <b>140</b> so that convenience of the community site is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">A description will be given of a sixth embodiment. The embodiment described above assumes a single world including eight lobbies. However, there are no particular limits to the number of worlds or the number of lobbies. The numbers may be suitably determined depending on the expected number of lobby users, the number of housings or performance of the management server <b>400</b>, the network bandwidth, etc. These constraints may define the upper limit of the number of users that can enter a lobby. For example, a single management server <b>400</b> may manage two worlds. Each world may include 64 lobbies, and the upper limit of 64 users may be allowed to enter each lobby.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">A description will be given of a seventh embodiment. The embodiment described above assumes the table-top game device <b>100</b> as an example of a device for setting up screen data for the lobby <b>140</b> and the room <b>160</b>. Devices for setting up the screen data may not be limited to game devices but may of course be ordinary PCs or other information processing devices.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Any combination of the embodiment and the variations may also be useful as an embodiment of the present invention. New embodiments produced by the combination will provide the advantages of the embodiment and the variations as combined.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the functions to be achieved by the constituting elements described in the claims are implemented by the constituting elements alone or in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">&#x201c;Objects associated with a plurality of users&#x201d; refer to objects displayed in the lobby <b>140</b>. The objects include the avatar <b>142</b>, the friend object <b>144</b>, the room object <b>146</b>, and the message object <b>156</b>.</p>
