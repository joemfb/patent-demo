<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Dopant-group substituted (cyclo)silane compounds, liquid-phase compositions containing such compounds, and methods for making the same. Such compounds (and/or ink compositions containing the same) are useful for printing or spin coating a doped silane film onto a substrate that can easily be converted into a doped amorphous or polycrystalline silicon film suitable for electronic devices. Thus, the present invention advantageously provides commercial qualities and quantities of doped semiconductor films from a doped &#x201c;liquid silicon&#x201d; composition.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to the field of dopant group-substituted semiconductor precursor compounds, compositions containing such compounds, methods for the synthesis of such compounds, and methods of making such compositions. More specifically, embodiments of the present invention pertain to hetero-substituted (cyclo)silane compounds of the formula (A<sub>n</sub>H<sub>z</sub>)<sub>m</sub>(DR<sup>1</sup><sub>3&#x2212;m</sub>)<sub>q</sub>, where A is Si and/or Ge and D is B, P, As or Sb; doped semiconductor precursor inks containing such compounds; and methods of making such compounds and ink compositions.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">DISCUSSION OF THE BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">There are a number of silanes that are liquid at ambient temperatures (e.g., from about 15&#xb0; C. to about 30&#xb0; C.) or that can be formulated into an ink composition that is liquid at ambient temperatures. Liquid silanes, such as cyclopentasilane or cyclohexasilane, have been investigated as candidate &#x201c;liquid silicon&#x201d; precursors. However, to date, it has been challenging to make semiconducting thin films of commercial qualities and quantities from &#x201c;liquid silicon&#x201d; precursors. One such challenge has related to doping such &#x201c;liquid silicon&#x201d; precursors and/or the films formed therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Methods have been proposed for covalently binding dopant atoms such as phosphorous and boron to silicon atoms in certain liquid (cyclo)silanes. For example, photochemical reactions between (cyclo)silanes and certain phosphines and/or boranes are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,145 and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2003/0229190. Heterocyclic doped silanes are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,527,847 and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2003/0045632, and a method for synthesizing such doped silanes is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,527,847. The properties of thin films formed from such compounds are somewhat disappointing, given the relative proportion of dopant atoms in the film-forming mixture. Also, the results are not quite as reproducible as may be generally desired for commercial applications.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The mechanisms behind the disappointing results are not well understood. However, there may be a number of critical steps involved in forming doped semiconducting films from doped liquid silanes, such as forming the covalent bonds between dopant atoms and silicon, preserving these covalent bonds during subsequent synthesis steps and in initial processing steps to form a thin film or thin film structure, and activating the dopant atoms once the thin film or thin film structure is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, there has been a long-felt need in the art for a &#x201c;liquid silicon&#x201d; compound and/or composition, particularly a doped &#x201c;liquid silicon.&#x201d; Such a composition would primarily comprise silicon atoms (other than solvent, to the extent solvent may be present as a main component), would include a dopant or dopant precursor, would be liquid at ambient temperatures (to facilitate handling, deposition and further processing), and would yield commercial quality semiconducting films upon subsequent processing (e.g., annealing or curing). However, to date, methods of making a thin doped semiconducting film or film structure from doped liquid silanes (or liquid compositions comprising doped silanes) have not been sufficiently reliable for high-volume commercial use.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments of the present invention relate to novel dopant group-substituted (cyclo)silane compounds, to compositions containing such compounds, and to methods of synthesizing such compounds and formulating such compositions. The compounds and compositions are generally useful for making (e.g., by printing or spin-coating, then curing and/or annealing) doped semiconductor thin films (see, e.g., copending U.S. application Ser. No. 10/949,013, filed Sep. 24, 2004). Thus, the present invention advantageously provides a means for obtaining commercial qualities and quantities of thin doped semiconductor films from a &#x201c;doped liquid silicon&#x201d; composition.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention relates to compounds of the formula (A<sub>n</sub>H<sub>z</sub>)<sub>m</sub>(DR<sup>1</sup><sub>3&#x2212;m</sub>)<sub>q</sub>, where n is an integer from 3 to 12, z is from (n&#x2212;q) to (2n+2&#x2212;q), m is an integer from 1 to 3, each of the n*m instances of A is independently Si or Ge, D is Sb, As, P or B, q is generally 1 or 2, and each of the (3&#x2212;m)*q instances of R<sup>1 </sup>is independently H, alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, or AR<sup>2</sup><sub>3</sub>, where R<sup>2 </sup>is hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, or A<sub>p</sub>H<sub>2p+1 </sub>(1&#x2266;p&#x2266;4). However, none of the covalent A-D bonds in the present compound is in a cyclic ring; hence, the characterization of the present compounds as &#x201c;dopant group-substituted.&#x201d; Furthermore, when m=1 and A<sub>n</sub>H<sub>z </sub>is a straight-chain, non-cyclic group of the formula n&#x2212;A<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+2&#x2212;q</sub>, then at most one of the (3&#x2212;m) instances of R<sup>1 </sup>is H. The present composition generally comprises the present hetero-substituted (cyclo)silane and a solvent in which the hetero-substituted (cyclo)silane is soluble.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention further relates to methods for synthesizing such compounds, generally comprising (a) reacting a (cyclo)silane of the formula A<sub>n</sub>H<sub>y </sub>(where y is an even integer of from n to 2n+2) with a dopant group precursor of the formula DR<sup>1</sup><sub>3 </sub>or DR<sup>1</sup><sub>3&#x2212;m</sub>X<sub>m </sub>to form a dopant group-substituted (cyclo)silane compound; and (b) purifying and/or isolating the dopant group-substituted (cyclo)silane compound. The method of making the composition generally comprises combining the hetero-substituted (cyclo)silane with a solvent, and mixing the hetero-substituted (cyclo)silane and the solvent sufficiently to dissolve the hetero-substituted (cyclo)silane in the solvent.</p>

<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention concerns a hetero-substituted (cyclo)silane compound of the formula (A<sub>n</sub>H<sub>z</sub>)<sub>m</sub>(DR<sup>1</sup><sub>3&#x2212;m</sub>)<sub>q</sub>, compositions containing the same, and methods of making the same. In the present hetero-substituted (cyclo)silane compound, n is generally from 3 to 12, z is from (n-q) to (2n+2&#x2212;q), m is an integer of from 1 to 3, each of the n instances of A is independently Si or Ge, q is generally 1 or 2, each of the q instances of D is P, As, Sb or B, and each of the q*(3&#x2212;m) instances of R<sup>1 </sup>is independently H, alkyl, aryl, aralkyl or AR<sup>2</sup><sub>3</sub>, where R<sup>2 </sup>is hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, or A<sub>p</sub>H<sub>2p+1 </sub>(where p is from 1 to 4; e.g., SiH<sub>3</sub>); such that none of the covalent A-D bonds in the formula is in a cyclic ring, and when m=1 and A<sub>n</sub>H<sub>z </sub>is a linear or branched group of the formula n&#x2212;A<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+2&#x2212;q</sub>, then at most one of the (3&#x2212;m) instances of R<sup>1 </sup>is H.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The method of making dopant group-substituted (cyclo)silanes generally comprises the steps of: (a) reacting a (cyclo)silane of the formula A<sub>n</sub>H<sub>y </sub>(where y is an even integer of from n to 2n+2) with a dopant group precursor of the formula DR<sup>1</sup><sub>3 </sub>or DR<sup>1</sup><sub>3&#x2212;m</sub>X<sub>m </sub>to form a dopant group-substituted (cyclo)silane compound; and (b) purifying and/or isolating the dopant group-substituted (cyclo)silane compound. In one embodiment, the (cyclo)silane is photoreacted with a dopant group precursor of the formula DR<sup>1</sup><sub>3 </sub>to form a dopant group-substituted (cyclo)silane compound of the formula (A<sub>n</sub>H<sub>z</sub>)(DR<sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub>)<sub>q</sub>, where z=y&#x2212;q. In another embodiment, a (cyclo)silane of the formula A<sub>n</sub>H<sub>y </sub>(where y is an even integer of from n to 2n+2) is reduced with an alkali metal, then reacted with dopant group precursor of the formula DR<sup>1</sup><sub>3&#x2212;m</sub>X<sub>m </sub>to form the dopant group-substituted (cyclo)silane, the structure of which depends on the identity of the alkali metal (and, to some extent, on whether the silane is cyclic or not). For example, when the alkali metal is Li, one may react two mole equivalents of the alkali metal and a dopant group precursor of the formula DR<sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub>X with one mole equivalent of a cyclosilane to form a dopant group-substituted silane of the formula R<sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub>D-(A<sub>n</sub>H<sub>y</sub>)-DR<sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub>.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Exemplary Hetero-Substituted (Cyclo)Silane Compounds</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present invention relates to a hetero-substituted (cyclo)silane compound of the formula (A<sub>n</sub>H<sub>z</sub>)<sub>m</sub>(DR<sup>1</sup><sub>3&#x2212;m</sub>)<sub>q</sub>, where n is from 3 to 12, z is from (n&#x2212;q) to (2n+2&#x2212;q), m is from 1 to 3, each of the n instances of A is independently Si or Ge, D is Sb, As, P or B, q is generally 1 or 2, and each of the (3&#x2212;m) instances of R<sup>1 </sup>is independently H, alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, or AR<sup>2</sup><sub>3</sub>, where R<sup>2 </sup>is hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, or A<sub>p</sub>H<sub>2p+1 </sub>(e.g., 1&#x2266;p&#x2266;4). Generally, each of the covalent A-D bonds in the present hetero-substituted (cyclo)silane is not in a cyclic ring. In certain preferred embodiments of this compound, A is Si, n is 4 to 6 (predominantly 5), (A<sub>n</sub>H<sub>z</sub>) is monocyclic (i.e., z is 2n&#x2212;q), m and q are each 1, and/or R<sup>1 </sup>is C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6 </sub>alkyl (e.g., t-butyl), C<sub>6</sub>-C<sub>12 </sub>aryl (e.g., phenyl), C<sub>7</sub>-C<sub>12 </sub>aralkyl (e.g., benzyl, &#x3b1;,&#x3b1;-dimethylbenzyl), SiH<sub>3</sub>, or Si(SiH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, although other embodiments may be preferred under certain circumstances. For example, in one embodiment, m is 1, and for each of the q instances of DR<sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub>, one R<sup>1 </sup>may be H and the remaining instances selected from C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6 </sub>alkyl, C<sub>6</sub>-C<sub>12 </sub>aryl, SiH<sub>3</sub>, and Si(SiH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>. In embodiments where m=3, generally q=1.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present invention relates in part to hetero-substituted cyclosilane compounds of the formula (A<sub>n</sub>H<sub>z</sub>)<sub>m</sub>DR<sup>1</sup><sub>3&#x2212;m</sub>, where n is from 3 to 12, z is an odd number from (n&#x2212;1) to (2n&#x2212;1) (preferably [y&#x2212;1]), m is from 1 to 3, each of the n instances of A is independently Si or Ge, D is Sb, As, P or B, and each of the (3&#x2212;m) instances of R<sup>1 </sup>is H, alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, or AR<sup>2</sup><sub>3</sub>, where R<sup>2 </sup>is hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, or A<sub>p</sub>H<sub>2p+1 </sub>(where p is an integer of 1 to 4). In certain preferred embodiments, A is Si, n is 4 to 6 (preferably 5), z is (2n&#x2212;1), D is P or B, and/or m is 1, although other embodiments may be preferred under certain circumstances.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">For example, one or more of the n instances of A may be Ge, in which case the present hetero-substituted (cyclo)silane compounds may comprise a substituted silagermane compound having the formula (Si<sub>n&#x2212;i</sub>Ge<sub>i</sub>H<sub>z</sub>)<sub>m</sub>DR<sup>1</sup><sub>3&#x2212;m</sub>, where i is an integer of at least 1 but less than n. Depending on the choice of starting materials (see, e.g., U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/789,317, filed Feb. 27, 2004, the relevant portions of which are incorporated herein by reference), the present compounds may be formed from a somewhat statistical mixture of cyclosilane compounds and cyclosilagermane compounds (e.g., in which there is a statistical distribution of compounds with specific n and i values).</p>

Also as shown in the compound of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, when q is 2 and the formula A<sub>n</sub>H<sub>z </sub>contains a polycyclosilyl moiety, the two DR<sup>1</sup><sub>3&#x2212;m </sub>groups may be covalently bound to A atoms that are members of a common ring. Positional and stereochemical isomers of the present compounds (such as isomers of the compound of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>) are also encompassed by the present invention. Furthermore, as is explained in greater detail below with regard to a &#x201c;photochemical coupling&#x201d; embodiment of the present method of making dopant group-substituted (cyclo)silanes, q can be greater than 2. In theory, up to all y H atoms in the (cyclo)silane can be replaced with -DR<sup>1</sup><sub>2 </sub>groups; however, due to steric crowding and/or hindrance effects, q is generally expected to be not greater than n when the silane is cyclic, and not greater than (n+2) when the silane is not cyclic.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1D and 1E</figref> show two different structures for a hetero-substituted polycyclosilane compound in which n=12 and z=n&#x2212;1. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref> shows a dopant atom-substituted cyclosilane in which n=5, z=2n&#x2212;1, and m=3, that can be synthesized according to the &#x201c;Na/K&#x201d; embodiment of the present method of making dopant group-substituted (cyclo)silanes disclosed below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1G</figref> shows a heterosilane compound in which n=4, m=1 and one of the R<sup>1 </sup>groups is H that may be made using either the photochemical coupling or the Na/K embodiment of the present method of making dopant group-substituted (cyclo)silanes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1H and 1I</figref> respectively show hetero-substituted silane and hetero-substituted cyclosilane compounds in which m=1, q=2, and n=5 or 10, that are synthesized using the &#x201c;Li&#x201d; embodiment of the present method of making dopant group-substituted (cyclo)silanes disclosed below.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Generally, when n&#x2266;6, the present hetero-substituted cyclosilane compounds are monocyclic (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1F</figref>); when n&#x2267;8, the present hetero-substituted cyclosilane compounds are generally polycyclic (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1C-1E</figref> and <b>1</b>I); and when 6&#x2266;n&#x2266;8, the present hetero-substituted cyclosilane compounds may be monocyclic or polycyclic. Thus, in some preferred embodiments, 4&#x2266;n&#x2266;10; more preferably, 4&#x2266;n&#x2266;6; and in one preferred compound, n is 5.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">One distinguishing feature of certain hetero-substituted (cyclo)silane compounds is the R<sup>1 </sup>group covalently bound to the dopant atom D. For example, R<sup>1 </sup>may be C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6 </sub>alkyl (e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, n-hexyl or t-hexyl [1,1-dimethylbutyl]), C<sub>6</sub>-C<sub>12 </sub>aryl (e.g., phenyl, &#x3b1;- or &#x3b2;-naphthyl, tolyl [o-, m- or p-methylphenyl], xylyl [e.g., 1,4-dimethylphenyl], cymyl [o-, m- or p-methylisopropylphenyl], t-butylphenyl, etc.), C<sub>7</sub>-C<sub>12 </sub>aralkyl (e.g., benzyl, 1,5-dimethylbenzyl, &#x3b1;,&#x3b1;-dimethylbenzyl, etc.), SiH<sub>3</sub>, or Si(SiH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>(i.e., y=1), although when R<sup>1 </sup>is AR<sup>2</sup><sub>3</sub>, R<sup>2 </sup>can be hydrogen, C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6 </sub>alkyl, C<sub>6</sub>-C<sub>12 </sub>aryl or C<sub>7</sub>-C<sub>12 </sub>aralkyl as described above. In certain implementations, R<sup>1 </sup>is t-butyl or phenyl. In other implementations, R<sup>1 </sup>is SiH<sub>3 </sub>or Si(SiH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In theory, dopant atom D may be any conventional dopant atom used in the semiconductor field. In practice, however, D is generally P, As, Sb or B (preferably P or B). One characteristic of a thin semiconducting film made from the present hetero-substituted (cyclo)silane compounds is that the dopant is uniformly distributed throughout the thin film (see, e.g., copending U.S. application Ser. No. 10/949,013, filed Sep. 24, 2004, the relevant portions of which are incorporated herein by reference). Surprisingly, the presence of a carbon-containing substituent on the dopant atom does not result in a significant increase in the amount of carbon in doped semiconductor films formed from the present hetero-substituted (cyclo)silane compounds, or in significant adverse effects on the physical and/or structural properties of such films, relative to undoped films formed from structurally analogous cyclosilanes (e.g., cyclopentasilane).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In an alternative embodiment, the present compound comprises a hetero-substituted silane compound of the formula (A<sub>n</sub>H<sub>y</sub>)(DR<sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, where n and y are as defined above, each of the n instances of A is independently Si or Ge, D is Sb, As, P or B, and each R<sup>1 </sup>is independently H, alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, or AR<sup>2</sup><sub>3</sub>, where R<sup>2 </sup>is hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, or A<sub>p</sub>H<sub>2p+1 </sub>(e.g., 1&#x2266;p&#x2266;4). In certain preferred embodiments of this compound, the formula is (AH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>(DR<sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, A is Si, n is 4 to 6 (and predominantly 5), and R<sup>1 </sup>is C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6 </sub>alkyl (e.g., t-butyl), C<sub>6</sub>-C<sub>12 </sub>aryl (e.g., phenyl), C<sub>7</sub>-C<sub>12 </sub>aralkyl, SiH<sub>3</sub>, or Si(SiH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, although other embodiments may be preferred under certain circumstances. One example of this type of compound is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1H</figref>, where n=5, m=1, and q=2.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Exemplary Hetero-Substituted (Cyclo)Silane Compositions and Methods of Making the Same</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The invention further relates to a composition comprising the present hetero-substituted (cyclo)silane compound(s) (i.e., of the formula (A<sub>n</sub>H<sub>z</sub>)<sub>m</sub>(DR<sup>1</sup><sub>3&#x2212;m</sub>)<sub>q</sub>) and a solvent in which the hetero-substituted (cyclo)silane is soluble. Thus, preferred compositions include those that contain one or more preferred hetero-substituted (cyclo)silanes compound (e.g., where A is Si, z is 2n&#x2212;q, n is 4-6, m is 1, D is P or B, and/or R<sup>1 </sup>is C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6 </sub>alkyl, C<sub>6</sub>-C<sub>12 </sub>aryl, C<sub>7</sub>-C<sub>12 </sub>aralkyl, SiH<sub>3</sub>, or Si(SiH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>[particularly where R<sup>1 </sup>is t-butyl or phenyl]).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The solvent in the present composition is one that is generally easily and/or thoroughly removable from the composition. Thus, in one embodiment, the solvent is selected from the group consisting of alkanes, substituted alkanes, cycloalkanes, substituted cycloalkanes, arenes, substituted arenes, and (cyclic) siloxanes, preferably those having a boiling point at 1 atm pressure of &#x3c;250&#xb0; C., &#x2266;200&#xb0; C., or &#x2266;150&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">While other apolar and/or non-polar solvents (e.g., saturated hydrocarbons such as C<sub>5</sub>-C<sub>12 </sub>alkanes, aliphatic ethers such as di-C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>6 </sub>alkyl ethers, methyl C<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>6 </sub>alkyl ethers and di-C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4 </sub>alkyl C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>6 </sub>alkylene diethers [e.g., glyme], cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxane, (cyclo)siloxanes, arenes such as benzene, toluene and xylenes, etc.) may be included in the present composition, mono- or polycycloalkanes, (cyclic) siloxanes and fluoroalkanes are generally preferred for their removability from the composition. Somewhat surprisingly, mono- and bicycloalkanes (e.g., monocyclooctane, decalin) provide ink formulations with improved stability relative to aromatic hydrocarbon solvents. Furthermore, the (doped) (cyclo)silanes are generally more soluble in mono- or bicycloalkane solvents than in arene-based solvents.</p>

Thus, this embodiment of the general method of synthesizing dopant group-substituted (cyclo)silanes may be referred to as the &#x201c;photochemical coupling&#x201d; embodiment. In this embodiment, the dopant group-substituted (cyclo)silane compound formed generally has the formula (A<sub>n</sub>H<sub>z</sub>)DR<sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub>, where z=(y&#x2212;1), but as will be discussed below, certain dopant group-substituted (cyclo)silane compounds may have the formula (A<sub>n</sub>H<sub>y&#x2212;2</sub>)(DR<sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>(i.e., q=2).</p>

Naturally, the (di)alkyl and (di)aryl boranes may be in the form of dimers; e.g., (R<sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub>D[&#x3bc;&#x2212;H])<sub>2</sub>.

Generally, the light comprises ultraviolet light (UV radiation), preferably having a wavelength absorbed by and/or sufficient to electronically excite the (cyclo)silane. In various embodiments, such radiation includes light having a wavelength within the range of from 200 nm to 440 nm, 220 nm to 400 nm, or 250 to 380 nm. A suitable source of such radiation may comprise a mercury vapor and/or arc lamp. The power output of the preferred UV lamp may be adjusted to about 0.1-20, 0.25-10 or 0.5-5 milliwatt/cm<sup>2</sup>. The photochemical coupling reaction may be conducted for a length of time of from 5 minutes to 24 hours, 15 minutes to 12 hours, or 30 minutes to 8 hours, depending on the scale of the reaction and/or the concentration(s) of the reactant(s). Generally, the higher the power output, the shorter the irradiation/reaction time. The reaction vessel will generally have at least one window, wall or surface that is transparent to such radiation. Typically, such a window, wall or surface (or the entire reaction vessel) comprises quartz. The photochemical coupling reaction is generally conducted at a temperature as close to ambient as the reaction conditions allow; for example, the reaction vessel and/or the radiation source may be conventionally cooled using a water jacket (which may use recirculating ice water), ice bath, or other conventional reaction cooling means.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The solvent may be any relatively non-polar, non-reactive solvent used in photochemical coupling reactions (e.g., having a negligible absorption at the wavelength chosen for irradiation).

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Under certain conditions, certain silanes (e.g., the polycyclosilane compound of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) may react with two (or more) mole equivalents of dopant group precursor to form a dopant group-substituted (cyclo)silane of the formula (A<sub>n</sub>H<sub>y&#x2212;q</sub>)(DR<sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub>)<sub>q</sub>, where q is an integer of 2 or more (in theory, up to y). Generally, a somewhat statistical distribution of products is expected when using two mole equivalents of dopant group precursor, in which products having q=2 will be formed in the largest percentage or proportion, products having q=1 and q=3 will be formed in the next largest (but significantly smaller) percentages or proportions, and products having q=4 may be formed in some detectable and/or isolatable amount, but other products having q&#x2260;0 may not be isolated or detected (although some amount of starting silane may be recovered). Similarly, products in which q=2 will generally be formed in a detectable and/or isolatable amount in the photochemical coupling reaction of a (cyclo)silane with one mole equivalent of dopant group precursor. Such products in which q=2 will generally be more likely to form the greater the value of n, but it is expected that the steric crowding of successive dopant groups will inhibit or prevent further substitution beyond a certain point. As a result, the photochemical coupling embodiment may be used to make compounds of the formula (A<sub>n</sub>H<sub>y&#x2212;q</sub>)(DR<sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub>)<sub>q</sub>, where n and y are as defined above, and q may be from 1 to n when the starting silane is cyclic and from 1 to n+2 when the starting silane is not cyclic.</p>

For example, one may suspend the alkali metal in a solvent that is not reduced by the alkali metal (see the solvents below). In various embodiments, the (cyclo)silane may be present in an amount providing a 1:1, 2:1 or 3:1 molar ratio of (cyclo)silane to later-added dopant group precursor (the exact molar ratio depending on the value of m in the dopant group precursor), and the alkali metal may be present in an amount providing a slight molar excess (e.g., 1% or more, 3% or more, or 5% or more) of alkali metal relative to (cyclo)silane.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The &#x201c;Na/K&#x201d; reduction is generally started at a relatively low initial temperature (e.g., from &#x2212;78&#xb0; C. to ambient temperatures [e.g., from about 15&#xb0; C. to about 30&#xb0; C.]), from about &#x2212;60&#xb0; C. to about 0&#xb0; C., or from about &#x2212;40&#xb0; C. to about &#x2212;5&#xb0; C.). The reaction vessel and/or the radiation source may be conventionally cooled using a water jacket (which may use recirculating ice water or a subzero aqueous salt solution), dry ice bath, or other conventional reaction cooling means.

Preferably, the solvent comprises or consists essentially of one or more alkanes (e.g., a C<sub>5</sub>-C<sub>12 </sub>or C<sub>6</sub>-C<sub>10 </sub>alkane), cycloalkanes (e.g., a C<sub>5</sub>-C<sub>10 </sub>cycloalkane), arenes (e.g., benzene), substituted arenes (e.g., toluene, xylenes, etc.), aliphatic ethers (e.g., di-C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>6 </sub>alkyl ethers, methyl C<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>6 </sub>alkyl ethers and di-C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4 </sub>alkyl C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>6 </sub>alkylene diethers [e.g., glyme]), and/or cyclic ethers (such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxane).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The &#x201c;coupling&#x201d; reaction in the &#x201c;Na/K&#x201d; embodiment may comprise adding the dopant group precursor of the formula DR<sup>1</sup><sub>3&#x2212;m</sub>X<sub>m </sub>to the reduced (cyclo)silane (e.g., dropwise by syringe, in a solution by addition funnel, via a double-ended needle, etc.) at a temperature of from &#x2212;78&#xb0; C. to the reflux temperature of the solvent, from about &#x2212;40&#xb0; C. to about 50&#xb0; C. (or the solvent reflux temperature, whichever is lower), or from about 0&#xb0; C. to ambient temperatures, for a length of time of from 15 minutes to 16 hours, 30 minutes to 12 hours, or 1 hour to 8 hours, depending on the scale of the reaction and/or the concentration(s) of the reactant(s). Optionally, the coupling reaction mixture may be warmed to a target temperature higher than the initial temperature (e.g., from about 0&#xb0; C. to the reflux temperature of the solvent, or from ambient temperatures to about 50&#xb0; C.) for a length of time of from 30 minutes to 16 hours, 1 hours to 12 hours, or 2 to 8 hours, depending on the scale of the reaction and/or the concentration(s) of the reactant(s). Generally, a slight molar excess (e.g., 1% or more, 2% or more, or 3% or more) of dopant group precursor (calculated on the number of halogen atoms) relative to alkali metal is added.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">When m=1, about one mole equivalent of dopant group precursor is added to the reduced (cyclo)silane to form a dopant group-substituted (cyclo)silane of the formula (A<sub>n</sub>H<sub>z</sub>)DR<sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub>. When m=2, about one-half mole equivalent of dopant group precursor is added to the reduced (cyclo)silane to form a dopant group-substituted (cyclo)silane of the formula (A<sub>n</sub>H<sub>z</sub>)<sub>2</sub>DR<sup>1</sup>. When m=3, about one-third mole equivalent of dopant group precursor is added to the reduced (cyclo)silane to form a dopant group-substituted (cyclo)silane of the formula D(A<sub>n</sub>H<sub>z</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">A Third Exemplary Method for Synthesizing Dopant Group-Substituted (Cyclo)silanes</heading>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In a third exemplary embodiment of the present method of synthesizing dopant group-substituted silanes similar to the second exemplary embodiment above, the alkali metal is Li, the dopant group precursor has the formula DR<sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub>X, and the reacting step comprises reacting two mole equivalents of the alkali metal and the dopant group precursor with the cyclosilane to form a dopant group-substituted silane of the formula R<sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub>D-(A<sub>n</sub>H<sub>y</sub>)-DR<sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub>. This embodiment of the present method for synthesizing hetero-substituted silanes (and, as will be discussed below, heterocyclosilanes) may therefore be known as the &#x201c;Li&#x201d; embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">However, in an alternative &#x201c;Li&#x201d; embodiment, the dopant group precursor has the formula DR<sup>1</sup>X<sub>2</sub>, and this aspect of the invention provides a method of making a heterocyclosilane. This method generally comprises the steps of (a) reducing a cyclosilane of the formula A<sub>n</sub>H<sub>y </sub>with at least two mole equivalents of lithium, where n is an integer from 3 to 12, y is from n to 2n, and each of the n instances of A is independently Si or Ge; and (b) reacting the reduced (cyclo)silane with a dopant group precursor of the formula DR<sup>1</sup>X<sub>2 </sub>to form a heterocyclosilane compound, where D is Sb, As, P or B, and R<sup>1 </sup>is independently alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, or AR<sup>2</sup><sub>3 </sub>(where R<sup>2 </sup>is hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, or A<sub>p</sub>H<sub>2p+1</sub>, 1&#x2266;p&#x2266;4), and each instance of X is independently a halogen. This alternative &#x201c;Li&#x201d; embodiment may further comprise (c) purifying and/or isolating the heterocyclosilane compound.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Generally, the reaction conditions (e.g., solvent, molar reactant ratios, temperature, length of reaction time, etc.) for each of the reduction and coupling reactions in this third exemplary method are the same as for the second exemplary method described above. Only the formulas of the starting materials typically differ, although conditions may depend to some extent on the selection of certain (cyclo)silanes and dopant group precursors. For example, ring-strained cyclosilanes (e.g., the compound of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, having two four-membered rings) may be reduced at a lower temperature and/or for a shorter period of time than less ring-strained cyclosilanes (e.g., cyclopentasilane, c-[SiH<sub>2</sub>]<sub>5</sub>). Also, sterically hindered dopant group precursors (e.g., di-t-butylphosphorous chloride, [(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>C]<sub>2</sub>P&#x2014;Cl) may benefit more from higher coupling reaction temperatures and/or longer coupling reaction times than less hindered dopant group precursors (e.g., dimethylphosphorous chloride, [CH<sub>3</sub>]<sub>2</sub>P&#x2014;Cl).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In one example, cyclopentasilane may be reduced with two mole equivalents of Li metal (suspended in dry THF at about 0&#xb0; C. under an inert atmosphere, then warmed to room temperature for about 12-16 hours after the addition of cyclopentasilane), then two mole equivalents of di-t-butylphosphorous chloride (dissolved in dry THF) may be added to the reaction mixture at about 0&#xb0; C. by addition funnel under an inert atmosphere. Thereafter, the coupling reaction mixture may be refluxed for 4-8 hours to provide ([CH<sub>3</sub>]<sub>3</sub>C)<sub>2</sub>P&#x2014;(SiH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>&#x2014;P(C[CH<sub>3</sub>]<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>), the compound of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1H</figref> in which R<sup>1</sup>=t-butyl, &#x2014;C(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, after isolation and/or purification using conventional techniques (e.g., filtering to remove insoluble solid-phase by-products, evaporating most if not all of the solvent by vacuum, precipitating certain impurities by addition of a non-polar solvent such as toluene or [cyclo]hexane, then [re]crystallizing the final product, optionally after evaporating some of the non-polar solvent). A similar process can be performed with c-(SiH)<sub>10 </sub>to form the compound of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1I</figref> in which R<sup>1</sup>=t-butyl.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Alternatively, after reducing cyclopentasilane with two mole equivalents of Li metal as described in the preceding paragraph, one mole equivalent of t-butylphosphorous dichloride may be added to the reaction mixture and isolated and/or purified as described above to provide c-(SiH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>P&#x2014;C(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, the compound of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in which R<sup>1</sup>=t-butyl, &#x2014;C(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Exemplary Isolation and/or Purification Steps</heading>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The present method may further comprise the step of purifying and/or isolating the hetero-substituted (cyclo)silane (or heterocyclosilane). Such purifying and/or isolating typically comprises removing solid by-product(s) from the reaction mixture by filtration. Alternatively, the reaction mixture can be passed through a column of silica or acidic aluminum gel to remove solid by-product. The isolating and/or purifying may further comprise removing the remainder of the solvent. Alternatively, isolating and/or purifying may comprise distilling the hetero-substituted (cyclo)silane (or heterocyclosilane), optionally under reduced pressure (e.g., from 0.1 to 50 Torr) and/or at ambient temperature or higher (e.g., from about 15&#xb0; C. to about 90&#xb0; C., or from about 20&#xb0; C. to about 60&#xb0; C.).</p>
