No. 8,332,975, which claims the priority benefit under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(e) of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/238,655, filed Aug. 31, 2009, the entireties of both of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This application relates to climate control, and more specifically, to climate control of medical beds, hospital beds, other types of beds and similar devices.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Pressure ulcers, which are also commonly referred as decubitus ulcers or bed sores, are lesions that form on the body as a result of prolonged contact with a bed or other surface. Bed sores typically result from exposure to one or more factors, such as, for example, unrelieved pressure, friction or other shearing forces, humidity (e.g., moisture caused by perspiration, incontinence, exudate, etc.), elevated temperatures, age and/or the like. Although such ulcers may occur to any part of the body, they normally affect bony and cartilaginous areas (e.g., the sacrum, elbows, knees, ankles, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One known method of preventing decubitus ulcers for patients who are confined to beds or other seating assemblies for prolonged time periods includes pressure redistribution or pressure reduction. Pressure redistribution generally involves spreading the forces created by an occupant's presence on a bed over a larger area of the occupant-bed interface. Thus, in order to accomplish pressure redistribution, a bed or other support structure can be designed with certain immersion and envelopment characteristics. For example, a desired depth of penetration (e.g., sinking level) can be provided along the upper surface of the bed when an occupant is situated thereon. Relatedly, an upper portion of a bed can be adapted to generally conform to the various irregularities of the occupant's body.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to help prevent the occurrence of decubitus ulcers, one or more other factors may also be targeted, either in addition to or in lieu of pressure redistribution. For example, lower shear materials can be used at the occupant-bed interface. Further, temperature and moisture levels along certain areas of an occupant's body can be reduced. In addition, the control of certain factors, such as high pressure, temperature, friction, moisture and/or the like, may improve the general comfort level of an occupant, even where decubitus ulcers are not a concern. Accordingly, a need exists to provide a conditioner mat or topper member for a bed (e.g., hospital or other medical bed) or other seating assembly that provides certain climate-control features to help prevent bed sores and/or help enhance comfort.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">This application is generally directed to climate control systems for beds or other seating assemblies. More specifically, in certain arrangements, the present application discloses climate controlled fluid conditioner members or topper members that are configured to be selectively positioned on top of hospital beds, medical beds, other types of beds and/or other seating assemblies (e.g., chairs, wheelchairs, other seats, etc.). Thus, the topper members or conditioner mats and the various systems and features associated with them are described herein in the context of a bed assembly (e.g., medical bed) because they have particular utility in this context. However, the devices, systems and methods described herein, can be used in other contexts as well, such as, for example, but without limitation, seat assemblies for automobiles, trains, planes, motorcycles, buses, other types of vehicles, wheelchairs, other types of medical chairs, beds and seating assemblies, sofas, task chairs, office chairs, other types of chairs and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">One embodiment of a conditioner mat <b>20</b> or topper member adapted to be attached to or otherwise positioned on top of a medical bed <b>8</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown, the mat <b>20</b> can be positioned on a mattress, pad, cushion or other support member <b>10</b> of a bed <b>8</b>. According to certain embodiments, the mattress <b>10</b> or other support member comprises foam, viscoelastic, air chambers, gel, springs and/or any other resilient materials to give it a desired or required feel. For example, the firmness, pliability and other physical characteristics of the mattress or other support member can be selected so as to enhance pressure redistribution when an occupant is positioned thereon. As discussed in greater detail herein, this can assist in preventing decubitus ulcers for bed occupants.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As discussed in greater detail herein, the conditioner mat <b>20</b> can be releasably secured to a mattress <b>10</b> or other portion of a bed using one or more attachment methods or devices. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the mat <b>20</b> can comprise a peripheral skirt that is configured to fit around a portion of the mattress (e.g., like a fitted sheet, other encapsulating member, etc.). The skirt can include one or more elasticized portions or members to facilitate its securement to and/or removal from the mattress. Such a design can also provide a more secure connection between the mat <b>20</b> and the mattress, pad, cushion or other support member <b>10</b>. In other arrangements, the position of the separate topper member <b>20</b> is maintained relative to the mattress <b>10</b> using one or more straps (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), zippers, hook-and-loop type fasteners, buttons, snap connections, friction surfaces and/or the like, as desired or required. In one embodiment, the straps <b>21</b>&#x2032; are elastic or otherwise expandable. Alternatively, the topper or mat <b>20</b> can be permanently attached to a support member <b>10</b> (e.g., mattress, pad, cushion, etc.) or other portion of a bed <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, one or more portions of the conditioner mat <b>20</b> can be selectively supplied with ambient and/or thermally-conditioned (e.g., heated, cooled, etc.) air or other fluid. According to certain arrangements, such fluids are generated by one or more fluid modules located within a separate fluid box <b>60</b>. A fluid module can include a blower, fan or other fluid transfer device. In certain embodiments, the fluid module can additionally include a thermoelectric device (e.g., Peltier circuit), a convective heater, other types of heating or cooling devices, dehumidifier and/or any other environmentally conditioning device. A fluid module can also include one or more of the following, as desired or required: fluid transfer members (e.g., fins), a sensor (e.g., temperature, humidity, condensation, etc.), a controller and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, fluid exiting a fluid module, which in some embodiments is housed within a fluid box <b>60</b> or other enclosure, can be advantageously routed to the mat or topper member <b>20</b> using one or more ducts or other fluid conduits <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>. The ducts can include one or more flexible, semi-rigid and/or rigid materials, such as, for example, plastic, rubber and the like. In some embodiments, such ducts or conduits are at least partially insulated to prevent or reduce the likelihood of thermal losses between the fluid module and the topper member <b>20</b>. As discussed in greater detail herein, a fluid module that supplies air or other fluid to a conditioner mat <b>20</b> need not be positioned within a separate box <b>60</b>. For instance, a fluid module can be incorporated within, adjacent to or near a main portion of the topper member. Alternatively, a fluid module can be configured to hang off one or more edges of the topper member and/or the like. Additional disclosure regarding fluid modules is provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/047,077, filed Jan. 31, 2005 and issued on Sep. 15, 2009 as U.S. Pat. No. 7,587,901, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated herein.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Regardless of the exact configuration of the topper member and fluid modules that are in fluid communication with it, the topper member <b>20</b> can include one or more fluid zones <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> into which thermally-conditioned or ambient air can be selectively delivered. For example, the conditioner mat <b>20</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> comprises a total of four climate control zones <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>. The mat <b>20</b> can be designed so that two or more zones are in fluid communication with one another. Consequently, air or other fluid having a first type of ventilation or thermal conditioning properties can be provided to certain portions of the mat <b>20</b>, while air or fluid having a second type of ventilation or thermal conditioning properties can be provided to other portions of the mat, as desired or required. For example, one set of fluid zones <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> can be supplied with relatively cool air, while another set of fluid zones <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> can be supplied with relative warm air, or vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In other arrangements, a mat or topper member <b>20</b> can include additional or fewer fluid zones, as desired or required. For instance, the mat <b>20</b> can include only a single conditioning zone (e.g., extending, at least partially, across some or most of the mat's surface area) such as the arrangement illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. In certain embodiments, two or more zones of the topper member or mat <b>20</b> are fluidly isolated from each other. Thus, air or other fluid entering one zone (or one set of zones) can be kept substantially separate and distinct from air or fluid entering another zone (or another set of zones). This can help ensure that fluid streams having varying properties and other characteristics (e.g., type or composition of fluid, temperature, relative humidity level, flowrate, etc.) can be delivered to targeted portions of a conditioner mat <b>20</b> in a desired manner.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">According to certain embodiments, as discussed in greater detail herein, air or other fluid delivered into a zone <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> exits through one or more openings <b>24</b> (e.g., holes, apertures, slits, etc.) located along an upper layer or other upper surface of the mat <b>20</b>. Thus, ambient and/or environmentally-conditioned (e.g., cooled, heated, dehumidified, etc.) air can be advantageously directed to targeted portions of an occupant's body. For example, in the topper member <b>20</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the zones <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> are arranged in a manner to generally target an occupant's head (zone <b>34</b>), shoulders (zone <b>44</b>), ischial region (zone <b>36</b>) and heels (zone <b>46</b>). However, a conditioner mat <b>20</b> in accordance with any of the embodiments disclosed herein can be modified to include more or fewer zones to target these and/or other body portions of an occupant.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In certain embodiments, the fluid zones <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> of a conditioner mat or topper member <b>20</b> are strategically positioned to target portions of the anatomy that are susceptible to decubitus ulcers, other ailments, general discomfort and/or other problems resulting from prolonged contact with a bed surface. As noted above, reducing the temperature and/or moisture levels in such susceptible anatomical regions can help prevent (or reduce the likelihood of) bed sores and help improve the comfort level of an occupant. For example, with respect to the hospital or medical bed <b>8</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the fluid zones <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> can be arranged so that ambient and/or conditioned (e.g., heated, cooled, dehumidified, etc.) air or other fluids are selectively delivered through the topper member <b>20</b> toward an occupant's back of the head, shoulders, upper back, elbows, lower back, hips, heels and/or any other target anatomical region.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, air or other fluid can be directed from the fluid module(s) (e.g., stand-alone unit(s), unit(s) located within a fluid box <b>60</b>, etc.) to the conditioner mat <b>20</b> through one or more ducts <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>. The ducts <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> can include standard or non-standard conduits. For instance, a duct can include flexible 1-inch diameter rubber tubing having a generally circular cross-section. However, the materials of constructions, cross-sectional size or shape, flexibility or rigidity and other details regarding the ducts <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> or other fluid conduits can vary, as desired or required.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In addition, according to certain arrangements, fluid is supplied to the conditioner mat <b>20</b> from both the left and right sides of the bed <b>8</b>. However, the number, location and other details regarding the fluid inlets into the mat <b>20</b> can vary, as desired or required. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the fluid box <b>60</b> is secured to or near the headboard of the bed assembly <b>8</b>. However, as discussed in greater detail herein, the fluid box <b>60</b> can be positioned at any other location relative to the bed, such as, for example, along the footboard, one of the sides and/or the like. Positioning the fluid modules away from the occupant head, regardless of whether or not the fluid modules are included within a fluid box <b>60</b>, can reduce the noise levels perceived by the occupant. Additional details regarding the fluid modules and the ducts are provided herein.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">According to certain arrangements, one or more fittings <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> are situated at the interface of the topper member <b>20</b> and a fluid conduit <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>. As discussed in greater detail herein, such fittings <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> can advantageously facilitate the connection of the conduits <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> to (and/or disconnection from) the mat or topper member <b>20</b>. This can be beneficial whenever there is a need or desire to remove the mat <b>20</b> from the adjacent mattress, pad, cushion or other support member <b>10</b> for cleaning, servicing, replacement and/or any other purpose. The fittings <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> can also help reduce the likelihood that fluids inadvertently leak prior to their delivery into an interior space (e.g., passages <b>32</b>, <b>42</b>, zones <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, etc.) of the mat <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the mat <b>20</b> can include an upper layer <b>22</b> and a lower layer <b>26</b> that together generally define a space S therebetween. According to certain arrangements, the upper and lower layers <b>22</b>, <b>26</b> comprise one or more fluid impermeable or substantially fluid impermeable materials and/or conductive materials, such as, for example, vinyl, other plastics, fabric and/or the like. In order to allow air or other fluids to exit the interior space S (e.g., in the direction of a bed occupant), the upper layer <b>22</b> can include a plurality of openings <b>24</b> (e.g., holes, orifices, etc.) along its upper layer <b>22</b>. The quantity, shape, size, spacing, orientation, location and other details of the openings <b>24</b> can be varied to achieve a desired or required airflow scheme along the top of the mat or topper member <b>20</b> during use.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In other arrangements, the upper layer <b>22</b> and/or the lower layer <b>26</b> of the mat conditioner mat <b>20</b> comprise a generally fluid impermeable lining, coating or other member along at least a portion (e.g., some or all) of its surface area in order to provide the mat with the desired air permeability or conductive characteristics or properties. Alternatively, one or more portions of the mat's upper surface (e.g., upper layer <b>22</b>) can be at least partially fluid permeable. Thus, air or other fluids delivered within an interior space S of a topper member <b>20</b> may diffuse through such air permeable portions, toward a bed occupant.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">According to certain configurations, as illustrated, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, one or more fluid distribution members <b>28</b> or spacer materials can be positioned within an interior space S of the conditioner mat <b>20</b>. Such fluid distribution members can provide desired structural characteristics to the mat <b>20</b> so that the integrity of the space S is sufficiently maintained during use. In addition, the fluid distribution member <b>28</b> or spacer material can help distribute air or other fluids within the interior space S. Consequently, air or other fluids delivered to the conditioner mat or topper member <b>20</b> can be advantageously distributed within the interior spaces S of the various zones. This can help ensure that ambient and/or conditioned (e.g., cooled, heated, dehumidified, etc.) fluids are properly delivered through the openings <b>24</b> along the top surface of the mat <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the conditioner mat <b>20</b> can be shaped, sized and generally configured to receive a fluid distribution member <b>28</b> within the interior space (e.g., generally between the upper and lower layers <b>22</b>, <b>26</b>). As noted above, the fluid distribution member <b>28</b> can include one or more spacer materials that are adapted to generally maintain their shape when subjected to compressive forces and other loads (e.g., from an occupant seated thereon or thereagainst). For example, in some embodiments, the fluid distribution member <b>28</b> comprises a spacer fabric, open cell or other porous foam, a mesh, honeycomb or other porous structure, other materials that are generally air permeable and/or conductive or that have an open structure through which fluids may pass and/or the like. Such spacer fabrics or other spacer materials can be configured to maintain a minimum clearance between the upper and lower layers <b>22</b>, <b>26</b> so that air or other fluid entering the mat <b>20</b> can be at least partially distributed within the interior space S before exiting the openings <b>24</b>. As discussed in greater detail herein, in certain arrangements, the mat or topper member <b>20</b> is configured to be selectively removed from the interior space S for replacement, cleaning, repair or for any other purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In some embodiments, the mat or topper member comprises a spacer fabric that is configured to generally retain its three-dimensional shape when subjected to compressive and/or other types of forces. The spacer fabric can advantageously include internal pores or passages that permit air or other fluid to pass therethrough. For example, the spacer fabric can comprise an internal lattice or other structure which has internal openings at least partially extending from the top surface to the bottom surface of the spacer fabric. In some embodiments, the thickness of the spacer fabric or other fluid distribution member is approximately 6-14 mm (e.g., about 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, 12 mm, 14 mm, values between such ranges, etc.). In other arrangements, the thickness of the spacer fabric or other fluid distribution member of the mat is less than approximately 6 mm (e.g., about 5 mm, 4 mm, 3 mm, 2 mm, 1 mm, less than 1 mm, values between such ranges, etc.) or greater than approximately 14 mm (e.g., about 15 mm, 16 mm, 18 mm, 20 mm, 24 mm, 28 mm, 36 mm, greater than 36 mm, values between such ranges, etc.). The spacer fabric or other fluid distribution member can be manufactured from one or more durable materials, such as, for example, foam, plastic, other polymeric materials, composites, ceramic, rubber and/or the like. The rigidity, elasticity, strength and/or other properties of the spacer fabric can be selectively modified to achieve a target spacing within an interior of the mat or topper member, a desired balance between comfort and durability and/or the like. In some embodiments, the spacer fabric can comprise woven textile, nylon mesh material, reticulated foam, open-cell foam and/or the like. The spacer fabric can be advantageously breathable, resistant to crush and air permeable. However, in other embodiments, a spacer fabric can be customized to suit a particular application. Therefore, the breathability, air permeability and/or crush resistance of a spacer fabric can vary.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrates a partial cross-sectional view of one embodiment of a conditioner mat <b>20</b> which includes a boundary or node N across or through which air or other fluid is generally not permitted to pass. In the illustrated arrangement, the mat comprises fluid impermeable or substantially fluid impermeable upper and lower layers <b>22</b>, <b>26</b> (e.g., vinyl or other thermoplastic sheet, tight-woven fabric, etc.) that define a first interior space S<b>1</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> and noted above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the mat or topper member <b>20</b> can be sized, shaped and generally configured to removably or permanently receive a fluid distribution member <b>28</b> within such a first interior space S<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In certain configurations, the upper and lower layers <b>22</b>, <b>26</b> are formed from a unitary sheet or member of plastic, fabric and/or other material that has been wrapped around an edge <b>25</b> to form a bag-like structure. Alternatively, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, an edge <b>25</b>&#x2032; of the mat <b>20</b> can be formed by attaching the free ends of the layers <b>22</b>, <b>26</b> to each other, using one or more connection methods or devices, such as, for example, hot melting, stitching, glues or other adhesives, crimping, clips or other fasteners and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the conditioner mat <b>20</b> can include one or more intermediate fluid boundaries or nodes N that act to block or substantially block air flow. Such nodes N can help maintain air or other fluids within certain desired portions or zones of the mat <b>20</b>. For example, in the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the fluid boundary or node N helps to generally prevent air from passing from the first interior space S<b>1</b> to the second interior space S<b>2</b> located immediately adjacent to it. Alternatively, in other arrangements, the second interior space S<b>2</b> also comprises a fluid distribution member (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) that is, at least partially, thermally and/or fluidly isolated from the fluid distribution member <b>28</b>. Under certain circumstances, the mat or topper member <b>20</b> comprises one or more interior spaces that are configured to not receive fluids, and thus, to not distribute fluids through the upper layer <b>22</b> defining their upper surface. For example, such non-fluid zones can be located along bodily portions of the occupant that are less susceptible to ulcer-formation, other ailments, discomfort and/or other undesirable conditions resulting from prolonged contact with a bed surface.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Relatedly, a mat <b>20</b> can include one or more non-fluid zones <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) where air flow to an occupant is undesirable, unnecessary or otherwise unwanted. In other arrangements, non-fluid zones <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> can provide one or more other functions or benefits. For example, a non-fluid zone can help reduce manufacturing costs, as the cost of relatively expensive spacer fabric and/or other spacer materials is reduced. Further, the use of non-fluid zones <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> can provide an additional level of thermal isolation and/or fluid isolation, with respect to adjacent fluid zones <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>. As discussed in greater detail herein, a pad, cushion, gel or similar member comprising foam (e.g., closed-cell, open-cell, viscoelastic, etc.), rubber, fabric, natural or synthetic filler material and/or any other material or substance can be positioned within the second interior space S<b>2</b>. The pad or other member positioned within a non-fluid zone can be air-permeable or non-air permeable, as desired or required. In addition, in some embodiments, the pad or other member or material that is positioned within a non-fluid zone <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> is selected so that the overall firmness, flexibility and/or other characteristics of the non-fluid zones <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> match or substantially match the corresponding properties of one or more adjacent fluid zones.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">For any of the embodiments of a conditioner mat or topper member disclosed herein, the mat can have a generally flexible configuration in order to help it conform to the shape of the mattress, pad, cushion or other support member of the bed on which it may be placed. Moreover, a mat or topper member can be designed with certain immersion and envelopment characteristics in mind to assist with pressure redistribution. Such characteristics can further enhance a topper member's ability to help prevent or reduce the likelihood of pressure ulcers, other ailments, general discomfort and/or other undesirable conditions to an occupant positioned thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">To further improve the immersion and envelopment characteristics of any of the embodiments of a conditioner mat or topper member disclosed herein, or equivalents thereof, one or more additional layers, cushions or other comfort members can be selectively positioned beneath the mat (e.g., between the mat and the mattress or other support structure of a bed). Such additional layers and/or other members can further enhance the ability of the mat and adjacent surfaces to generally conform to an occupant's anatomy and body contours and shape.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the conditioner mat <b>20</b> can include one or more main passages <b>32</b>, <b>42</b> that receive ambient or thermally conditioned air from the fluid modules (e.g., the inlet fittings <b>76</b>, <b>78</b>) and distribute it to one or more fluid zones <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>. In the depicted embodiment, the mat <b>20</b> includes two main passages <b>32</b>, <b>42</b> that extend longitudinally along opposite sides of the mat <b>20</b> (e.g., at or near what would be the edge of the bed's mattress or other upper support structure). As discussed in greater detail herein, the passages <b>32</b>, <b>42</b> can be configured to direct air or other fluid to different zones <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> of the mat or topper member <b>20</b>. A mat <b>20</b> can include more or fewer passages <b>32</b>, <b>42</b>, as desired or required for a particular design or application. The size, shape, location, spacing, orientation, general configuration and/or other details regarding the passages <b>32</b>, <b>42</b> can also be modified.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The passages <b>32</b>, <b>42</b> can comprise upper and lower layers of plastic, fabric or other material, as discussed herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref>. In some embodiments, the upper and lower layers that define the passages <b>32</b>, <b>42</b> are the same layers that also define the interior spaces of the fluid zones and/or the non-fluid zones. In such designs, the conditioner mat can include one or more fluid boundaries (e.g., nodes) which help to direct air or other fluids toward specific portions of the mat interior. Such a fluid boundary can include a continuous or substantially continuous line that strategically extends along one or more portions of the mat or topper member (e.g., to define passages <b>32</b>, <b>42</b>, fluid zones <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, non-fluid zones <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> and/or the like). As discussed herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3C</figref>, such fluid boundaries can be established by joining the upper and lower layers <b>22</b>, <b>26</b> of the mat <b>20</b> to each other, using, for example, hot melting, stitching, adhesives and/or the like. In other embodiments, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, a fluid boundary is created by wrapping a layer around an edge (e.g., bag-like design). As with the fluid zones, one or more spacer materials (e.g., spacer fabric, open cell foam, other porous foam, honeycomb or other porous structure, etc.) can be positioned within the passages <b>32</b>, <b>42</b> to help ensure that the integrity of the passages (e.g., the passage height) is maintained during use. Fluid flow within the passages <b>32</b>, <b>42</b> can be controlled by creating one or more boundary lines (e.g., nodes that extend across a portion of the mat).</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">With continued reference to the conditioner mat <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a first passage <b>32</b> is configured to receive fluid (e.g., ambient or conditioned air) from one or more conduits <b>72</b> and deliver it to two zones <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, each of which is located along a different region of the mat <b>20</b>. Likewise, a second passage <b>42</b> is configured to receive fluid from one or more conduits and deliver it to two other zones <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>. Thus, the conditioning (e.g., cooling, heating, ventilation, etc.) for each set of zones <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> or <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> can be advantageously controlled separately. For example, in one embodiment, relatively cool air is directed to zones <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> (e.g., intended to target a bed occupant's head, shoulders, hips, ischial region, lower back, etc.), while relatively warm air is directed to zones <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> (e.g., intended to target a bed occupant's main torso and feet), or vice versa. In other arrangements, both sets of zones <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> and <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> are subjected to the same or similar type of ventilation or conditioning (e.g., heating, cooling, dehumidification, etc.). Further, the rate of fluid flow into each fluid zone (or set of fluid zones) can be separately adjusted in order to achieve a desired or required effect along the top surface of the mat or topper member <b>20</b>. For instance, the rate of fluid flow into (and thus, out of the corresponding openings <b>24</b>) of the first set of zones <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> can be greater or less than the fluid flow into the second set of zones <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>. Alternatively, each passage <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> can be configured to selectively delivery air or other fluid to fewer (e.g., one) or more (e.g., three, four, more than four) zones, as desired or required.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">As discussed in greater detail herein, a conditioner mat or topper member <b>20</b> can include one or more generally air-impermeable portions or non-fluid zones <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> which can assist in establishing physical and/or thermal boundaries. Further, such non-fluid zones <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> can be used to help to create a substantially even and continuous thickness and/or indentation force along the mat <b>20</b>, especially in regions that do not include a spacer material (e.g., the areas located between adjacent climate controlled zones). Thus, such non-fluid zones can help maintain a generally continuous thickness and feel to the mat or topper member. This can help improve an occupant's comfort level. In addition, the incorporation of non-fluid zones into a mat or topper member design can help reduce manufacturing costs, as the spacer materials that are typically positioned within the fluid zones materials tend to be relatively expensive.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">A plan view of one embodiment of a conditioner mat or topper member <b>20</b>A is schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As in the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the depicted mat <b>20</b>A comprises two passages <b>32</b>, <b>42</b> which are generally located along opposite edges of the mat <b>20</b>A and which extend, at least partially, in the longitudinal direction of the mat. In other embodiments, however, a mat or topper member can include fewer or more passages, which may be positioned along or near different portions of the mat (e.g., near the edges, away from edges, near the middle, etc.). Arrows included in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrate the general direction of fluid flow through the passages <b>32</b>, <b>42</b> and into (and/or out of) the respective fluid zones <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>. For example, ambient and/or conditioned (e.g., cooled, heated, dehumidified, etc.) air or other fluid entering a first passage <b>32</b> is generally directed to zones <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>, whereas air or other fluid entering a second passage <b>42</b> is generally directed to zones <b>44</b> and <b>46</b>. As noted above, such a configuration can allow air to be distributed to and within certain target regions or areas of the conditioner mat <b>20</b>A, and thus, the bed (e.g., hospital bed, medical bed, other bed or seating assembly, etc.) on which the mat is positioned. The ability to deliver ambient and/or conditioned (e.g., cooled, heated, etc.) air can help provide one or more benefits to a bed's occupant. For example, as discussed in greater detail herein, such a scheme can help reduce the likelihood of bed sores resulting from heat, friction, moisture, prolonged contact and/or other factors. In addition, such embodiments can improve the general comfort level of the occupant, especially in difficult environmental conditions (e.g., extreme heat or cold, excessively high relative humidity levels, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the mat is designed such that adjacent fluid zones (e.g., zones <b>34</b> and <b>44</b>, zones <b>44</b> and <b>36</b>, zones <b>36</b> and <b>46</b>, etc.) are not in fluid communication with the same main passage <b>32</b>, <b>42</b>. In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, adjacent zones are generally separated by one or more air-impermeable or substantially air-impermeable zones <b>50</b>. In certain embodiments, interior spaces of one or more non-fluid zones <b>50</b> comprise foam (e.g., closed-cell, open-cell, viscoelastic, etc.), one or more natural or synthetic filler materials or some other generally air-impermeable pad or material.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> schematically illustrates another embodiment of a conditioner mat <b>20</b>B that comprises two main passages <b>32</b>, <b>42</b>. A conditioner mat can include additional non-fluid zones <b>52</b>, which in the illustrated arrangement, are oriented along one edge of a zone and perpendicularly extend between the main non-fluid zones <b>50</b>. As discussed herein, the various generally air-impermeable zones (e.g., non-fluid zones) <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> included within a conditioner mat can help create thermal and/or fluid barriers between adjacent climate controlled zones <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> (e.g., fluid zones). Accordingly, the function of the conditioner mat can be improved, as the specific zones can operate closer to a target cooling, heating, ventilation or other environmentally-controlled effect.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">According to certain arrangements, a conditioner mat, such as any of those disclosed herein, can be approximately 3 feet wide by 7 feet long. However, depending on the size, shape and general design of the bed (e.g., hospital bed, other medical bed, etc.) or other seating assembly on which a mat is configured to be positioned, the dimensions (e.g., length, width, etc.) of the mat can be larger or smaller than noted above. For example, a mat or topper member can be about 3 feet wide by 6 foot-4 inches or 6 foot-8 inches long. In some embodiments, the mat or topper member is sized to fit a standard sized bed (e.g., single, twin, queen, king, etc.) or a custom-designed (e.g., non-standard sized) bed. Thus, conditioner mats or topper members can be specially designed (e.g., non-standard shapes, sizes, etc.) according to a specific bed with which they will be used. Possible shapes include, but are not limited to, other triangular, square, other polygonal, circular, oval, irregular, etc. In addition, the mat can encompass all or substantially all of the top surface area of the mattress or other support member of a bed. Alternatively, the mat or topper member can encompass only a fraction of a mattress's total top surface area, such as, for example, 95%, 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, more than 95%, less than 20%, ranges between these values, and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In some arrangements, the length and width of the fluid zones <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> of a conditioner mat <b>20</b> are approximately 12 inches and 31 inches, respectively. Further, in certain embodiments, the length of the main non-fluid zones <b>50</b> is approximately 8 inches. However, the dimensions of the fluid zones and/or the non-fluid zones can vary, as desired or required by a particular application or use. For example, in one arrangement, the length of one or more fluid zones is approximately 8 inches or 16 inches, while the length of the non-fluid zones <b>50</b> is approximately 4 inches. In other embodiments, the length, width, shape, location along the mat, orientation, spacing and/or other details of the various portions and components of a conditioner mat may be greater or less than indicated herein. For instance, in some embodiments, the length of a fluid zone or a non-fluid zone is between about 1 inch and 24 inches (e.g., approximately 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, ranges between such values, etc.) less than about 1 inch, more than about 24 inches, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a bottom view of a conditioner mat <b>20</b> positioned on a mattress <b>10</b>, cushion or other support member (e.g., foam pad). As shown, the mat <b>20</b> can include a lower skirt portion <b>21</b> or other securement device that is configured to at least partially wrap around the mattress <b>10</b> in order to secure the mat <b>20</b> to a bed (e.g., hospital or medical bed) or other seating assembly. Thus, the conditioner mat or topper member <b>20</b> can be generally designed like a fitted sheet, allowing it to be conveniently attached to and/or removed from a mattress or other upper support member of a bed assembly. In certain arrangements, the bottom skirt portion <b>21</b> extends continuously around the entire mattress <b>10</b> or other support member. Alternatively, the skirt portion <b>21</b> can be intermittently or at only partially positioned around the periphery of the mat <b>20</b>, as desired or required. The skirt portion <b>21</b> can include one or more elasticized portions or regions to help accommodate for variations in the dimensions of mattresses or other support members and/or to provide for a more snug fit.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a conditioner mat <b>20</b> can include one or more straps <b>21</b>&#x2032;, bands, belts or other securement devices to help secure the mat <b>20</b> to a mattress, pad or other support structure <b>10</b> of a bed. For example, in the depicted embodiment, the mat <b>20</b> comprises a total of two securement devices <b>21</b>&#x2032; that are shaped, sized and otherwise adapted to partially or completely surround the mattress <b>10</b>. The securement devices <b>21</b>&#x2032; can include flexible straps that comprise an elastic structure and/or one or more elastic, stretchable or other flexible materials or members. Consequently, in such configurations, a user can conveniently pass the straps <b>21</b>&#x2032; underneath a mattress <b>10</b> or other support structure of a bed in order to properly position the conditioner mat <b>20</b> on a bed assembly. Alternatively, each strap, band or other securement device <b>21</b>&#x2032; can include two or more loose ends that are configured to be selectively attached to each other using a connection device or method (e.g., belt-like connection, mating clip portions, hook-and-loop fasteners, zippers, buttons, other mechanical fastener systems, a simple tie or knot system and/or the like). Further, regardless of their exact configuration, one or more properties of the securement devices <b>21</b>&#x2032; can be modifiable to accommodate mattresses and other bed support structures of various sizes, shaped and types. For instance, in some embodiments, the length of a strap is adjustable.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Any of the embodiments of a conditioner mat or topper member <b>20</b> disclosed herein, or equivalents thereof, can be configured to include a fitted sheet design (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), a strap or other securement device (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) and/or any other device or method for temporary or permanent attachment to one or more portions of a bed (e.g., upper mattress or other support structure or member). Alternatively, a mat can be positioned adjacent to a mattress or other portion of a bed without being attached to it. In certain arrangements, a bottom surface of a conditioner mat or topper member includes one or more tactile or non-slip features or properties that are configured to increase the friction between the mat and the adjacent support structure, and thus, reduce the likelihood of movement of the mat relative to the bed, especially when an occupant is positioned thereon. For example, the mat can include a generally unsmooth surface (e.g., a surface having bumps, other projections or other tactile features, recesses or cavities, etc.), one or more relatively high friction regions (e.g., areas having rubber or relatively high-friction layers or strips) and/or the like. In other embodiments, the conditioner mat or other topper member are incorporated into a unitary structure with the bed's mattress or other support structure.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">According to certain embodiments, for example, such as disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a conditioner mat <b>120</b> or topper member includes only a single zone <b>130</b> through which ambient and/or conditioned (e.g., cooled, heated, dehumidified, etc.) air or other fluid is selectively delivered. As discussed with reference to other arrangements herein, such a fluid zone <b>130</b> can extend along one or more regions or areas of the mat <b>120</b> in order to target specific portions of an occupant's body (e.g., head, shoulders, hips, heels, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Within the fluid zone <b>130</b> of the mat illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an upper surface (e.g., upper fabric, layer, film, other member, etc.) of the mat <b>120</b> can include a plurality of openings <b>124</b>. As discussed herein with reference to other configurations (e.g., those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C, etc.), such openings <b>124</b> can be configured to allow air or other fluid that enters into an interior space of the mat's fluid zone (e.g., through a spacer fabric, fluid distribution member, etc.). In certain embodiments, the quantity, size, shape, location, density, spacing, orientation and/or other characteristics of the openings <b>124</b> are selected to direct the fluid exiting the conditioner mat <b>120</b> in targeted regions or areas of the occupant's body, such as, for example, high pressure, temperature, friction and/or moisture regions that are susceptible to decubitus ulcers, other ailments, general discomfort and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the mat or topper member <b>120</b> can include one or more non-fluid zones or areas <b>150</b>, <b>152</b> that are configured to prevent or substantially prevent air and other fluids from entering therein. According to some arrangements, such non-fluid zones <b>150</b>, <b>152</b> comprise a foam (e.g., closed-cell, open-cell, viscoelastic, etc.) pad, other polymeric or other type of pad, filler materials, other layers or members and/or the like. As discussed herein with reference to other embodiments, such as, for example, those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref>, the upper and lower layers (e.g., vinyl, other plastic, fabric, etc.) of a mat or topper member can be advantageously attached adjacent to such non-fluid zones or portions <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, thereby forming fluid boundaries that block or substantially block fluid flow. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the conditioner mat <b>120</b> includes non-fluid zones or portions <b>150</b>, <b>152</b> along the bottom and one of the sides of the bed <b>100</b>. However, such zones <b>150</b>, <b>152</b> or portions that are generally configured to not receive fluids can be positioned at, along or near additional and/or different areas of the mat <b>120</b>. Further, the respective surface areas of the mat <b>120</b> covered by fluid zones <b>130</b> and non-fluid zones <b>150</b>, <b>152</b> can be varied to accomplish a desired ventilation and/or conditioning (e.g., cooling, heating, dehumidification, etc.) effect above the mat <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates another embodiment of a conditioner mat or topper member <b>220</b> secured to a medical bed <b>200</b> or other bed assembly. As shown, the mat <b>220</b> includes two fluid zones <b>234</b>, <b>236</b> that are in fluid communication with a main passage <b>232</b> which extends along one of the mat's sides. In some arrangements, ambient and/or conditioned air is delivered from one or more fluid modules (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) into the main passage <b>232</b> via one or more ducts <b>272</b> or fluid conduits. The conditioner mat <b>220</b> can include one or more additional fluid zones <b>244</b> that are generally not in fluid communication with the first set of fluid zones <b>234</b>, <b>236</b>. Accordingly, as discussed herein with reference to the arrangements of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, separate fluid zones (or sets of fluid zones) that are fluidly, hydraulically and/or thermally isolated from each other can be used to vary the ventilation and/or thermal conditioning effects along the top of a mat. Thus, fluid zones <b>234</b>, <b>236</b> of the conditioner mat or topper member <b>220</b> can be cooled, while fluid zone <b>244</b> is heated, or vice versa. Alternatively, the type of fluid (e.g., ambient air, heated or cooled air, etc.) being delivered to all the fluid zones <b>234</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>244</b> of a mat <b>220</b> can be similar or substantially similar. In other embodiments, although the distinct fluid zones <b>234</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>244</b> are configured to receive the same or similar types of fluids, the flowrate of fluid delivery can be varied between fluid zones, as desired or required.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Another embodiment of a conditioner mat or topper member <b>320</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>.

The cutout or recess <b>532</b> can be positioned along any portion of the mat and need not be confined to a particular corner or region of a main portion <b>530</b>. The cutout <b>532</b> can be situated along a different corner, along a side (e.g., generally between two corners), within an interior region of the main portion <b>530</b> and/or the like, as desired. By way of example, the conditioner mat <b>620</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref> comprises a cutout <b>632</b> along its front or back end and generally between its two sides. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>, the fluid module <b>680</b> can be at least partially situated within the cutout <b>632</b>. In addition, at least some of the components and portions of a fluid module <b>680</b> that selectively supply fluid to the mat <b>620</b> can hang along an end or side of the mat <b>620</b>. For example, in the depicted arrangement, the fluid transfer device <b>682</b> and a portion of the conduit <b>684</b> are oriented generally perpendicularly relative to the main portion <b>630</b>.</p>

In other configurations, the fluid modules can be positioned in a location generally separate and remote from the mat <b>820</b>. For example, one or more of the fluid modules are located within a fluid box or other container that can be conveniently mounted on the bed assembly (e.g., to, along or near a headboard, footboard, guardrail, etc.), a wall, the floor and/or the like. In such embodiments, the fluid modules can be placed in fluid communication with the respective fluid zones of the mat's main portion <b>830</b> using one or more conduits. Additional details regarding fluid boxes are provided herein with reference to the arrangements illustrated in, inter alia, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A</figref>, <b>17</b>B and <b>19</b>A-<b>27</b>.</p>

As shown, the mat <b>820</b>C can comprise more than one (e.g., two, three, four, more than four, etc.) separate fluid zones <b>832</b>C, <b>834</b>C. As discussed in greater detail herein, each fluid zone <b>832</b>C, <b>834</b>C can be configured to receive fluid having the same or a different properties (e.g., type, temperature, humidity, flowrate, etc.) than another zone. This can help provide customized ventilation, heating, cooling and/or other environmentally-conditioned schemes to a seated occupant. In the arrangement depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C</figref>, air or other fluid is selectively delivered to the fluid zones <b>832</b>C, <b>834</b>C by one or more fluid modules (not shown) positioned within a fluid box <b>880</b>. Alternatively, one or more fluid modules providing conditioned and/or unconditioned fluid to the conditioner mat <b>820</b>C need not be positioned within a fluid box <b>880</b> or other enclosure. In addition, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16D</figref>, a conditioner mat <b>820</b>D can include two or more fluid boxes <b>880</b>A, <b>880</b>B, as desired or required. For example, in the depicted embodiment, air from one or more fluid modules housed within a first fluid box <b>880</b>A is selectively delivered to a first fluid zone <b>832</b>D of the mat <b>820</b>D. Likewise, air from one or more fluid modules housed within a second fluid box <b>880</b>B can be selectively delivered to a second fluid zone <b>834</b>D. Thus, the type, flowrate, temperature and/or other properties or characteristics of the fluid being delivered to each zone <b>832</b>D, <b>834</b>D can be varied in order to achieve a desired ventilation, cooling and/or heating effect along the top surface of the mat or topper member <b>820</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">As illustrated in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16B-16D</figref>, the conditioner mat or topper member can be configured to only partially cover the underlying mattress or other support structure of a bed assembly.

The mat <b>920</b> can be removably or temporarily secured to the mattress or other support structure <b>710</b> using one or more securement devices <b>921</b> (e.g., a bottom skirt member such as included in a fitted sheet design), straps (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) and/or the like. Further, as with other arrangements disclosed herein, the depicted mat <b>920</b> can include one or more fluid zones into which ambient and/or environmentally-conditioned (e.g., cooled, heated, dehumidified, etc.) air or other fluids can be selectively delivered. The fluid zones can comprise spacer materials <b>928</b> (e.g., spacer fabric, other porous members or material, etc.) that are generally positioned within a interior space defined by upper and lower layers <b>922</b>, <b>926</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>, one or more of the bed's guardrails <b>904</b>, frame members or other support structures can be advantageously configured to receive a fluid conduit <b>972</b>, <b>974</b>. Such guardrails <b>904</b> or other members can include one or more internal channels or passages through which air or other fluid may pass. Thus, air or other fluid discharged from one or more fluid modules (e.g., located within the fluid box <b>960</b> in the depicted embodiment) can be routed through one or more hoses or other conduits <b>972</b>, <b>974</b> to such guardrails <b>904</b>. Thus, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>, the hoses or other conduits <b>972</b>, <b>974</b> can be placed in fluid communication with corresponding conduits <b>972</b>&#x2032;, <b>974</b>&#x2032; formed within one or more portions of a guardrail or similar structure. Accordingly, ambient and/or environmentally-conditioned air or other fluids exiting the fluid box <b>960</b> can be selectively routed to the guardrail conduits <b>972</b>&#x2032;, <b>974</b>&#x2032;. Air or other fluid entering the fluid passages of the guardrails <b>904</b> can be distributed to the interior spaces of the various fluid zones of the mat <b>920</b> using one or more intermediate fluid connectors <b>976</b> or other fluid branches.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In the arrangement illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>, the fluid box <b>960</b> is mounted to the footboard <b>906</b> of the bed assembly <b>900</b>. Alternatively, the fluid box <b>960</b>, and thus the one or more fluid modules positioned therein, can be mounted to the headboard <b>902</b>, on one of the guardrails <b>904</b> and/or any other location (e.g., either on the bed or away from the bed), as desired or required. In addition, as discussed herein with reference to other embodiments, the conditioner mat <b>920</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref> can be configured so that it is removable from the mattress <b>10</b>, the fluid connectors <b>976</b> that place the mat <b>920</b> in fluid communication with the guardrail conduits <b>972</b>&#x2032;, <b>974</b>&#x2032; and/or any other portion of the bed assembly, for cleaning, other maintenance and/or any other purpose.</p>

The conditioner mat <b>920</b>&#x2032; can include one or more fluid zones <b>932</b>&#x2032;, <b>934</b>&#x2032;, <b>936</b>&#x2032;, <b>938</b>&#x2032; and/or non-fluid zones, allowing for customized ventilation and/or thermal or environmental conditioning (e.g., cooling, heating, etc.) schemes along the upper surface of the bed <b>900</b>&#x2032;. In the depicted arrangement, air or other fluid is provided to the various fluid zones <b>932</b>&#x2032;, <b>934</b>&#x2032;, <b>936</b>&#x2032;, <b>938</b>&#x2032; of the topper member <b>920</b>&#x2032; using one or more fluid modules (e.g., blowers or other fluid transfer devices, thermoelectric devices, convective heaters and/or other thermal conditioning devices, dehumidifying devices, etc.) that may be located within, along or near a fluid box <b>960</b>&#x2032;, another type of enclosure or device, an adjacent surface (e.g., wall, floor, etc.) and/or the like. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17C and 17D</figref>, the bed <b>900</b>&#x2032; comprises a single fluid box <b>960</b>&#x2032; that is removably secured to the footboard <b>906</b>&#x2032;. However, the quantity, type, size, shape, location and/or other details of the fluid box <b>960</b>&#x2032; and/or the various components located therein can vary, as desired or required.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17C</figref>, conditioned and/or unconditioned fluid exiting the fluid box <b>960</b>&#x2032; can be delivered to the various fluid zones of the conditioner mat <b>920</b>&#x2032; using one or more delivery conduits <b>972</b>&#x2032;. As discussed in greater detail with reference to other embodiments discussed herein, such delivery conduits <b>972</b>&#x2032; can be incorporated into the design of the mat <b>920</b>&#x2032; itself. Alternatively, one or more delivery conduits <b>972</b>&#x2032; can be physically separated from the conditioner mat <b>920</b>&#x2032;. For example, in certain arrangements, the delivery conduits <b>972</b>&#x2032; are incorporated into and/or positioned adjacent to a side guardrail <b>904</b>&#x2032;, footboard <b>906</b>&#x2032;, headboard <b>902</b>&#x2032; and/or any other portion of the bed <b>900</b>&#x2032; or other seating assembly. Thus, air or other fluid (e.g., having a general direction of flow schematically represented by arrows A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17D</figref>) can be selectively transferred from one or more delivery conduits into one or more fluid zones <b>932</b>&#x2032;, <b>934</b>&#x2032;, <b>936</b>&#x2032;, <b>938</b>&#x2032;. Air or other fluid can enter an interior space of the conditioner mat <b>920</b>&#x2032; along one or more other portions of the bed assembly <b>900</b>&#x2032; (e.g., the opposite side, top, bottom, etc.), as desired or required.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A-18E</figref> illustrate various views of another embodiment of a conditioned mat or topper member <b>1020</b>. The mat <b>1020</b> can include a main portion <b>1030</b> that comprises one or more fluid zones and/or non-fluid zones (not shown). The main portion <b>1030</b> can include upper and lower layers or members <b>1022</b>, <b>1026</b> that generally define one or more interior spaces S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b>. A spacer material or other fluid distribution member <b>1028</b> can be positioned within one or more of the interior spaces defined by the upper and lower layers of the mat's main portion <b>1030</b>. Such spacer materials or other members can help maintain the shape and integrity of the interior spaces, especially when the mat or topper member <b>1020</b> is subjected to compressive loads during use. In addition, as discussed with reference to other configurations herein, the mat <b>1020</b> can include one or more fluid boundaries or nodes N that generally create separate fluid zones and/or non-fluid zones within the mat.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A-18E</figref>, the conditioner mat <b>1020</b> can include a fluid header <b>1072</b> through which ambient and/or environmentally-conditioned (e.g., cooled, heated, dehumidified, etc.) air or other fluid is selectively conveyed. In certain arrangements, such a header <b>1072</b> can at least partially form or can be incorporated, at least in part, into a guardrail or other portion of a bed assembly (e.g., hospital bed, other medical bed, other type of bed, other seating assembly, etc.). Thus, as discussed herein with reference to the assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>, the depicted embodiment can provide a relatively simple and convenient way of delivering fluids to a conditioner mat <b>1020</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">According to certain arrangements, the fluid header <b>1072</b> comprises a multi-piece design that allows the internal passage P of the header <b>1072</b> to be conveniently accessed by a user. For example, by removing one or more end pieces <b>1073</b> and/or other fasteners (not shown), the fluid header <b>1072</b> can be opened along a seam <b>1075</b> to expose its internal passage P. Thus, one or more intermediate fluid connectors <b>1076</b> can be positioned within such a seam, prior re-attaching the adjacent components of the header <b>1072</b> to each other. Consequently, the openings within the intermediate fluid connectors <b>1076</b> can advantageously place the internal passage P of the header <b>1072</b> in fluid communication with one or more fluid zones of the mat's main portion <b>1030</b>. Thus, as air is delivered from a fluid module into the fluid header <b>1072</b>, such air can be conveyed to the various fluid zones of the mat <b>1020</b> via the fluid connectors <b>1076</b>. Such a design allows for the conditioner mat or topper member <b>1020</b> to be conveniently modified as desired or required by a particular application or use. For example, intermediate fluid connectors <b>1076</b> can be quickly and reliably added to or removed from the system. Further, the main portion <b>1030</b> of the mat <b>1020</b> can be easily removed for cleaning, maintenance, replacement, inspection and/or any other purpose. The fluid header can comprise one or more materials, such as for example, foam, plastic, wood, paper-based materials and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">As discussed with reference to other configurations herein, the upper and lower layers <b>1022</b>, <b>1026</b> of the conditioner mat <b>1020</b> can include plastics (e.g., vinyl), tight-woven fabrics, specially-engineered materials and/or the like. However, in one simplified arrangement, the layers <b>1022</b>, <b>1026</b> of the mat <b>1020</b> comprise cotton, linen, satin, silk, rayon, bamboo fiber, polyester, other textiles, blends or combinations thereof and/or other materials typically used in bed sheets and similar bedding fabrics. In some embodiments, such fabrics have a generally tight weave to reduce the passage of fluids thereacross. In one embodiment, one or more coatings, layers and/or other additives can be added to such fabrics and other materials to improve their overall fluid impermeability. Thus, such readily accessible materials can be used to manufacture a relatively simple and inexpensive version of a conditioner mat or topper member <b>1020</b>. For example, the upper and lower layers can be easily secured to each other (e.g., using stitching, glue lines or other adhesives, mechanical fasteners, etc.) to form the desired interior spaces S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b> of the fluid zones. Spacer fabric <b>1028</b> or other spacer or distribution materials can be inserted within one or more of the fluid zones, as desired or required. In some embodiments, foam pads, other filler materials and/or the like can be inserted into spaces or chambers of the mat <b>1020</b> to create corresponding non-fluid zones.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">As with any of the embodiments discussed herein, the spacer fabric <b>1028</b> or other spacer materials can be easily removed from the interior spaces prior to washing or otherwise cleaning the mat <b>1020</b>. However, the spacer fabric <b>1028</b> can be left within the corresponding space or pocket of the mat during such cleaning, maintenance, repair, inspection and/or other procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">For any of the embodiments of a conditioner mat or topper member disclosed herein, one or more additional layers or members can be positioned on top of the mat. For example, as shown in the exploded perspective view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a fluid distribution and conditioning member <b>90</b> may be situated along the upper surface of the mat <b>20</b>. Such a conditioning member <b>90</b> can help provide a more uniform distribution of fluid flow toward an occupant. In addition, the conditioning member <b>90</b> can improve the comfort level to the occupant (e.g., by providing a softer, more consistent feel).</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In addition, for any of the topper member arrangements disclosed herein, one or more layers can be positioned immediately beneath the fluid zones to enhance the operation of the topper member. For instance, in one embodiment, a lower portion of the mat (or alternatively, an upper portion of the mattress or other support structure on which the mat is positioned) can comprise one or more layers of foam (e.g., closed-cell foam), other thermoplastics and/or other materials that have advantageous thermal insulation and air-flow resistance properties. Thus, such underlying layers can help reduce or eliminate the loss of thermally-conditioned fluids being delivered into the fluid zones through the bottom of the mat or topper member. Such a configuration can also help to reduce the likelihood of inadvertent mixing of different fluid streams being delivered in adjacent or nearby fluid zones.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">According to some embodiments, any of the conditioner mats or topper members disclosed herein, or equivalents thereof, are configured to selectively receive non-ambient air within one or more of their fluid zones, either in lieu of or in addition to environmentally or thermally-conditioned (e.g., heated, cooled, dehumidified, etc.) air or other fluids. For example, a header or other conduit in fluid communication with one or more of the mat's fluid zones can be connected to a vent or register that is configured to deliver fluids from a facility's main HVAC system. Alternatively, a facility can have a dedicated fluid system for delivering air and other fluids to the various topper members and/or other climate controlled seating assemblies. In other arrangements, one or more medicaments or other substances can be added to the ambient and/or conditioned (e.g., heated, cooled, dehumidified, etc.) air or other fluids being delivered (e.g., by a fluid module, HVAC system, etc.) into a topper member. For example, medicines, pharmaceuticals, other medicaments and/or the like (e.g., bed sore medications, asthma or other respiratory-related medications, anti-bacterial medications or agents, anti-fungal medications or agents, anesthetics, other therapeutic agents, insect repellents, fragrances and/or the like). In some embodiments, a climate conditioned bed additionally includes at least one humidity or moisture sensor and/or any other type of sensor. that are intended to help prevent or reduce the likelihood of pressure ulcers can be selectively delivered to a patient through a conditioner mat or topper member. In other embodiments, such medicaments or other substances can be adapted to treat, mitigate or otherwise deal with any related symptoms.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">In addition, in some embodiments, it may be beneficial to cycle the operation of one or more fluid modules to reduce noise and/or power consumption or to provide other benefits. For example, fluid modules can be cycled (e.g., turned on or off) to remain below such a threshold noise level or power consumption level. In some embodiments, the threshold or maximum noise level is determined by safety and health standards, other regulatory requirements, industry standards and/or the like. In other arrangements, an occupant is permitted to set the threshold or maximum noise level, at least to the extent provided by standards and other regulations, according to his or her own preferences. Such a setting can be provided by the user to the climate control system (e.g., control module) using a user input device. Additional details for such power conservation and/or noise abatement embodiments are provided in U.S. patent Ser. No. 12/208,254, filed Sep. 10, 2008, titled OPERATIONAL CONTROL SCHEMES FOR VENTILATED SEAT OR BED ASSEMBLIES and published on Mar. 12, 2009 as U.S. Publication No. 2009/0064411, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">One embodiment of a control scheme for operation of one or more fluid modules configured to provide environmentally-conditioned (e.g., heated, cooled, dehumidified, etc.) and/or ambient air to a topper member or mat is schematically and generally represented by the wiring diagram <b>1500</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>. As shown, in order to reduce power consumption of the climate controlled topper member, to improve its performance, enhance the occupant's comfort level and/or for any other purpose, the system's control unit <b>1510</b> (e.g., electronic control unit, control module, etc.) can be adapted to regulate the operation of a fluid module (e.g., a blower or other fluid transfer device, a thermoelectric device, a convective heater or other thermal conditioning device, etc.) and/or any other electric component of device of the system based on, at least in part, input from a moisture sensor <b>1530</b> and/or any other type of sensor (e.g., temperature sensor, pressure sensor, occupant-detection sensor, humidity sensor, condensation sensor, etc.). Such control schemes can help avoid excessive use of battery power, over cooling or over heating of the topper member and/or any other undesirable conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">With continued reference to the schematic of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, a moisture sensor <b>1530</b> located on or near the topper member or the bed assembly on which the topper member is positioned can advantageously determine if excessive humidity or moisture is present near the occupant. Accordingly, the sensor <b>1530</b> can provide a corresponding feedback signal to the control unit <b>1510</b> in order to determine if, when and how the fluid module should be activated or deactivated. For example, is some embodiments, a fluid module can be operated only when a threshold level of moisture, humidity and/or temperature has been detected by one or more sensors <b>1530</b>. Such a scheme can help extend the useful charge period of a battery or other power source <b>1520</b> that supplies electrical power to one or more fluid modules of the system. Such control schemes can also help ensure that potentially dangerous and/or uncomfortable over-temperature or under-temperature conditions do not result when operating a climate controlled conditioner mat or topper member. In addition, such control methods, which in some arrangements incorporate one or more other devices or components (e.g., an electrical load detection device, an occupant detection switch or sensor <b>1550</b>, other switches or sensors, etc.), can be incorporated into any of the topper embodiments disclosed herein, or equivalents thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In some embodiments, a climate-controlled mat or topper member can include a timer configured to regulate the fluid module(s) based on a predetermined time schedule. For example, such a timer feature can be configured to regulate when a blower or other fluid transfer device, a thermoelectric device, a convective heater or other thermal conditioning device and/or any other electrical device or component is turned on or off, modulated and/or the like. Such timer-controlled schemes can help reduce power consumption, enhance occupant safety, improve occupant comfort and/or provide any other advantage or benefit.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Relatedly, one or more of the components (e.g., fluid transfer device, thermoelectric device, etc.) that can be included in fluid modules, which supply air and other fluids to corresponding mats or topper members, can also be configured to cycle (e.g., turn on or off, modulate, etc.) according to a particular algorithm or protocol to achieve a desired level of power conservation. Regardless of whether the fluid module cycling is performed for noise reduction, power conservation and/or any other purpose, the individual components of a fluid module, such as, for example, a blower, fan or other fluid transfer device, a thermoelectric device, a convective heater and/or the like, can be controlled independently of each other.</p>

<p id="p-0147" num="0146"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A and 19B</figref> illustrate one embodiment of a fluid box <b>60</b> that is sized, shaped and otherwise designed to house one or more fluid modules <b>62</b>A, <b>62</b>B, <b>64</b>A, <b>64</b>B. The depicted fluid box <b>60</b> includes a total of four fluid modules within its interior I. As shown, the fluid modules are grouped into two pairs (e.g., a first module pair <b>62</b>A, <b>62</b>B and a second module pair <b>64</b>A, <b>64</b>B). In some embodiments, such as the one illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>, the first pair (or other grouping) of fluid modules <b>62</b>A, <b>62</b>B is configured to selectively deliver ambient and/or environmentally-conditioned air to one side of a conditioner mat (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>), while the second pair (or other grouping) of fluid modules <b>64</b>A, <b>64</b>B is configured to selectively deliver ambient and/or environmentally-conditioned air to the opposite side of a conditioner mat. However, the quantity, spacing, orientation, grouping and/or other details associated with the inclusion of fluid modules within a fluid box can be different than illustrated and discussed herein, as desired or required. For example, each fluid module can be configured to deliver ambient and/or conditioned fluid into only a single fluid zone. In other arrangements, fluid exiting two or more modules can be combined and delivered simultaneously into one or more fluid zones of a conditioner mat.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>, the interior of a fluid box <b>60</b> can include one or more layers of insulating materials <b>68</b> that are configured to reduce temperature fluctuations within certain portions of the fluid box interior I and/or reduce the noise levels emanating from the fluid box <b>60</b> when the fluid modules are operating. In some embodiments, the fluid box can include one or more noise reduction layers, materials, devices or features, either in lieu of or in addition to thermal insulating materials. In some arrangements, the same layers, devices or members are used to provide a desired level of thermal insulation and a desired amount of noise reduction. As shown, a power supply <b>61</b>, which provides electrical power to the fluid modules <b>62</b>A, <b>62</b>B, <b>64</b>A, <b>64</b>B and/or any other electrical component associated with the mat's climate control system, can be positioned within an interior I of the fluid box <b>60</b>. Alternatively, the power supply <b>61</b> can be moved outside the box <b>60</b> to avoid high heat conditions and other potentially damaging temperature fluctuations resulting from the operation of the fluid modules (e.g., fluid transfer devices, thermoelectric devices, etc.). For example, in one embodiment, the system includes a power supply <b>61</b> that is physically separated from the box or other enclosure. In such arrangements, one or more electrical cables, wires and/or other connections are provided to properly connect a power supply to the fluid modules and/or any other electrical components.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>, each thermoelectric housing <b>66</b>, <b>67</b> and/or any other portion or component of the fluid module <b>62</b>A, <b>62</b>B, <b>64</b>A, <b>64</b>B can comprise its own outlet fitting <b>63</b>A, <b>63</b>B, <b>65</b>A, <b>65</b>B, which, in some embodiments, serves as an interface between the fluid transfer device and the conduit <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> that places the corresponding fluid module in fluid communication with at least a portion of a conditioner mat or topper member. Various non-limiting embodiments of an outlet fitting <b>63</b>A-<b>63</b>E are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. As shown, the outlet fittings <b>63</b>A-<b>63</b>E can include any shape, size, general configuration and/or other features or characteristics, as desired or required for a particular application or use. For example, two of the fittings <b>63</b>B, <b>63</b>D comprise bellows, while one of the fittings <b>63</b>D is configured to accommodate a thermoelectric device.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">In some embodiments, such as those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19B and 20</figref>, the outlet fittings <b>63</b>A, <b>63</b>B, <b>65</b>A, <b>65</b>B comprise a thermoelectric device <b>66</b>, <b>67</b> (or a convective heater or any other type of thermal conditioning device) positioned therein. Thus, air and other fluids passing from the respective fluid transfer devices to the outlet fittings can be advantageously heated or cooled, as desired or required. The waste air stream from the thermoelectric devices <b>66</b>, <b>67</b> can be routed to the space generally outside the insulation layer <b>68</b> where it can be more effectively and conveniently eliminated from the outlet vents V<b>2</b> located along the top of the fluid box <b>60</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>, ambient air can be drawn into an interior I of the fluid box <b>60</b> through one or more inlet vents V<b>1</b> located along the bottom of the box. Further, in order to increase the use of generally less-expensive, commercially-available materials, the downstream end of the outlet fittings <b>63</b>A-<b>63</b>E (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>) can include standard 1-inch or 2-inch diameter rubber tubing or other commercially available conduits. This can help reduce manufacturing and maintenance costs. In other embodiments, however, one or more non-standard conduits can be used. In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, a fluid box <b>60</b> can include a hinged door <b>69</b> or similar device to facilitate access to its interior I.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Another embodiment of a fluid box <b>60</b>&#x2032; is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22</figref>, <b>23</b>A and <b>23</b>B. The depicted fluid box <b>60</b>&#x2032; is generally smaller than the box <b>60</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A and 19B</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref>, the fluid box <b>60</b>&#x2032; includes only a single fluid module <b>62</b>&#x2032;. Thus, such a smaller fluid box <b>60</b>&#x2032; can be utilized when the fluid demand for a conditioner mat or topper member is relatively small. The fluid box <b>60</b>&#x2032; can include one or more buttons <b>94</b> or other controllers that help regulate the operation of the fluid module(s) positioned therein. For example, in one embodiment, the box <b>60</b>&#x2032; includes a red button or other controller, which the user presses or otherwise manipulates to direct relatively warm air to the topper member, and a blue button or other controller, which the user presses or otherwise manipulates to direct relatively cool air to the topper member. A fluid box (or a separate controller or control panel) can include additional buttons, knobs, dials, keypads, touchscreens and/or other controllers, as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, a channel <b>96</b> or other hooking device located along the rear surface of the fluid box <b>60</b>&#x2032; can help mount the box <b>60</b>&#x2032; to a headboard, footboard, a side rail, a side panel, a frame or other support structure and/or any other portion of a bed (e.g., hospital or medical bed, conventional bed, other type of bed, other seating assembly, etc.) and/or any other surface or location (e.g., wall, floor, an adjacent medical device, other hospital equipment, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">In certain embodiments where fluid modules <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> located within a single fluid box <b>60</b> are configured to both heat and cool a fluid being delivered to a conditioner mat, the waste streams of the respective thermoelectric devices <b>65</b>, <b>66</b> can be used to help improve the overall thermal-conditioning efficiency of the system. For example, assuming that the first fluid module <b>62</b> schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is operating in a cooling mode, the waste fluid W<b>1</b> exiting the first thermoelectric device <b>65</b> will be warm relative to ambient air. Thus, at least a portion of this relatively &#x201c;warm&#x201d; fluid stream can be directed into the inlet of the second fluid module <b>64</b>, which is operating in a heating mode. Thus, it will be generally easier and more cost effective to heat the air exiting the second fluid module <b>64</b> under such a scheme (e.g., because the starting temperature of the fluid to be heated is generally higher than ambient air). Likewise, the efficiency of the first fluid module <b>62</b> can be improved if a portion of the relatively cool waste fluid W<b>2</b> exiting the second thermoelectric device <b>66</b> is directed to the inlet of the first fluid module <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">As noted above and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, a conduit <b>72</b> that delivers thermally-conditioned fluid from the fluid modules (e.g., located within a fluid box) to a conditioner mat or topper member <b>20</b> can be partially or completed covered with one or more layers of thermal insulation <b>73</b>. Such a configuration, which may be incorporated into any of the embodiments disclosed herein or equivalents thereof, can help reduce or prevent undesirable heat transfer (e.g., either to or from the fluid being delivered to the mat). As a result, the temperature of the fluids being delivered to the fluid zones of a mat or topper member can be more accurately maintained within the desired range.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">In certain arrangements, two or more outlet fittings <b>63</b> can be used to deliver ambient and/or conditioned fluid from one or more fluid modules to an inlet of a conditioner mat <b>20</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, such a dual conduit design can help reduce fluid headlosses through the system, thereby lowering the backpressure experienced by the blowers and other components of the fluid modules. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, a fitting <b>76</b> can be used at the inlets of a conditioner mat or topper member <b>20</b>. Such a fitting <b>76</b> can help prevent or reduce the likelihood of leaks as air or other fluid is transferred from the upstream conduit <b>72</b> to the mat <b>20</b>. In addition, such a fitting <b>76</b> can make it easier for a user to connect (or disconnect) a mat from the upstream fluid delivery system (e.g., conduit <b>72</b>). Such features can be incorporated into any of the mat or topper member embodiments disclosed herein, or equivalents thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A-28C</figref> illustrate different embodiments of ensuring that the desired volume or flowrate of fluid is delivered to each fluid zone of a conditioner mat or topper member. For example, in the arrangement depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28A</figref>, the upstream fluid zone <b>34</b>A (e.g., the fluid zone closest to the inlet fitting <b>76</b>A) comprises a gate <b>51</b>A at or near the interface of the fluid zone <b>34</b>A and the main passage <b>32</b>A. According to some embodiments, the gate <b>51</b>A comprises one or more foam pieces or any other flow blocking or diversion members that can regulate the rate of fluid flowrate from the passage <b>32</b>A to the upstream fluid zone <b>34</b>A. The gate can include one or more other materials other than foam, such as, for example, other polymeric or elastomeric materials, paper or wood-based materials, metals, alloys, composites, textiles, fabrics, other natural or synthetic materials and/or the like. In other embodiments, the gates are created by strategically attaching the upper and lower portions (e.g., using stitching, adhesives, hot melting, crimping, other fasteners, any other connection method or device) to each other, either in lieu of or in addition to including flow blocking or diverting members (e.g., foam or other materials, etc.). Thus, regardless of how the gates are configured, as flow into the upstream fluid zone <b>34</b>A becomes restricted, more fluid will be delivered to downstream fluid zones (zone <b>36</b>, see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28B</figref>, the main passage <b>32</b>B includes one or more fluid boundaries <b>33</b>B that help ensure that a particular portion of the fluid entering the conditioner mat <b>20</b>B enters the upstream fluid zone <b>34</b>B. As discussed in greater detail herein, such fluid boundaries or nodes can be created using various devices or methods, such as, for example, hot melting, gluing or otherwise joining the upper and lower sheets of the mat together. Alternatively, in order to ensure more accurate flow balancing between the various fluid zones, separate passages (e.g., in the form of conduits) can be used to feed individual fluid zones.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Another embodiment of improving or enhancing flow balancing into the various fluid zones is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28C</figref>. As shown, the inlet fitting <b>76</b>C can be positioned further into the passage <b>32</b>C or conduit of the conditioner mat <b>20</b>C or topper member. Such a feature can help direct additional fluid past the upstream fluid zone <b>34</b>C and into downstream fluid zones, as fluid is less likely, hydraulically, to enter into the most upstream zone <b>34</b>C. One or more additional ways of balancing fluid flow into the various fluid zones can also be used, either in lieu of or in addition to those specifically disclosed herein. For example, the quantity, size, shape, density, spacing and other details of the outlet openings located within each fluid zone can affect how well fluid flows are balanced. In some embodiments, the size (e.g., width, length, height, cross-sectional area, etc.), location and other details of the gates or other inlets into each of the gates can be adjustable, allowing a user to modify flow distribution according to a desired or required scheme. For example, in one embodiment, the length of a blocking member that helps define a gate <b>51</b>A, <b>51</b>B can be shortened or lengthened (e.g., using a telescoping design, by removing or adding portions, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29A and 29B</figref> illustrate another embodiment of a conditioner mat or topper member <b>1120</b> that is configured to be positioned, at least partially, along an upper portion of a medical bed, other type of bed or other seating assembly. As with other embodiments disclosed herein, the depicted conditioner mat <b>1120</b> comprises one or more fluid zones <b>1132</b>, <b>1142</b> that are configured to selectively receive thermally or environmentally conditioned and/or unconditioned fluid (e.g., ambient, heated and/or cooled air from one or more fluid modules).</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">As illustrated in the partial perspective view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29B</figref>, the conditioner mat <b>1120</b> can include one or more spacer material portions <b>1128</b>A-<b>1128</b>E positioned between a generally fluid impermeable bottom layer <b>1124</b> (e.g., vinyl sheet or layer, tight-woven fabric, lining, etc.) and an upper scrim layer <b>1180</b>. For clarity, at least some of the layers and other components of the mat <b>1120</b> are shown separated from each other in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29B</figref>. The generally fluid impermeable bottom layer <b>1124</b> and an upper scrim layer <b>1180</b> can be selectively and strategically attached to each other to form continuous or intermittent fluid barriers <b>1184</b> or borders that prevent or reduce the likelihood of fluid flow thereacross. Consequently, fluid zones, non-fluid zones, chambers, passages and other features can be advantageously provided within a conditioner mat <b>1120</b>. According to certain arrangements, the barriers <b>1184</b> can be formed using stitching, fusion, adhesives, heat staking, other bonding agents or techniques and/or any other attachment method or device. Such fluid barriers <b>1184</b> can help direct fluid into targeted fluid zones, through specific passages or openings and/or as otherwise desired or required. For example, in the arrangement illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29A and 29B</figref>, fluid barriers <b>1184</b> are used to create a plurality of passages <b>1128</b>B-<b>1128</b>E located along the sides of the mat <b>1120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29A and 29B</figref>, as with any other embodiments disclosed herein, the conditioner mat <b>1120</b> can additionally include a comfort layer <b>1190</b> and/or any other layer generally above (and/or below) the scrim layer <b>1180</b>. Such an air permeable comfort layer <b>1190</b> (e.g., quilt layer, soft air permeable or perforated foam, etc.) can further enhance the comfort level of an occupant positioned along the top of the conditioner mat <b>1120</b>. In some arrangements, the scrim layer <b>1180</b>, and/or any other layers or components positioned between the upper comfort layer <b>1190</b> and the spacer material <b>1128</b>A-<b>1128</b>E (e.g., spacer fabric, air permeable structure, woven polyester or other material, etc.) or other fluid distribution member, are configured to help distribute the air or other fluid being delivered to the mat or topper member <b>1120</b>. The use of heat staking, stitching, fusion, other types of bonding and/or any other attachment method or device can be incorporated into any embodiments of a conditioner mat or topper member disclosed herein or equivalents thereof, including those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-33</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">A partial perspective view of one embodiment of a spacer material <b>1200</b> configured for use in a conditioner mat or topper member is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>. As shown, the spacer material <b>1200</b> can comprise one or more fluid permeable materials and/or structures. For example, the spacer material can include a spacer fabric, a porous foam, a honeycomb or other porous structure, other materials or members that are generally air permeable or that have an open structure through which fluids may pass and/or the like. As with the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29A and 29B</figref>, the spacer material or member <b>1200</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> can include one or more fluid barriers <b>1284</b> that are continuously or intermittently positioned so as to create separate fluid passageways <b>1212</b>, <b>1214</b>, <b>1222</b>, <b>1224</b>, fluid zones <b>1204</b>, non-fluid zones and/or other fluid boundaries, as desired or required. The barriers <b>1284</b> can be formed using stitching, heat staking, adhesives, crimping, clips, other fasteners, bonding or other fusion techniques and/or the like. In some embodiments, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, a mat comprises a spacer <b>1200</b> that includes generally tubular spacer members <b>1212</b>, <b>1214</b>, <b>1222</b>, <b>1224</b> and/or generally flat spacer members <b>1204</b>. The tubular spacer members, which in some arrangements serve as main conduits, can be positioned along the sides of the mat (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>) and/or any other mat portion (e.g., middle, away from the sides, etc.), as desired or required.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">One embodiment of a fluid nozzle or other inlet <b>1300</b> configured to be used on a conditioner mat is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>. As shown, the nozzle <b>1300</b> can extend along an edge (e.g., side) of a conditioner mat or topper member <b>20</b> so as to facilitate connection to (or disconnection from) a conduit (not shown) that places the mat <b>20</b> in fluid communication with one or more fluid modules. The nozzle <b>1300</b> can include a main portion <b>1310</b>, which in some embodiments, includes a generally cylindrical shape defining an interior space <b>1304</b>. Along it exterior surface, the main portion <b>1310</b> can comprise one or more alignment and/or quick-connect features <b>1320</b> (e.g., tabs, other protrusions, slots, other recesses, etc.) that are shaped, sized and otherwise configured to generally mate with corresponding mating or engaging features on the conduit (not shown) to which the fluid nozzle <b>1300</b> can be selectively connected or disconnected.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Other embodiments of a fluid nozzle <b>1400</b> for a conditioner mat or topper member <b>20</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32 and 33</figref>.

In addition, as illustrated in the cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, the layers and/or other components of the conditioner mat <b>20</b> that define an interior space through which air is selectively delivered can be configured to properly locate and secure the nozzle <b>1400</b> thereon. For example, fluid boundaries or barriers <b>1484</b> (e.g., stitching, heat staking, bonding, etc.) can be used to form the opening through which the nozzle <b>1400</b> can extend.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">As discussed herein, control of the fluid modules and/or any other components of a conditioner mat or topper member can be based, at least partially, on feedback received from one or more sensors. For example, a mat or topper member can include one or more thermal sensors, humidity sensors, condensation sensors, optical sensors, motion sensors, audible sensors, occupant detection sensors, other pressure sensors and/or the like. In some embodiments, such sensors can be positioned on or near a surface of the mat or topper member to determine whether cooling and/or heating of the assembly is required or desired. For instance, thermal sensors can help determine if the temperature at a surface of the mat is above or below a desired level. Alternatively, one or more thermal sensors and/or humidity sensors can be positioned in or near a fluid module, a fluid conduit (e.g., fluid passageway) and/or a layer of the upper portion of the topper member (e.g., fluid distribution member, comfort layer, etc.) to detect the temperature and/or humidity of the discharged fluid. Likewise, pressure sensors can be configured to detect when a user has been in contact with a surface of the bed for a prolonged time period. Depending on their type, sensors can contact a portion of the mat or the adjacent portion of the bed assembly on which the mat has been situated. As discussed herein, in some embodiments, sensors are located within and/or on the surface of the mat or topper member. However, in other arrangements, the sensors are configured so they do not contact any portion of the mat at all. Such operational schemes can help detect conditions that are likely to result in pressure ulcers. In addition, such schemes can help conserve power, enhance comfort and provide other advantages.
