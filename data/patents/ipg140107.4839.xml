<heading id="h-0002" level="1">Description of the Related Art</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The diversity and versatility of display devices today imposes new demands on digital media. For instance, designers must create different alternatives for web-content and design different layouts for different devices. Moreover, HTML, as well as other standards, can support dynamic changes of page layout and text. Images, although they make up some of the key elements in digital media, typically remain rigid in size and cannot deform to fit different layouts automatically. However, the size and/or aspect ratio of an image must change in order to fit into different displays, such as cell phones or PDAs, or to print on a given paper size or at a specified resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Resizing images using standard image scaling is often not sufficient since it is oblivious to the image content and typically can be applied only uniformly, resulting in various artifacts or distortions of the input image. Cropping is also of limited use since it can only remove pixels from the image periphery. More effective resizing can only be achieved by considering the image content and not only geometric constraints. Seam carving techniques have been developed which alter the dimensions of an image by removing pixels from the image or adding pixels to the image that are considered to be less important than other pixels of the image, e.g., based on a pixel's value as compared to the value of its neighbors. However, standard seam carving techniques may be computationally expensive and may also produce undesirable artifacts or distortions. In addition, the number of computations performed using standard seam carving techniques may make them too slow for use in fluid user-interactive environments.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Various embodiments of systems, methods, and computer-readable storage media for performing resizing operations on images using seam carving techniques are disclosed. The methods described herein may in some embodiments facilitate efficient re-computation of the energy of an image between iterations in a resizing operation by recognizing that after a seam is identified and removed (or replicated), it may not be necessary to re-compute the energy of all the remaining pixels and/or seams in the entire image. In various embodiments, dependent on the particular energy function being applied, the methods may include re-computing only the energy of pixels and/or seams in the neighborhood of removed and/or replicated seams between iterations.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some embodiments, the methods described herein may include generating an energy map for an input image by determining a respective energy value for each pixel of the image. In various embodiments, the respective energy values may be computed as a difference in color values of two or more pixels, a difference in intensity values of two or more pixels, a derivative of two or more pixel values, an average of two or more pixel values, a maximum of two or more pixel values, or a minimum of two or more pixel values.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The methods may also include identifying a seam of the input image having the lowest cost, dependent on the respective energy values of pixels of the seam, where the cost of the seam is dependent on a sum of the respective energy values of all pixels of the seam, an average of the respective energy values of all pixels of the seam, a weighted average of the respective energy values of all pixels of the seam, or a maximum value of the respective energy values of all pixels of the seam, for example. Identifying the lowest cost seam may in some embodiments include identifying a shortest path across the image or applying a dynamic programming technique.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The methods may include performing a resizing operation on the image along the identified seam, and updating (in the energy map) the respective energy values for the pixels in the neighborhood of the identified seam. For example, the resizing operation may be a reduction operation, and the pixels of the identified seam may be removed. In another example, the resizing operation may be an expansion operation, and the pixels of the identified seam may be replicated in the image. In various embodiments, the neighborhood, and therefore the pixels for which the energy values are updated, may be dependent on the energy function employed by a particular seam carving technique.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The methods may include identifying the next lowest cost seam of the image, dependent on the updated energy map, and performing an additional resizing operation on the image along the next lowest cost seam. In some embodiments, the energy map may be further updated (e.g., for pixels in the neighborhood of each of the next lowest cost seams) and additional low-cost seams may be identified and removed (or replicated) until the resized image meets a specified target size or a specified target aspect ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the methods described herein may be used to pre-compute a retargeting matrix, which may then be used in performing one or more retargeting operations on an input image without re-computing the energy and/or the lowest cost seam(s) of the image between iterations. In various embodiments, the retargeting matrix may store, for each seam, an identifier of the seam, an indication of the seam cost, a cost order of the seam, and/or an identifier of each of the pixels of the seam.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The methods described herein may be implemented as program instructions, (e.g., stored on computer-readable storage media) executable by a CPU and/or GPU, in various embodiments. For example, they may be implemented as program instructions that, when executed, implement generating a retargeting matrix and/or performing a seam carving operation as stand-alone operations or in conjunction with execution of an image editing operation in a graphics application, in different embodiments.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Graphic applications include an ever-increasing number of image editing features, such as various filtering options and resizing operations (e.g., for cropping, expanding, or reducing an image). Currently available image resizing techniques include scaling techniques and seam-based techniques, also known as seam carving techniques. Seam carving, as described herein, may be used to increase or decrease the size of an image, in various embodiments. For example, given an image, to reduce the width, one or more seams in the image may be identified by a seam carving technique and removed from the image, while to increase the width one or more seams may be identified and replicated in the image. As used herein, the term &#x201c;seam&#x201d; refers to a set of pixels along a path from one edge of the image (e.g., the top of the image) to the opposite edge of the image (e.g., the bottom of the image) that satisfies the following two constraints:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0018">1) The seam is monotonic, meaning (in this example) that its path only goes in one direction across the image (e.g., down), and does not reverse directions as it crosses the image (e.g., going down for a while and then up, or vice versa).</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0019">2) The seam comprises pixels that are &#x201c;connected&#x201d; to each other. In other words, for any given pixel of the seam (in this example), the pixel on the next row must be either directly below the given pixel or diagonally adjacent to the given pixel (e.g., one pixel to the left of the pixel or one pixel to the right of the given pixel on the next row). For example, from any given pixel of the seam to the next pixel of the seam, the path cannot jump to a pixel <b>20</b> pixels away in the next row.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0020">In various embodiments, seam carving techniques may be content sensitive, or context aware. For example, given an input image, the data representing the image may be processed to generate an alternate representation of the image, which may be referred to as an energy map, which indicates the importance of each pixel in terms of image resizing. In some embodiments of a content-aware seam carving technique, the values mapped to each pixel of the input image by this energy map may be generated dependent on the pixels in its neighborhood, e.g., using a derivative function. For, example, if a white pixel is surrounded by other white pixels, it may not be considered an important pixel (with respect to a resizing operation). This is because if it is removed, it is not likely to be missed. On the other hand, if a white pixel is surrounded by black pixels, then removing it may be very noticeable and may change the content of the image. Therefore, this pixel may be mapped to a higher value by the energy map.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0021">A content-aware seam carving technique may in various embodiments assign an energy or weight to every pixel, and may use those values to identify one or more seams having a minimal cost with respect to a resizing operation. In other words, the content-aware seam carving technique may use the energy costs of each pixel to identify a path of pixels going from one edge of the image to the opposite edge of the image for which the sum of the energy values has the minimum value. In some embodiments, this determination may be solved efficiently using a technique called dynamic programming or shortest path. Once the lowest-cost seam has been identified, the image may be resized along the seam. For example, if the resizing operation is a reduction operation, the pixels associated with the lowest-cost seam may be removed. In this example, the seam carving operation would remove one pixel per row (because the seam is monotonic), and all the pixels to the right of the seam would be moved one pixel to the left to obtain an image that is one pixel narrower than the input image. By iteratively applying this technique, the image may be reduced to reach a target size and/or aspect ratio. Similarly, if the resizing operation is an expansion operation, the pixels associated with the lowest-cost seam may be replicated, and a copy of each pixel may be inserted into the image to the right of the seam. In this example, the seam carving operation would add one pixel per row, and all the pixels to the right of the seam would be moved one pixel to the right to obtain an image that is one pixel wider than the input image. By iteratively applying this technique, the image may be expanded to reach a target size and/or aspect ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0022">Seam carving may be further illustrated by way of example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates an input image <b>100</b>, which is to be resized. In this example <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is to be resized to a target size with an aspect ratio that is shorter (i.e., smaller in the vertical dimension) and wider (i.e., longer in the horizontal dimension) than input image <b>100</b>. In this example, seam carving techniques may be applied separately in each dimension.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0023">To expand the width of input image <b>100</b>, one or more low-cost (or lowest-cost) seams of pixels going from top to bottom, such as vertical seam <b>101</b>, are identified. Input image <b>100</b> may then be expanded by replicating the pixels of each of the identified vertical seams (e.g., by making a copy of each pixel of the seam and inserting it into the image to the right of the seam). This may produce a resized image as an intermediate result, in some embodiments. To reduce the height of the input image, one or more low-cost (or lowest-cost) horizontal seams, such as horizontal seam <b>102</b>, are identified. The resized input image <b>100</b> may then be reduced by removing the pixels of the identified horizontal seams. An output image <b>110</b>, resulting from these two resizing operations, is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. Note that in various embodiments, the reduction operation may be performed before the expansion operation, the reduction and expansion operations may be performed in parallel, or the resizing operation may alternate between the replication of vertical seams (e.g., one at a time) and the removal of horizontal seams (e.g., one at a time) until the target size and/or aspect ratio for the output image is reached.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0024">As previously noted, standard seam carving techniques may be too slow for today's demanding interactive environment. The methods described herein may in some embodiments simplify and/or reduce the number of computations performed during seam carving operations, therefore facilitating implementations of seam carving that are fast enough for user-interactive environments without compromising quality. One of the bottlenecks in seam carving may be the re-computation of energy values for all of the pixels of an input image between iterations in a given seam carving operation. Using standard seam carving techniques, these computations may comprise on the order of 25% of the computational bandwidth of the operation.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0025">Using standard seam carving techniques, the energy values for all the pixels of the image may be recalculated between iterations (e.g., after each removal or replication of a single seam). In this way, determining the next lowest cost seam in the image would take into account the change made in the previous iteration. For example, a standard seam carving technique may include the following steps:</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0026">Let the source image be S</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0027">For every seam to be computed:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0028">1) Find energy (E) for all pixels of S</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0029">2) Use dynamic programming to find the optimal seam</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0030">3) Remove the pixels from S belonging to the seam</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0031">4) Repeat as necessary for the modified source image S</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0032">Computing (and re-computing) energy over the entire image, especially for large images, can be highly computationally complex and expensive. In some embodiments, this complexity and expense may be greatly reduced by re-computing energy for only a portion of the image between iterations, rather than re-computing the energy of the entire image. For example, energy may only need to be re-computed in the neighborhood of a removed seam, since energy in the rest of the image may not have been affected by its removal. As a result, instead of computing energy over and over again, the method may include computing energy for the entire image once, and then updating the energy between seam carving iterations only where necessary. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> again illustrates input image <b>100</b>, and includes vertical seam <b>101</b> (shown as a white line crossing from the top of the image to the bottom of the image) and horizontal seam <b>102</b> (shown as a white line crossing from the left side of the image to the right side of the image). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, neighbors of the pixels in vertical seam <b>101</b> and in horizontal seam <b>102</b> are highlighted in black on either side of the seams. In some embodiments, before determining a next lowest cost vertical seam and/or a next lowest cost horizontal seam after removal of seams <b>101</b> and/or <b>102</b>, only the energy values corresponding to the pixels in these highlighted areas may be re-computed, rather than all of the energy values for input image <b>100</b>. In this way, a large percentage of the computations typically performed in a seam carving operation may be avoided without compromising the quality of the result.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0033">The neighbors of the pixels of an identified seam, i.e., those pixels for which the energy may be affected by seam removal and/or replication, may in general be dependent on the method used to determine the energy of the image. For example, in various embodiments, energy values mapped to each pixel may be computed as a difference in color values between two or more neighboring pixels, a difference in intensity values between two or more neighboring pixels, a derivative of two or more neighbors' pixel values, an average of two or more neighbors' pixel values, a maximum of two or more neighbors' pixel values, and a minimum of two or more neighbors' pixel values. The neighboring pixels for each of these energy functions may be of various orientations with respect to the target pixel, in different embodiments. For example, one energy function may compute an average of pixel values in a 3&#xd7;3 pixel area having the target pixel at its center. Another energy function may compute the difference between the value of the pixel on the right of the target pixel and the value of the pixel on the left of the target pixel. Other energy functions are possible and may involve neighboring pixels of any number and/or orientation, in different embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0034">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the highlighted neighbors of the identified seam pixels include a small number of pixels on either side of each seam. In this example, the energy of the image may be computed using a gradient function involving one or more pixels immediately adjacent to each pixel (e.g., pixels that are one pixel to the right, left, top, and/or bottom of each pixel). Therefore, only the energies of the pixels immediately adjacent to each pixel of a replicated or removed seam may need to be re-computed and/or updated in an energy map for the image between iterations.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0035">In some embodiments, the pixels that are considered neighbors of identified seam pixels may be determined programmatically, e.g., based on the energy function employed in the seam carving operation. In other embodiments, they may be determined arbitrarily, or using a default definition. In other words, in some embodiments, the neighborhood of a pixel may be defined to include pixels in a specified number of rows and/or columns surrounding the pixel. For example, in one embodiment, the energy may be re-computed and updated in the image's energy map for all pixels within 4 pixels of an identified seam pixel. In some embodiments, the number and/or orientation of pixels to be re-computed and/or updated may be configurable by a user (e.g., through a graphical user interface).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0036">One method for seam carving that employs the methods described above is illustrated by the flow chart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In this example, data representing an image to be resized is accessed, as in <b>300</b>. This data may be accessed in response to being imported into an application configured for image editing, or may be resident in memory accessible to such an application as a result of being imported previously, or as a result of being created and/or modified by the application prior to the desired resizing operation. Note that, as used herein, the term &#x201c;image editing application&#x201d; may refer to a graphic application that is specifically directed to image editing, or to any application that includes an image editing component, according to various embodiments. The data accessed may represent a whole image or a portion of an image that is to be resized, in different embodiments. For example, in one embodiment, a user may select a portion of an image on which to perform a resizing operation using a selecting tool or a cropping tool of an image editing application. The user may also select a target size, expansion/reduction target (e.g., a percentage increase or decrease in one or more dimensions) and/or target aspect ratio for a resizing operation using various user interface elements (e.g., pull-down menus, radio buttons, or alphanumeric input fields), in various embodiments. As shown at <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the method may also include initializing an energy map for the image. For example, memory may be allocated for storing the energy values of all the pixels of the input image. In various embodiments, other data structures (e.g., data structures configured to store input image data, intermediate image data, and/or output data for resized images) may also be allocated in memory (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0037">In this example, respective energy values may be determined for all of the pixels of image, as in <b>310</b>. The energy values may be determined as described above (e.g., using a derivative function or another parametric function), or by any of various other methods. Dependent on these energy values, the lowest cost seam of the image may be determined, as in <b>320</b>. The cost of each seam may be determined in various ways in different embodiments, such as by calculating a sum, average, or weighted average of the energy values of the pixels making up the seam. In another example, the cost of each seam may be dependent on a maximum energy value for the pixels of the seam. In other words, a seam may be assigned a higher cost due to the presence of even one high-energy pixel in the seam, because removing that pixel may create an undesirable visual artifact. As previously noted, identifying a seam of the image having a lowest cost may include identifying a shortest path across the image or applying a dynamic programming technique, in some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0038">As illustrated at <b>320</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the method may include resizing the image along the seam determined to have the lowest cost. For example, if the image is to be reduced, the pixels of the lowest-cost seam may be removed, while if the image is to be expanded, the pixels of the lowest-cost seam may be replicated and inserted adjacent to the identified seam.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0039">If the resizing operation performed in <b>320</b> does not result in a resized image that meets its resizing target (e.g., a target for size, percentage increase/decrease, and/or aspect ratio), shown as the negative exit from <b>330</b>, additional resizing operations (e.g., on each successive next lowest cost seam) may be performed on the image. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the method may include updating the energy values (e.g., in the energy map for the image) for the pixels in the neighborhood of the most recently identified seam (i.e., the seam along which the image has just been resized), as in <b>340</b>. As described above, the neighborhood, and therefore the pixels for which the energy values are updated, may be dependent on the energy function employed by the particular seam carving technique, in some embodiments. In this example, once the energy map for the image has been updated, the method may include determining the next lowest cost seam of the image, dependent on the updated energy map, as in <b>350</b>. As shown at <b>350</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the method may include further resizing the modified image along the next lowest cost seam.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0040">If the further resized image does not meet the resizing target, shown as the negative exit from <b>360</b>, the method may include additional resizing iterations, each including an update to the energy values of pixels in the neighborhood of the last identified low-cost seam and a determination of the next lowest cost seam, along which the resizing should be performed. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> as the feedback from <b>360</b> to <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0041">If the resizing operation performed at <b>350</b> results in a resized image that meets its resizing target, shown as the positive exit from <b>360</b>, the resizing operation may be complete, and the method may include outputting data representing the resized image, as in <b>370</b>. For example, the data may be provided to a display component of the application for display of the resized image to the user and/or the data may be stored as in intermediate image by the image editing application for further processing by the application (or another application) or as a final image (e.g., written to main memory, a file, an archive, etc.). Note that the method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> may in various embodiments be applied to reduction of an image, expansion of an image, or a combination of reduction and expansion operations in order to resize the image to its target size and/or aspect ratio (as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0042">The methods described herein for iteratively determining the lowest cost seam in an image between seam carving iterations may in some embodiments be applied independently from the performance of seam carving operations. For example, in some embodiments, rather than iteratively calculating the lowest-cost seam and duplicating it (e.g., one seam at a time) during an expansion operation, the cost of all seams may be pre-computed up front using the methods described herein, and then one or more of the lowest-cost seams may be duplicated until a resizing target is met. Similarly, a retargeting operation that reduces an image, or that allows a user to interactively resize an image (e.g., by stretching or moving an edge or corner of the image through a graphical user interface), may access a pre-computed retargeting matrix to determine one or more seams to be removed and/or replicated without having to iteratively determine the next lowest cost seam(s) as the image is modified.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0043">As noted above, a standard seam carving technique may include the following steps:</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0044">Let the source image be S</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0045">For every seam to be computed:

    </ul>
    </li>

</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0050">In some embodiments, a method for generating a retargeting matrix may include steps 1 and 2, but may not include removing the pixels of each identified seam from the actual image data, as shown in step 3. Instead, the method may include repeating steps 1 and 2 as if the seam identified in the previous step 2 had been removed, and determining the next lowest cost seam of the image from the updated energy map produced in the current step 1. As the next lowest cost seam is calculated, an indication of the seam cost, the cost order of the seam, and/or the pixels of the seam may be stored in a retargeting matrix for the image. In some embodiments, such a retargeting matrix may include all the information needed to perform interactive retargeting of images without re-computing the image energy and/or the lowest cost seam(s) during the retargeting operation. For example, as a user drags or stretches an edge or corner of an image, the image may be retargeted for display one or more times using the pre-computed retargeting matrix to determine which seam(s) to remove and/or replicate. Once the user saves the image, the retargeting matrix may be re-computed and/or stored in memory for subsequent retargeting operations. In some embodiments, generation of a retargeting matrix may be accelerated using the methods described above for accelerating seam carving operations. For example, when the energy computation at step 1 above is repeated, only the energy values for pixels in the neighborhood of the seam identified in the previous step 2 may be re-computed and updated in the energy map for the image. The updated energy map, with only these changes, may then be used to determine the next lowest seam cost in step 2.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0051">One method for generating a retargeting matrix is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, according to one embodiment.

Memory <b>510</b> may include other types of memory as well, or combinations thereof. One or more of memories <b>510</b> may include program instructions <b>515</b> executable by one or more of processors <b>530</b> to implement aspects of the image resizing techniques described herein. Program instructions <b>515</b>, which may include program instructions configured to implement graphics application <b>520</b>, may be partly or fully resident within the memory <b>510</b> of computer system <b>500</b> at any point in time. Alternatively, program instructions <b>515</b> may be provided to GPU <b>540</b> for performing resizing operations (or portions thereof) on GPU <b>540</b> using one or more of the techniques described herein. In some embodiments, the techniques described herein may be implemented by a combination of program instructions <b>515</b> executed on one or more processors <b>530</b> and one or more GPUs <b>540</b>, respectively. Program instructions <b>515</b> may also be stored on an external storage device (not shown) accessible by the processor(s) <b>530</b> and/or GPU <b>540</b>, in some embodiments. Any of a variety of such storage devices may be used to store the program instructions <b>515</b> in different embodiments, including any desired type of persistent and/or volatile storage devices, such as individual disks, disk arrays, optical devices (e.g., CD-ROMs, CD-RW drives, DVD-ROMs, DVD-RW drives), flash memory devices, various types of RAM, holographic storage, etc. The storage devices may be coupled to the processor(s) <b>530</b> and/or GPU <b>540</b> through one or more storage or I/O interfaces including, but not limited to, interconnect <b>560</b> or network interface <b>550</b>, as described herein.

<p id="p-0055" num="0064">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, processor(s) <b>530</b> may be coupled to one or more of the other illustrated components by at least one communications bus, such as interconnect <b>560</b> (e.g., a system bus, LDT, PCI, ISA, or other communication bus type), and a network interface <b>550</b> (e.g., an ATM interface, an Ethernet interface, a Frame Relay interface, or other interface). The CPU <b>530</b>, the network interface <b>550</b>, and the memory <b>510</b> may be coupled to the interconnect <b>560</b>. It should also be noted that one or more components of system <b>500</b> might be located remotely and accessed via a network.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0065">As noted above, in some embodiments, memory <b>510</b> may include program instructions <b>515</b>, comprising program instructions configured to implement graphics application <b>520</b>, as described herein. Graphics application <b>520</b> may be implemented in various embodiments using any desired programming language, scripting language, or combination of programming languages and/or scripting languages, e.g., C, C++, C#, Java&#x2122;, Perl, etc. For example, in one embodiment, graphics application <b>520</b> may be JAVA based, while in another embodiments, it may be implemented using the C or C++ programming languages. In other embodiments, graphics application <b>520</b> may be implemented using specific graphic languages specifically for developing programs executed by specialize graphics hardware, such as GPU <b>540</b>. In addition, graphics application <b>520</b> may be embodied on memory specifically allocated for use by graphics processor(s) <b>540</b>, such as memory on a graphics board including graphics processor(s) <b>540</b>. Thus, memory <b>510</b> may represent dedicated graphics memory as well as general-purpose system RAM, in various embodiments. Memory <b>510</b> may in some embodiments also include a data store configured to store image data for one or more input images and/or output images, in various embodiments. Other information not described herein may be included in memory <b>510</b> and may be used to implement the methods described herein and/or other functionality of computer system <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0066">Network interface <b>550</b> may be configured to enable computer system <b>500</b> to communicate with other computers, systems or machines, such as across a network. Network interface <b>550</b> may use standard communications technologies and/or protocols, and may utilize links using technologies such as Ethernet, 802.11, integrated services digital network (ISDN), digital subscriber line (DSL), and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) as well as other communications technologies. Similarly, the networking protocols used on a network to which computer system <b>500</b> is interconnected may include multiprotocol label switching (MPLS), the transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP), the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), the hypertext transport protocol (HTTP), the simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP), and the file transfer protocol (FTP), among other network protocols. The data exchanged over such a network by network interface <b>550</b> may be represented using technologies, languages, and/or formats, such as the hypertext markup language (HTML), the extensible markup language (XML), and the simple object access protocol (SOAP) among other data representation technologies. Additionally, all or some of the links or data may be encrypted using any suitable encryption technologies, such as the secure sockets layer (SSL), Secure HTTP and/or virtual private networks (VPNs), the international data encryption standard (DES or IDEA), triple DES, Blowfish, RC2, RC4, RC5, RC6, as well as other data encryption standards and protocols. In other embodiments, custom and/or dedicated data communications, representation, and encryption technologies and/or protocols may be used instead of, or in addition to, the particular ones described above.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0067">GPUs, such as GPU <b>540</b> may be implemented in a number of different physical forms. For example, GPU <b>540</b> may take the form of a dedicated graphics card, an integrated graphics solution and/or a hybrid solution. GPU <b>540</b> may interface with the motherboard by means of an expansion slot such as PCI Express Graphics or Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) and thus may be replaced or upgraded with relative ease, assuming the motherboard is capable of supporting the upgrade. However, a dedicated GPU is not necessarily removable, nor does it necessarily interface the motherboard in a standard fashion. The term &#x201c;dedicated&#x201d; refers to the fact that hardware graphics solution may have RAM that is dedicated for graphics use, not to whether the graphics solution is removable or replaceable. Dedicated GPUs for portable computers may be interfaced through a non-standard and often proprietary slot due to size and weight constraints. Such ports may still be considered AGP or PCI express, even if they are not physically interchangeable with their counterparts. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, memory <b>510</b> may represent any of various types and arrangements of memory, including general-purpose system RAM and/or dedication graphics or video memory.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0068">Integrated graphics solutions, or shared graphics solutions are graphics processors that utilize a portion of a computer's system RAM rather than dedicated graphics memory. For instance, modern desktop motherboards normally include an integrated graphics solution and have expansion slots available to add a dedicated graphics card later. As a GPU may be extremely memory intensive, an integrated solution finds itself competing for the already slow system RAM with the CPU as the integrated solution has no dedicated video memory. For instance, system RAM may experience a bandwidth between 2 GB/s and 8 GB/s, while most dedicated GPUs enjoy from 15 GB/s to 30 GB/s of bandwidth. Hybrid solutions may also share memory with the system memory, but may have a smaller amount of memory on-board than discrete or dedicated graphics cards to make up for the high latency of system RAM. Data communicated between the graphics processing unit <b>540</b> and the rest of the computer system <b>500</b> may travel through a graphics card slot or other interface, such as interconnect <b>560</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 500</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0069">Computer system <b>500</b> may also include one or more additional I/O interfaces, such as interfaces for one or more user input devices <b>570</b>, or such devices may be coupled to computer system <b>500</b> via network interface <b>550</b>. For example, computer system <b>500</b> may include interfaces to a keyboard, a mouse or other cursor control device, a joystick, or other user input devices <b>570</b>, in various embodiments. Additionally, the computer system <b>500</b> may include one or more displays (not shown), coupled to processors <b>530</b> and/or other components via interconnect <b>560</b> or network interface <b>550</b>. Such input/output devices may be configured to allow a user to interact with graphics application <b>520</b> to request various resizing operations and/or to specify various parameters, thresholds, and/or other configurable options available to the user when editing images executing graphic application <b>520</b>. It will be apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art that computer system <b>500</b> may also include numerous other elements not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0070">Note that program instructions <b>515</b> may be configured to implement a graphic application <b>520</b> as a stand-alone application, or as a module of another graphics application or graphics library, in various embodiments. For example, in one embodiment program instructions <b>515</b> may be configured to implement graphics applications such as painting, publishing, photography, games, animation, and/or other applications, and may be configured to resize images as part of one or more of these graphics applications. In another embodiment, program instructions <b>515</b> may be configured to implement the resizing techniques described herein in one or more functions called by another graphics application executed on GPU <b>540</b> and/or processor(s) <b>530</b>. Program instructions <b>515</b> may also be configured to render images and present them on one or more displays as the output of a resizing operation and/or to store image data for resized images in memory <b>510</b> and/or an external storage device(s), in various embodiments. For example, a graphics application <b>520</b> included in program instructions <b>515</b> may utilize GPU <b>540</b> when resizing, rendering, or displaying images in some embodiments.</p>
