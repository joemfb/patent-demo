<heading id="h-0003" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates generally to an electrode useable in an electrochemical cell, and more particularly to a battery cathode material including a nano-architecture current collector array in electrical contact with a flexible (or rigid) conducting foil and coated with a high-performance active layer of ternary orthosilicate compound, and methods of manufacturing and applications of the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Currently, a lithium-ion battery (LIB) is one of the most promising battery technologies that can provide higher energy density than other batteries. It also does not suffer from the memory effect and the loss of charge is relatively slow when not in use. Hence, high-performance LIB remains the preferred technology that would address a much broader range of energy source/storage for a variety of applications if advanced cathode material with extreme operating capability could be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Current lithium ion batteries mostly utilize metal oxides as cathode material with LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>as the most popular and commercially successful representative [2]. However, due to the intrinsic material properties of these metal oxides, further enhancement of LIB performance is limited. Specifically, the metal oxides have limited average potential versus Li/Li<sup>+</sup>, mostly well below 4V except LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and most of the metal oxides have the specific capacity well below 180 mAh/g, with the exception of LiNiO<sub>2</sub>. The metal oxides are also &#x201c;hot&#x201d; cathode materials due to the thermal runaway reaction, so there is also a concern for safety.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another major group of cathode materials is LiMPO<sub>4</sub>, where M=Co, Ni, Mn, or Fe. These materials have the electrode potential in the range of about 3.5-5.2 V, but the capacity is still limited below 150-170 mAh/g [3]. Further, these materials have poor electrical conductivity, so they have to be made in the form of tiny nanoparticles and coated with a carbon layer, which increases the cost of the materials.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The Li<sub>2</sub>MSiO<sub>4 </sub>silicate family (where M=Co, Fe, or Mn) has attracted research activities for the applications in LIB only recently [4, 5] and much work needs to be done to thoroughly understand its properties. The most significant advantage of this group of materials is the polyanionic structure with two lithium ions per formula unit. The theoretical capacity of these materials is as high as about 330 mAh/g. Unfortunately, Co is an expensive metal despite its high average voltage of about 4.3 V. Therefore, pure Li<sub>2</sub>CoSiO<sub>4 </sub>is not an efficient and economic way for making a cathode. Li<sub>2</sub>FeSiO<sub>4 </sub>has good cycle-ability, but the average voltage is only about 3.1 V, far below 4 V. On the contrary, Mn is an inexpensive and abundant element. The average voltage of Li<sub>2</sub>MnSiO<sub>4 </sub>is about 4.2 V. The reported specific capacity of Li<sub>2</sub>MnSiO<sub>4 </sub>is about 210 and about 250 mAh/g at room temperature and 55&#xb0; C., respectively [6]. However, it has to be noted that the entire family of Li<sub>2</sub>MSiO<sub>4 </sub>silicates has poor electrical conductivity, therefore Li<sub>2</sub>MnSiO<sub>4 </sub>has to be made into nanoparticles and coated with carbon in order to improve the conductivity, similar to the aforementioned LiMPO<sub>4</sub>. The additional carbon-coating process is expensive.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another major drawback of Li<sub>2</sub>MnSiO<sub>4 </sub>is its poor cycle life characterized by the poor capacity retention and rate performance. A recent report shows a 50% retained capacity at room temperature after 20 cycles. The poor cycling performance is mainly attributed to Jahn-Teller distortion, structural instability and low electronic conductivity of the material. Another possible attribution is the electrolyte degradation.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The presence of Mn<sup>3+</sup> ions in the material system is responsible for the dynamic Jahn-Teller distortion and manganese dissolution, a situation similar to that of LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>spinel cathode. Also, the structure of Li<sub>2</sub>MnSiO<sub>4 </sub>is prone to collapsing upon delithiation. During delithiation, a phase separation into MnSiO<sub>4 </sub>and Li<sub>2</sub>MnSiO<sub>4 </sub>may occur, leading to the formation of an amorphous structure, which in turn results in the drop of reversible capacity of the electrode during the cycling.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">An effective way to minimize the dynamic Jahn-Teller distortion and prevent the collapse of Li<sub>2</sub>MnSiO<sub>4 </sub>structure is the utilization of a solid solution of Li<sub>2</sub>MnSiO<sub>4 </sub>and Li<sub>2</sub>FeSiO<sub>4 </sub>as the cathode. However, there is very limited research available on this topic. A few literature reports do show that addition of Li<sub>2</sub>FeSiO<sub>4 </sub>has prevented Li<sub>2</sub>MnSiO<sub>4 </sub>from collapsing during delithiation [7, 8]. Nonetheless, according to the reports, the cyclic reversibility is still unacceptable.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The present invention is more particularly described in the following examples that are intended as illustrative only since numerous modifications and variations therein will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Various embodiments of the invention are now described in detail. Referring to the drawings, like numbers indicate like components throughout the views. As used in the description herein and throughout the claims that follow, the meaning of &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d;, and &#x201c;the&#x201d; includes plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Also, as used in the description herein and throughout the claims that follow, the meaning of &#x201c;in&#x201d; includes &#x201c;in&#x201d; and &#x201c;on&#x201d; unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Moreover, titles or subtitles may be used in the specification for the convenience of a reader, which shall have no influence on the scope of the present invention. Additionally, some terms used in this specification are more specifically defined below.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">DEFINITIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The terms used in this specification generally have their ordinary meanings in the art, within the context of the invention, and in the specific context where each term is used. Certain terms that are used to describe the invention are discussed below, or elsewhere in the specification, to provide additional guidance to the practitioner regarding the description of the invention. For convenience, certain terms may be highlighted, for example using italics and/or quotation marks. The use of highlighting has no influence on the scope and meaning of a term; the scope and meaning of a term is the same, in the same context, whether or not it is highlighted. It will be appreciated that same thing can be said in more than one way. Consequently, alternative language and synonyms may be used for any one or more of the terms discussed herein, nor is any special significance to be placed upon whether or not a term is elaborated or discussed herein. Synonyms for certain terms are provided. A recital of one or more synonyms does not exclude the use of other synonyms. The use of examples anywhere in this specification including examples of any terms discussed herein is illustrative only, and in no way limits the scope and meaning of the invention or of any exemplified term. Likewise, the invention is not limited to various embodiments given in this specification.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;on&#x201d; another element, it can be directly on the other element or intervening elements may be present therebetween. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly on&#x201d; another element, there are no intervening elements present. As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, third etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another element, component, region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Furthermore, relative terms, such as &#x201c;lower&#x201d; or &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; and &#x201c;upper&#x201d; or &#x201c;top,&#x201d; may be used herein to describe one element's relationship to another element as illustrated in the Figures. It will be understood that relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the Figures. For example, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as being on the &#x201c;lower&#x201d; side of other elements would then be oriented on &#x201c;upper&#x201d; sides of the other elements. The exemplary term &#x201c;lower&#x201d;, can therefore, encompasses both an orientation of &#x201c;lower&#x201d; and &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; depending of the particular orientation of the figure. Similarly, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements would then be oriented &#x201c;above&#x201d; the other elements. The exemplary terms &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; can, therefore, encompass both an orientation of above and below.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and the present disclosure, and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As used herein, &#x201c;around&#x201d;, &#x201c;about&#x201d; or &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; shall generally mean within 20 percent, preferably within 10 percent, and more preferably within 5 percent of a given value or range. Numerical quantities given herein are approximate, meaning that the term &#x201c;around&#x201d;, &#x201c;about&#x201d; or &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; can be inferred if not expressly stated.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As used herein, if any, the term &#x201c;scanning electron microscope&#x201d; or its abbreviation &#x201c;SEM&#x201d; refers to a type of electron microscope that images the sample surface by scanning it with a high-energy beam of electrons in a raster scan pattern. The electrons interact with the atoms that make up the sample producing signals that contain information about the sample's surface topography, composition and other properties such as electrical conductivity.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As used herein, if any, the term &#x201c;energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy&#x201d; or its abbreviation &#x201c;EDS&#x201d; refers to an analytical technique used for the elemental analysis or chemical characterization of a sample. It relies on the investigation of an interaction of some source of X-ray excitation and a sample. Its characterization capabilities are due in large part to the fundamental principle that each element has a unique atomic structure allowing unique set of peaks on its X-ray spectrum.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As used herein, if any, the term &#x201c;X-ray diffraction&#x201d; or its abbreviation &#x201c;XRD&#x201d; refers to a method of determining the arrangement of atoms within a crystal or solid, in which a beam of X-rays strikes a crystal and diffracts into many specific directions. From the angles and intensities of these diffracted beams, a crystallographer can produce a three-dimensional picture of the density of electrons within the crystal. From this electron density, the mean positions of the atoms in the crystal can be determined, as well as their chemical bonds, their disorder and various other information. In an X-ray diffraction measurement, a crystal or solid sample is mounted on a goniometer and gradually rotated while being bombarded with X-rays, producing a diffraction pattern of regularly spaced spots known as reflections. The two-dimensional images taken at different rotations are converted into a three-dimensional model of the density of electrons within the crystal using the mathematical method of Fourier transforms, combined with chemical data known for the sample.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As used herein, if any, the term &#x201c;differential scanning calorimetry&#x201d; or its abbreviation &#x201c;DSC&#x201d; refers to a thermoanalytical technique in which the difference in the amount of heat required to increase the temperature of a sample and reference is measured as a function of temperature. Both the sample and reference are maintained at nearly the same temperature throughout the experiment. Generally, the temperature program for a DSC analysis is designed such that the sample holder temperature increases linearly as a function of time. The reference sample should have a well-defined heat capacity over the range of temperatures to be scanned.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As used herein, &#x201c;nanoscopic-scale&#x201d;, &#x201c;nanoscopic&#x201d;, &#x201c;nanometer-scale&#x201d;, &#x201c;nanoscale&#x201d;, &#x201c;nanocomposites&#x201d;, &#x201c;nanoparticles&#x201d;, the &#x201c;nano-&#x201d; prefix, and the like generally refers to elements or articles having widths or diameters of less than about 1 &#x3bc;m, preferably less than about 100 nm in some cases. In all embodiments, specified widths can be smallest width (i.e. a width as specified where, at that location, the article can have a larger width in a different dimension), or largest width (i.e. where, at that location, the article's width is no wider than as specified, but can have a length that is greater).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As used herein, a &#x201c;nanostructure&#x201d; refers to an object of intermediate size between molecular and microscopic (micrometer-sized) structures. In describing nanostructures, the sizes of the nanostructures refer to the number of dimensions on the nanoscale. For example, nanotextured surfaces have one dimension on the nanoscale, i.e., only the thickness of the surface of an object is between 1.0 and 1000.0 nm. Nanotubes have two dimensions on the nanoscale, i.e., the diameter of the tube is between 1.0 and 1000.0 nm; its length could be much greater. Finally, sphere-like nanoparticles have three dimensions on the nanoscale, i.e., the particle is between 1.0 and 1000.0 nm in each spatial dimension. A list of nanostructures includes, but not limited to, nanoparticle, nanocomposite, quantum dot, nanofilm, nanoshell, nanofiber, nanoring, nanorod, nanowire, nanotube, and so on.</p>

The nanostructured current collectors include CNTs or carbon fibers/nanofibers (CFs), where the CNTs or CFs are in electrical contact with the conductive substrate. The ternary orthosilicate composite includes Li<sub>2</sub>Mn<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>y</sub>Co<sub>z</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, where x+y+z=1. The CNTs have diameters or thicknesses in a range of about 1.0-1,000.0 nm. The nanoparticles of the Li<sub>2</sub>Mn<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>y</sub>Co<sub>z</sub>SiO<sub>4 </sub>composite have diameters or sizes in a range of about 1.0-1000.0 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In addition, the electrode further includes an electrolyte solution filled in spaces among the CNTs and the nanoparticles of the Li<sub>2</sub>Mn<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>y</sub>Co<sub>z</sub>SiO<sub>4 </sub>composite.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In one embodiment, CNTs are utilized as an array of nano-architecture current collectors formed directly on a conductive substrate, which can be a flexible (or rigid) conducting foil (e.g. metal, graphite). Vertical-aligned CNTs impregnated with MnO<sub>2 </sub>nano-particles as electrodes [1] have been used for electrochemical supercapacitors recently, which resulted in excellent performance of about 1,000 F/cm<sup>3</sup>. In the present invention, the material coated on the CNT array is a high-performance active layer of ternary orthosilicate compound with composition of Li<sub>2</sub>Mn<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>y</sub>Co<sub>z</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, where x+y+z=1. The electrode using such nanostructured CNTs provides a high surface area of attachment for Li<sub>2</sub>Mn<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>y</sub>Co<sub>z</sub>SiO<sub>4 </sub>nanoparticles, which minimizes the contact resistance at the active material/current collector interface, and thereby maximizes the charge efficiency and the energy density of the cathode.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The electrode of the present invention is a high-voltage, high-capacity, and inexpensive cathode for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) capable of supporting high transient and pulsed loads while offering enhanced safety and lifecycle performance. Currently LIB is one of the most promising battery technologies that can provide higher energy density than other battery technologies. It also does not suffer from the memory effect and the loss of charge is relatively slow when not in use. Hence, with the electrode of the present invention, high-performance LIB can be realized to address a much broader range of energy source/storage for both military and civil applications.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Li<sub>2</sub>MSiO<sub>4</sub>, where M=Mn, Fe, and/or Co, is similar to olivine phosphate (LiFePO<sub>4</sub>) and has low electron conductivity. Fabrication processes of the LIB cathode structures utilizing such materials usually involve making the active material in the form of tiny nanoparticles, mixing them with carbon or coating them with a conductive carbon layer, and then pasting the mixture onto a conductive substrate (e.g., an aluminum foil) with a binder material. However, the electron conductivity of the mixture is limited by the high resistivity of the binder material and the high ohmic contact resistance between the cathode material and the substrate. In addition, the heat transfer between the cathode material and the substrate is also less than optimal, leading to elevated cathode temperature under heavy load.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Accordingly, the present invention utilizes a ternary orthosilicate composite, such as the Li<sub>2</sub>Mn<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>y</sub>Co<sub>z</sub>SiO<sub>4 </sub>composite, for the cathode active material, which would lead to a cathode with high voltage (&#x2267;4V), high capacity (&#x2267;180 mAh/g), excellent cycle life, and low cost. To achieve the present invention, synthesis of high performance ternary orthosilicate composite of Li<sub>2</sub>Mn<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>y</sub>Co<sub>z</sub>SiO<sub>4 </sub>must be realized such that the Li<sub>2</sub>Mn<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>y</sub>Co<sub>z</sub>SiO<sub>4 </sub>composite can be attached to the CNTs structure. Thus, the cathode obtained would have enhanced specific area and minimized interface resistance, thereby maximizing the charge transfer efficiency and specific power-energy densities.</p>
