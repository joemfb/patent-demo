<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A rod reel generally identified by reference numeral <b>10</b>, will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1 through 5</figref>. A method of servicing a rod string deployed in a well will then be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, rod reel <b>10</b> is a multi-pocket transfer reel, and has a reel body <b>12</b> comprising a linear central axis <b>14</b>, a first rod receiving channel <b>16</b> and a second rod receiving channel <b>18</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, first and second rod receiving channels <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> are substantially ring shaped and centered on central axis <b>14</b>. Second rod receiving channel <b>18</b> is adjacent to first rod receiving channel <b>16</b>. When mounted on a truck or trailer, axis <b>14</b> sits on a spindle <b>28</b> that allows rod reel <b>10</b> to turn. The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> may rest on the ground. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when mounted on a rod transfer truck or trailer, it may be raised or lowered to a desired angle using known lifting mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there may be a third channel <b>30</b> adjacent to first and second channels <b>18</b> as well. More than three channels may also be present. This may be desired if multiple sizes of rod string are to be transferred.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, channels <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> have been designed with safety and convenience in mind, such as both channels <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> being angled toward linear central axis <b>14</b> and first rod channel <b>16</b> being angled relative to the second rod receiving channel <b>18</b>, in order to prevent the loaded rod <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> from coming out during or after loading.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the examples discussed below, first channel <b>16</b> is used for used rod <b>26</b>, while replacement, or new rod <b>24</b>, is loaded into second channel <b>18</b>. This arrangement has been found to be more convenient in some circumstances, although it will be understood that either channel may store either type of rod.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">There will now be discussed a method of employing rod reel <b>10</b> to repair a rod string that is used in a wellbore. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, rod reel <b>10</b> is preferably loaded onto a rod transfer truck or trailer, as shown. A service reel <b>22</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is also used to handle the rod <b>26</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, rod reel <b>10</b> is shown as holding new rod <b>24</b> and used rod <b>26</b>. While not shown, a picker or rod guide, a rod shear, and a winch are also commonly used when handling rod strings. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a pinch roller <b>32</b> is carried along with rod reel <b>10</b>. The rod reel may be used to carry a replacement section of rod that is inserted into the existing rod string, or it may be used to carry an entire replacement rod string.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Rod reel <b>10</b> can be employed to repair rod at the bottom of the rod string, in the middle of the rod string, or at the top of the rod string. A general method will be discussed below, but variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Certain differences will become apparent from the discussion of each below.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Bottom of the Rod String Repair</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, at the rod yard, a new pin end may be welded on and the ordered amount of new endless rod <b>24</b> is loaded into, for example, the outside pocket <b>16</b> of transfer reel <b>12</b>. The pin end may also be welded on location. Using a winch the tail end of the new endless rod <b>24</b> is brought into the pocket where it is secured. Rod reel <b>10</b> is then taken to the location for rod repair. The rod transfer truck or trailer is backed to the service reel <b>22</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, and the used endless rod <b>26</b> is threaded through the picker/rod guide, then through the pinch roller <b>32</b>. Using the pinch roller <b>32</b> the rod end is pushed into and secured inside the rod reel <b>10</b> inside pocket <b>18</b>. Using pinch roller <b>32</b>, the worn endless rod <b>26</b> is measured and spooled on to rod reel <b>10</b>. Using a rod shear, the used endless rod <b>26</b> is then cut. Using the winch the rod tail end is brought inside the pocket and secured in place. Again using the winch the tail end of the new endless rod <b>24</b> is removed from outside pocket <b>16</b> of rod reel <b>10</b>. The new endless rod <b>24</b> is then strung through the pinch roller <b>32</b> and the picker/rod guide. Using pinch roller <b>32</b> the new endless rod <b>24</b> is fed to the welder. The welder can then weld the new endless rod <b>24</b> to the used endless rod that is on the service reel <b>22</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. After welding is completed the rod transfer truck or trailer is backed to the service reel <b>22</b>. Using pinch roller <b>32</b>, the new endless rod <b>24</b> is spooled onto the service reel <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Middle of the Rod String Repair</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">At the rod yard, the ordered amount of new endless rod <b>24</b> is loaded into the rod reel <b>10</b> inside pocket <b>18</b>. Using a winch the tail end of the new endless rod <b>24</b> is brought into the pocket and secured. The rod reel <b>10</b> is then taken to the location for rod repair. The rod transfer truck or trailer is backed to the service reel <b>22</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the used endless rod <b>26</b> is threaded through picker/rod guide and then through the pinch roller <b>32</b>. Using the pinch roller <b>32</b>, the rod end is pushed into and secured inside the transfer reel <b>12</b> outside pocket <b>16</b>. Using pinch roller <b>32</b>, the used endless rod <b>26</b> is spooled until the worn rod is found. Using a rod shear, the worn endless rod is measured and cut out. Using the winch, the rod tail end is brought inside the pocket and secured. Again using the winch, the tail end of the new endless rod <b>24</b> is removed from inside pocket <b>18</b> of rod reel <b>10</b>. The new endless rod <b>24</b> is strung through the pinch roller <b>32</b> and the picker/rod guide. The pinch roller <b>32</b> is then used to feed the new endless rod <b>24</b> to the welder. The welder can then weld the new endless rod <b>24</b> to the used endless rod that is on the service reel <b>22</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. After welding is completed, the new endless rod <b>24</b> is spooled onto service reel <b>22</b>. Using the winch, the tail end of the used rod <b>26</b> is removed from out of outside pocket <b>16</b> of rod reel <b>10</b>. The used endless rod <b>26</b> is then strung through the pinch roller <b>32</b> and the picker/rod guide. Using pinch roller <b>32</b> the used endless rod <b>26</b> is fed to the welder. The welder can then weld the used endless rod <b>26</b> to the new endless rod that is on the service reel <b>22</b>. After welding is completed the used endless rod <b>26</b> is spooled onto service reel <b>22</b> using pinch roller <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Top of the Rod String Repair</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">At the rod yard, the ordered amount of new endless rod <b>24</b> is loaded into inside pocket <b>18</b> of rod reel <b>10</b> with a welded pin on the end.
