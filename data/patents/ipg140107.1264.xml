<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Embodiments described herein relate generally to a rub rail assembly including a rub rail for protecting wall surfaces from impacts and abrasions, and more particularly, to a rub rail assembly including a support member for the rub rail.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In buses and other vehicles, the side wall surfaces are often protected from impacts and abrasions with rub rail assemblies, which often include a shock-absorbent rub rail. Often the rub rail assembly includes a rail support that is attached to the side wall surface, and a rubber or plastic rub rail that is attached to the rail support. In addition to side wall surfaces, rub rail assemblies are also used on vehicle doors and fenders. Rub rail assemblies are also used in applications other than vehicles, such as marine docks, boats, shelving, display cases, among other applications.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, rub rail assemblies <b>1</b> for buses and other vehicles <b>2</b> that are known today include a rub rail <b>3</b> that is fastened to the side wall surface <b>4</b> of the vehicle. Typically, multiple rub rails <b>3</b> are fastened to the side wall surface <b>4</b> in a parallel arrangement, with fasteners <b>5</b> spaced along the length of the rub rail assembly <b>1</b>, for example about every 9-inches. The rub rail assembly <b>1</b> may also include a rail support <b>6</b> over which the rub rail is placed.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">At the time of manufacture of the vehicle <b>2</b>, the rub rails <b>3</b> are clamped onto the side wall surface <b>4</b>, and the side wall surface is match drilled with fastener holes <b>7</b> in the rub rails. Then, the fasteners <b>5</b> are inserted through the rub rails <b>3</b> to attach the rub rail to the side wall surface <b>4</b>. After fastening, the vehicle is masked a first time to paint the rub rails <b>3</b>, and masked a second time to paint the vehicle. Thus, there a multiple steps in the manufacturing process of attaching the rub rail assemblies to the vehicle that may lead to additional cost and time.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A rub rail assembly for a side wall surface of a vehicle includes a cleat support having a first body portion and a second body portion. The first body portion has a first fastener receiving hole for fastening the cleat support to the side wall surface of the vehicle, and the second body portion has an engagement structure. The rub rail has a hook that is engageable with the engagement structure of the support cleat to permit the rub rail to hang from the support cleat.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A cleat support for hanging a rub rail on a side wall surface of a vehicle includes a generally rectangular body having a wall-facing surface and a rail-facing surface. The body has a first body portion and a second body portion, and an offset surface disposed between the first body portion and the second body portion. The first body portion is non-planar with the second body portion. A first fastener receiving hole on the first body portion is for fastening the support cleat to the side wall surface of the vehicle. An engagement structure is disposed on the second body portion. The engagement structure is configured to engage and hang the rub rail from the engagement structure.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A method of assembling a rub rail assembly on a side wall surface of a vehicle includes the steps of attaching at least one support cleat to the side wall surface, and hanging the rub rail on the at least one support cleat, where the support cleat entirely supports the rub rail. The method also includes the step of fastening the rub rail to the side wall surface with a fastener.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, a rub rail assembly <b>10</b> includes a rub rail <b>12</b> and a support cleat <b>14</b> that are attachable to the side wall surface <b>4</b> of the bus or other vehicle <b>2</b>. While the rub rail assembly <b>10</b> will be explained with reference to use on the side wall surface <b>4</b> of a bus, it should be appreciated that the rub rail assembly <b>10</b> may be used in any vehicle or application where impacts or abrasions can occur.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The support cleat <b>14</b> may have a generally rectangular body <b>16</b> including a first edge <b>18</b>, a second edge <b>20</b> generally parallel to the first edge, a third edge <b>22</b> generally perpendicular to the first edge and the second edge, and a fourth edge <b>24</b> generally parallel to the third edge. The body <b>16</b> also includes a wall-facing surface <b>26</b> and a rail-facing surface <b>28</b> opposite the wall-facing surface. The support cleat <b>14</b> may be a stamped metal, although other materials are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The body <b>16</b> of the support cleat <b>14</b> includes a first body portion <b>30</b> that may be generally planar and is configured to be generally coextensive with the side wall surface <b>4</b> of the bus <b>2</b>. The first body portion <b>30</b> may have at least one first fastener receiving hole <b>32</b> for receiving a first fastener <b>34</b>. There may be two first fastener receiving holes <b>32</b> located in a spaced arrangement adjacent the third edge <b>22</b>, and may be located near the corner of the first edge <b>18</b> and the third edge <b>22</b>, and near the corner of the second edge <b>20</b> and the third edge. Other locations of the first fastener receiving holes <b>32</b> are possible. The first body portion <b>30</b> may also have at least one second fastener receiving hole <b>36</b> configured for receiving a second fastener <b>38</b>. There may be two second fastener receiving holes <b>36</b> located adjacent the first edge <b>18</b> and the second edge <b>20</b>, although other locations are possible. The second fastener receiving holes <b>36</b> in the support cleat <b>14</b> and side wall surface <b>4</b> accept the fastener <b>38</b> that supports the rub rail <b>12</b>. The second hole in the side wall surface <b>4</b> will be drilled after the first receiving holes <b>32</b> and is self-located by the support cleat <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The body <b>16</b> of the support cleat <b>14</b> also includes a second body portion <b>40</b> that is offset from the first body portion <b>30</b> such that the rail-facing surface <b>28</b> at the second body portion is not in the same plane as the rail-facing surface of the first body portion. An offset surface <b>42</b> separates the first body portion <b>30</b> from the second body portion <b>40</b>. The offset surface <b>42</b> may extend from the first edge <b>18</b> to the second edge <b>20</b>, and may be generally V-shaped, linear, angular, curved or any other configuration. The second fastener receiving holes <b>36</b> may be located closer to the offset surface <b>42</b> than the first fastener receiving holes <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">When the support cleat <b>14</b> is fastened to the side wall surface <b>4</b> with one or more first fasteners <b>34</b> through the one or more first fastener receiving holes <b>32</b>, the first body portion <b>30</b> is configured to engage or lay generally flush against the generally planar side wall surface, and the second body portion <b>40</b> may be spaced or offset from the side wall surface (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The second body portion <b>40</b> and the offset surface <b>42</b> extend from the first body portion <b>30</b> to form an engagement structure <b>44</b>, such as a cleat or projection, that receives the rub rail <b>12</b>. The side wall surface <b>4</b>, the offset surface <b>42</b> and the second body portion <b>40</b> define a receiving space <b>45</b> for receiving the rub rail <b>12</b> therein.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The rub rail <b>12</b> is generally elongate and is configured to extend along at least a portion of the length of the bus <b>2</b>. In cross-section (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), the rub rail <b>12</b> has a generally undulating shape with two generally outwardly extending ridges <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> separated by a generally inwardly extending channel <b>50</b>, although other shapes are possible. At a first edge <b>52</b> of the rub rail <b>12</b>, there is a skirt <b>54</b> that extends from the second ridge <b>46</b>. The second ridge <b>46</b> is generally convex, but may have a flattened or planar top surface <b>56</b>. Extending from the second ridge <b>46</b> is the inwardly extending channel <b>50</b>, which may have a generally flattened or planar bottom surface <b>58</b> that is configured to engage the rail-facing surface <b>28</b> of the first body portion <b>30</b> of the support cleat <b>14</b>. The channel <b>50</b> includes a third fastener receiving hole <b>60</b>. Extending from the channel <b>50</b> opposite from the second ridge <b>46</b> is the first ridge <b>48</b>. The first ridge <b>48</b> is generally convex, but may have a generally flattened or planar top surface <b>62</b>. It is possible that the first ridge <b>48</b> extends convexly outwardly a greater distance than the second ridge <b>46</b>, however other configurations are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A hook <b>64</b> extends from the first ridge <b>48</b> and engages with the engagement structure <b>44</b>. The hook <b>64</b> may have an interior surface <b>66</b> that is configured to engage with at least the fourth or top edge <b>24</b> or the wall-facing surface <b>26</b> of the second body portion <b>40</b>. Extending into the receiving space <b>45</b>, the hook <b>64</b> may also engage the side wall surface <b>4</b>. At least a portion of the hook <b>64</b> may be generally parallel with the bottom surface <b>58</b> of the channel <b>50</b>. From the top surface <b>62</b> of the first ridge <b>48</b>, and extending to an end <b>65</b> of the hook <b>64</b>, the rub rail may traverse 180-degrees and may curve inwardly towards the channel, however other configurations are also possible.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The hook <b>64</b> engages the engagement structure <b>44</b> in a configuration that allows the rub rail <b>12</b> to hang from the support cleat <b>14</b> without a clamp so that the manufacturer can insert the fasteners without an additional clamping step. The rub rail <b>12</b> is hung on the at least one support cleat <b>14</b> such that the support cleat entirely supports the rub rail. It is also possible that the hook <b>64</b> mechanically grips the second body portion <b>40</b> in such a configuration that obviates the need for the hook <b>64</b> to extend into a receiving space, but still allows the rub rail <b>12</b> to hang from the support cleat <b>14</b>. Once the rub rail <b>12</b> is hanging on the support cleats <b>14</b>, the third fastener receiving holes <b>60</b> in the rub rail will be self-aligned with the second fastener receiving holes <b>36</b> in the support cleat and the side wall surface <b>4</b> as the support cleats serve as locating fixture device for installation, which may save labor time.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the rub rail is generally elongate, and as such, the channel <b>50</b>, the first ridge <b>46</b> and the second ridge <b>48</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> may extend the entire length or substantially the length of the rub rail. The rub rail <b>12</b> may be a roll-formed metal or may be formed of other materials, or alternately may be formed of multiple components. The rub rail <b>12</b> may also have additional corrugations or ribs.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Starting at the first step shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the side wall surface <b>4</b> of the vehicle <b>2</b> has no rub rail assembly <b>10</b>. Referring to the second step shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, to install the rub rail assembly <b>10</b> onto the bus <b>2</b>, at least one support cleat <b>14</b> may be installed onto the side wall surface <b>4</b> using a template to ensure proper location along the side wall surface. The plurality of support cleats <b>14</b> are fastened to the side wall surface <b>4</b> through the first fastener receiving holes <b>32</b> using the first fasteners <b>34</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The first fasteners <b>32</b> may be Torx screws, however other types of fasteners are possible. This fastening process may be repeated along the length of the rub rail <b>12</b> at each support cleat <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The second fastener receiving holes <b>36</b> on the support cleat <b>14</b> can be used as a guide to match drill holes through the side wall surface <b>4</b> of the bus <b>2</b>. The bus <b>2</b> and attached support cleats <b>14</b> may then be painted at the third step shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">At the fourth step shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the rub rail <b>12</b> is hung on the at least one support cleat <b>14</b> by engaging the hook <b>64</b> onto the engagement structure <b>44</b> of the support cleat <b>14</b>. The rub rail <b>12</b> may be pre-painted before being hung on the support cleat <b>14</b>. The third fastener receiving hole <b>60</b> on the rub rail <b>12</b> is aligned with second fastener receiving hole <b>36</b> on the support cleat <b>14</b>, and the second fastener <b>38</b> is received in the third fastener receiving hole, in the second fastener receiving hole, and into the side wall surface <b>4</b>. This fastening process may be repeated along the length of the rub rail <b>12</b> at each support cleat <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The rub rail <b>12</b> can be pre-painted and the fasteners <b>34</b>, <b>38</b> can be pre-painted. With a pre-painted rub rail <b>12</b> and fasteners <b>34</b>, <b>38</b> attached to the side wall surface <b>4</b>, the bus <b>2</b> may only have to be masked one time while the bus is painted.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The rub rail assembly <b>10</b> may be attached to the side wall surface <b>4</b> of the bus at no more than 8-inches above the seat-cushion level (not shown), and may extend from the rear side of the entrance door (not shown) completely around the body (except at emergency or access doors), although other configurations are possible. There may be an additional rub rail assembly <b>10</b> above the floor line (not shown). Each rub rail <b>12</b> may have a width of about 4-inches or more, although other widths are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The rub rail assembly <b>10</b> allows the manufacturer to assemble the rub rail <b>12</b> onto the support cleat <b>14</b> without the need for a clamp and with minimal tools required by the user. The engagement structure <b>44</b> is configured to engage and hang the rub rail <b>12</b> from the engagement structure and line up the third fastener receiving holes <b>60</b> of the rub rail with the second fastener receiving holes <b>36</b> in the cleat support <b>14</b> and sidewall surface <b>4</b> for mounting of the rub rail, which may save time and use less manpower. Also, if the rub rails <b>12</b> are pre-painted at installation, an additional painting step is eliminated.</p>
