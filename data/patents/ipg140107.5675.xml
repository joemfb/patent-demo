<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to content accessed from a computing device, and, more particularly, but not exclusively to an apparatus and a method for enhancement of content accessed from a computing device, with selected queries.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Currently, a typical computer user downloads a variety of content items, such as articles on web sites such as Fox News, Wikipedia entries, Video clips, Computer games, etc., from the internet, on a daily basis.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In what follows, the computer user may engage on an associative information searching activity, in which the computer user chooses to further explore a certain subject discussed in the article, learn more about a person or phenomenon mentioned in the article, etc., by issuing a query on a webpage of a search engine service such as Yahoo&#xae; or Google&#xae;, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typically, in order to issue the query, the computer user opens a new session in the computer user's web browser (say a Microsoft&#xae; Explorer or Google&#xae; Chrome), and types one or more terms in a search box presented to the user on the webpage of the search engine.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The information searching activity is a manual, and often repetitive.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, the information searching activity may require some skill to determine keywords, phrases, and the like that will return optimally relevant results that the user may actually use.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Very often, keywords and phrases entered by a user with good intent, cause return of many links to information that is not relevant to what the user was actually searching for. Therefore much time is wasted sifting through data and refining and resubmitting keywords for additional searches.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present embodiments comprise an apparatus, method, and computer readable medium, for enhancing content with queries.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Currently, an enormous quantity of content is distributed over the internet through a variety of channels, say in many thousands of applications offered for sale or free distribution, on application distribution systems such as the Apple&#x2122; App Store or the Amazone&#x2122; App Store, on news web sites, in RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds etc.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Very often, when a computer user reads through a content item such as a report on a news web site, or watches a content item such as a YouTube&#x2122; video clip, the user wishes to search for more information on a certain person, story, place, etc., which appears in the content item, or for information that bears an associative connection to such information, in the user's mind.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">To find the information, the user typically opens one of the popular search engine web sites (say Google&#x2122; or Bing&#x2122;) in a separate page or session on his computer (say by opening a new session in a web browser such as Google&#x2122; Chrome or Microsoft&#xae; Internet Explorer).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Then, the user manually types a query in a search box available on the search engine web site and issues the query to the search engine, which in turn presents several results to the computer user.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Very often, at that stage, the user's attention is diverted to one of several results provided by the search engine, and the user closes the session in which the content item is presented, say by closing a specific application or a web page on which the content item is presented.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to exemplary embodiments of the present invention, a content item destined for a user of a computing device and received through a service implemented using an exemplary apparatus, as described in further detail hereinbelow, or directly on the user's device, is automatically enhanced with one or more queries.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Consequently, the queries may be presented to the computer user together with the content item (say by presenting the two, side by side, on a web page communicated to the computer user), thus potentially, providing the user with a personal content enrichment and increasing mobile application engagement.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to the exemplary embodiments, the enhancement is based on information which associates between previously presented content items and queries issued by the computer user, other computer users, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The association is based on context. Thus, a query may be associated with a specific content item previously presented to a computer user, if the computer user issues the query upon being presented the specific content item.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">For example, the information may associate a video interview with Ben Bernanke with queries issued by users in context of presentation of the video interview, say with a specific query for stock exchange data, a specific query on Bernanke's recent decisions or biographical data, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Optionally, upon receipt of a content item destined for the computer user, there are selected one or more of the queries associated with the content item destined for the computer user, for presentation with the received content item, as described in further detail hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Optionally, upon receipt of a content item destined for the computer user, there is found a linkage between the received content item and one or more of the previously presented content items.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The linkage may be based on a category (say &#x2018;Nature&#x2019;, &#x2018;Football&#x2019;, etc.) that both content items are classifiable to, on terms common to both contents items, on bibliographic data (say author or magazine name) similarity, etc., as described in further detail hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Then, there are selected one or more queries that the information associates with the previously presented content items having that linkage with the received content item, for presentation to the computer user that the received content item is destined for, as described in further detail hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">That is to say that a history of queries issued in context of content items presented to the user(s), serves as a basis to suggest queries to the user(s).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Consequently, queries previously issued in context of presentation of the content items, may be automatically put forward as recommendations to a computer user whenever a content item (new or already associated by the information) is later received on the user's computer.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">For each content item received on the user's computer (say cellular phone), the queries put forward as recommendations, may include queries that the information associates with the received content item, queries that the information associates with content items having a linkage to the received content item, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The later presented content item is thus enhanced with the previously issued queries.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one example, the selected queries are presented to the computer user together with the content item in a search box, and the computer user may select one of the queries for issuance, modify the query, etc., as described in further detail hereinbelow. Subsequently, the information which serves as a basis for the enhancement is enriched with new information which associates the presented content item with the query issued per the user's selection.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The principles and operation of a method and an apparatus according to the present invention may be better understood with reference to the drawings and accompanying description.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.</p>

<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In a second example, the linkage finder <b>230</b> finds all content items that have at least a predefined number terms in common with the received content item, to have the linkage with the received content item.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In a third example, the linkage finder <b>230</b> measures term based similarity between the received content item and one (or more) of the content items associated with the queries, as a part of finding the linkage between the two (or more) content items.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The similarity measurement may be based on digital information representation and retrieval methods, as known in the art. The methods include but are not limited to: asymmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence between language model representations of content items (say a set of terms of each content item), angles between vector representations (say the terms) of the content items, standard to area of information retrieval, etc, as known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Optionally, for finding the linkage, the linkage finder <b>230</b> uses parts of the data on the destined content item that directly link the destined content item to other content items. The parts may include bibliographical data, hyperlinks, or other parts that are added to the content item by the item's publisher, as known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In one example, the linkage finder <b>230</b> uses hyperlinks in a CNN web site article, that link the article to another CNN article, for finding the linkage, provided that the other article is an item previously presented to a subscriber of the cloud based service (as indicated by the information recorded by the information recorder <b>210</b>).</p>

Then, there are selected <b>340</b> a predefined number of highest ranked ones of the queries for the presentation, as described in further detail hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">That is to say that the queries may be ranked, by counting occurrences of one (or more) specific terms of each query associated with the content item destined for the computer user, in a population made of all the queries associated with the content item destined for the computer user, as described in further detail hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Optionally, as a part of the selection <b>340</b>, the queries are ranked according to a sum, an average, or any other score calculated by the query selector <b>140</b> using the count of the occurrences of the terms of each of the queries in the population of all the queries associated with the content item destined for the computer user.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Optionally, as a part of the selection <b>340</b>, any one of the queries that has less than a predefined number of terms in common with the received content item that is destined for the computer user, is filtered out, as described in further detail hereinabove.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Optionally, the selected <b>340</b> queries are presented together with the received content item, to the computer user that the content item is destined for, say by the query presenter of apparatus <b>1000</b>. For example, the selected <b>340</b> queries may be presented in a search box positioned aside the content item that is presented to the user, as described in further detail hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Optionally, the computer user is allowed to forward one or more of the presented queries, to an internet search engine such as Google&#xa9;, to a search engine internal to the apparatus <b>1000</b>, etc., say by the query forwarder of apparatus <b>1000</b>, as described in further detail hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Subsequently, the add-on may communicate new information which associates the presented content item with the query forwarded to the search engine, say to the information recorder <b>110</b> of apparatus <b>1000</b>. The information recorder <b>110</b> adds the new information to the information which associates previously issued queries with content items, as described in further detail hereinabove.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, which is a simplified flowchart illustrating a second method for enhancing content with queries, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">An exemplary method according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, may be implemented on a networked computer, such as a server computer in communication with multiple remote computing devices (say smart phones, tablet computers, or both), over the internet or another computer network.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">In one example, the method is implemented as a part of a web based content provisioning service (say a cloud based service) that multiple computer users (say smart phone or tablet computer users) subscribe to. Optionally, the users subscribe to the service by downloading an add-on (an accessory program that extends capabilities of an existing computer application) or another computer application to their computing device, as known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In the exemplary method, there is recorded <b>410</b> information on content items and queries previously issued by at least one computer user (say a subscriber of the cloud based service), say by the information recorder <b>210</b> of apparatus <b>2000</b>, as described in further detail hereinabove.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">The information associates each one of the previously issued queries with a respective at least one of the content items.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">The association is based on context. Thus, a query may be associated with a specific content item previously presented to a computer user, if the computer user issues the query upon being presented the specific content item.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Optionally, the computer user communicates with the apparatus <b>2000</b>, using an add-on utility for mobile phone applications, say the add-on used for subscribing to the cloud based service, as described in further detail hereinabove.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">When a content item (say a video or an article) is presented to the user, the user may choose to issue a query to an internet search engine like Google&#x2122;, against files on the user's own computer, etc., as described in further detail hereinabove. Consequently, the add-on communicates information on the query and the content item in context of which the query is issued, to the apparatus <b>2000</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Optionally, the communicated information is recorded <b>410</b> in a dedicated database. The recorded <b>410</b> information associates between the content item presented to the computer user and the query issued by the computer user in the context of the presented content item.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">For example, the information may associate a video interview with Ben Bernanke with queries previously issued by at least one user (say one or more of the subscribers), in context of presentation of the video interview, say with a query for specific stock exchange prices, a specific query on Bernanke's recent decisions, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Further, the recorded <b>410</b> information may be indexed according to a variety of criterions, say by user name, IP address, geographical area, time of day, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Later, there is received <b>420</b> data on a content item destined for a computer user.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">In one example, the content item destined for the user is a content item received on the user's smart phone on which the add-on in installed, and the add-on sends data on the received content item, to the content data receiver <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">The data may include, but is not limited to: the content item itself, a selected part of the content item, bibliographic data of the content item, origin of the content item, a list of terms that appear in the content item, etc., or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Upon receipt <b>420</b> of the data on the content item, the received <b>420</b> data is used to find <b>430</b> a linkage between the received content item and one or more of the content items that the recorded <b>410</b> information associates with the previously issued queries, say by the linkage finder <b>230</b>, as described in further detail hereinabove.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">The linkage may be based on one or more categories (say &#x2018;Nature&#x2019;, &#x2018;Football&#x2019;, etc.) that both content items are classifiable to, on terms common to both contents items, on bibliographic data (say author or magazine name) similarity between the content items, etc., or any combination thereof, as described in further detail hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">In a first example, the received content item is classified into a predefined category that a content item associated with one of the previously issued queries also belongs to, as a part of finding <b>430</b> the linkage, as described in further detail hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">In the example, a Judo Fight Video is classified into a category of &#x2018;Fighting Sports&#x2019; and thus found <b>430</b> to have a linkage to a Bruce Lee movie and a PDF version of a Kong-Fu book&#x2014;both classified into the same category of &#x2018;Fighting Sports&#x2019;.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Optionally, the classification of the received content item into the categories is based on a periodically learnt multi-label text classifier, such as the standard Na&#xef;ve Bayes classifier and extensions, K-nearest neighbor, etc., as known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">In a second example, all content items that have a predefined number of terms in common with the received content item, are found <b>430</b> to have the linkage with the received content item.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">In a third example, there is measured term based similarity between the received content item and one (or more) of the content items associated with the queries, as a part of finding <b>430</b> the linkage between the two (or more) content items.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">The similarity measurement may be based on digital information representation and retrieval methods, as known in the art. The methods include but are not limited to: asymmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence between language model representations of content items (say a set of terms of each content item), angles between vector representations (say the terms) of the content items, standard to area of information retrieval, etc, as known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Optionally, the finding <b>430</b> of the linkage involves use of parts of the data on the destined content item that directly link the destined content item to other content items. The parts may include bibliographical data, hyperlinks, or other parts that are added to the content item by the item's publisher, as known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">For example, an hyperlink in a web site article, that links the article to another one of the web site's articles, may be used for finding <b>430</b> the linkage, provided that the other article is an article previously presented to a subscriber of the cloud based service (and thus a content item that a part of the recorded <b>410</b> information pertains to).</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">Next, there are selected <b>440</b> one or more of the queries associated with the content items having the linkage with the received content item, for presentation to the computer user that the content item is destined for, say by the query selector <b>240</b>, as described in further detail hereinabove.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">Optionally, as a part of the selection, the queries associated with the content items having the linkage, are ranked according to popularity among a population of computer users, say according to a count of times in which each of the queries is issued by subscribers of the cloud based service.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">The popularity may be limited to a specific time frame (say the recent month or year) or not limited to a specific time frame. Then, there are selected <b>440</b> a predefined number of highest ranked ones of the queries for the presentation to the computer user that the content item is destined for, as described in further detail hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Optionally, as a part of the selection, the queries associated with the content items having the linkage, are ranked, according to usage by the computer user that the content item is destined for. The usage may pertain to a specific time frame (say the recent month or year) or rather be not limited to a specific time frame.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">In one example, the queries are ranked according to a number of times that the specific computer user issues the specific query in general, a number of times that the user issues the specific query when a specific content item associated with the query is presented to the specific user, etc., as described in further detail hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">Then, there are selected <b>440</b> a predefined number of highest ranked ones of the queries for the presentation, as described in further detail hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Optionally, as a part of the selection, the queries associated with the content items having the linkage, are ranked according to a count of occurrences of one (or more) terms of each one of the associated queries in all the associated queries.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">That is to say that the queries may be ranked, by counting occurrences of one (or more) specific terms of each query associated with the content items having the linkage, in a population made of all the queries associated with the content items having the linkage.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">The queries may be ranked according to a sum, an average, or any other score calculated (say by the query selector <b>240</b>) using the count of the occurrences of the terms of each of the queries associated with the content items having the linkage, in the population of all the queries associated with the content items having the linkage.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">Then, there are selected <b>440</b> a predefined number of highest ranked ones of the queries for the presentation, as described in further detail hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">Optionally, as a part of the selection, any one of the queries that has less than a predefined number of terms in common with the received content item destined for the computer user, is filtered out, as described in further detail hereinabove.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">Optionally, the selected <b>440</b> queries are presented together with the received content item, to the computer user that the content item is destined for, say by the query presenter of apparatus <b>2000</b>. For example, the selected <b>440</b> queries may be presented in a search box positioned aside the content item that is presented to the user, as described in further detail hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">Optionally, the computer user is allowed to forward one or more of the presented queries, to an internet search engine such as Google&#xa9;, to a search engine internal to the apparatus <b>2000</b>, etc., say by the query forwarder of apparatus <b>2000</b>, as described in further detail hereinbelow.</p>
