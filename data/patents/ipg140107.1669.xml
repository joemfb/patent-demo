<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to golf accessories. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a golf training device including a target tee having a ground anchor screw, interchangeable tee heads for providing different tee heights, and an adjustable alignment rod system for assisting golfers with stance, body, and club face alignment and golf ball positioning.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Golf is a popular sport played by amateurs and professionals alike. The game is typically played on a golf course having nine or eighteen holes where each hole is identified by a marker such as a flag pole. In many communities, golfers often become members of golf clubs that offer particular member services and amenities that cater to individual needs of players. Golf clubs utilize member fees to maintain the playing condition and functional attributes of the golf course. The object of the game is to drive a golf ball into each designated hole with the fewest strokes or shots possible. Each golf hole is assigned a particular stroke or shot definition according to golf rules and regulations. For example, par, birdie, and eagle are all terms that are associated with a particular number of strokes needed to drive a golf ball into a hole. Par is a name given to define a number of shots required to drive a golf ball into a hole. Par 3 means that the golf ball should be driven into a designated hole using only three shots. A birdie means that a golfer was able to drive a golf ball into a hole using one shot under par. The player with the lowest score, the least number of shots needed to make drive a golf ball into a set number of holes, is the winner.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A number of accessories are often used when playing golf. For example, golfers use golf shoes, and a wide variety of golf clubs, such as drivers, irons and putters, which are usually stored in a golf bag. The golf bag may include wheels for rolling the bag along the ground, or the bag may include a strap for carrying on an individual's shoulder. Other articles that are used include gloves and various articles of clothing designed to help shield the player from the sun such as a hat or visor.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One accessory that is often used by golfers is a standard golf tee. Commercial golf tees generally include a shaft having a conical bottom end for inserting into the ground, where the shaft terminates at the top into a shallow cup for holding a golf ball thereon. Golf tees are typically used when initially driving the golf ball from the driving area of the golf course, and also on driving ranges. Golf tees are designed to elevate golf balls off the ground a predetermined distance to provide golfers a heightened striking advantage without obstruction. For example, if a golf ball was simply disposed on the ground, a golfer would often impact the ground with the golf club before coming into contact with the golf ball, thereby hindering the impact force required to drive the golf ball forward. By elevating the golf ball, the path of impact is cleared from obstruction. The traditional golf tees are typically fabricated from wood or plastic and come in a variety of different colors. Golfers often carry golf tees in their pants or shirt pocket, or store them in golf bags.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional golf tees suffer from certain drawbacks. For example, upon impact of the golf club face with the ball, the golf tee typically flies out of the ground. The golf tee is thrown a distance away from the original setting forcing the golfer to locate the tee. The golfer must repeatedly bend over to reset the golf tee, and pick up a dislodged tee over and over again potentially leading to back pain as a result of strain on the individual's back. Some golf tees have been designed to include neon colors or light emitting diodes that visually assist golfers in locating the tee. However, such electronic golf tees often require battery replacement requiring golfers to service the devices. Still another drawback is that most conventional golf tees typically come in standard heights. If a golfer wishes to adjust the height of the ball from the ground, the individual must remove or insert the shaft of the tee from or into the ground to provide a desired height. If the golf tee is removed too far from the ground, the tee will wobble or sway. The prior art has attempted to address this issue by providing a golf tee having a rotationally adjustable unit and a base supporting unit. The height adjustable golf tee includes a plurality of screw threads used to make vertical adjustments. Such units are cumbersome to use, costly, and larger in size. Traditional golf tees are designed for one purpose only and that is to hold a golf ball in place. Such traditional golf tees are not designed to assist golfers in further developing their golfing skills and techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A large variety of training aids are available to help golfers develop their golfing skills and techniques. For example, one training aid includes alignment sticks that are designed to lie on the ground to provide a visual indication to golfers. One problem with such aids is that the alignment sticks cause golfers to misalign their bodies at a target rather than aligning the body parallel to the target. Aiming the toes and body at an intended target, such as a golf hole, can create an &#x201c;over the top&#x201d; downswing that can cause poor contact and side spin. Other training aids are complex to assemble, not portable, and time consuming to employ.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention overcomes the deficiencies of the known art and the problems that remain unsolved by providing a target tee that includes a screw like anchor, rubber friction dampening designed to withstand repeated strikes and automatically reset itself vertically after impact from a golf club, interchangeable tee heads for varying the height of golf balls, and adjustable alignment rod system for training golfers in further developing their golf skills and techniques.</p>

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">One embodiment of a target tee <b>100</b> is presented in various configurations in the illustrations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 7</figref>. Target tee <b>100</b> includes an anchoring system defined by a ground anchor <b>102</b> that is removably insertable into the ground <b>104</b>, a rotating disc <b>106</b>, an interchangeable tee head <b>108</b> that is detachably secured to the ground anchor <b>102</b> via, a rubber cord <b>126</b> to provide a resettable target tee for use in golf, and adjustable alignment rods <b>148</b> to assist golfers with stance and club face alignment. A second embodiment of a target tee <b>200</b> is presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> to include a rubber nipple <b>260</b> for frictionally holding a standard golf ball holder or tee <b>262</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Ground anchor <b>102</b> includes a shaft <b>110</b> having a helical member <b>112</b> extending partially downwards along the axial perimeter of the shaft <b>110</b> to provide a screw-like arrangement. Like a screw, the helical member <b>112</b> is designed to securely hold the target tee <b>100</b> firmly in place within the ground <b>104</b>. In one embodiment, shaft <b>110</b> includes a conical-shaped member having a tapered bottom end for easy entry into a surface and a wider top end for providing structural integrity when handling. A golfer may use a common golf shoe spike tool, making it easy for golfers to insert the target tee <b>100</b> into any type of turf whether hard or soft. An anchor base <b>114</b> is affixed to the top portion of shaft <b>110</b>. Anchor base <b>114</b> includes a hollowed region <b>115</b> adapted for partially receiving a bushing <b>116</b> and a bottom end <b>132</b> of a rubber cord <b>126</b>. A plurality of upwardly extending posts <b>118</b> is disposed on the outer surface of the anchor base <b>114</b>. It will be understood that the ground anchor system <b>102</b> may be fabricated or molded as a single piece from a variety of different materials such as polymer plastics, ceramic, wood, aluminum, or other rust-proof material that able to withstand wear and tear due to use and exposure to the elements. Thus, to help reduce costs and assembly, the shaft <b>110</b>, helical member <b>112</b>, anchor base <b>114</b> and posts <b>118</b> may be fabricated or molded as one unit. Well-known injection molding techniques may be used to construct the device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Target tee <b>100</b> further includes a rotating disc <b>106</b> having a central hole <b>120</b> slightly diametrically larger in size than bushing <b>116</b>. In assembly, rotating disc <b>106</b> is coupled to anchor base <b>114</b> with bushing <b>116</b> extending through the central hole <b>120</b> of disc <b>106</b>. Bushing <b>116</b> provides rotating engagement with disc <b>106</b> allowing disc <b>106</b> to rotate freely. Hole <b>120</b> is diametrically sized to fit snug over bushing <b>116</b> preventing the rotating disc <b>106</b> from swaying back and forth during rotation. It is contemplated that bushing <b>116</b> be replaced with a bearing, rolling bearing, or include a ball bearings to reduce frictional engagement with rotating disc <b>106</b> to allow the disc <b>106</b> to rotate more freely.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Rotating disc <b>106</b> includes a plurality of slots <b>122</b> formed within the body of the disc <b>106</b> along the outer edge. Each slot <b>122</b> is configured to receive a corresponding post <b>118</b> there through. Posts <b>118</b> aid in coupling and aligning the rotating disc <b>106</b> onto anchor base <b>114</b>, and also serve to limit the rotating angle of disc <b>106</b>, as described further below. Posts <b>118</b> may include nubs, detents, clips or the like to help retain the rotating disc <b>106</b> onto anchor base <b>114</b>. Rotating disc <b>106</b> further includes a plurality of threaded holes <b>124</b> formed axially within the body of the disc <b>106</b>. Each threaded hole <b>124</b> is dimensioned to receive a threaded end <b>140</b> of an alignment rod <b>148</b> which is described in greater detail below. The rotating disc <b>106</b> and busing <b>116</b> may be fabricated from a variety of different materials such as polymer plastics, ceramic, wood, aluminum, brass, or other rust-proof material. The material should be selected to withstand continuous impact by a golf club.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Rotating disc <b>106</b> and anchor base <b>114</b> may comprise any diametrical shape and size that is selected to provide optimum performance and easy handling during use. In one non-limiting example, rotating disc <b>106</b> may be &#xbc; inch thick to &#xbd; inch thick, and comprise a diameter that is &#xbd; inch to 2 inches. In a preferred embodiment, the diametrical sizes are selected to provide a small yet durable device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, target tee <b>100</b> also includes a flexible, rubber cord <b>126</b> having a cord shaft <b>128</b> and a top member <b>130</b> and a bottom member <b>132</b> disposed on opposite ends of the cord shaft <b>128</b>. The rubber cord <b>126</b> acts as a tension cord that prevents an interchangeable tee head <b>108</b> from flying off or breaking upon impact with the face of a golf club. The rubber cord <b>126</b> provides rubber friction dampening, and allows tee target <b>100</b> to automatically reset the tee head <b>108</b> upon subsequent impacts. Rubber cord <b>126</b> is designed to extend through central hole <b>120</b> of rotating disc <b>106</b>, and also through bushing <b>116</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, rubber cord <b>126</b> extends through the central hole <b>120</b> of disc <b>106</b>, and bushing <b>116</b> such that the enlarged bottom member <b>132</b>, of the rubber cord <b>126</b>, is trapped underneath the bushing <b>116</b> to rest within the hollow region <b>115</b> of anchor base <b>114</b>. The enlarged top member <b>130</b> of the rubber cord <b>126</b> is configured to be inserted within the interchangeable tee head <b>108</b> to hold the interchangeable tea head <b>108</b> in place.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Target tee <b>100</b> includes interchangeable tees <b>108</b> of varying heights. Each interchangeable tee <b>108</b> includes a plurality of longitudinal slots <b>134</b> formed within the body of the tee defining a plurality of resilient arms <b>136</b> that are joined together at a bottom end <b>139</b> and forming an elongated tee orifice having a tee opening <b>138</b>. The resilient arms <b>136</b> are configured to open outwardly to define a golf ball support. In one embodiment of the present invention, each resilient arm <b>136</b> includes an outwardly curved top segment to hold a larger surface area of a golf ball. Each curved top segment may be beveled to freely receive the curvature formation of a golf ball when a ball positioned on the tee <b>108</b>. Alternatively, a friction material may be implemented to frictionally engage with the outer surface of the golf ball to better receive the golf ball without restricting the releasing performance of the golf ball when the ball is stricken by the head of a golf club.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Each interchangeable tee head <b>108</b> includes a tee hole <b>140</b> that is formed through the tee bottom <b>139</b> and axially aligned with the elongated orifice, as better illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Tee hole <b>140</b> is smaller in diametrical size than the elongated orifice resulting in a cord stop <b>142</b> for receiving the top enlarged member <b>130</b> of rubber cord <b>126</b>. The top member <b>130</b> rests on the cord stop <b>142</b> when inserted within tee <b>108</b>, as better illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The rubber cord <b>126</b> of the present invention provides the benefit of retaining interchangeable tee heads to the anchor system <b>102</b>, provides a friction damping system that prevents tee head <b>108</b> from flying off or breaking upon impact with the face of a golf club, and forces the tee head <b>108</b> to retract to its original position on subsequent impacts.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In assembling target tee <b>100</b>, bushing <b>116</b> is inserted within hollow region <b>115</b> of anchor base <b>114</b>, and rotating disc <b>106</b> is inserted onto anchor base <b>114</b> so that bushing <b>116</b> extends through central hole <b>120</b>. Posts <b>118</b> extend through slots <b>122</b> to limit the rotation of the disc <b>106</b>. Rubber cord <b>126</b> is inserted through central hole <b>120</b>, of disc <b>106</b>, and bushing <b>116</b> such that the bottom enlarged member <b>132</b> of rubber cord <b>126</b> engages against the underneath of bushing <b>116</b> and rests within the hollow region <b>115</b> of anchor base <b>114</b>. The top enlarged member <b>130</b> of the rubber cord <b>126</b> is inserted in the top opening <b>138</b> of the tee head <b>108</b> and the shaft <b>128</b> slides within a longitudinal slot <b>134</b> such that the top member <b>130</b> comes to rest on the cord stop <b>142</b> to pivotally hold interchangeable tee head <b>108</b> onto anchor system <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, target tee <b>100</b> can be firmly inserted into the ground <b>104</b> and ready for use, in accordance with the present invention. As noted earlier, a golfer may utilize a common golf shoe spike tool, if desired, to insert the target tee <b>100</b> into the ground <b>104</b> or can simply rotate the tee <b>100</b> by hand like a screw. The helical member <b>112</b> rotates within the ground <b>104</b> to secure the target tee <b>100</b> in place. When fully inserted within the ground <b>104</b>, the underside of anchor base <b>114</b> rests flat on the ground surface. It will be noted that one or more spikes (not shown) may be included on the underside of the anchor base <b>114</b> to further secure the target tee <b>100</b> in place, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Advantageously, target tee <b>100</b> includes a plurality of interchangeable tee heads <b>108</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> designed to provide golfers with ultimate control over tee heights. In the preferred embodiment, each tee head <b>108</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> comprise a different height allowing golfers to set golf balls above the ground at various heights. Each tee head <b>108</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> includes a longitudinal slot <b>134</b> for receiving the shaft <b>128</b> of rubber cord <b>126</b> to attach the tee head <b>108</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> securely to the anchor.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Users must insert traditional golf tees into the ground at various depths in order to provide for adjustable heights making inconvenient and impractical. For example, setting a traditional golf tee higher from the ground compromises the stability of the tee to firmly hold a golf ball in place. The present invention allows target tee <b>100</b> to remain firmly in place, while allowing users to interchange tee heads <b>108</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>. Further, the height of the tee head <b>108</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> remains consistent over repeated use. Conventional golf tees do not provide consistent height over repeated use. It is difficult to replace traditional golf tees at the exact depth each time to provide a consistent height.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, there is shown a front cross-sectional view of the target tee <b>100</b> taken along the A-A line as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The top enlarged member <b>130</b> of the rubber cord <b>126</b> is initially inserted within tee opening <b>138</b> such that shaft <b>128</b>, of the cord <b>126</b>, fits within a longitudinal slot <b>134</b>, better illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, to allow the top member <b>130</b> to come to rest on cord stop <b>142</b>. The bottom enlarged member <b>132</b>, of rubber cord <b>126</b>, butts against the underside of bushing <b>116</b> and rests within hollow region <b>115</b> of anchor base <b>114</b>. Tee bottom <b>139</b> rests within bushing <b>116</b> with posts <b>118</b> extending through slots <b>122</b> of rotating disc <b>106</b>. As seen, the length of resilient arms <b>136</b> of each tee head <b>108</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> differ from one another to provide golf tee heads <b>108</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> having different heights. Target tee <b>100</b> permits users to easily replace, remove or interchange tee heads <b>108</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> with ease.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">With reference now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, there are shown perspective views of the target tee <b>100</b> including an alignment system designed to assist golfers with stance, positioning of shoulders and toes, and club face alignment relative to the position of a golf ball and target location. The alignment system includes a plurality of alignment rods <b>148</b>, each including a threaded end for removable attachment to threaded holes <b>124</b> of the rotating disc <b>106</b>. In one non-limiting example, alignment rods <b>148</b> may comprise 5 inches in length, though other lengths may be implemented as well. Additional alignment rods <b>148</b> can be connected to each other via, attachments to increase the length of rods <b>148</b>, if desired. Also, path rods <b>150</b> may be added to one or more alignment rods <b>148</b>, via coupling <b>152</b>. The alignment rod system provides options to a golfer for aligning the user's toes and shoulders correctly relative to the position of the golf ball. Alignment rods <b>148</b> can be rotated left or right to change location of an intended target without moving the golf training device <b>100</b> from place to place. As better illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, posts <b>118</b> extend through slots <b>122</b> to limit the rotation of rotating disc <b>106</b> and positioning of alignment rods <b>148</b>. Alignment rods <b>148</b> provide a visual indication to assist golfers in perfecting their stance and body alignment, provides golf club face alignment, and proper ball positioning.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">When fully implemented, a golfer using the target tee <b>100</b> will have an anchored base with friction resistant, interchangeable tee heads <b>108</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, and the availability of training alignment rods <b>148</b> for use with drivers, fairways woods, and hybrid clubs. In exemplary use, when a golfer wishes to use an iron and is ready to hit golf balls, the user can place a golf ball on the grass and secure target tee <b>100</b> between the golf ball and golfer's toes. A desired tee height can be quickly selected by choosing one of the interchangeable tee heads <b>108</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> and attaching the tee head to base anchor <b>114</b>, via rubber cord <b>126</b>. Alignment rods <b>148</b> can be implemented to help align a user's toes, shoulders, hips and club face to an intended target. Rotating disc <b>106</b> can be rotated with ease to change the positioning of the golfer when moving from one target to another.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, target tee <b>100</b> provides an optional use of a T-shaped adaptor <b>154</b>. The T-shaped adaptor <b>154</b> comprises a first leg <b>156</b> integrally formed with and perpendicular to a second leg <b>158</b>. The distal ends of the first leg <b>156</b> each include a threaded bore adapted to threadably receive the threaded ends of alignment rods <b>148</b> therein. The distal end of the second leg <b>158</b> is also threaded to allow the T-shaped adaptor <b>154</b> to be releasably connected to any one of the threaded holes <b>124</b> provided within the body of rotating disc <b>106</b>. In use, adaptor <b>154</b> displaces alignment rods <b>148</b> away from rotating disc <b>106</b> a predetermined distance. As contemplated, the distance is defined by the length of the second leg <b>158</b> of the adaptor <b>154</b>. Adaptor <b>154</b> serves two main purposes. First, adaptor <b>154</b> allows a golfer to place the cross section of the adaptor <b>154</b> out from under the club head starting position. Some golfers prefer to hover or maneuver a golf club head over the ground before swinging, while preparing. Yet other golfers prefer to swing without first hovering. Adaptor <b>154</b> is designed for those golfers that prefer to swing immediately the ball without first hovering the golf club head. Adaptor <b>154</b> is also useable on putting greens. For example, a popular putting technique in golf includes a method known as &#x201c;straight back&#x201d;, or &#x201c;straight through&#x201d;. This method is generally when a golfer moves a golf putter along a straight line back and then forward through impact. When implemented, adaptor <b>154</b> acts as a visual guide allowing the golfer to place the golf club head underneath an attached alignment rod <b>148</b> to provide a visual indication of a straight stroke path. Thus, a golfer may use target tee <b>100</b> along with adaptor <b>154</b> to help align and improve putting shots. This is easily accomplished by inserting the target tee <b>100</b> into a putting green a slight depth, and releasably threading adaptor <b>154</b> into rotating disc <b>106</b>, via threaded holes <b>124</b>. Alignment rods <b>148</b> can be attached to the distal ends of the first leg <b>156</b> of the adaptor <b>154</b> to provide an aligned visual indicator that is raised a few inches above the ground. The raised alignment rods <b>148</b> act as an alignment aid to also perfect putting skills.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">A perspective view of a target tee <b>200</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in accordance with an alternative embodiment of the present invention. Target tee <b>200</b> includes the same features, structures, elements, shapes, and dimensions as that of the embodiment of target tee <b>100</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 7</figref>, with the exception of a rubber nipple <b>260</b> and traditional golf ball holder or tee <b>262</b>. Rubber nipple <b>260</b> is designed for frictionally holding a standard golf ball holder <b>262</b> therein. The rubber nipple <b>260</b> acts similar to rubber cord <b>126</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in that the nipple <b>260</b> provides friction dampening allowing holder <b>262</b> to pivot when struck with the face of a golf club. Target tee <b>200</b> provides a benefit of using traditional golf ball holders <b>262</b> while providing an automatic resettable golf tee. Golf ball holder <b>262</b> can be easily inserted into the rubber nipple <b>260</b> with ease. In one exemplary embodiment, rubber nipple <b>260</b> may include frictional ridges, grooves or dimples that are formed within the interior surface of the nipple <b>260</b> to increase the frictional grip of the standard golf ball holder <b>262</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The present invention may include alternative embodiments. For example, the conical shaped shaft <b>102</b> and helical member <b>112</b> of the present invention may be replaced with a spike or spike base configuration. The spike base could house standard rubber golf tees, and alignment rods. The geometrical shapes and sizes of the interchangeable tee heads <b>108</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, rotating disc <b>106</b>, and anchor system <b>102</b>, and the materials used to fabricate such parts are preferably selected to enhance the structural and functional integrity of the target tee <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> of the present invention. Adapter <b>154</b> may include a separate base stand (not shown) that may be connected to the spike base (not shown) forming a free standing unit designed to couple with alignment rods.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The present invention provides a target tee <b>100</b> that includes friction dampening to prevent a tee head <b>108</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> from flying off when struck by a golf club, provides an automatic tee where the tee head <b>108</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> returns upright in a vertical direction in preparation for another strike, includes an alignment rod system that provides visual indication and guidance for proper body alignment, and includes interchangeable tee heads <b>108</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> to provide different tee heights. The present invention eliminates the need for golfers to continuously bend over to reposition golf tees after hitting a golf ball, and provides a golf tee that is simple and easy to use.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The present invention provides for a recessed tip of the rubber nipple <b>260</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. A circular ring to determine the depth of insertion into rotating disk <b>206</b>, and a conical bottom to fit snuggly into the anchor base.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Since many modifications, variations, and changes in detail can be made to the described preferred embodiments of the invention, it is intended that all matters in the foregoing description and shown in the accompanying drawings be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense. Thus, the scope of the invention should be determined by the appended claims and their legal equivalence.</p>
