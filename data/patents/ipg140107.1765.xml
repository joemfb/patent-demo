<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is related to a cardiac assist system having a transseptal cannula that extends through the atrial septum from the right atrium to the left atrium of the patient and a perfusion cannula that extends into the arterial system of the patient for circulating oxygenated blood throughout the patient. More specifically, the present invention is related to an extracorporeal blood pump, connected to the transseptal cannula at the pump inlet and the perfusion cannula at the pump outlet, that pumps blood at specified flow rates over a range of physiological pressure and is held in place on the patient's leg.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For short term (hours to days) use in supporting significant circulation (1-3.5 LPM) of oxygenated blood, there is a need for simple equipment in a hospital that can be quickly connected to the patient without surgical intervention and that can provide bypass blood flow to the patient. The present invention provides a quick and relatively simple way of operation to assist the heart without an open-chest surgery.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention pertains to a system supporting circulation of oxygenated blood. The system comprises a transseptal cannula set adapted to be inserted percutaneously in the femoral vein and extend through the atrial septum from right atrium to left atrium, a blood pump mechanism, connected to the transseptal cannula through the pump inlet and controlled by an external microprocessor based blood pump controller, for pumping blood received from the patient's heart, a perfusion cannula adapted to be inserted percutaneously in the femoral artery and connected to the pump outlet for returning oxygenated blood to the arterial system of the patient. The cannula set consists of a cannula, a catheter, and a dilator. The catheter and dilator are used for insertion of the cannula.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention pertains to a method and a process for assisting a patient's heart. The method comprises a step of inserting a transseptal cannula percutaneously in the femoral vein of the patient and extending through the atrial septum from the right atrium to the left atrium. Next there is a step of inserting a perfusion cannula percutaneously in the femoral artery for returning oxygenated blood to the arterial system of the patient. Next is preferably a step of connecting the two cannulae to the pump. Then there is a step of pumping blood with a blood pump connected to the transseptal cannula and the perfusion cannula at specified flow rates over a range of physiological pressures. This step preferably includes control of the pump and monitoring of the control system and pump by an external pump controller in such a manner as to detect, manage, and alert the user to the applicable potential system faults without dedicated human monitoring.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, the system of the present invention can be used to quickly access or redistribute a patient's blood to a certain destination in a patient's body by changing appropriate sizes of cannulae connected to the pump inlet and outlet.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring now to the drawings wherein like reference numerals refer to similar or identical parts throughout the several views, and more specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> thereof, there is shown a system <b>300</b> for assisting flow of blood by a patient's heart. The system <b>300</b> comprises a transseptal cannula <b>12</b> adapted to be inserted percutaneously in the femoral vein and extend through the atrial septum from the right atrium to the left atrium. The system <b>300</b> comprises a perfusion cannula <b>100</b> adapted to be inserted percutaneously in the femoral artery. The system <b>300</b> comprises a blood pump mechanism <b>30</b> having a blood pump <b>316</b> (driven by a brushless DC motor), connected to the transseptal cannula <b>12</b> at the pump inlet, for pumping oxygenated blood received from the left atrium through the transseptal cannula <b>12</b> and returning the blood to the arterial system of the patient through the perfusion cannula <b>100</b> connected to the blood pump <b>316</b> at the pump outlet. The blood pump <b>316</b> is controlled by a controller <b>332</b> that monitors key system operating parameters to detect and manage faults and to alert operators.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Fault tolerance of the system is offered by providing redundant mechanisms for pump operation and for monitoring functions. Pump operation must propel blood at sufficient flow rates (1-3.5 LPM) without destroying red blood cells, without causing clotting of the blood, without causing immune system or other bio compatibility compromise or reaction, and must locate and center themselves without offering a wear surface that can cause blood damage or clotting over time or can cause variable power loss over time, as power loss is used as a performance monitor. Reliable operation must be maintained even through a wide variety of system, component, or human faults.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The AB-180 XC System, as it is referred to, offers atraumatic contact with red blood cells by virtue of the smooth surface finishes of the blood contacting surfaces, the gradual radiuses of the impeller, and does not allow locations for stagnant blood to accumulate and form clots. In addition to these smooth geometries, it is designed to be placed within 3 feet of the blood egress from the body, as the small amount of artificial material minimizes complications. To provide further resistance to thrombus formation, an anti-coagulant is infused directly into the blood chamber of the pump, where concentration of anti-coagulant is high enough to deter clotting. But since the pump volume is small, the amount of infused anti-coagulant is small enough to achieve minimal effect on systemic concentration of anti-coagulant when the blood flowing out of the pump is disbursed throughout the body. This is important, as the anti-coagulant concentration throughout the body is then small enough to prevent additional risk of internal bleeding elsewhere in the patient. Clots can also form when blood flow drops to low rates (&#x3c;0.5 LPM), which can happen if the transseptal cannula becomes clogged or kinked, if the patient bleeds internally, or if a cannula becomes dislodged. Any of these events cause an alarm condition from the reduced blood flow.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Pump wear is a major issue with blood pumps, as any wear can cause blood damage and/or clotting. The infusion system used to infuse anti-coagulant into the blood chamber also performs a useful bearing function. While the main bearing function, or centering and locating of the rotating part of the pump, is performed by the interaction of the stator and rotor electromagnetic interactions, the rotating impeller is also centered by a) the impeller/seal sliding contact and b) the fluid film and fluid lift pads in the motor chamber. Whenever the rotor becomes out of center, the fluid film prevents rotor and stator contact, thus providing fault tolerance of the electromagnetics. In the motor chamber, the fluid film is propelled radially as the rotor rotates. As lift pads are encountered in the lower chamber surface, fluid is propelled axially into the surface of the rotor, thus &#x2018;lifting&#x2019; it away from the stator surface, where contact would cause wear. This fluid is pumped by a constant flow pump, which provides a stable flow of infusate into the lower chamber. This constant flow builds pressure in the lower chamber, and as this pressure exceeds the pressure across the seal in the upper, or blood flow chamber, the infusate is pressed through the seal and into the blood chamber, where the anti-coagulation prevents clotting. The infusate fluid thus provides a third bearing mechanism and a cooling mechanism for the seal/rotor contact area. Loss of infusate flow can then be used as an indicator of a fault in the bearing system, which can then allow a user alarm to correct the infusate system or the pump bearing system prior to any patient injury. The mechanism of the determination of infusate flow is described elsewhere.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Another mechanism for system fault is the presence of air in the system, which can happen in some circuits when the pressure is reduced to dangerous levels. This can occur in larger pumps or in longer and smaller cannula, which involve more pressure drop. The pump design, by its small size, prevents any such cavitation by means of low pressure. The mechanism of connections between the components prevents any injection of air into these joints, which can occur with the negative pressure associated with high pressure drop and long, small diameter cannulae. Without this mechanism of connection, and by connecting arbitrary components, dangerous pressures can result and can cause cavitation and/or air injection at the connection joints.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The flow characteristics of the Pump over a range of conditions, performed with perfusate at the viscosity of 3.5 cP (35% Glycerol+65% Saline @23&#xb0; C.) is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref><i>a</i>. The flow rates represent the relationship, between RPM and the pressure differential between the inflow port and the outflow port. An estimated flow rate can be determined by using this chart, the RPM of the Pump and the pressure differential of the inlet to outlet ports. The pressure drop characteristics of the transseptal cannula are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref><i>b</i>, with the box indicating the limits as specified with the AB-180 pump. The key issue is that the low pressure rise of the pump, in combination with the pressure drop of the cannula, does not allow any point in the circuit to obtain pressures lower than &#x2212;350 mmHg, which is the point at which gases can be removed from the blood solution. Including the flow characteristics of the pump, the transseptal cannula, and the possible sizes of perfusion cannulae, the vacuum pressure created at the pump inlet can be solved at different pump speeds as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref><i>c</i>. Since the pump inlet pressure is always higher than &#x2212;350 mmHg, cavitation will not happen in the system over the recommended flow range against physiologic pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">All electrical control functions are redundant to provide enhanced reliability. And alarms are used to notify operators of potentially unsafe conditions rather than to stop the pump until replacement of control is maintained. All power systems are duplicated, and all control systems are watch-dogged to warn of failures of standby monitor functions. Without these failsafe operations, tolerance of system, component, or human faults could not be offered.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Preferably, the blood pump mechanism <b>30</b> includes a transseptal clamp mechanism <b>322</b> which clamps the blood pump <b>316</b> to the transseptal cannula <b>12</b> to avoid undesired disconnection of the blood pump <b>316</b> and the transseptal cannula <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>.

The second catheter <b>60</b> is maintained in position while the guide wire <b>30</b> is maintained in place in the left atrium. The cannula <b>12</b> is then advanced forward into the left atrium along the guide wire <b>30</b> and the second catheter <b>60</b> which extend through the orifice <b>18</b>. The presence of the second catheter <b>60</b> acts as a stiffener for the cannula <b>12</b> to assist in the placement of the cannula <b>12</b> in the left atrium. The second catheter <b>60</b>, needle <b>58</b> and guide wire <b>30</b> are then removed from the cannula.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Preferably, the transseptal cannula <b>12</b> connection step includes the step of connecting the transseptal cannula <b>12</b> to the tubing <b>324</b> connected to the blood pump <b>316</b>. Preferably, prior to clamping the clamping mechanism <b>322</b> to connect the tubing <b>324</b> to the transseptal cannula <b>12</b>, there are preferably the steps of filling the transseptal cannula <b>12</b> with blood and confirming proper transseptal cannula <b>12</b> position by visualizing blood color, as is well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">It should be noted that the aforementioned procedure can be performed without the introducer catheter. Instead, the second catheter <b>60</b> acts with a dual purpose, as the introducer catheter and the second catheter <b>60</b>. In this case, the needle <b>58</b> and guide wire <b>30</b> are together inserted in the second catheter <b>60</b>, and the introducer catheter is not present. When the second catheter <b>60</b> and needle <b>58</b> puncture the septum and move into the left atrium, the second catheter <b>60</b> remains in place and the guide wire <b>30</b> and the needle <b>58</b> are removed to clear a blood flow passage through the second catheter <b>60</b>. This apparatus of second catheter <b>60</b>, guide wire <b>30</b> and needle <b>58</b>, without any of the other features described herein on the cannula <b>12</b>, or with some or all of them, in and of itself can be used to access the left atrium. Again, the advantage of the combination of elements, is that it can serve to access the left atrium without having to take turns pulling the guide wire <b>30</b> out and then inserting the needle <b>58</b> into the second catheter <b>60</b> since the guide wire <b>30</b> and the needle <b>58</b> are together present in the second catheter <b>60</b> simultaneously; and the second catheter <b>60</b> serves a dual purpose of being the introducer catheter and second catheter <b>60</b>, without needing the introducer catheter. Alternatively, the needle can be inserted into the second catheter <b>60</b> after the second catheter has reached the right atrium.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">During the process of moving the cannula <b>12</b> to the right atrium, removing the guide wire <b>30</b> from the orifice <b>18</b> and extending the needle through the orifice <b>18</b>, an imaging device, external to the patient is imaging the location of the orifice <b>18</b> (and during the entire procedure) by noting where an end marker <b>34</b>, disposed about the orifice <b>18</b>, is located in the patient. Such an imaging system, for instance with the end marker <b>34</b> being radio opaque, is well known in the art. If it is desired, the guide wire <b>30</b> or a portion thereof, such as the tip of the guide wire <b>30</b>, and/or the needle <b>58</b> or a portion thereof, such as the tip of the needle <b>58</b>, can also be enhanced for imaging purposes, for example by having a radio opaque material, so the guide wire <b>30</b> and needle <b>58</b> can also be followed as they move through the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Once the orifice <b>18</b> is positioned in the left atrium and the port <b>20</b> of the cannula <b>12</b> is positioned in the right atrium, a balloon <b>52</b> disposed adjacent the orifice <b>18</b> is inflated with saline, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which travels along an inflation tube <b>54</b> that runs the length of the cannula <b>12</b> along the outside of the cannula <b>12</b> to a saline supply <b>87</b> disposed outside of the patient. The inflated balloon <b>52</b> serves to prevent the distal end <b>14</b> of the cannula from puncturing an atrium wall <b>50</b> of the left atrium where the distal end <b>14</b> of the cannula is now disposed, for instance when the patient is being turned or moved. The inflated balloon <b>52</b> also serves to prevent the cannula <b>12</b> from slipping back into the right atrium at undesired times, such as when the patient is being turned or moved about. The balloon <b>52</b> can be deflated by removing the saline that has been introduced into it through the inflation tube <b>54</b>, back out of the inflation tube <b>54</b> with negative pressure applied to the end of the inflation tube <b>54</b> extending externally from the patient. In another embodiment of a balloon <b>52</b> with the cannula <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the balloon <b>52</b> is disposed at the distal end <b>14</b> of the cannula <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Alternatively, a pigtail cannula <b>78</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, can be used which has its distal end curling about. As long as a straightening dilator <b>80</b> or needle <b>58</b> is present in the pigtail cannula <b>78</b>, the pigtail cannula <b>78</b> is straight, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. As soon as the dilator <b>80</b> is removed, the pigtail cannula's distal end curls about to achieve the same results as the inflated balloon <b>52</b>. See U.S. Pat. No. 5,190,528 titled &#x201c;Percutaneous Transseptal Left Atrial Cannulation System&#x201d; by James D. Fonger et al. and PCT patent application number PCT/US00/13601, incorporated by reference herein, for further information about a transseptal cannula and its use.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Alternatively, a transseptal sheath <b>82</b> positioned about the cannula <b>12</b> can be used, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. When the transseptal sheath <b>82</b> is in a closed position, it covers over the port <b>20</b> so no blood can pass through the port <b>20</b>. When the transseptal sheath <b>82</b> is in an open position, meaning it has been retracted by being pulled on from outside the patient, the transseptal sheath <b>82</b> has moved away from the distal end <b>14</b> exposing the port <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The extent the transseptal sheath <b>82</b> has been retracted determines how much of the port <b>20</b> is exposed. The transseptal sheath <b>82</b> can also have a marker at its end, and the cannula <b>12</b> can have gradations which are marked to identify where the end of the transseptal sheath <b>82</b> is relative to the cannula <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Holes <b>32</b> having an elongate shape and disposed essentially in parallel with the axis of the cannula <b>12</b> and between the orifice <b>18</b> and the port <b>20</b> further facilitates movement of blood into and out of the cannula <b>12</b>. The elongate shape of the holes <b>32</b> minimizes damage to the cellular structure of the blood cells as they pass through the holes <b>32</b>. Furthermore, all openings, such as the orifice <b>18</b> and the port <b>20</b>, are made as smooth as possible and are made of bio-inert materials such as plastic or steel to minimize or preclude the clotting of blood. In this way, access to the left and right atriums of the patient is achieved for whatever purpose, such as the attachment of a pump to the cannula <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The perfusion cannula <b>100</b> connected to the pump mechanism <b>30</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, is inserted into the femoral artery of a patient so the distal end <b>116</b> of the tube <b>112</b> of the perfusion cannula <b>100</b> is disposed in the femoral artery, as is well known in the art. See U.S. Pat. No. 5,330,433 titled &#x201c;A Bidirectional Femoral Arterial Cannula&#x201d; by James D. Fonger et al. and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/400,800, incorporated by reference herein, for further discussions and use of a perfusion cannula.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Preferably, the perfusion cannula <b>100</b> connection step includes the step of connecting the perfusion cannula <b>100</b> to the tubing <b>324</b> connected to the blood pump <b>316</b>. Preferably, the connection step includes the step of priming the perfusion cannula <b>100</b>. Preferably, prior to clamping the clamping mechanism <b>322</b> to connect the tubing <b>324</b> to the perfusion cannula <b>100</b>, there is the step of filling the perfusion cannula <b>100</b> with oxygenated blood.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Selecting the size of perfusion cannula depends on patient's body size. A bigger size of perfusion cannula can allow higher blood flow rate and thus unloading the patient's heart better. However, if the perfusion cannula size is too big, the cannula may block the blood stream through patient's leg. It is desirable to choose an appropriate perfusion cannula size such that the total blood flow rate through the cannula between 1 and 4 L/min, preferably 1 to 3.5 L/min. In addition, the blood stream through patient's leg between femoral artery and the perfusion cannula should have the flow rate between 100 ml/min and 500 ml/min, preferably 200 ml/min to 400 ml/min</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Prior to pump attachment, the two chambers (upper and lower) of the pump are primed to prevent air from being pumped into the patient after attachment to the other system components. The lower chamber uses fluid infusate to provide a bearing function that prevents motor wear, provides cooling, and provides anti-coagulation directly to the upper chamber, where blood flows during operation. First, the infusate line is primed with sterile infusate from the infusate supply system. The lower chamber, or motor chamber, is then filled with sterile infusate from the infusate line. A syringe is used to push fluid through the infusate system and into the lower chamber. The pump is then started, with the pumping action pulling all air through the seal separating the upper and lower chambers. Alternately, a syringe with two way stopcock can be used to suck air out of the lower chamber prior to filling with infusate. The upper chamber, or blood flow chamber, is filled with saline from either the inflow or outflow port. Owing to the low pump volume, this can be accomplished with saline.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Once the transseptal cannula and the perfusion cannula are in position in the patient, the blood pump <b>316</b> is connected to them, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-13</figref>. Connection of the blood pump <b>316</b> to the transseptal cannula and the perfusion cannula is accomplished with tubing <b>324</b> that extends between the input cannula of the blood pump <b>316</b> and the transseptal cannula, and the output cannula of the blood pump <b>316</b> and the perfusion cannula. The tubing <b>324</b> is secured in place by the clamping mechanism <b>322</b> that clamps the tubing to the respective elements. The clamping mechanism <b>322</b> is used to avoid inadvertent disconnection of the elements and the tubing and to prevent leakage of air into the system. The blood pump <b>316</b> is positioned in close proximity, within 3 ft. to the ends of the perfusion cannula and the transseptal cannula which extend from the patient to minimize the system blood volume and to minimize heat loss of the blood in the extracorporeal portion of the system. The tubing <b>324</b> from the perfusion cannula and the transseptal cannula is designed so there is no step transition from the pump housing to the connecting tubing that would tend to create areas of low blood flow.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The blood pump <b>316</b> is placed into an imprint <b>352</b> of the holding portion <b>348</b> which corresponds to the shape of the blood pump <b>316</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-23</figref>. The holding portion <b>348</b> is placed on a band <b>354</b> about the patient's leg <b>352</b>. Straps <b>356</b> of the band <b>354</b> are then placed over the blood pump <b>316</b>. Loops <b>358</b> on the straps <b>356</b> are connected to the hooks <b>360</b> on the band <b>354</b> to secure the straps <b>356</b> on the band <b>354</b>, thus holding blood pump <b>316</b> securely to the patient. The holding mechanism <b>346</b> comprising the holding portion <b>348</b> and the band <b>354</b> can be attached to either of the patient's legs and allows for inflow or outflow cannulation to the side opposite the pump fixation to the leg. The holding mechanism can fix the blood pump <b>316</b> in a position normal to the leg of the patient, or rotated 20 degrees from the normal to the patient's leg.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The blood pump <b>30</b> is a continuous flow blood pump, electrical in nature and magnetically driven having a rotor <b>328</b> and a stator <b>330</b>. The blood pump components are constructed from biocompatible materials suitable for blood contact for periods of up to 14 days.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The primary function of the pump mechanism <b>30</b> is to pump blood. The pump <b>316</b> provides a range of volumetric flow rates from 1 to 41/min. over a mean arterial pressure range of 60 to 100 mmHg with a minimum of 5 mmHg left atrium filling pressure in persons with body surface areas (BSA) between 1.2 and 2.7 sq. meters. This is accomplished by the regulated rotation of the impeller at speeds of 3000 to 7500 rpm.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Secondary functions of the pump mechanism <b>30</b> provided by the controller <b>332</b> include:</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Provide a fluid bearing and localized heparin in the pump.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Provide a system to monitor the fluid bearing infusate supply.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Provide a system to monitor the blood flow rate through the pump <b>316</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Provide a system to power the device.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Provide a system to interface to user.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Provide a performance monitor and alarm system.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Provide a software-based control system.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Alarm conditions are detected by the CPU and communicated to the user through audible and visual alarms on the controller display.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">For single system faults, when a monitored system parameter goes outside an acceptable operating range, an alarm condition is set and a standard alarm sequence is started. The alarm is first issued by turning on an audible alarm device, turning on a flashing red alarm LED and displaying one or more related alarm messages on the display.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">In case of multiple alarms, each time a new parameter goes out of range, a new audible alarm and flashing indication are generated. The alarm list fills top to bottom, that is, a new alarm message is added to the bottom of the alarm list and earlier alarm messages maintain their position on the list. The operator may be able to mute the alarm and the flashing LED may become steady, depending on the alarms present. As alarm conditions are cleared, the related alarm message is removed from the display but the alarm LED remains light. Only when all alarm conditions have been cleared, the red LED turns off. If the number of simultaneous alarms exceeds the available lines on the display, normally <b>13</b>, then no new alarms appear on the display until previous alarms clear. The audible alarm as well as the alarm LED are still activated in the event of a new alarm condition during a alarm message overflow.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">All muted Alarms reactivate within 2 minutes if the alarm condition persists.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">A type 1 alarm condition is an indication that some critical pump electrical parameter has gone outside the acceptable operating range. A standard alarm sequence is started and pump power is removed. The operator is able to mute the audible alarm but the light still flashes if a type 1 alarm is present.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Pump parameter checking only occurs when the pump is turned on but not start until after a brief delay to allow the pump speed to settle to the desired setpoint. Battery monitoring is always active.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Type 1 alarm messages will clears if a pump restart is attempted.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">A type 2 alarm condition is a warning to the operator that some system parameter is approaching or has produced an unacceptable operating condition. A standard alarm sequence is started but the pump is not stopped. The operator is able to mute the audible alarm and the red light will change from flashing to steady if no type 1 alarm is present. If the alarm condition is cleared either by the operator or natural circumstances, the alarm clears.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">The blood pump has a hydrodynamic bearing <b>338</b> between the rotor and the lower housing. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>. A lubrication system is used for the bearing. The purpose of the lubrication system is to provide a fluid bearing to the internal components of the pump and to provide a localized concentration of heparin to the blood in the interior of the pump for prevention of thrombus formation.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Heparin is injected into a 1000 ml I.V. bag of sterile water (i.e., the infusate). The infusate flows through the I.V. set tubing, to the infusion tubing within the infusion pump in the controller. This infusion pump forces the infusate, at a constant rate of 10 ml/hr., through a bacteriologic filter, the 12 ft. of lube tubing in the external communicating line and into the lower housing as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-15</figref><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The infusate in the lower housing flows between the rotor assembly and journal to provide a fluid bearing, thereby lubricating these components. The infusate flows from the lower housing through the center hole in the baffle seal and into the blood chamber. As a result of positive infusate fluid flow, blood will not pass below the seal into the lower housing. This infusate provides a localized source of heparin to the blood in the pumping chamber. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Blood pumps must not destroy red blood cells, must not cause clotting of the blood, and must locate and center themselves without offering a wear surface that can cause red cell damage or clotting over time. The location function must also prevent undesired contact between rotor and stator parts, which can cause pump heating, particulate accumulation in the blood, or pump seizure. The fluid bearing provides a force that aligns the rotating surface to be in the center of the stator, thus preventing contact. The closer the rotor and stator parts come to each other (as a result of electromagnetic forces due to motor operation or due to faults or inconsistencies in the components), the greater the force provided by the fluid, as generated by the flow and the geometries of the bearing surfaces. This centering force provides fail safe centering and location. The primary single point fault in this system is the loss of infusate flow, which is detected well in advance by the infusion management system, described elsewhere. If diluted with an anti-coagulant, the flow of this infusate also provides an anti-clotting mechanism directly to the pump blood chamber, where it is most needed. Without this anti-coagulation, the patient must be provided with a systemic anti-coagulation, which affects the clotting of all the blood in the patient. This carries the risk of internal bleeding. With the anti-coagulation involved with the infusion system of the AB-180 XC System, the concentration of anti-coagulation is large while it is in the blood chamber of the pump but is small by the time it is diluted with the other blood in the body. Therefore, the risk of internal bleeding associated with systemic anti-coagulation is negated.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">The infusate supply is monitored by four distinct systems: 1) bag weigh system, 2) I.V. set drip chamber observation, 3) lube line pressure measurements, and 4) air detector. The purpose of the bag weigh system is to provide a monitoring and alarm system to alert the user of a low infusate volume condition because infusate flow is required for lubrication of the fluid bearing between the journal seal and the impeller shaft and to provide a constant infusion of heparin into the upper housing of the pump for localized anticoagulation.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">A 1000 ml of sterile water containing 90,000 units of heparin provides 90 hours of operation before a warning alert is initiated. A large safety margin has been provided by designating a warning alert to be sounded and displayed on the controller when the infusate volume remaining in the I.V. bag is 100&#xb1;10 ml. This provides a maximum 10 hour interval before a run-dry condition could occur. A drip chamber has been provided in the design of the lubrication system so that visual checks can be made by bedside personnel that fluid is constantly leaving the infusate bag.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">A third layer of protection is the warning alarm system based on the pressure measured in the lubrication system during pump operation. High and low pressure alarm warning limits provide safety by warning the operator that the lube line may have become disconnected (low pressure warning) or that the lube line may be kinked or the particulate bacteriologic filter has become clogged and needs to be changed (high pressure warning).</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">In order to mitigate the hazards associated with the infusion system and to manage the infusate delivery, a multi-alarm system has been implemented. This system is based on monitoring the infusion pump operation, monitoring pressure in the infusion line, and monitoring for any air, at the most downstream location that is practical, in the line.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Although the infusate flow rate is too low for conventional flow measurement techniques, infusion system operation can be confirmed considering the cyclical nature of the pressure in the infusion line downstream from the infusion pump. As the infusion pump rotates one full cycle, the pressure in the downstream line also cycles accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">By measuring pressure in the downstream line, high pressure conditions can be monitored that would signal a kink or an occlusion in the line, and the frequency of pressure variation and the slope of that variation can be measured. The waveforms of pressure and pressure variation are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The frequency of the pressure variation within the infusion line is a measure of the speed of the infusion pump rotation, and it can be measured either by counting the number of zero crossings of the derivative of pressure or by measuring the time between consecutive zero crossings of pressure. The derivative of pressure is calculated as the difference in two discrete pressure measurements divided by the time between those measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">A high or low frequency of the pressure waveform indicates an infusion pump which is rotating faster or slower than normal, indicating an infusion flow rate which is out of specification.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">The slope of the pressure variation is related to the infusate flow rate (i.e., below a specified limit) and can be used to detect a low flow condition. If the magnitude of dP/dt is &#x2018;low&#x2019; for an extended period, then the infusate flow rate is considered to be low. Generally, this situation occurs when the infusion pump is pushing into an open line (constant, ambient pressure in the infusion line) or a kink in the line upstream to the infusion pump has stopped supplying fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Specifically, alarms are generated by the infusion monitoring system under the following conditions:</p>

This cycle is repeated until a lube transducer offset is determined to be within range. The alarm clears if the offset voltage is within range for the 8 second period. When an acceptable offset has been identified, the controller then uses the offset value until the transducer is removed. This alarm cannot occur if the lube transducer is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">When a lube transducer is disconnected or not properly inserted a standard alarm sequence is started and the LUBE XDUCER REMOVED message displayed. The alarm clears when a lube transducer is properly connected. No lube related alarms, except LUBE VOLUME LOW and LUBE XDUCER REMOVED, can occur when a transducer disconnect is verified. The alarm can occur before, during or after the pump has been started but not before a transducer has been inserted at least once.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">The time period (&#x394;T) between consecutive zero crossings of dP/dt is monitored. If &#x394;T is outside the range for 6 consecutive zero crossings then a standard alarm sequence is started and the LUBE PHASE SHIFT message is displayed. If the alarm condition is observed not to occur for a continuous time period of 1 second then the alarm clears.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">This alarm cannot occur when the lube transducer is disconnected. The alarm is not be issued if the pump is stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">The lube line is monitored for the presence of air at one second intervals. If a bubble of sufficient volume passes the bubble detector transducer then a standard alarm sequence is started and the LUBE LINE OPEN message is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">The alarm is mutable. The alarm is latched and only cleared if the mute button has been pressed while the message appears on the alarm list and no air is detected in the lube line.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">As a secondary indication, the yellow LED is illuminated during a LUBE LINE OPEN alarm.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">The blood pump <b>316</b> is controlled by the controller <b>332</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Therefore, the flow rate through the blood pump <b>316</b> can be adjusted by the technician. This is accomplished in the blood pump <b>316</b> by changing speed of the impeller <b>334</b>. A technician adjusts the controller <b>332</b> for attaining a desired impeller speed based on the arterial pressure of the patient and the flow rate of blood through the blood pump <b>316</b>. Generally, it is desired to maintain a flow rate of blood of between 1.0 and 3.5 liters per minute through the blood pump, and an arterial pressure of 60-70 mm of mercury in the patient. The arterial pressure of the patient can be obtained from standard techniques of obtaining blood pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">The flow rate of the blood through the blood pump <b>316</b> can be identified by measuring the impeller speed and stator current, as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/130,617 (PCT application PCT/US99/17465), incorporated by reference herein. The flow rate is displayed on the controller, where the technician uses the information to change the impeller speed. The impeller speed is maintained between 3000 and 7500 rpm. If the estimated flow is below a preset low flow alarm limit, a low flow alarm is activated to warn the technician of potentially unsafe conditions, such as impeller speed too low or too high and cannula kinking or distortion. Impeller under speed can cause regurgitant flow from patient's artery, through the pump, and into the heart and thus impair patient's heart function. Excessive impeller speed can cause patient's heart collapse and introduce heart damage. Cannula kinking can cause blood clotting in the cannula and lead to pump failure. Cannula distortion may cause patient's organ under perfusion.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">The low flow alarm also provides prevention of removing gases from the circulated blood stream into patient's body due to an excessive vacuum pressure created at the pump inlet.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Since the controller is able to detect low flow conditions, which might be due to unsafe operation of the system, this would provide an easier way for patient care and a better safety feature to patients.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">When the patient is stationary, and thus the controller is stationary, the controller and the blood pump are powered from the AC mains available through the walls of the room. The controller also has a battery operation, which is used for patient transfers, and more particularly from the catheter lab to the ICU or operating room.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">The power supply system provides power to the pump. The power supply system consists of a switching power supply, a battery charging supply, and the necessary control circuitry, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref><i>c</i>-<b>16</b><i>e. </i></p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">The switching power supply provides power to the controller when the controller is connected to AC power (with power switch on or off). The battery provides a minimum of 30 minutes of operation under maximum load conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">A warning is generated in the controller when switching to battery operation to tell the user the system is operating on battery power. A low battery alarm is generated, which cannot be muted, when the battery output is less than specification giving the user warning of 10 minutes remaining on battery operation. When the battery voltage has decayed to the battery depleted threshold, new alarm messages are displayed (PUMP AUTO OFF; RECONNECT AC PWR), the pump is shut off. The ALARM/MUTE switch will not silence this alarm. This alarm can only be silenced by connection to AC power.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">The system is designed for a single mode of operation. All setup and service operations are done from the normal operating mode.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">The control system is divided into three distinct parts: an operator control panel, a support stand and a power assembly. The system is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref><i>a</i>-<b>16</b><i>e. </i></p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">The operator control panel is an electronic control system that includes the system computer, status display and operator controls. It is attached at about shoulder height to the support stand to provide optimum display readability and easy hand access to the operator controls. The height of the control panel can be adjusted. The operator panel has dual control units, a primary unit and a backup unit. The dual unit design provides dual integral displays and dual computers for redundant operation. A hinged door is used to cover the display panel not being used (normally the backup display). A knob is provided to manually switch control to the backup unit as described below. The door can be moved to cover the primary display and is mechanically interlocked with the &#x201c;primary-backup&#x201d; control knob to eliminate inadvertently covering the active controller.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">The support stand is a vertical post with a square pedestal base with castors. It provides an attachment point for the control panel, power assembly and lubricating fluid components. It also contains the wires which interconnect the system components and the height adjustment subsystem.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">The power assembly is located at the base of the support stand and contains the power system, the battery and implant pump drive electronics. The system power switch is located here.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">The control system architecture provides for fault tolerance while minimizing the failure rate of the system controlling pump operation. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref><i>e</i>, the user can only turn the pump on or off and change the speed between minimum and maximum speeds. Speed control is performed by hardware, with the user input determining voltage from a potentiometer that is then fed directly to a motor control/drive circuit, which then feeds current directly to the motor. All other control functions provide only monitoring of the system parameters, which are performed in parallel with the motor and pump operation. Should a monitor function fail, the system will maintain pump operation but will alert the user to the failure of the monitor system. The user can then switch to a backup control system to again begin effective pump monitoring. In other words, the monitoring is not directly involved with motor operation, in which case any monitor failure might affect patient treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Pump speed is controlled by the selected (primary or backup) potentiometer (speed pot) on the control panel which is wired directly to the motor control chip. The motor control chip independently starts the motor and controls the speed in accordance with the speed potentiometer setting. The CPU monitors the speed pot voltage and compares it to the actual pump speed determined by the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) frequency to confirm that they are within the specified tolerance. The CPU monitors pump direction via a direction detection circuit located on the power board. If the CPU detects pump direction reversal, it provides an appropriate type 2 alarm.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">The control system is designed with redundancy for all subsystems (except for the lubricant infusion subsystem). The redundancy is structured as two parallel control units with the exception of the battery, which is structured with independent redundancy. Under normal operation, both computers are operational but only one is in control, recording data and generating alarms based on the setting of the primary/backup knob. A circuit is included to alarm a dual control unit failure. The primary and backup computers are separate without exchanging information.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">The control panel is divided into two halves: 1 primary system and 1 backup system. Under normal operation, the blood pump is controlled using the primary control unit. If a runtime failure occurs in the primary control unit, control can be manually switched to the backup control unit. Circuitry is also provided to monitor the backup computer.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">Because of the requirement to always have two operational control units available before implanting the cardiac pump, when power is turned on, both primary and backup control units perform a startup self test sequence. If either computer is not functional, an alarm condition is evident. If the primary computer does not function the primary light on the primary/backup select knob indicates the failure, the backup light flashes green and a non-mutable audible alarm is sounded. A PRIMARY CPU FAIL message appears on the backup controller. If the backup computer does not run, a BACKUP CPU FAIL alarm is posted on the primary control panel and the backup light on the primary-backup select knob indicates the failure. A mutable audible alarm occurs. If the proper functioning of components in the system other than the computers must be verified, they should be checked by the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">Both primary and backup systems must be fully operational for the control system to be used. If a startup failure is detected in either the primary or backup control unit, the entire control system should be rejected. If the BACKUP CPU FAIL appears on the display, at any time, then the controller should be replaced since backup patient support is unavailable.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">The system power and pneumatic components are located in the power assembly. If a failure of any power or pneumatic component occurs, the backup component set can be selected by manually switching the control unit on the control panel. The two redundant batteries are always connected and use semiconductor and mechanical fusing to automatically disconnect a failed battery.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">If a primary to backup switchover is performed while the pump is running, the pump shuts down. If a primary to backup switchover is performed while the pump is stopped, the pump remains stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">All switches are labeled and recessed or guarded to prevent inadvertent operation. All controls occur in duplicate except the primary/backup select knob and the power switch.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">A recessed rotary knob is supplied to control pump speed. The knob does not have any quantitative markings but is labeled Pump RPM and to indicate that turning the knob clockwise increases speed (hence flow rate). When the pump is started, it comes to a speed determined by the angular position of the knob. The speed can then be increased or decreased by rotating the knob. The actual pump speed is determined by observing the RPM readout on the display which is measured directly from the pump drive electronics.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">When an alarm condition occurs, a flashing RED light occurs, the audible alarm is activated and an alarm message is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">A rotary knob is built into the control panel which selects the operable system components. It is labeled &#x201c;Primary&#x201d; and &#x201c;Backup&#x201d; and has a circular indent to point to the selected subsystem.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">The display screen is touch sensitive and has three main buttons: SERVICE DATA, CONFIG MENU and WEAN MENU. The CPU activates an audible chirp when it senses a touchscreen button press.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">The SERVICE DATA is used to display system parameters not needed for normal pump operation. Pressing the SERVICE DATA button again exits the system parameter display.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">The CONFIG MENU button is displayed when the SERVICE DATA button is pressed after power on but before the pump is started (this prevents CPU controller reset while the pump is running). The configuration menu is a user interface that consists of clearly labeled and intuitive touchscreen buttons for adjusting the controller time, RS-232 port setting, date, and language. The settings are stored in non-volatile memory and are recalled when the controller is powered up. The CPU maintains the time/date and the CPU EEPROM holds the latest language and RS-232 configuration setting. The selectable languages are English, Spanish, German, Italian and French. The selectable RS-232 port settings are direct (to PC) or modem.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">The WEAN MENU button only appears while the pump is running or after the pump has been stopped. The WEAN MENU button replaces the CONFIG MENU button if the pump is started when the service data is being displayed. The WEAN MENU allows the operator to temporarily disable the PUMP FLOW LOW alarm during patient weaning.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">System power is directly controlled by a guarded, manual switch. If the system is off, pressing the power button supplies power to the controller. Selection of primary or backup power is controlled by the primary/backup knob on the control panel as described above, however, selection of primary or backup battery is automatic. Status of system power is displayed by visible LED indicators.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">If the system is on and the power button is pressed, system power is removed and the controller stops. Any audible alarms are silenced. Battery charging continues as long as AC power is supplied.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">All parameters and messages are displayed on a backlit monochromatic graphics display with alpha numeric capability and a touch-sensitive overlay. The messages are grouped into three sections: Normal operating parameters, alarms and system parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">During normal operation, with the pump on and no alarms, several messages are presented on the display. These include: SYSTEM READY, SERVICE DATA, WEAN MENU, XXXX<sub>RPM </sub>and Y.YY<sub>LPM </sub>where XXXX is the pump speed and Y.YY is the pump flow rate. If the pump is stopped, XXXX RPM and Y.YY LPM are replaced by the message PUMP OFF HH:MM:SS.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">If an out of range reading is observed for any of the monitored system parameters, the audible alarm is sounded and the red alarm light is illuminated. Appropriate alarm messages are displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">An audible alarm is provided to indicate that a new alarm condition has occurred. The alarm can be silenced by pushing a mute button except under certain conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">A number of indicator lights are provided to tell the operator the status of the pump, the occluder, alarms, system power, and bubble detector status.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">The controller has external connections for the implant pump, system power and external data communications.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">The controller is designed so that initial set-up and testing can be performed by a single non-sterile operator.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">The pump is started by pushing the PUMP START/STOP button while the pump is in the OFF state.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">The pump is stopped by pushing and holding the Pump Start/Stop button for 5 seconds while the pump is in the ON state. The typical pump stop sequence would be as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">Press PUMP START/STOP button.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">The controller initiates the pump stop sequence by displaying the HOLD BUTTON X message (a short beep is issued).</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">The HOLD BUTTON X message where X=the seconds remaining until the pump shuts down is the controller's confirmation to the operator that the button is being pushed.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">After 5 seconds, the pump is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">The PUMP START/STOP light will switches green to off.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">The PUMP OFF HH:MM:SS message is displayed and starts counting. The PUMP STOPPED alarm is posted.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">If any of the alarm conditions that require shutting off the pump occurs, the pump is shut down and the PUMP STOPPED alarm message is displayed. When the pump stops, either from an operator command or an alarm condition, a &#x201c;PUMP OFF&#x201d; timer is started and the elapsed time since pump stop is shown on the display with the message PUMP OFF HH:MM:SS. If an primary to backup switchover is performed while the pump is running the pump shuts down and the messages PUMP STOPPED and PUMP OFF HH:MM:SS are displayed on the backup display.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">If a primary to backup switchover is performed when the pump is off then the pump will remain off and the messages PUMP STOPPED and PUMP OFF HH:MM:SS will be displayed on the backup display.</p>

The AC power status is also echoed by the status panel indicators.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">If battery A or battery B voltage drops below the battery fail voltage threshold for 1 second, but both batteries are not below the battery fail voltage threshold, a standard alarm sequence is started.

<p id="p-0233" num="0232">The temperature of the power board case in the region of the primary and backup motor control chips are measured at 1 second intervals. If the temperature exceeds the temperature threshold, a standard alarm sequence is started and a POWER ASSY TEMP HIGH message displayed. The alarm clears if the temperature drops below the alarm limit The AB-180 pump is controlled by a dedicated motor control chip which has three nested control loops. For each loop, the parameters must be selected by the designer to give the desired dynamic operation over the full range of pump speeds.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">The loop parameter settings for optimum dynamic operation are not consistent with reliable startup performance. Startup can be erratic with chatter and in the worst case the pump refuses to start at all. These symptoms vary with the setting of the speed control knob. Also at higher speed settings there is significant speed overshoot which could be damaging to blood cells. The control circuit parameters for reliable startup at the minimum pump speed were determined, considering the special algorithms in the control chip that operate during startup to limit current and sense rotor position. The parameters for optimum dynamic operation were then determined over the full speed range.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the key speed control concept employed to offer stable speed and soft speed change without overshoots involves switching between two different sets of loop filter components, A and B. The point at which switching occurs is determined by the circuitry at D. The switching also changes the speed between upper and lower settings provided by the user. The circuitry at C determines the rate of speed change between the upper and lower speed settings.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">The pump speed setting is electronically overridden and held at minimum during the startup sequence, regardless of the setting of the speed control knob. Then the loop parameters are configured for reliable startup and the pump is started. The pump starts and its speed begins to ramp up. When it reaches a predetermined threshold, the loop parameters are automatically reconfigured to their optimum values for dynamic operation and the override of the pump speed setting is released. The pump speed is then allowed to slowly increase to the knob setting.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">Pump startup is reliable and smooth since the loop parameters are optimized for startup at one particular speed which is set by the override and startup always occurs at that speed.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> for a description of this speed modulation control circuitry. U<b>1</b> is the motor control IC. Only the pertinent connections are shown. The pump speed is proportional to the voltage at the VSPEED input (pin <b>8</b>). RUN/STOP signal is low when the pump is off and the voltage at CISC (U<b>1</b>, pin <b>21</b>) is high. This forces comparator U<b>2</b>'s output to the low state which holds transistor Q<b>4</b> off and relay K<b>1</b> de-energized. In the de-energized position K<b>1</b> has two effects. The lower contacts of K<b>1</b> cause the loop filter components connected to U<b>1</b>'s CSC line (U<b>1</b>, pin <b>5</b>) to be set for proper startup. Capacitor C<b>1</b> is connected from pin <b>5</b> directly to ground and components R<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>, and C<b>3</b> are connected to ground through resistor R<b>2</b> which provides isolation and a DC return path. The upper contacts of K<b>1</b> pull the non-inverting input of op amp U<b>3</b> to ground. This causes the voltage determined by the minimum speed set potentiometer R<b>3</b> to appear at U<b>1</b>'s VSPEED input.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">When the RUN/STOP signal is taken high, U<b>1</b>'s BRAKE line (pin <b>25</b>) is released and the pump is started. Its speed begins to ramp up to the minimum speed setting. As U<b>1</b>'s control loops settle to their locked condition, the voltage at CISC (pin <b>21</b>) begins to drop. This CISC voltage is filtered and delayed by the R<b>4</b>/C<b>4</b> network and its drop is sensed by comparator U<b>2</b>. U<b>2</b> then turns on Q<b>4</b> which energizes relay K<b>1</b>. U<b>2</b> incorporates hysteresis which is not shown in the figure and is a high input impedance device to avoid loading the CISC signal. When K<b>1</b> is energized, its lower contacts connect C<b>2</b> and C<b>3</b> directly to ground which sets the loop filter components to the desired configuration for normal pump operation. K<b>1</b>'s upper contacts release U<b>3</b>'s non-inverting input and capacitor C<b>5</b> begins to slowly charge to the voltage set by the run speed potentiometer R<b>5</b>. Op amps U<b>3</b> and U<b>4</b> then cause the voltage at U<b>1</b>'s VSPEED input to be determined by the run speed setting.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">It can be appreciated from the above description that the speed modulation circuitry provides a convenient means of ramping the pump speed between two user selected settings in a controlled manner. This technique would allow the pump output to be varied in a pulsatile manner using only a simple digital signal for control. The control signal could be provided by a simple oscillator which could have an unequal duty cycle. The time constants of the ramp rates can be adjusted as desired by proper component selection or minor changes to the circuitry of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>. Note that other more complex means could also be used to implement a pulsatile flow control. Pulsatile control with this circuit concept could be implemented in software.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">It is possible to simulate the varying blood pressure of the normal heartbeat by modulating the speed of the pump to obtain pulsatile flow.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">The actual pump speed is compared to the speed potentiometer setting at one second intervals. If a deviation greater than that specified is detected, for 6 consecutive intervals, then a standard alarm sequence is initiated and the PUMP SPEED ERROR message is displayed. The alarm clears if the deviation is less than the limit specified in the alarm table for one second.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">The actual pump speed is monitored by the CPU after the CPU sends the pump shutdown signal. If the actual pump speed is greater than the alarm threshold specified then a standard alarm sequence is initiated and the PUMP SHUTDOWN ERROR alarm is displayed. The alarm clears if the pump is restarted. The alarm clears if the pump speed decreases below the alarm threshold when the CPU has established a pump off condition.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">The pump flow estimate is monitored at one second intervals. If a blood flow rate less than the limit specified is detected then a standard alarm sequence is initiated and the PUMP FLOW LOW message is displayed. The alarm clears if the flow rate rises above the limit specified in the alarm table. This alarm can only be disabled via the WEAN MENU. The alarm defaults to enabled at controller power up. The alarm automatically re-enables within a specified period of being disabled.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">Another safety feature of the system is its ability to detect if the motor controller is improperly causing the pump to spin in the reverse direction. The control IC has the ability to spin the pump in either direction. Unintended reverse operation is a concern to regulatory agencies regardless of its low likelihood of occurrence.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">Pump direction is monitored via a direction detection circuit located on the power board. The circuit outputs logic high for forward direction and logic low for reverse. The direction detection circuit is monitored at one second intervals. If pump reversal is detected then a standard alarm sequence is initiated and the PUMP DIRECTION ERROR message will be displayed. The alarm can occur with the pump on or off. When the pump is on the PUMP DIRECTION ERROR alarm clears if the pump reverses direction. A PUMP DIRECTION ERROR alarm when the pump is off suggests a direction detection circuit failure and the alarm can only be cleared if the fault is repaired by service personnel.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, U<b>1</b> signals P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>, and P<b>3</b> (pins <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b>) are the drive lines to the P channel FETS in a standard three phase bridge motor driver. These signals are logic outputs which are driven in a specific sequence as the three phases of the motor are energized. When the pump is spinning in the forward direction the sequence is P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>, P<b>3</b> and in reverse it is P<b>1</b>, P<b>3</b>, P<b>2</b>. The pulses are low for two cycles of the VCO clock output (pin <b>13</b>) and transitions occur on the positive going VCO clock edge. Note that the N channel outputs (pins <b>9</b>, <b>10</b>, and <b>11</b>) are not suitable because in an analog control scheme they vary in amplitude and in a pulse width modulated scheme they are high frequency pulses that bear no relationship to the phase sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">The direction of pump drive is determined by examining the P line sequence using digital logic. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> is a timing diagram which shows both the foreword and reverse sequences. To determine direction, the P<b>2</b> phase is sampled shortly after the high going edge of the P<b>1</b> phase. If the sample is low, the direction is foreword. If the sample is high, the direction is reverse. It will be appreciated that any phase could be used for the reference and either of the remaining phases could be sampled. Also it is possible to sample both of the remaining phases.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">D type flip flop U<b>5</b> is used to delay the P<b>1</b> signal by one VCO clock period. The rising edge of the delayed P<b>1</b> signal then clocks D type flip flop U<b>6</b> to sample the P<b>2</b> signal. The sampled P<b>2</b> signal appears at the Q output of U<b>6</b>. It is filtered by the R<b>10</b>/C<b>6</b> network and applied to comparator U<b>7</b> which produces the DIRECTION output. Comparator U<b>7</b> also incorporates hysteresis which is not shown. Resistors R<b>6</b>, R<b>7</b>, R<b>8</b>, and R<b>9</b> reduce the voltage of the P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> signals to the logic level required by U<b>5</b> and U<b>6</b>. The R<b>11</b>/C<b>7</b> network holds the direction output at foreword until the control loops have stabilized.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">A runtime random access memory (RAM) test is implemented by periodically checking critical values against duplicate inverted values. If any of the critical variables cannot be verified then a standard alarm sequence is started and the RAM TEST FAILURE message is displayed. The alarm clears if all critical variables can be verified in a subsequent cycle of the runtime RAM test.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">A runtime read only memory (ROM) test checks the application code space in Flash memory. This test is completed approximately every 5 minutes or less. If the test is not completed successfully then a standard alarm sequence is started and the message ROM TEST FAILURE is displayed. The alarm clears if a subsequent ROM test passes.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">The CPU supply voltage is monitored in 1 second intervals. If the CPU supply voltage exceeds the alarm limit then a standard alarm sequence occurs and the message CPU VOLTAGE HIGH is displayed. The alarm clears if the CPU voltage decreases below the specified alarm limit for one interval.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">The CPU supply voltage is monitored in 1 second intervals. If the CPU supply voltage drops below the alarm limit then a standard alarm sequence occurs and the message CPU VOLTAGE LOW is displayed. The alarm clears if the CPU voltage increases above the specified alarm limit for one interval.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">A runtime CPU self test is completed approximately every 10 seconds or less. If the test is not completed successfully then a standard alarm sequence is started and the message CPU TEST FAILURE is displayed. The alarm clears if a subsequent CPU self test passes.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">The WD (PIC) toggles a signal to the CPU when the WD sends its strobe. When the CPU fails to detect the holdoff signal from the PIC within 1 second then a standard alarm sequence is started and the message PIC FAILURE is displayed. The alarm clears if the WD resumes sending CPU holdoff signals in less than 1 second intervals. In addition, the WD also monitors the CPU communications to confirm CPU status.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">The CPU initiates an air bubble detector self test approximately once every 1 minute. If, during the self test, the air in line response is not confirmed by the CPU within 1 second then a standard alarm sequence is started and the message AIR DETECTOR FAILURE is displayed. The alarm clears if a subsequent air detector self test passes.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">When the controller passes its internal startup self tests successfully, the CPU displays the SYSTEM READY message. The SYSTEM READY message remains posted while the computers are functioning normally as established by the runtime self tests. The only exceptions are that the SYSTEM READY message is not displayed when the configuration menu is displayed and SYSTEM READY is not displayed when BATTERY ON XXX MIN is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">The pump can only be started when SYSTEM READY appears in the display.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">Hardware watchdogs are provided for both the primary and backup control units. If the control unit selected by the primary/backup selector knob fails to start or fails during operation, the watchdog circuit alarms. The alarm is a type 2 mutable. The primary/backup switch LEDs indicate system status.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">Pump power is controlled by removing motor power from the motor drive and pulling the brake pin of the motor control chip low. Removing power from the drive circuit is needed to assure that current to the motor can be removed even if drive transistors short. When the CPU sends the signal to shutdown the pump it continues to monitor the VCO frequency to verify that the pump stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">To turn the pump on, the CPU will send a voltage level command to the power board. This controls a relay that applies power to the pump drive chip and releases the brake line.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">Pump speed is measured by counting VCO pulses from the motor drive chip. The drive chip produces 12 pulses per revolution of the motor, so RPM=pulse rate per sec&#xd7;60 sec per min/12 pulses per revolution=Pulse rate (Hz)&#xd7;5.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> serves as an illustration of how the motor control chip pulse train is processed.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">Pump flow is derived using Non-Invasive Flow Estimation Algorithm. See PCT application PCT/US99/17465, incorporated by reference herein. The algorithm samples two analog voltages (16 bit, 200 Hz) that are proportional to pump current and pump speed to compute flow to within &#xb1;10% of full scale. The algorithm is derived based on the force balance between the electric torque generated by the motor and the load torque, including the mechanical losses. The flow estimator equation is given by</p>

All connections to remote devices are made from the power assembly located at the base of the stand. Connections critical for safety are provided with strain reliefs and/or locking mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">The system shall have 2 connections for data output. One RS-232 connector is used to send system data to remote computers; standard DB-9 connector with sockets, base panel mounted and menu configurable for use as modem or direct PC connection. One dry contact relay output is provided for connection to a nursing alarm panel; normally closed, access via base panel mounted &#xbc;&#x2033; female phone jack. The relay opens, to signal an alarm condition, only when the unit is powered on and a type 1 or type 2 alarm occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">The pump is a three phase brushless DC (BLDC) motor. The motor is driven by a Micro Linear Corporation Sensorless Smart-Start&#x2122; BLDC Motor Controller Model ML4428. The circuit is configured for linear mode operation to minimize noise and to facilitate flow estimation.</p>

This high current simulates the system load during battery operation. The system software monitors the battery voltage during the test. The voltage must remain above a threshold to pass the test. The load test gives an indication of capacity since during testing the battery's internal impedance increases as the capacity decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0298">The system can also be used for treatment of oxygenated blood without surgical procedures, such as radiation or drug or gene insertion. Drug insertion can be accomplished by injecting a specified amount of a specific drug into the system infusion IV bag. Delivery of the drug is then specified by the amount of drug inserted and the constant flow rate of the infusion system. Alternatively, drug insertion can be accomplished by connecting a bag, containing fluid or drug to be professed, to the pump inlet, either with a tube, or a channel if the fluid supply and the pump are in a single housing, and an appropriate size of perfusion cannula to the pump outlet to access a patient's blood stream. The desired perfusion rate can be achieved by adjusting impeller speed of the pump. Radiation treatment can be accomplished by accessing blood flowing through the extracorporeal circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299">The system can be used for the treatment of hemorrhagic shock, providing circulatory support to treat patients suffering from extreme blood loss. Alternatively, the system can be used for regional blood redistribution when re-circulating blood of a patient is needed. The application would be similar to those already discussed, with the mechanics of setup and operation being identical. Locations for blood access are viable depending on the purposes of treatments. For example, blood access at the pump inflow side could be from subclavian vein, sephalicvein, jugular vein, femoral artery, or axillary artery. On the other hand, blood can be returned to patients through the outflow cannulation at axillary artery, femoral artery, or descending aorta via axillary or femoral artery. Selection of cannulae for different applications depends on the location of blood access and patient's size.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">The pump fixation (holster) mechanism as described is to be attached to patient's leg. If other blood access sites are used to provide circulatory support, the pump fixation mechanism could be located at different places of patient's body, such as the arm, torso, or shoulder, near the blood access sites by modifying the bottom shape of the holster.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301">Although the invention has been described in detail in the foregoing embodiments for the purpose of illustration, it is to be understood that such detail is solely for that purpose and that variations can be made therein by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention except as it may be described by the following claims.</p>
