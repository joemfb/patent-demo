<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic view of an example embodiment of an electrical system <b>100</b>, which can include an electrical cable <b>102</b> (e.g., a coaxial cable) coupled to an electrical component <b>104</b>. The electrical component <b>104</b> can be an antenna element in various embodiments disclosed herein, although various other electrical components can be used (e.g., a television or other display device, a computing device, a computer peripheral device, an electrical appliance, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The antenna element <b>104</b> can be a horizontally polarized antenna element, such as a cross-dipole antenna, which is generally driven by a single coaxial cable, includes one pair of arms (first dipole) longer than a second pair of arms (second dipole), where phase shifts are established by the arms themselves, e.g., without the need for an external phase shifter or a second coax. In such cases, radiation travelling on the electrical cable <b>102</b> towards the antenna element <b>104</b> (e.g., via the center conductor of the coaxial cable) can cause undesirable EMI and/or RFI interference. For example, radiation travelling towards the antenna element <b>104</b> up the center conductor of the coaxial cable <b>102</b> can reflect off of the antenna element <b>104</b> and travel back down the outer surface of the coaxial cable. This can create unbalanced current flow on the coaxial cable, impairing performance of the antenna element <b>104</b>. For instance, the unbalanced current flow can result in radiation which may interfere with the horizontal polarization of the antenna element <b>104</b> or otherwise impair performance. Various features and elements relating to antenna elements, including cross-dipole, horizontally polarized antenna elements which can be implemented in connection with the electrical system <b>100</b>, are disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2011/0068992, titled CROSS-DIPOLE ANTENNA CONFIGURATIONS, published on Mar. 24, 2011, and filed on Jul. 21, 2010, U.S. Patent Publication No. 2011/0025569, titled CROSS-DIPOLE ANTENNA COMBINATION, published on Feb. 3, 2011, and filed on May 21, 2010, and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2011/0025573, titled CROSS-DIPOLE ANTENNA, published on Feb. 3, 2011, and filed on Aug. 3, 2009. The entirety of each of these publications is hereby incorporated by reference and made a part of this specification. In one embodiment, the antenna element <b>104</b> is a cross-dipole, horizontally polarized antenna where arms of the cross dipole antenna that are coupled to a center conductor of the coaxial cable remain of conventional length, but the arms of the cross dipole antenna that are coupled to a shield of the coaxial cable are lengthened by a fraction of the radius (half the diameter) of the coaxial cable. Various other embodiments of antennas which can be used with the electrical chokes described herein are described in the '992, '569, '573, and publications. In some cases, the antenna element <b>104</b> has some other polarization instead of or in addition to a horizontal polarization. For instance, the antenna element <b>104</b> may be vertically or circularly polarized in some cases. Moreover, while the antenna element <b>104</b> can be a cross-dipole antenna in some cases, other types of antennas can be used (e.g., turnstile antennas).</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In some embodiments, the electrical cable <b>102</b> can couple to the electrical component <b>104</b> by a connector <b>106</b>, while in other embodiments, the electrical cable <b>102</b> can couple directly to the electrical component <b>104</b>. The electrical cable <b>102</b> can be configured to provide power to the electrical component <b>104</b> and/or to deliver control signals to and/or from the electrical component <b>104</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the electrical cable <b>102</b> can be a feed line for an antenna element. In some embodiments, the electrical cable <b>102</b> can couple the electrical component to another electrical component <b>108</b> (e.g., a power source, a splitting module, a computing device, etc.) directly or via a connector <b>110</b>. A choke <b>112</b> can be disposed on the electrical cable <b>102</b> to suppress undesired signals.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The choke <b>112</b> can be disposed at or near the electrical component <b>104</b> (e.g., at or near the end of the electrical cable <b>102</b>). For example, the choke <b>112</b> can be disposed directly adjacent to the electrical component <b>104</b> or the connector <b>106</b>, or the choke <b>112</b> can be spaced apart from the electrical component <b>104</b> or connector <b>106</b> by a distance of less than about 0.1 mm, less than about 0.25 mm, less than about 0.5 mm, less than about 1.0 mm, less than about 1.25 mm, less than about 1.5 mm, less than about 3.0 mm, less than about 5.0 mm, less than about 10 mm, less than about 20 mm, less than about 50 mm, or less than about 100 mm, although larger distances can be used. In some embodiments, the choke <b>112</b> can be spaced apart from the electrical component <b>104</b> or the connector <b>106</b> by a distance of at least about 0.1 mm, at least about 0.2 mm, at least about 0.3 mm, at least about 0.5 mm, at least about 0.75 mm, at least about 1.0 mm, at least about 1.5 mm, at least about 2.0 mm, at least about 5.0 mm, or more. In some embodiments, the choke <b>112</b> can be disposed at or near the other electrical component <b>108</b> or connector <b>110</b> that is coupled to the electrical cable <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, the choke <b>112</b> can be spaced apart from both electrical components <b>104</b> and <b>108</b>, e.g., at a generally midsection of the electrical cable <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross-sectional view of an example embodiment of the electrical cable <b>102</b> taken through the line <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective view of a section of the electrical cable <b>102</b> with portions of various layers hidden from view to facilitate viewing of the various layers. The electrical cable <b>102</b> can be a coaxial cable, although various types of cables can be used. The electrical cable <b>102</b> can include an inner conductor <b>114</b> configured to deliver power and/or control signals to or from the electrical component <b>104</b>, a cable insulating layer <b>116</b> disposed over the inner conductor <b>114</b>, a shielding layer <b>118</b> disposed over the cable insulating layer <b>116</b>, and an outer jacket <b>120</b> disposed over the shielding layer <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;over&#x201d; and &#x201c;under&#x201d; sometimes refer to the relative positions of various components with respect to a center or longitudinal axis of an electrical cable or choke. For example, a first component can be &#x201c;under&#x201d; a second component if the first component is closer to the center or longitudinal axis than the second component or if the first component is disposed radially inward from the second component. Similarly, a second component can be &#x201c;over&#x201d; a first component if the second component is further from the center or longitudinal axis than the first component or if the second component is disposed radially outward from the first component.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The inner conductor <b>114</b> can be a copper wire or other electro-conductive material. The cable insulating layer <b>116</b> can be made of an insulating material (e.g., a dielectric material) such as fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP). The shielding layer <b>116</b> can be made of an electro-conductive material (e.g., copper) and can be braided. The outer jacket <b>120</b> can be made of an insulating material such as FEP or polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Various other materials can be used, and many other variations are possible. For example, in some embodiments, a foil shield (not shown) can be included, which can be made of an electro-conductive material (e.g., aluminum) and can be disposed, for example, between the cable insulating layer <b>116</b> and the shielding layer <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In antenna systems, as well as in other electrical systems <b>100</b>, an undesired signal (e.g., a radio frequency (RF) signal) can be produced. For example, in some cases the electrical cable <b>102</b> can operate as an antenna element which can transmit and/or receive undesired signals (e.g., RF signals). In some instances, an undesired current can flow along a portion of the electrical cable <b>102</b> (e.g., along an outside of the electrical cable <b>102</b> or along the shielding layer <b>118</b> of the electrical cable <b>102</b>), which is commonly referred to as common mode electromagnetic interference (EMI) or radio frequency interference (RFI). In some cases, the current of the undesired electrical current can propagate in a direction along the cable <b>102</b> that is substantially opposite the direction of the current propagating in the inner conductor <b>114</b> of the cable <b>102</b>. The choke <b>112</b> can be configured to suppress EMI and/or RFI. The chokes can be configured to suppress RF signals (e.g., ranging from 9 kHz to 300 GHz).</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a cross-sectional view of an example embodiment of the choke <b>112</b> and electrical cable <b>102</b> taken through line <b>4</b>-<b>4</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a perspective view of the choke <b>112</b> and electrical cable <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The choke <b>112</b> can include an electro-conductive sleeve <b>122</b>, which can be made of metal (e.g., copper) or other electro-conductive material. The sleeve <b>122</b> can have a generally cylindrical shape, and can have a generally circular cross-sectional shape, although other cross-sectional shapes are possible (e.g., rectangular or other polygonal shapes). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the sleeve <b>122</b> can extend around the full cross-sectional perimeter of the electrical cable <b>102</b>, although in some embodiments, the electro-conductive sleeve <b>122</b> can extend around less than the full cross-sectional perimeter of the electrical cable <b>102</b>, as discussed herein. The electro-conductive sleeve <b>122</b> can be a seamless sleeve, which can be, for example, an extruded piece of electro-conductive material (e.g., copper). In some embodiments, the electro-conductive sleeve <b>122</b> can include a seam <b>124</b> (shown by a dotted line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), which can extend substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the sleeve <b>122</b>. For example, the sleeve <b>122</b> can be formed by bending a generally planar piece of electro-conductive material (e.g., copper) so that the ends of the piece of material are adjacent or near each other. The ends can be joined by an electro-conductive material such as solder, an electro-conductive adhesive, etc., or by an insulating material, as discussed herein. In some embodiments, the electro-conductive sleeve <b>122</b> can be a coating applied to the outside of the electrical cable <b>102</b> (e.g., a electro-conductive paint or an electro-conductive tape).</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">The electro-conductive sleeve <b>122</b> can have a thickness <b>126</b>, which can be substantially uniform across the sleeve <b>122</b>. In some embodiments, the electro-conductive sleeve <b>122</b> can be thin, but can have sufficient thickness such that the sleeve <b>122</b> is electro-conductive. The thickness <b>126</b> of the sleeve <b>122</b> can vary depending on the frequency or wavelength of the signal being suppressed. For example, the sleeve <b>122</b> can have a thickness of at least about 2 skin depths, at least about 3 skin depths, at least about 4 skin depths, at least about 5 skin depths, at least about 7 skin depths, at least about 10 skin depths, or more, and the sleeve <b>122</b> can have a thickness <b>126</b> of no more than about 20 skin depths, no more than about 15 skin depths, no more than about 10 skin depths, no more than about 7 skin depths, no more than about 5 skin depths, or less. Depending on the target frequencies or wavelengths to suppress, the thickness <b>126</b> can be less than about 2 mm, less than about 1 mm, less than about 0.5 mm, less than about 0.25 mm, less than about 0.1 mm, or less, and the thickness <b>126</b> can be at least about 0.01 mm, at least about 0.05 mm, at least about 0.075 mm, at least about 0.1 mm, at least about 0.15 mm, at least about 0.2 mm, at least about 0.5 mm, or more, although other values can be used depending on the frequencies or wavelengths of the signals being suppressed. Other thicknesses outside of these ranges can also be used for the electro-conductive sleeves <b>112</b> disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The electro-conducive sleeve <b>122</b> can have a length <b>128</b>, which can correspond to the frequency or wavelength of the signal being suppressed. Various features and embodiments disclosed herein can relate to quarter-wave chokes. A quarter-wave choke can include a electro-conductive sleeve <b>122</b> having a length <b>128</b> of about one-fourth (0.25) the wavelength of the undesired signal being suppressed. The electro-conductive sleeve <b>122</b> of a quarter-wave choke can have a first end (e.g., the end furthest from the source (e.g., the electrical component <b>104</b>)) that is shorted (e.g., electrically coupled to the shielding layer <b>118</b>) and a second end (e.g., the end closest the source (e.g., the electrical component <b>104</b>)) that is open (e.g., not electrically coupled to the shielding layer <b>118</b>). In this configuration, the sleeve <b>122</b> can behave, or be referred to, as a quarter-wave resonator at the frequency or wavelength of the signal being suppressed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the behavior of an example quarter-wave choke can be illustrated on the Smith chart by starting at zero ohms and rotating one quarter wavelength towards the generator, or half a rotation around the Smith chart, arriving at infinity. This configuration can produce a desired high impedance, thereby effectively suppressing (e.g., blocking or attenuating) the undesired current (e.g., which can travel in the shielding layer <b>118</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">In some embodiments, the length <b>128</b> of the sleeve <b>122</b> in a quarter-wave choke does not exactly equal one-fourth (0.25) the wavelength of the signal being suppressed. For example, if the electrical cable <b>102</b> has an insulating outer jacket <b>120</b>, the velocity of propagation of the signal can be reduced, which can result in an optimal sleeve length <b>128</b> of less than one-fourth (0.25) the wavelength of the signal being suppressed. Also, in some instances, there can be fringing fields at the open and/or shorted ends of the electro-conductive sleeve, which can also modify the resonant length of the choke, which can result in an optimal sleeve length <b>128</b> that is different than one-fourth (0.25) the wavelength of the signal being suppressed. As used herein the terms &#x201c;quarter-wave choke&#x201d; and &#x201c;quarter-wave sleeve&#x201d; refer to chokes and sleeves that operate on the principles described above (e.g., an electro-conductive sleeve <b>122</b> that is open on a first end and shorted to the electrical cable <b>102</b> on the second end and/or behaving as a quarter-wave resonator), even though the actual length <b>128</b> of the electro-conductive sleeve <b>122</b> can vary depending on, for example, the thickness of the outer jacket <b>120</b>, the dielectric constant of the outer jacket <b>120</b>, and/or properties of the sleeve itself, such that the length <b>128</b> of the sleeve <b>122</b> is not equal to one-fourth (0.25) of the wavelength of the signal being suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Various features and embodiments disclosed herein can relate to half-wave chokes. A half-wave choke can include an electro-conductive sleeve <b>122</b> having a length <b>128</b> of about half (0.5) the wavelength of the undesired signal being suppressed. The electro-conductive sleeve <b>122</b> of a half-wave choke can have a both ends open (e.g., neither end electrically coupled to the shielding layer <b>118</b> of the electrical cable <b>102</b>). With neither end shorted, the electro-conductive sleeve <b>122</b> can behave, or be referred to, as a half-wave resonator at the frequency or wavelength of the signal being suppressed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the behavior of an example half-wave choke can be illustrated on the Smith chart by starting at infinity and rotating one half wavelength towards the generator, or a full rotation around the Smith chart, arriving back at infinity. This configuration can produce a desired high impedance, thereby effectively suppressing (e.g., blocking or attenuating) the undesired current (e.g., which can travel in the shielding layer <b>118</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In some embodiments, the length <b>128</b> of the sleeve <b>122</b> in a half-wave choke does not exactly equal half (0.5) the wavelength of the signal being suppressed. For example, if the electrical cable <b>102</b> has an insulating outer jacket <b>120</b>, the velocity of propagation of the signal can be reduced, which can result in an optimal sleeve length <b>128</b> of less than half (0.5) the wavelength of the signal being suppressed. Also, in some instances, there can be fringing fields at one or both of the open ends of the electro-conductive sleeve <b>122</b>, which can also modify the resonant length of the choke, which can result in an optimal sleeve length <b>128</b> that is different than half (0.5) the wavelength of the signal being suppressed. As used herein the terms &#x201c;half-wave choke&#x201d; and &#x201c;half-wave sleeve&#x201d; refer to chokes and sleeves that operate on the principles described above (e.g., an electro-conductive sleeve <b>122</b> that is open at both ends and/or behaving as a half-wave resonator), even though the actual length <b>128</b> of the electro-conductive sleeve <b>122</b> can vary depending on, for example, the thickness of the outer jacket <b>120</b>, the dielectric constant of the outer jacket <b>120</b>, and/or properties of the sleeve itself, such that the length <b>128</b> of the sleeve <b>122</b> is not equal to half (0.5) of the wavelength of the signal being suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">A quarter-wave choke can include less material than a half-wave choke that is configured to suppress a signal of the same frequency or wavelength. However, the half-wave choke can be advantageous because it does not include any electrical connection to the electrical cable <b>102</b> (e.g., to the shielding layer <b>118</b> thereof). One advantage of a half-wave choke that does not include an electrical connection to the electrical cable <b>102</b> is reduced labor and cost associated with removing the outer jacket <b>120</b> and connecting the sleeve <b>122</b> to the shielding layer <b>118</b> of a electrical cable <b>102</b>. Another advantage of a half-wave choke that does not include an electrical connection to the electrical cable <b>102</b> is improved compatibility as compared to a quarter-wave choke. For example, a half-wave choke can be used with electrical cables for which a quarter-wave choke would be impossible, impractical, or difficult (e.g., electrical cables other than coaxial cables and electrical cables that do not include a shielding layer <b>118</b>). Another advantage of a half-wave choke that does not include an electrical connection to the electrical cable is that half-wave choke can be more easily installed on existing electrical systems (e.g., in a retrofitting process).</p>

In some embodiments, an outer insulating layer <b>130</b> can be disposed over the electro-conductive sleeve <b>122</b>.

For example the material of the outer insulating layer <b>130</b> can cover the ends of the sleeve <b>122</b>, and in some embodiments, the material of the outer insulating layer <b>130</b> can contact the electrical cable <b>102</b> (e.g., the outer jacket <b>120</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a cross-sectional view of an example embodiments of a choke <b>112</b> coupled to an electrical cable <b>102</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a perspective view of the choke <b>112</b> and electrical cable <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Additional insulating (e.g., dielectric) material <b>132</b> can be disposed under the electro-conductive sleeve <b>122</b>. The additional insulating material <b>132</b> can be disposed between the sleeve <b>122</b> and the outer surface of the electrical cable <b>102</b> (e.g., the outer surface of the outer jacket <b>120</b>). In some embodiments, the additional insulating material <b>132</b> can be applied (e.g., coated or wrapped) over the outer surface of the electrical cable <b>102</b> before the electro-conductive sleeve <b>122</b> is applied thereto, or the additional insulating material <b>132</b> can be applied to an inside of the electro-conductive sleeve <b>122</b> and the sleeve <b>122</b> and additional insulating material <b>132</b> can be applied together over the electrical cable <b>102</b>. The additional insulating material can be a layer of FEP, although other insulating materials can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">As discussed above, in some cases, the electrical cable <b>102</b> can be covered in an outer jacket <b>120</b>, which can include an insulating (e.g., dielectric) material such as fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), and properties of the outer jacket <b>120</b> (e.g., the dielectric constant and the thickness of the outer jacket <b>120</b>) can be considered in optimizing the length of the electro-conductive sleeve <b>122</b>. In some instances, a thicker outer jacket <b>120</b> can result in a shorter sleeve length <b>128</b>. The additional insulating material <b>132</b> can have the effect of increasing the outer jacket <b>120</b> of the cable <b>102</b> at the portions of the cable <b>102</b> under the electro-conductive sleeve <b>122</b>. Accordingly, including additional insulating material <b>132</b> can allow for a shorter sleeve length <b>128</b>, which can use less conductive material and can encumber less of a length of the electrical cable <b>102</b>. The additional insulating material <b>132</b> can enable the choke <b>112</b> (e.g., a half-wave choke) to provide more favorable suppression of common mode EMI and/or RFI and/or other currents (e.g., by increasing the amount of suppression of undesired signals). In some embodiments, the additional insulating material <b>132</b> can also increase the effective frequency range of the choke <b>112</b>. Various embodiments are discussed herein in connection with suppression of a target frequency or wavelength or a range of frequencies or wavelengths. In some cases, a choke <b>112</b> can be configured to optimize suppression of a signal of a particular frequency or wavelength, and signals of other nearby frequencies or wavelengths can also be suppressed by the same choke <b>112</b>. For example, in various embodiments a plot of the amount of suppression provided by a choke <b>112</b> across various wavelengths or frequencies can have a curved distribution with different amounts of suppression for different wavelengths or frequencies, and in some cases a maximum amount of suppression can be achieved for a particular frequency or wavelength, sometimes referred to herein as a target frequency or wavelength. Many variations are possible, for example, in some cases the distribution of signal suppression may not have a well-defined maximum, and the target frequency or wavelength may be a particular frequency or wavelength for which the choke is configured to provide significant signal suppression even if not at a well-defined maximum of the distribution of signal suppression. Some features discussed herein are configured to increase an amount of suppression, which can result in more signal suppression for the target wavelength or frequency. In some cases, an increase in the amount of suppression applied to the target wavelength or frequency can also result in an increase of a frequency or wavelength range of effective suppression of a choke <b>112</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0149" num="0148">The first electro-conductive sleeve <b>122</b> (e.g., the length <b>128</b> thereof) and the second electro-conductive sleeve <b>136</b> (e.g., the length <b>138</b> thereof) can both be configured to suppress undesired signals. The first electro-conductive sleeve <b>122</b> can be configured to suppress a first frequency or wavelength range of signals, and the second electro-conductive sleeve <b>136</b> can be configured to suppress a second frequency or wavelength range of signals. The first range of signals (suppressed by the first sleeve <b>122</b>) can overlap with the second range of signals (suppressed by the second sleeve <b>136</b>), although in some embodiments, the first and second ranges do not overlap. In some embodiments, the sleeves <b>122</b> and <b>136</b> can be configured to suppress substantially the same frequency or wavelength range of signals. In some embodiments the second electro-conductive sleeve <b>136</b> can increase the effective frequency or wavelength range of the choke <b>112</b>. Sleeves <b>122</b> and <b>135</b> of various lengths can be used to provide various different types of signal suppression. The use of multiple sleeves <b>122</b> and <b>136</b> can effectively increase the frequency or wavelength range of the choke <b>112</b>. The electro-conductive sleeves <b>122</b> and <b>136</b> can be quarter-wave sleeves, half-wave sleeves, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the sleeves <b>122</b> and <b>136</b> can operate as coupled resonators (e.g., not independent resonators). In some embodiments, the sleeves <b>122</b> and <b>136</b> can be mutually coupled to the electrical cable <b>102</b> to facilitate suppression of undesired signals.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">In some embodiments, the optimal length <b>128</b> for the sleeve <b>122</b> can be affected by properties of the sleeve <b>136</b>, the insulating layer <b>134</b>, the additional insulating (e.g., dielectric) material <b>132</b>, the outer jacket <b>120</b>, and/or the sleeve <b>122</b>. For example, for a half-wave chokes, the actual length <b>128</b> of the sleeve <b>122</b> can be different (e.g., larger or smaller) than half (0.5) the wavelength (e.g., the free space wavelength) of the signal being suppressed.

<p id="p-0151" num="0150">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, the choke <b>112</b> can included two electro-conductive sleeves <b>122</b> and <b>136</b>. In some embodiments, additional electro-conductive sleeves (not shown) can be added to suppress additional signals or ranges of signals, or to enhance suppression of the signals suppressed by the sleeves <b>122</b> and/or <b>136</b>. For example, in some embodiments, three, four, five, or more sleeves can be used. In some embodiments, three electro-conductive sleeves can be used (e.g., positioned to be substantially concentric), and the three sleeves can be configured to suppress various frequency ranges, although more than three sleeves can be used in some embodiments. The length <b>138</b> of the second sleeve <b>136</b> can have a shorter than the length <b>128</b> of the first sleeve <b>122</b>. In some embodiments, each sleeve can have a length that is shorter than the length(s) of the sleeve(s) disposed thereunder. In some embodiments, a sleeve can have a length that is longer than one or more sleeves disposed thereunder. For example, the length <b>138</b> of the second sleeve <b>136</b> can be longer than the length <b>128</b> of the first sleeve <b>128</b>, and in some cases conductive material can extend substantially between the outside surface of the electrical cable <b>102</b> and the second sleeve <b>136</b> at the areas where the second sleeve <b>136</b> overlaps the first sleeve <b>122</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The properties of the additional insulating material <b>132</b> (e.g., thickness <b>148</b> and type of material) and/or the properties of the one or more additional electro-conductive sleeves <b>136</b> (e.g., sleeve length <b>138</b>, sleeve thickness, and sleeve material) an affect the effective frequency range of the choke <b>112</b> and the amount of suppression that is applied to the signal being suppressed. Accordingly, these parameters can be adjusted to achieve a desired effective frequency or wavelength range for the choke <b>112</b>. These parameters can also be adjusted to achieve a desired amount of signal suppression. In some cases, the amount of signal suppression can be measured as a ratio of the amount of current of the undesired signal (e.g., propagating along the shielding layer <b>118</b>) on a first side of the choke <b>112</b> (e.g., before the current reaches the choke <b>112</b>) to the amount of current of the undesired signal on a second side of the choke (e.g., after the current passes the choke <b>112</b>). If the choke <b>112</b> did not suppress the current, the ratio would be one to one. Increased signal suppression results in a higher ratio of the current on the first side of the choke <b>112</b> to the current on the second side of the choke <b>112</b>. In some embodiments, the amount of suppression applied of the undesired signal can be measured as the ratio of the amount of current that is present external to the electrical cable <b>102</b> (e.g., propagating in the choke <b>112</b>) to the amount of undesired current that is propagating in the electrical cable <b>102</b> (e.g., in the shielding layer <b>118</b> or insulating layers <b>116</b> and/or <b>120</b> of the cable <b>102</b>).

<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In some embodiments, the choke <b>112</b> can be configured to suppress passive intermodulation (PIM). PIM can occur, for example, when two or more signals (e.g., high power tones) mix at device nonlinearities. The nonlinearities can be caused by junctions between dissimilar metals, between coaxial cables, between connectors, between mounting hardware, between like metals that are not atomically clean, etc. PIM can occur, for example, in multi-frequency communication systems (e.g., antenna arrays, land mobile radio sites, and/or satellite earth stations), where multiple signals (e.g., high power signals) of different frequencies are produced. Various example embodiments of chokes <b>112</b> disclosed herein can be configured to not produce PIM, or to produce low amounts of PIM as compared to other types of signal suppressors (e.g., ferrite beads). For example, the choke <b>112</b> can include substantially no nonlinearities. In some embodiments, the electro-conductive sleeve <b>122</b> can be a continuous piece of material that extends around a full cross-sectional perimeter of the electrical wire <b>102</b>. For example, the electro-conductive sleeve <b>122</b> can be seamless, and the sleeve <b>122</b> can be an extruded or drawn piece of tubing. In some embodiments, the electro-conductive sleeve <b>122</b> can include substantially no nonlinearities.

The slot <b>150</b> can have a small width, in some embodiments. For example, gap in the choke of about 10 mils can be sufficient. The width of the slot <b>150</b> can be large enough in some embodiments so as to substantially prevent current &#x201c;arc&#x201d; across the gap. The width of the slot <b>150</b> can be small enough that the choke <b>112</b> can effectively mitigate PIM and can also be configured to suppress undesired signals (e.g., as a &#xbd; wave open ended choke configured to suppress EMI and/or PMI), as discussed herein. In some embodiments, the slot <b>150</b> can have a width from about 0.1 mm to about 1 mm, from about 0.25 mm to about 0.75 mm, of about 0.25 mm, or of about 0.5 mm, although other values (e.g., outside of these ranges) can also be used. The slot <b>150</b> can have a substantially uniform width across substantially the full length of the slot <b>150</b>, although in some embodiments, the slot <b>150</b> can have a width that varies (e.g., tapers or osculates) across the length of the slot <b>150</b>. In some embodiments, the slot <b>150</b> can have a substantially uniform width across at least about 25%, at least about 50%, at least about 75%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 98%, at least about 99%, or the full length of the slot <b>150</b>, or across 99% or less, or 98% or less, or 95% or less, or 85% or less, or 75% or less, or 50% or less, or 25% or less of the full length of the slot <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">In some embodiments, metallic contact causing PIM can be mitigated by use of a continuous sleeve such as seamless extruded or drawn tubing. In some embodiments, the sleeve <b>122</b> can be wrapped around the cable <b>102</b>. The ends of the wrapped sleeve <b>122</b> can be spaced apart to form the slot <b>150</b>. In some embodiments, the ends can be joined. For example, the ends of the sleeve <b>122</b> can be welded together, soldered together, or joined by a conducting adhesive, etc., in a manner that reduces or eliminates nonlinearities. In some embodiments soldering or welding, etc., can induce non-linearities that can be insubstantial. In some embodiments, the slot <b>150</b> can be at least partially filled with a material <b>152</b>, which can be different than the material of the sleeve <b>122</b>, as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. In some embodiments, a solder, or an adhesive material (e.g., a conductive adhesive), can be used to join or secure the ends of the sleeve <b>122</b> together. In some embodiments, a conductive material (e.g., a metal) can be used to join or secure one or more of the ends of the sleeve <b>122</b>. In some embodiments, an insulating (e.g., dielectric) material (e.g., FEP or PVC) can join the ends of the sleeve <b>122</b> and/or can at least partially fill the slot <b>150</b> formed between the ends of the sleeve <b>122</b>. In some embodiments, the slot <b>150</b> can be at least partially, of substantially completely, filled with air or other gaseous material. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, in some embodiments, an outer insulating layer <b>130</b> (e.g., an outer jacket disposed over the choke <b>112</b>) can have a portion that at least partially fills or substantially fills the slot <b>150</b>. In some embodiments, the additional insulating material <b>132</b> (which can optionally be disposed between the sleeve <b>122</b> and the outer jacket <b>120</b> of the cable <b>102</b>) can extend into the slot <b>150</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>.

An area near the second end of the sleeve <b>122</b> can be disposed over (radially outward of) an area near the first end of the sleeve <b>122</b>. A slot <b>150</b> can be disposed between the overlapping end portions of the sleeve <b>122</b>. In some embodiments, an electrically insulating (e.g., dielectric) material can be disposed between the overlapping end portions of the sleeve <b>122</b>. For example, the additional insulating material <b>132</b> (which can optionally be disposed between the sleeve <b>122</b> and the outer jacket <b>120</b> of the cable <b>102</b>) can extend into the slot <b>150</b> formed between the end portions of the sleeve <b>122</b>. In some embodiments, the additional insulating material <b>132</b> can fill at least a part of or substantially the entire slot <b>150</b>. An outer jacket (now shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> can fill at least part of, or substantially the entire, slot <b>150</b>. In some embodiments, material of an outer jacket (not shown) can extend into the slot <b>150</b> and can fill the slot <b>150</b> partially or substantially completely. In some embodiments, the end portions of the sleeve <b>122</b> are capacitively coupled (e.g., such that the end portions of the sleeve <b>122</b> can form, or operate as, a capacitor).</p>

Accordingly, properties of the slot <b>150</b> (e.g., the width of the slot <b>150</b> and the type of filling material) can be used in determining the length <b>128</b> for the sleeve <b>122</b>, and in some cases re-optimization may be performed to account for the slot <b>150</b>, filling material, and/or other features of the choke <b>112</b>.</p>

In some embodiments, two or more of the panels <b>156</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>can have substantially the same length and can cooperate to suppress an undesired signal of a the same frequency or wavelength or range thereof. For example, opposing panels <b>156</b><i>a </i>and <b>156</b><i>c </i>can have substantially the same length as each other (e.g., a first length), while opposing panels <b>156</b><i>b </i>and <b>156</b><i>d </i>can have substantially the same length as each other (e.g., a second length that is different (e.g., shorter) than the first length).

    </ul>
    </li>

</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0178">Depending on the above-identified factors, the actual or optimal length for a half-wave sleeve can be different (e.g., larger or smaller) from the distance of half the wavelength in free space by less than or equal to about 1%, less than or equal to about 3%, less than or equal to about 5%, less than or equal to about 10%, less than or equal to about 15%, less than or equal to about 20%, less than or equal to about 30%, less than or equal to about 40%, less than or equal to about 50%, less than or equal to about 75%, or less than or equal to about 95%, by at least about 1%, at least about 2%, at least about 3%, at least about 5%, at least about 7%, at least about 10%, at least about 15%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 50%, at least about 70%, or at least about 90%. By way of example, if the outer jacket and/or the additional insulating material have sufficient thickness, the length of the half-wave sleeve can be shortened enough that the length of the half-wave sleeve is actually closer to the value of one-fourth (0.25) the free space wavelength being suppressed than to the value of half (0.5) the free space wavelength being suppressed. In some embodiments, a half-wave sleeve can be configured to suppress a signal having a target wavelength for the signal propagating in the structure in which the signal propagates. For example, an undesired signal can propagate in the insulating outer jacket <b>120</b>, on the outside of the shielding layer <b>118</b>, of an electrical cable <b>102</b>. Accordingly, the signal propagating in the insulating outer jacket <b>120</b> can have a wavelength that is smaller than the wavelength of the signal in free space. Thus, in this example, a half-wave sleeve <b>122</b> that is configured to suppress the undesired signal can have a length that is less than the half the free space wavelength of the signal. However, the length of the half-wave sleeve <b>122</b> can be about half the wavelength of the signal as propagating in the insulating outer jacket <b>120</b> outside the shielding layer <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0179">To determine the appropriate length for a half-wave sleeve, the length of half (0.5) the wavelength in free space of the undesirable signal being suppressed can be used as a base or starting point, and the length can be adjusted (e.g., shortened or lengthened) based at least in part on the values for one or more of the variables identified above. For example, if additional insulating material is included (e.g., increasing the effective thickness of the outer jacket), the length of the sleeve can be shortened to accommodate the additional insulating (e.g., dielectric) material. The adjustment for fringing fields may be calculated by either analytical or numerical methods, or may be determined experimentally. In some embodiments, two or more of the above-identified factors can be considered in the order set forth above, although the factors can be considered in various other orders as well. In some embodiments, two or more of the factors can be considered together. The length of the sleeve can be determined by first considering the frequency of the signal to be suppressed. Then, the length of the sleeve can be adjusted by considering the diameter of the cable and/or the thickness of the outer jacket. Then, the length of the sleeve can be adjusted by considering the dielectric constant of the outer jacket of the cable. Then, the length of the sleeve can be adjusted to accommodate for fringe effects of the sleeve. Various other orders, or other alternatives, are possible. In some embodiments, the sleeve can be re-optimized at multiple steps (e.g., at each step) of the optimization process, which can facilitate confirmation that the sleeve is performing in the frequency range desired. The length of the sleeve can be determined using computer hardware that includes one or more computer processors, as discussed herein.</p>
