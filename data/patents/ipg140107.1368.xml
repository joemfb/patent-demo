<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Image projectors with increased light intensity and methods for providing brighter images are provided. Image projectors, described herein, can provide the brightness while still providing any or all of compactness, low power consumption, and long lifetime. To increase brightness, sectional mirrors are used to respectively compress the light from two light sources into a single pupil (e.g. an aperture) of an imaging device. The compression can be accomplished by regions (e.g. sections) of the mirror having different angles with respect to the pupil. Relatively little light may be lost in the compression since minima for a light intensity pattern from a light source may occur between the regions that reflect the light.</p>

No. 10/427,946, filed May 2, 2003, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to image projectors, and more specifically to image projectors having high intensity (brightness) and/or luminosity (total amount of light).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Most projection systems today uses ultra high pressure (UHP) lamps, e.g. Mercury arc lamps, with wattage from 120 W-350 W and a lifetime of typical 1500-4000 h. These projectors are compact and portable with brightness level of typical 1000-5000 lumens. Most of these projectors are single lamp solutions. These arc lamp projectors are typically for home or office use where the space is relatively small.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Projectors used for digital cinema, large venues, and for fixed installations have a typical brightness of 10,000-30,000 lm. These projectors typically use Xenon lamps with wattage range of 2-6 KW. However, a typical lifetime for a Xenon lamp is 500-1500 hours. Accordingly, the tradeoff is that the Xenon lamps have a shorter lifetime but a higher brightness (luminosity).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, it is desirable to have projectors that use arc lamps to obtain a longer lifetime, that also provide the brightness of the Xenon lamps. Also, it may also be desirable to have Xenon projectors with even more brightness.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As previously mentioned, most of the image projectors use one lamp. To provide more brightness, image projectors do use multiple lamps. However, these lamps combine light from the multiple lamps in an inefficient manner. Typically, the light collection will be only typical 2 to 2.5 times a single lamp solution.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is therefore desirable to multiple lamp systems that provide greater efficiency and brightness.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments of the present invention provide image projectors with increased light intensity (brightness) relative to known models using multiple light sources. For example, certain embodiments meet the needs for high brightness, while still providing any or all of compactness, low power consumption, and long lifetime. Regarding the increased brightness, embodiments of the present invention advantageously can produce flux levels that are 1.5 times or better than other known systems. This increase can reduce power consumption, material cost, and operating cost.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To increase brightness, embodiments use mirrors to respectively compress the light from two light sources into a single pupil (e.g. an aperture) of an imaging device. In one aspect, the light from one source is compressed into about half of the pupil. The compression is accomplished by regions (e.g. sections) of the mirror having different angles with respect to the pupil. In one embodiment, relatively little light is lost in the compression since steps, which are between the regions, occur where a light pattern from a light source is at a minimum node.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to one exemplary embodiment, an image projection system is provided. Two sources each provide electromagnetic (EM) radiation in opposing directions. A first reflective surface reflects EM radiation from the first source. A second reflective surface reflects EM radiation from the second source. An imager has a pupil that receives the reflected EM radiation. The imager uses the received EM radiation to create an image.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A first half of the pupil receives reflected EM radiation from the first source, and a second half of the pupil receives reflected EM radiation from the second source. Each reflective surface includes a plurality of regions that are flat in at least one direction. A first region of each reflective surface has a smaller angle relative to a line perpendicular to the pupil than does a second region, which is farther from the pupil than the first region.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to one exemplary embodiment, a method of creating an image is provided. Two sources (although more may be used) provide electromagnetic (EM) radiation in opposing directions. A first reflective surface reflects EM radiation from the first source to a first half of a pupil of an imager. A second reflective surface reflects EM radiation from the second source to a second half of the pupil. The imager uses the received EM radiation to create an image with the imager.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Each reflective surface includes a plurality of regions that are flat in at least one direction, for example, in a direction towards the pupil. A first region of each reflective surface has a smaller angle relative to a line perpendicular to the pupil than does a second region of each reflective surface, where each first region is closer to the pupil than each second region.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Embodiments of the present invention provide image projectors with increased light intensity (brightness) relative to known models using multiple light sources. To increase brightness, embodiments use mirrors to respectively compress the light from two light sources into a single pupil (e.g. an aperture) of an imaging device.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, the light from each light source creates a node intensity light pattern, which is focused on a respective stepped mirror. In one aspect, the light received at a stepped mirror has the same f-number as an entrance pupil of an imager. Each stepped mirror can compress its received light to 50% of the entrance pupil. The light reflected from the stepped mirror will transmit into the optical system and focused on the imager.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram of an image projector <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. Light from sources <b>110</b> is used to create an image, which is then displayed as projected image <b>190</b>. Herein, light refers to any electromagnetic (EM) radiation, and not just to visible light. Herein, the two terms light and electromagnetic radiation are used interchangeably.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment, the light sources <b>110</b> may include a single lamp or include any arrangement of multiple lamps (including the one shown), which produce light from electricity in any suitable manner known or to be developed. Although it common to use UHP types of lamps for the light sources, embodiments may use any type of light sources, including light emitting diodes (LEDs) and lasers. In another embodiment, the light sources <b>110</b> are light emitting sources that do not produce light from electricity, such as from other EM radiation or fields, or thermal energy.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown, light sources <b>110</b> provide electromagnetic radiation in opposing directions. Herein, the term &#x201c;opposing&#x201d; means that some component of the lights rays from the respective sources <b>110</b> are provided in opposite directions. Here, the two opposite directions are up and down.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one embodiment, light disperses from an outlet of a light source <b>110</b>. The dispersed light is then collected into relay lenses <b>120</b>. In one aspect, the relay lenses <b>120</b> have a diameter big enough to collect almost all (e.g. greater than 90%, and preferably greater than 955) of the light energy from the lamps <b>110</b>, and focus the light onto a respective reflective surface <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Each reflective surface <b>130</b> has a sectional surface, for example, a stepped mirror surface. The surfaces <b>130</b> are reflective in that at least part of the surface is reflective. However, not every part of the surface is necessarily reflective. The parts that are reflective reflect almost all of the light, e.g., greater than 90% of the incident light, and preferably greater than 95% of the light.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The reflective light from the surfaces <b>130</b> is received by an imager <b>140</b> via a pupil <b>145</b>. In one embodiment, the pupil is a simple opening. In another embodiment, the pupil is a transmissive object that allows light to pass through it, although the transmissive object may bend the light.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The reflective surface <b>130</b> includes regions <b>132</b> (e.g. sections) that are flat in at least one direction, with steps <b>136</b> between the regions <b>132</b>. These regions reflect the light form the sources <b>110</b> to the pupil <b>145</b>. As shown, the regions <b>132</b> are flat in a direction from right to left. In other words, a cross section of the surface <b>130</b> in a plane that is perpendicular to the pupil has regions that are flat. As user herein, the term &#x201c;flat&#x201d; means that as one moves in a particular direction along the surface in the region, a direction of the movement does not change (e.g. curve up or down) on a macroscopic scale, i.e. larger than minor chips in the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one embodiment, the regions are curved in a direction perpendicular to the cross section shown, i.e. in the direction out of the paper. In another embodiment, the regions <b>132</b> are flat in the direction perpendicular to the cross section. In one aspect, the regions may have steps in this direction perpendicular to the cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The regions <b>132</b> advantageously have different angles relative to the line <b>142</b>. For example, a region farther from the pupil <b>145</b> has an angle that is larger than the angle for a region closer to the pupil <b>145</b>. In this manner, a region <b>132</b><i>a </i>farther from the pupil <b>145</b> can be situated higher than a top edge of the pupil <b>145</b>, but still reflect light into the pupil <b>145</b>. Also, a region closer to the pupil <b>145</b> can reflect light into a different location within the pupil <b>145</b> than region <b>132</b> does, without reflecting light into the lower half of the pupil <b>145</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one embodiment, the angle for each region increases as the distance to the pupil becomes shorter. For instance, the region closest to the pupil may have a 45&#xb0; with the line <b>142</b>. The region would thus reflect light horizontal to line <b>142</b>. The angle for the farthest respective region may have the largest angle and reflect light to the lowest or highest point on the pupil. The angle larger than 45&#xb0; allows the region to be located below the lowest point of the pupil <b>145</b>, but still reflect light into the pupil <b>145</b>. In one aspect, almost all of the reflected light can be received by the pupil <b>145</b> and still have a relatively homogeneous light distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Such embodiments have advantages over other arrangements or structures. For example, as shown, the height of the pupil <b>145</b> is smaller than the total height of the two surfaces <b>130</b> combined. If the surface <b>130</b> had a single flat region having one angle (e.g. 45 degrees), then the light incident on the far edges of the surface <b>130</b> would not reflect into the pupil <b>145</b>. Although it may be possible to use a different angle than 45&#xb0; to reflect light from the outer edges of single surfaces in this inferior arrangement, an uneven brightness in the image would result.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">After light is received by the pupil <b>145</b>, the imager <b>140</b> uses the light to create an image, e.g. by modulating different parts (potentially for different colors or wavelengths) corresponding to different pixels of an image. The modulated light (i.e. the image) is then sent to a projection lens <b>150</b>, which is configured to project the image onto an external surface to create the projected image <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, more than two light sources may be used. For example, two other light sources may provide light in a perpendicular direction to the light sources shown. These light sources may be directly above and below the reflective surfaces <b>130</b>. In this embodiment, two other reflective surfaces would also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a lamp <b>200</b> that may be used as a light source and a resulting light intensity pattern <b>250</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. As depicted, the lamp <b>200</b> is an arc lamp, although other lamps may be used in other embodiments of the invention. Types of arc lamps include ultra-high performance or ultra-high pressure (UHP) lamps (e.g. containing Mercury), as well as other lamps that have a short arc gap. Exemplary arc-gaps are from 0.7 mm-1.5 mm with a wattage of between 120-500 W.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Electrodes <b>210</b> produce electric discharges (arcs) <b>220</b>. These arcs <b>220</b> emit light rays <b>240</b>. Typically, these light rays <b>240</b> are emitted generally in all directions. A reflector <b>230</b> is used to focus the rays <b>240</b> to provide a more concentrated beam of light. Given that the arc <b>220</b> is not a perfect point of light, the rays <b>240</b> reflected from the reflector <b>240</b> will travel different distances and a diffraction (intensity) node pattern <b>250</b> results. Thus, different points will have different intensities.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, other node patterns may be created via other mechanisms. For example, a node pattern may be created from a uniform pattern, which has already been compressed. This new node pattern may then be compressed again to create the light at pupil <b>145</b>. In this manner, a multi-level compression mechanism may be achieved. In one embodiment, each light source could include reflective light surfaces <b>230</b> to perform a first level of compression, or compression for any subsequent or prior level of compression.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Embodiments account for this resulting intensity node pattern to achieve greater efficiency. In one embodiment, the flat regions <b>132</b> are aligned with the high intensity nodes so that an optimal amount of light is reflected into pupil <b>145</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic diagram of an image projector <b>300</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, each light source described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is composed of two lamps <b>305</b>. Thus, in general, the illumination for image projector <b>300</b> includes four lamps; however, each light source may be made of any number of lamps.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Each lamp <b>305</b> is positioned to transmit light into respective light guides <b>308</b> (also called an integrator) that are each optically connected to a collective light guide <b>312</b>. The optical connection may be accomplished in any number of ways, e.g., via methods described in the Andersen patent, referenced above.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown, the two lamps <b>305</b> of each light source are in parallel configuration, which allows the lamps to be rotated around its own axis. In other embodiments, the lamps are in other configurations. In one embodiment, the lamp <b>305</b> needs to burn and emit light in a horizontal direction within about +/&#x2212;20 degrees from normal because a vertical burning direction would reduce lamp lifetime significant, e.g., due to burn back of the electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The lamps <b>305</b> have a focus point close to the light guides <b>308</b>. In one embodiment, the light guide are solid and act as an integrator of the light. In one aspect, the surface of the light guides <b>308</b> at which the focus point is located is anti-reflection (AR) coated to reduce the level of back reflection in the transition between air and the surface (e.g. the glass of the light guide).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The light in the integrator <b>308</b> is reflected by an angled mirror surface (e.g. 45&#xb0;) coated directly on the light integrator. The light is then reflected again in the solid light integrator on an angled (e.g. 45&#xb0;) mirror coated surface on another end of the solid light integrator. The exit side of the light integrator <b>308</b> is AR coated to achieve maximum light transmission in the transition between glass and air.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The light travels from the solid light integrator <b>308</b> to the collection light integrator <b>312</b>. In one embodiment, the collection light integrator is of a hollow type, e.g., where 4 pieces of surface mirrors are glued together and form a hollow light tunnel In one aspect, the cross section of the collecting light integrator <b>312</b> has similar format as the final image. As user herein the term &#x201c;format&#x201d; refers to an aspect ration of the sides of the image, for example, 16:9, 4:3, etc. In another aspect, the entrance cross section of the integrator <b>312</b> is twice the length of the exit cross section of the solid light integrators <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In one embodiment, the collecting light integrator <b>312</b> has a length such that the light is uniformly integrated by multiple reflections from the collecting light integrator mirror surfaces. Ideally, the exit cross section of the collecting light integrator <b>312</b> should be free of chips from the mirror surface or any dust from the edge that will be focused into the imager <b>340</b>. Any dust or chips on this cross section will be visible on a focused image from the projector <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The light are then collected into relay lenses <b>320</b> with diameter big enough to collect all (or almost all) of the light energy from the lamps <b>305</b>, and focus the light intensity node pattern from the light integrators onto the reflective surfaces <b>330</b> (e.g. a stepped mirror surface). The light intensity node pattern on the surfaces <b>330</b> is a virtual mapping of the light spots from the light integrators <b>308</b> entrance. In one embodiment, the solid light integrators <b>308</b> for the depicted parallel position lamp have a same cross section and length to beneficially create a node pattern with well defined maximums and minimums. In one aspect, if the integrators do not have a same cross section the node pattern may be destroyed.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a simulation plot of the light intensity node pattern <b>410</b> focused on the stepped mirror <b>400</b>, where the mirror steps are matched with the created light intensity node pattern according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown, the node patterns shows peaks as one moves from left to right. The highest peak shown roughly corresponds to the center of the mirror. Additionally, peaks can be seen as one moves up and down from a middle of the mirror.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one aspect, the flat regions <b>432</b> are located at or near the peaks, and the steps <b>436</b> are located at or near the minimums of the node pattern. This configuration is able to reflect almost all of the light. For example, in one embodiment, about 90%-95%. In one embodiment, the steps are not reflective, for instance, because very little light is received by them.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Therefore, referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each stepped mirror surface <b>330</b> compresses the illumination of the entrance pupil to about 50% from each stepped mirror unit. Thus, by designing a stepped mirror <b>330</b> where each mirror surface has a dimension and an angle matched to reflect the light intensity node pattern into the pupil <b>345</b>, all (or almost all) of the light energy from a light source illuminates approximately 50% of the pupil <b>345</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown, the pupil <b>345</b> is a lens that is attached to a total internal reflection (TIR) prism <b>348</b> where the surface of the lens is AR coated and the lens is glued, aligned and fixed in x-y-z position to the TIR prism <b>348</b>. In one embodiment, the TIR prism <b>348</b> is a 2 glass block component where there is air gap between the glass substrates of typical 5-25 micron meter. The light is reflected in the TIR surface and illuminates the digital micromirror device (DMD) <b>342</b> from Texas Instrument, US, or other imaging device.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A DMD is a mirror device that consists of a pixel matrix of mirror tilted, e.g., +/&#x2212;12 degrees to obtain an On/Off state. The DMD reflects the light into the projection lens when the DMD is ON position. In one embodiment, to avoid any reflections into the projection lens, the DMD reflects the light in a dump light area of the optical engine when the DMD is in Off position. Such reflection can reduce the contrast of the projected image.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Compression of light from a light source by a stepped mirror is now further described, particularly with regard to the location of the steps.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a schematic diagram of part of an image projector according to an embodiment of the present invention. Two lamps <b>505</b> are shown in one illumination axis. The stepped mirror <b>530</b> compresses the illumination from the lamps <b>505</b> to only illuminate 50% of the entrance pupil <b>545</b> of an imager. In one aspect, such compression can effectively double the light intensity for the area of the pupil <b>545</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown, the solid rays <b>517</b> correspond to peaks in a light intensity node pattern provided from collective light guide <b>512</b>. The mirrors <b>532</b> are located so that the solid rays <b>517</b> (i.e. the peaks) are reflected to the pupil <b>545</b>. The dashed rays <b>519</b> signify any light rays that are at the minimums in the node pattern. The rays <b>519</b> are incident on the stepped mirror at steps <b>536</b>, which do not reflect the rays <b>519</b> to the pupil <b>545</b>. However, as few of the rays <b>519</b> exist, the stepped mirror <b>530</b> can accomplish compressing most of the illumination to half (half A as shown) of the pupil <b>545</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The steps <b>519</b> occur so that different mirror regions <b>532</b> can have their angle with line <b>542</b> adjusted to appropriate values in order to compress the illumination to half A of the pupil <b>545</b>. Ideally, the change from one mirror to another is as short as possible. Accordingly, in one embodiment, a step has a surface with an orientation within a range of 90 degrees from perpendicular to the received EM radiation to parallel to the EM radiation with the surface facing away from the pupil <b>545</b>. In other words, the step <b>536</b> is horizontal, vertical (face to the left), or somewhere in between.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Additionally, in one embodiment, the mirrors <b>532</b> may be curved in a direction perpendicular (i.e. transverse&#x2014;out of the paper) to the cross section shown. In another embodiment, there are different mirror sections in the transverse direction. These embodiments may provide a greater illumination as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown, the central ray <b>517</b><i>a </i>is transformed into the ray <b>521</b><i>a </i>that is received by the pupil <b>545</b>. The ray <b>517</b><i>a </i>occurs at the greatest height of the relay lens <b>520</b> (i.e. from top to bottom of the relay lens <b>520</b>). However, the ray <b>521</b><i>a </i>occurs at a point between the middle <b>547</b> and the narrow end <b>549</b> of the pupil lens <b>545</b>. Thus, the height at this point may be less than the height of the relay lends <b>520</b> at its middle. Accordingly, embodiments compress the ray <b>517</b><i>a </i>in the vertical direction (i.e. in direction into/out of the paper).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">To compress the illumination in this direction, a similar mechanism as the compression in the other direction (as described above) may be used. For example, a greater angle from a plane perpendicular to the cross-section shown may be used for regions of a mirror that correspond to the top and the bottom of the relay lens <b>520</b>. As another example, mirror regions that are above a central plane perpendicular to the pupil are tilted so that an angle between a respective region and the central plane is less than 90 degrees. The central plane cuts the pupil in half The central plane would be a horizontal plane, i.e. in the same plane as the cross-section shown. This titled mirror region would reflect the light with a component in a downward direction so that the light would be compressed. Similarly, a mirror region below the central plane would reflect light upwards.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As mentioned above, different lamp configurations may be used as a light source. Examples of other configurations are as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> show alternative configurations for lamps of light sources according to an embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the lamps <b>605</b> provide light in opposing directions into light guides <b>608</b>, which are also in opposing directions. These light guides then transmit the light into a collective light guide <b>612</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the lamps provide light in perpendicular directions to the light guides <b>608</b>, which are also perpendicular to each other. These light guides also then transmit the light into a collective light guide <b>612</b>. In other embodiments, different configurations may be combined to provide light sources with more than two lamps, e.g. combining these two configurations so that 3 lamps are used.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Embodiments also provide modulation of different colors of the light sources.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a color modulator <b>725</b> placed between a lamp <b>705</b> and a light integrator <b>708</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. In one aspect, the color modulator <b>725</b> is close or at a focus point of the reflector of the lamp. The color modulators <b>725</b> operate to filter certain wavelengths (or colors) of a light source. Such operation is further described in the Andersen patent, referenced above. In one embodiment, each lamp <b>705</b> has its own color modulator, which are synchronized to each other during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> shows a color wheel with 4 segments, shows here by Red, Green, Blue and White, according to an embodiment of the present invention.

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The description above has been focused on single display systems; however, embodiments may also be used with multiple display systems, or in non display solutions.</p>
