<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to portable electronic devices with an antenna and a power transfer coil. The invention will be described in the context of wireless power transfer in which the power transfer coil functions as an energy-receiving coil that wirelessly receives energy in order to, for example, charge a battery included with the portable electronic device. However, it will be appreciated that the invention is not limited to this particular use.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Portable electronic devices such as mobile phones and netbook computers include antennas for signal transmission and reception to carry out wireless communication functions. However, in view of the growth of wireless charging technology and increasing research efforts in this technology, it is envisaged that many portable electronic devices, including mobile phones and netbook computers, will be re-designed in the near future to embed an energy-receiving coil for wireless charging purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Thus, portable electronic devices with telecommunication functions will require both an antenna for transmitting and receiving RF signals and an energy-receiving coil, which is also called the secondary coil in a wireless battery charging system. With the associated circuitry, this energy-receiving coil is sometimes called the receiver module. To ensure trouble-free operation, and to meet the wireless charging requirements of industry-wide standards and protocols, future portable devices need to have an antenna and an energy-receiving coil that each work independently without adversely affecting the operation of the other.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An antenna inside a mobile phone, for example, could be in the form of a metal plate. If this metal plate is subject to an AC magnetic field (as one would experience in wireless charging), an eddy current can be induced in the antenna, resulting in unwanted induction heating and a reduction in energy efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Also, to prevent the charging flux from inducing eddy currents in the metallic parts of the portable electronic devices, some form of electromagnetic (EM) shielding may be required for the energy-receiving coil. However, such EM shielding may reduce the strength of the transmitted and received signal in the antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the disadvantages of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE BEST MODE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to the figures, a portable electronic device <b>1</b> is provided in accordance with the present invention. The portable electronic device includes an antenna <b>2</b> having a major planar cross-section <b>3</b>, and a power transfer coil <b>4</b> having windings <b>5</b> parallel to a coil plane <b>6</b>, the coil plane extending to the perimeter of the power transfer coil. The antenna <b>2</b> and the power transfer coil <b>4</b> are arranged such that the major planar cross-section <b>3</b> is substantially perpendicular to the coil plane <b>6</b> if a line <b>7</b> directed perpendicularly from the coil plane <b>6</b> intersects the major planar cross-section <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Put another way, the antenna <b>2</b> and the power transfer coil <b>4</b> are arranged such that the major planar cross-section <b>3</b> is substantially perpendicular to the coil plane <b>6</b> if the coil plane overlaps the orthographic projection of the major planar cross-section <b>3</b> onto a projective plane <b>8</b> containing the coil plane <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, such as the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>a </i>and <b>7</b><i>b</i>, the major planar cross-section <b>3</b> is substantially perpendicular to the coil plane <b>6</b> regardless of whether a line <b>7</b> directed perpendicularly from the coil plane <b>6</b> intersects the major planar cross-section <b>3</b>. In other embodiments, such as the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref><i>a </i>and <b>8</b><i>b</i>, no line <b>7</b> directed perpendicularly from the coil plane <b>6</b> intersects the major planar cross-section <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">It will be appreciated that in further embodiments, such as the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b</i>, the major planar cross-section <b>3</b> is substantially perpendicular to the coil plane <b>6</b> and no line <b>7</b> directed perpendicularly from the coil plane <b>6</b> intersects the major planar cross-section <b>3</b>. Thus, these embodiments combine the embodiments exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>a</i>, <b>7</b><i>b</i>, <b>8</b><i>a </i>and <b>8</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In other words, in embodiments of the type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>a </i>and <b>7</b><i>b</i>, the antenna <b>2</b> and the power transfer coil <b>4</b> are arranged such that the major planar cross-section <b>3</b> is substantially perpendicular to the coil plane <b>6</b> regardless of whether the coil plane overlaps the orthographic projection of the major planar cross-section <b>3</b> onto the projective plane <b>8</b>. In embodiments of the type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref><i>a </i>and <b>8</b><i>b</i>, the antenna <b>2</b> and the power transfer coil <b>4</b> are arranged such that the coil plane <b>6</b> does not overlap the orthographic projection of the major planar cross-section <b>3</b> onto the projective plane <b>8</b>. In the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b</i>, the antenna <b>2</b> and the power transfer coil <b>4</b> are arranged such that the coil plane <b>6</b> does not overlap the orthographic projection of the major planar cross-section <b>3</b> onto the projective plane <b>8</b> and the major planar cross-section <b>3</b> is substantially perpendicular to the coil plane <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The portable electronic device <b>1</b> further includes a signal shield <b>9</b>. The orthographic projection of the signal shield <b>9</b> onto the projective plane <b>8</b> containing the coil plane <b>6</b> covers the orthographic projection of the power transfer coil <b>4</b> onto the projective plane <b>8</b>. Where such a signal shield is included, the coil plane <b>6</b> extends to the perimeter of the orthographic projection of the signal shield onto the projective plane <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In other words, the signal shield <b>9</b> has a position and an extent to shield against any magnetic field that passes through the power transfer coil <b>4</b>. As such, the signal shield <b>9</b> can function to shield the other components in the portable electronic device to minimise the formation of eddy currents in those other components. Preferably, the power transfer coil <b>4</b> and the signal shield <b>9</b> form part of a power transfer module <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The portable electronic device <b>1</b> includes an exterior surface <b>11</b> adapted to be positioned adjacent a power transfer surface <b>12</b>. When so positioned, magnetic field lines <b>13</b> can pass through the power transfer coil <b>4</b> substantially perpendicularly to the coil plane <b>6</b> thereby to induce a voltage across the power transfer coil. In the present embodiments, the power transfer coil <b>4</b> is adjacent and substantially parallel to the exterior surface <b>11</b>, and the magnetic field lines <b>13</b> emanate substantially perpendicularly from the power transfer surface <b>12</b>. Further, the power transfer surface <b>12</b> is substantially horizontal and the exterior surface <b>11</b> is adapted to rest on top of the power transfer surface <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The power transfer coil <b>4</b>, of the present embodiments, functions as an energy-receiving coil and the power transfer surface <b>12</b> forms part of a wireless charging pad <b>14</b> to charge the portable electronic device <b>1</b> through the power transfer coil. Thus, the power transfer module <b>10</b> functions as an energy-receiving module in these embodiments. It will be appreciated that in other embodiments, the power transfer coil <b>4</b> can also function to transmit energy as an energy-transmitting coil, which can form part of an energy-transmitting module, which in turn can include, for example, a signal shield similar to the signal shield <b>9</b>. In particular, power is transferred, that is, received or transmitted, wirelessly through inductive coupling, for example, with another power transfer coil. The power transfer coil <b>4</b> can also function to communicate wirelessly through inductive coupling.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The shape of the power transfer coil <b>4</b> and the power transfer module <b>10</b> can be circular, rectangular or any polygonal shape. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref>, <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> show some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The exterior surface <b>11</b> forms at least a portion of a major exterior face <b>15</b> of the portable electronic device <b>1</b>. In some embodiments, such as the present embodiments, the portable electronic device <b>1</b> includes a first face <b>16</b> having a user interface <b>17</b> and a second face <b>18</b> opposite the first face, the second face being the major exterior face <b>15</b>. Thus, the portable electronic device <b>1</b> can still be used during wireless power transfer, such as charging, through the power transfer coil <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">For example, where the portable electronic device <b>1</b> is in the form of a mobile phone, the first face <b>16</b> is the front of the mobile phone and the second face <b>18</b> is the back of the mobile phone. Furthermore, the user interface <b>17</b> is, for example, a screen and a keypad, which are typically included with mobile phones. In another example, the portable electronic device <b>1</b> is in the form of a portable computer, such as a netbook computer, and the first face <b>16</b> is the top of the portable computer and the second face <b>18</b> is the underside of the portable computer. The user interface <b>17</b> can be, for example, a keyboard or a touchpad.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The embodiments of the portable electronic devices <b>1</b> described have one antenna <b>2</b> and one power transfer coil <b>4</b>. Other embodiments can have a plurality of the antennas <b>2</b> and a plurality of the power transfer coils <b>4</b>. Preferably, in these embodiments, each antenna <b>2</b> is arranged relative to each power transfer coil <b>4</b> as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The antenna <b>2</b> of the present embodiments is in the form of a metallic plate, having a planar face <b>19</b> of a width and a length that are relatively larger than a thickness of the plate, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In particular, the major planar cross-section <b>3</b> is a planar cross-section parallel to the face <b>19</b>. The antenna <b>2</b> of other embodiments can be of various shapes. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an antenna <b>2</b> in the form of an oval cylinder, having a planar oval transverse cross-section <b>20</b> along a longitudinal axis. The length of the cylinder along the longitudinal axis is relatively larger than the major axis of the planar oval transverse cross-section <b>20</b>. Thus, in this case, the major planar cross-section <b>3</b> is the longitudinal planar cross-section through the major axis of the oval cross-section <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A particular embodiment of the invention will now be described in further detail. Specifically, the portable electronic device <b>1</b> takes the form of a mobile phone, which is adapted to be charged wirelessly by the wireless charging pad <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The power transfer coil <b>4</b> of this embodiment is square-shaped, having windings <b>5</b> wound parallel to and defining a square coil plane <b>6</b>. The signal shield <b>9</b> is included and extends to the perimeter of the power transfer coil <b>4</b>. In this embodiment, the power transfer coil <b>4</b> functions as an energy-receiving coil to inductively, and therefore wirelessly, receive power from the wireless charging pad <b>14</b>. The power transfer coil <b>4</b> and the signal shield <b>9</b> form the power transfer module <b>10</b>, operating as an energy-receiving module. In this embodiment, the power transfer module <b>10</b> also includes a rectifier <b>21</b>, such as a diode or a synchronous rectifier, and a voltage regulator <b>22</b>, which can be embedded in a charging circuit of a battery in the mobile phone.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The wireless charging pad <b>14</b> generates an AC magnetic flux in such a way that the lines of flux, or magnetic field lines, leave the power transfer surface <b>12</b> vertically. This can be referred to as the &#x201c;vertical flux&#x201d; approach. In this embodiment, the power transfer surface <b>12</b> is in the form of a planar charging surface. If a metallic plate, such as the antenna <b>2</b>, is placed on the charging surface <b>12</b>, the flux will flow through the metallic plate vertically as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. This results in an induced (or eddy) current <b>23</b> in the metallic plate, which leads to induction heating and energy loss, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">This is why, in this embodiment, the major planar cross-section <b>3</b> of the antenna <b>2</b> should not be placed in the vertical path of the magnetic filed lines <b>13</b> which pass through the power transfer coil <b>4</b>. This is also why the signal shield <b>9</b>, in the form of, for example, an electromagnetic (EM) shield, is usually needed to shield the power transfer coil <b>4</b>. In this way, the flux will not induce current in other metallic parts inside the portable electronic device <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As discussed above, the presence of the electromagnetic signal shield <b>9</b> for the power transfer coil <b>4</b> poses another problem for the antenna <b>2</b> since the shielding material of the signal shield <b>9</b> will also shield the signal transmitted from or received by the antenna <b>2</b>. The electromagnetic signal shield <b>9</b> can cover a larger area than the power transfer coil <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Thus, as described above, in some embodiments of the present invention, the antenna <b>2</b> and the power transfer coil <b>4</b> are placed away from each other such that the coil plane <b>6</b> does not overlap the orthographic projection of the major planar cross-section <b>3</b> onto the projective plane <b>8</b>, which contains the coil plane <b>6</b>. Similarly, in embodiments with the signal shield <b>9</b>, the antenna <b>2</b> and the signal shield <b>9</b> are placed away from each other such that the orthographic projection of the signal shield onto the projective plane <b>8</b> does not overlap the orthographic projection of the major planar cross-section <b>3</b> onto the projective plane <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In other embodiments of the invention, also as described above, the antenna <b>2</b> and the power transfer coil <b>4</b> are arranged such that the major planar cross-section <b>3</b> and the coil plane <b>6</b> are perpendicular. In this way, the vertical AC flux generated perpendicularly through the coil plane <b>6</b> of power transfer coil <b>4</b> will not flow vertically into the major planar cross-section <b>3</b> of the antenna <b>2</b>. Hence, minimal eddy currents will be induced by the AC flux in the antenna <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Also as described above, in further embodiments of the invention, if the major planar cross-section <b>3</b> and the coil plane <b>6</b> are perpendicular, the antenna <b>2</b> and the power transfer coil <b>4</b> can be placed inside the mobile phone with or without overlap of the coil plane <b>6</b> and the orthographic projection of the major planar cross-section <b>3</b> onto the projective plane <b>8</b>, which contains the coil plane <b>6</b>. It will be appreciated, of course, that the more desirable arrangement is to have the major planar cross-section <b>3</b> perpendicular to the coil plane <b>6</b> without overlap of the coil plane <b>6</b> and the orthographic projection of the major planar cross-section <b>3</b> onto the projective plane <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Undesirable arrangements of the antenna <b>2</b> and the power transfer coil <b>4</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a</i>, <b>5</b><i>b</i>, <b>6</b><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b</i>. The figures show total overlap and partial overlap of the major planar cross-section <b>3</b> of the antenna <b>2</b> and the coil plane <b>6</b>, when the major planar cross-section <b>3</b> is orthographically projected onto the projective plane <b>8</b>. In these Figures, the antenna <b>2</b> and the power transfer coil <b>4</b> are substantially parallel. However, if there is the type of overlap mentioned above, the same problems arise whenever the major planar cross-section <b>3</b> is not oriented perpendicularly to the coil plane <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In these undesirable arrangements, the electromagnetic signal shield <b>9</b> may partially shield the antenna <b>2</b> from transmitting and receiving signals. The AC flux for wireless charging will also induce current in the antenna <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The present invention also provides, in another aspect, a method of assembling a portable electronic device. In a preferred embodiment, the method is for assembling the portable electronic device <b>1</b> described above. More particularly, the method includes providing the antenna <b>2</b> having the major planar cross-section <b>3</b>, and providing the power transfer coil <b>4</b> having windings <b>5</b> parallel to the coil plane <b>6</b>, the coil plane extending to the perimeter of the power transfer coil. The method further includes arranging the antenna <b>2</b> and the power transfer coil <b>4</b> such that the major planar cross-section <b>3</b> is substantially perpendicular to the coil plane <b>6</b> if a line <b>7</b> directed perpendicularly from the coil plane <b>6</b> intersects the major planar cross-section <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments of the method, the antenna <b>2</b> and the power transfer coil <b>4</b> are arranged such that the major planar cross-section <b>3</b> is substantially perpendicular to the coil plane <b>6</b> regardless of whether a line <b>7</b> directed perpendicularly from the coil plane <b>6</b> intersects the major planar cross-section <b>3</b>. In other embodiments of the method, the antenna <b>2</b> and the power transfer coil <b>4</b> are arranged such that no line <b>7</b> directed perpendicularly from the coil plane <b>6</b> intersects the major planar cross-section <b>3</b>. In further embodiments, the antenna <b>2</b> and the power transfer coil <b>4</b> are arranged such that the major planar cross-section <b>3</b> is substantially perpendicular to the coil plane <b>6</b> and no line <b>7</b> directed perpendicularly from the coil plane <b>6</b> intersects the major planar cross-section <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The method, in the present embodiment, also includes providing the signal shield <b>9</b>. As described above, the orthographic projection of the signal shield <b>9</b> onto the projective plane <b>8</b> containing the coil plane <b>6</b> covers the orthographic projection of the power transfer coil <b>4</b> onto the projective plane <b>8</b>, and the coil plane <b>6</b> extends to the perimeter of the orthographic projection of the signal shield <b>9</b> onto the projective plane <b>8</b>. Preferably, the power transfer coil <b>4</b> and the signal shield <b>9</b> are provided as part of the power transfer module <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The present embodiment also includes providing the portable electronic device <b>1</b> with the exterior surface <b>11</b>, which is adapted to be positioned adjacent the power transfer surface <b>12</b>, wherein the magnetic field lines <b>13</b> can pass through the power transfer coil <b>4</b> substantially perpendicularly to the coil plane <b>6</b> thereby to induce a voltage across the power transfer coil. The embodiment includes positioning the power transfer coil <b>4</b> adjacent and substantially parallel to the exterior surface <b>11</b>. Similar to above, the magnetic field lines <b>13</b>, in this embodiment, emanate substantially perpendicularly from the power transfer surface <b>12</b>. As above, the power transfer surface <b>12</b> is substantially horizontal and the exterior surface <b>11</b> is adapted to rest on top of the power transfer surface. Also, the power transfer coil <b>4</b> functions as an energy-receiving coil and the power transfer surface <b>12</b> forms part of the wireless charging pad <b>14</b> to charge the portable electronic device <b>1</b> through the power transfer coil <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the present embodiment, the exterior surface <b>11</b> provided with the electronic device forms at least a portion of the major exterior face <b>15</b> of the portable electronic device <b>1</b>. The portable electronic device <b>1</b> is also provided with the first face <b>16</b> having the user interface <b>17</b> and the second face <b>18</b> opposite the first face, the second face being the major exterior face <b>15</b>.</p>
