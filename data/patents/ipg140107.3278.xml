<p id="p-0001" num="0000">In a plasma torch unit, copper rods forming a coil as a whole are disposed inside copper rod inserting holes formed in a quartz block so that the quartz block is cooled by water flowing inside the copper rod inserting holes and cooling water pipes. A plasma ejection port is formed on the lowermost portion of the torch unit. While a gas is being supplied into a space inside an elongated chamber, high-frequency power is supplied to the copper rods to generate plasma in the space inside the elongated chamber so that the plasma is applied to a substrate.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to thermal plasma processing for use in processing a substrate by applying thermal plasma onto the substrate, or a plasma processing apparatus and a method thereof, which applies plasma derived from a reaction gas or plasma and the reaction gas flow simultaneously onto a substrate so that plasma processing such as low-temperature plasma processing is carried out thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventionally, a semiconductor thin film, such as polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si), has been widely utilized for thin-film transistors (TFT: Thin Film Transistor) or solar batteries. In particular, the poly-Si TFT has high carrier mobility, and is characterized in that it can be formed onto a transparent insulating substrate, such as a glass substrate. By utilizing this characteristic, the poly-Si TFT is widely used, for example, as switching elements forming a pixel circuit for a liquid display apparatus, a liquid crystal projector, or an organic EL display apparatus, or as a circuit element for a driver for driving liquid crystal.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As a method for manufacturing a high-performance TFT on a glass substrate, in general, a manufacturing method referred to as &#x201c;high-temperature processing&#x201d; is proposed. Among the manufacturing processes for a TFT, a process in which a high temperature of about 1000&#xb0; C. is used as the highest temperature in the process is generally referred to as &#x201c;high-temperature processing&#x201d;. The characteristics of the high-temperature processing are that a relatively high-quality polycrystalline silicon can be formed as a film by utilizing a solid-phase epitaxy of silicon, that a high-quality gate insulating layer can be obtained by thermal oxidation of silicon, and that a clean interface between polycrystalline silicon and a gate insulating layer can be obtained. By these characteristics, the high-temperature processing makes it possible to manufacture a high-performance TFT having high mobility and high reliability in a stable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In contrast, since the high-temperature processing is a process in which a silicon film is crystallized by solid-phase epitaxy, heating treatment for a long period, such as 48 hours, at a temperature of about 600&#xb0; C. is required. This process is requires an extremely long period, and in order to increase the throughput of the process, a large number of heating furnaces are inevitably required, resulting in an issue of difficulty in reducing costs. In addition, since quartz glass needs to be used as an insulating substrate having high heat resistance, the costs of substrates become higher, with the result that this method is not suitable for providing devices with large areas.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In contrast, a technique referred to as &#x201c;low-temperature processing&#x201d; has been proposed in which the highest temperature during the processes is lowered so that a poly-Si TFT is manufactured on an inexpensive glass substrate with a large surface area. Among manufacturing processes of TFTs, the process for manufacturing a poly-Si TFT on a relatively inexpensive heat-resistant glass substrate under a temperature environment having the highest temperature of about 600&#xb0; C. or less is generally referred to as &#x201c;low-temperature process&#x201d;. In the low-temperature process, a laser crystallization technique that crystallizes a silicon film by using a pulse laser whose oscillation time is very short has been widely used. The laser crystallization refers to a technique in which such a characteristic that the silicon thin film is instantaneously fused by irradiating a silicon thin film on a substrate with pulse laser light having high output and this fused silicon thin film is crystallized during its solidification is utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, this laser crystallization technique has some major issues. One of the issues is a large number of trap levels that are localized inside a polysilicon film formed by the laser crystallization technique. Due to the existence of these trap levels, carriers that are to be originally shifted through an active layer upon application of a voltage are trapped, failing to devote to electric conduction, with the result that adverse effects, such as a reduction in the mobility of TFTs and an increase of the threshold voltage, are raised. Another issue is that by the limitation of the laser output, the size of a glass substrate is limited. In order to improve the throughput of the laser crystallization process, it is necessary to increase the area that can be crystallized in one time. However, since the current laser output has limitations, upon application of this crystallization technique to a large-size substrate of the seventh generation (1800 mm&#xd7;2100 mm), a long period of time is required for crystallizing one substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Moreover, as the laser crystallization technique, in general, a laser that is formed into a line pattern is used, and the crystallization is performed by scanning this laser. Since this line beam has limitations in laser output, it is shorter than the width of a substrate, and it is necessary to carry cut the laser scanning process several times in a divided manner in order to crystallize the entire surface of the substrate. This generates joint regions of the line beam within the substrate, resulting in double scanned regions. The crystalline characteristic in these regions is greatly different from that in the region crystallized by the scanning of one time. For this reason, the element characteristics of the two regions are greatly different from each other and become the main cause of device deviations. Lastly, since the laser crystallization device has a complicated device structure, and sine the costs of consumable parts are high, there is an issue in that the device costs and running costs are consequently high. As a result, TFTs using a polysilicon film crystallized by using a laser crystallization device cause elements having high production costs.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to overcome these issues of the limitation of the substrate size and high device cost's, a crystallization technique called &#x201c;thermal plasma jet crystallization method&#x201d; has been examined (for example, see &#x201c;Crystallization of Si in Millisecond Time Domain Induced by Thermal Jet Irradiation&#x201d; S. Higashi, H. Kaku, T. Okada, H. Murakami, and S. Miyazaki, Japanese Journal of Applied Physics, Vol. 45, No. 5B, (2006) pp. 4313-4320). This technique is briefly described in the following. When a tungsten (W) cathode and a water-cooled copper (Cu) anode are made to face each other, and a DC voltage is applied thereto, an arc discharge is generated between the electrodes. By allowing an argon gas to flow between these electrodes under the atmospheric pressure, thermal plasma is ejected from an ejection hole opened in the copper anode. The thermal plasma is thermally equilibrium plasma forming an ultra-high temperature heat source in which temperatures of ions, electrons, and neutral atoms are almost the same, with the temperatures thereof being set to about 10000 K. For this reason, the thermal plasma can easily heat an object to be heated to a high temperature, and by scanning a substrate on which an a-Si film is deposited in front of the ultra-high temperature thermal plasma at a high speed, the a-Si film can be crystallized.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In this manner, since the device structure is very simple, and since the crystallization process is carried out under the atmospheric pressure, it is not necessary to cover the device with an expensive member, such as a chamber, and device costs are expected to be extremely low. Moreover, since utilities required for the crystallization are only an argon gas, power, and cooling water, this system provides a crystallization technique also having inexpensive running costs.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a schematic view that describes the crystallization method of a semiconductor film using this thermal plasma.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, a thermal plasma generation device <b>31</b> includes a cathode <b>32</b>, and an anode <b>33</b> that is placed with a predetermined distance apart from the cathode <b>32</b> so as to face therewith. The cathode <b>32</b> is made of a conductor such as, for example, tungsten. The anode <b>33</b> is made of a conductor such as, for example, copper. Moreover, the anode <b>33</b> is formed into a hollow structure so as to be cooled with water being allowed to pass through the hollow portion. Furthermore, an ejection hole (nozzle) <b>34</b> is formed in the anode <b>33</b>. Upon application of a direct current (DC) voltage between the cathode <b>32</b> and the anode <b>33</b>, an arc discharge is generated therebetween. By allowing a gas such as an argon gas to flow between the cathode <b>32</b> and the anode <b>33</b> under the atmospheric pressure in this state, thermal plasma <b>35</b> can be ejected from the ejection hole <b>34</b>. In this case, &#x201c;thermal plasma&#x201d; is the thermally equilibrium plasma forming an ultra-high temperature heat source in which temperatures of ions, electrons, and neutral atoms are almost the same, with the temperatures thereof being set to about 10000 K.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Such thermal plasma <b>35</b> can be utilized for heating treatment for use in crystallization of a semiconductor film.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">More specifically, a semiconductor film <b>37</b> (for example, amorphous silicon film) is preliminary formed on a substrate <b>36</b>, and the thermal plasma (thermal plasma jet) <b>35</b> is applied to the semiconductor film <b>37</b>. At this time, the thermal plasma <b>35</b> is applied to the semiconductor film <b>37</b>, while being relatively shifted along a first axis (lateral direction in an example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>) in parallel with the surface of the semiconductor film <b>37</b>. That is, the thermal plasma <b>35</b> is applied to the semiconductor film <b>37</b>, while being scanned in the first axis direction. In this case, &#x201c;being relatively shifted&#x201d; means that the semiconductor film <b>37</b> (and a substrate <b>36</b> supporting the semiconductor film <b>37</b>) and the thermal plasma <b>35</b> are relatively shifted, and includes both cases in which only one of these is shifted and in which both of them are shifted together. By carrying out such a scanning process of the thermal plasma <b>35</b>, the semiconductor film <b>37</b> is heated by a high temperature of the thermal plasma <b>35</b> to obtain a crystallized semiconductor film <b>38</b> (polysilicon film in this example) (for example, see Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2008-53634).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a conceptual view showing a relationship between the depth from the uppermost surface and the temperature. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, by shifting the thermal plasma <b>35</b> over the substrate <b>36</b> at a high speed, only the proximity of the surface of the substrate <b>36</b> can be treated at a high temperature. Since the heated region is quickly cooled after the thermal plasma <b>35</b> has passed, the temperature on the proximity of the surface becomes high only for a very short period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The thermal plasma <b>33</b> is generally generated in dot regions. Since the thermal plasma <b>35</b> is maintained by thermions discharged from the cathode <b>32</b> and the thermions are more vigorously discharged at a position having high plasma density, a positive feedback is exerted so that the plasma density becomes increasingly higher. That is, the arc discharge occurs by concentrating on one point of the cathode so that the thermal plasma <b>35</b> is generated at the dot region.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the case where an attempt is made so as to uniformly process a flat-shaped substrate, such as in the case of crystallization of a semiconductor film, a dot-shaped thermal plasma needs to be scanned over the entire substrate. In this case, so as to provide a process that can be carried out in a short period of time by reducing the number of scanning operations, it is effective to increase a region irradiated with thermal plasma. For this reason, a technique for generating thermal plasma within a large area has long been examined.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">For example, a method is disclosed in which, in a plasma jet ejected from an external nozzle of a plasma torch, width-widening gases for use in width-widening the plasma jet in a direction intersecting with the center axis of the external nozzle are ejected simultaneously from two portions so that the plasma jet is widened (for example, see Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 08-118027). Alternatively, another, method is proposed in which a plasma nozzle, which is characterized in that its mouth of the nozzle passage is tilted with a predetermined angle relative to the axis center of the nozzle passage, is prepared, and a casing that forms the nozzle passage, or one portion of such a casing, is rotated at a high speed around the longitudinal axis center so that the plasma nozzle is allowed to pass and shift along a work piece (for example, see Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2001-68298). Moreover, a system is disclosed in which a rotation head having at least one plasma nozzle disposed in an eccentric manner is provided (for example, see Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2002-500818).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Additionally, although not intended to process a large area in a short period of time, a high-speed gas shield arc welding method is disclosed in which, as a welding method utilizing the thermal plasma, a band-shaped electrode is used, and a welding process is carried out with its width direction being coincident with the welding line direction (for example, see Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 04-284974).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Moreover, there is disclosed an inductive coupling-type plasma torch having a linear elongated shape, which uses an insulator member having a flat rectangular parallel epiped shape (for example, see Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2009-545165).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Additionally, a method for generating elongated linear plasma by using an elongated electrode is proposed (for example, see Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2007-287454). Although this system is described as a method for generating thermal plasma, this system relates to generation of low-temperature plasma, and is not suitable for thermal treatment. Supposing that this is used for generating thermal plasma, the arc discharge is concentrated on one portion because this system is a capacitive coupling-type using electrodes, and it is considered to be difficult to generate thermal plasma that is uniform in the longitudinal direction. In contrast, as a low-temperature plasma processing apparatus, this system provides a device capable of carrying out plasma processing, such as etching or film-forming, by forming an etching gas or a CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) gas into plasma.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Moreover, a system is disclosed in which a linear elongated plasma torch is formed by aligning a plurality of discharging electrodes into a line pattern (for example, see Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2009-158251).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">However, the conventional technique for generating thermal plasma on a large area is not effectively applied to high-temperature treatment on the proximity of a surface of a substrate only in a very short period of time, such as a crystallizing process of a semiconductor.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the technique for generating thermal plasma on a large area, described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 08-118027 shown in the conventional examples, although the region is widened, the temperature distribution in the widened region becomes 100&#xb0; C. or more, making it impossible to realize uniform thermal treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Moreover, in the techniques for generating thermal plasma on a large area described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication Nos. 2001-68298 and 2002-500818 shown in the conventional examples, since the thermal plasma is inherently rocked, the period of time during which the thermal treatment is actually carried out becomes shorter than that of the scanning process without rotation, with the result that the period of time during which the large area is processed in not particularly shortened. Moreover, in order to carry out a uniform process, the rotation speed needs to be sufficiently made higher as compared with the scanning speed, inevitably causing a complicated structure of a nozzle.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Moreover, the technique described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 04-284974 shown in the conventional examples is a welding technique, and is not a structure for processing a large area uniformly. Even in an attempt to apply this technique to the processing for a large area, since the dot-shaped arc oscillates along the belt-shaped electrode in this structure, nonuniform plasma is instantaneously caused although the plasma is uniformly generated on a time-averaged basis. Therefore, this technique is not applicable to the uniform processing for a large area.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Furthermore, the technique described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2009-545165 shown in the conventional examples is different from the structure using a DC arc discharge disclosed in &#x201c;Crystallization of Si in Millisecond Time Domain. Induced by Thermal Jet Irradiation&#x201d; S. Higashi, H. Kaku, T. Okada, H. Murakami, and S. Miyazaki, Japanese Journal of Applied Physics, Vol. 45, No. 5B, (2006) pp. 4313-4320 and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2008-53634, and is characterized in that an inductive coupling-type high-frequency plasma torch is utilized. Since this is an electrodeless discharging process, there is an advantage that thermal plasma with superior stability is obtained (with small time-based fluctuations) and the electrode materials are hardly mixed into the substrate (contamination).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the inductive coupling-type plasma torch, in general, a method has been adopted in which, in order to protect the insulator material from high-temperature plasma, the insulator material is formed into a double-tube structure with a coolant being allowed to flow therebetween. However, in the technique described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2009-545165 shown in the conventional examples, since an insulator material has a flat rectangular parallelepiped shape, it is not possible to flow a coolant with a sufficient flow rate by simply forming the insulator material into a double-tube structure. The reason for this is because, since the insulator material is generally inferior in mechanical strength to metals, the inner pressure in the double tubes cannot be made higher if the insulator material is made too long in the longitudinal direction. Consequently, it has limitations in processing a large area uniformly.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Although there is assumed to be no issue with cooling in the insulator material, in the technique described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2009-545165 shown in the conventional examples, since the high-temperature plasma formed in the inner space of the insulator material is such that only one portion thereof ejected from its lowermost portion, is directly reacted with the substrate, there is an issue in that power efficiency is poor. Moreover, in the inner space of the insulator material, since the plasma density near the center becomes higher, the plasma becomes nonuniform in the longitudinal direction, resulting in an issue in which the substrate is not processed uniformly.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Additionally, even in the case of a dot-shaped thermal plasma, since the number of scanning times can be reduced upon processing a large area if the diameter of the thermal plasma is large, a process in a short period of time can be achieved depending on applications. However, when the diameter of the thermal plasma is large, since the time during which the thermal plasma passes over the substrate upon scanning becomes substantially longer, it is not possible to carry out a high-temperature process only on the proximity of the surface of the substrate only for a short period of time. Therefore, a rather deeper region in the substrate becomes a high temperature to sometimes cause issues such as, for example, cracks in the glass substrate and film separations.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Moreover, in the technique described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2009-158251 shown in the conventional examples, as compared with the above-mentioned inductive coupling-type high-frequency plasma torch, there are disadvantages in that stability in thermal plasma is poor (time-based fluctuations are large) and the electrode materials tend to be mixed into the substrate (contamination).</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Before continuing the description of the present invention, it is to be noted that like parts are denoted with like reference numerals throughout the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Hereinafter, plasma processing apparatuses and methods thereof according to embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">(First Embodiment)</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">A first embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows a structure of a plasma processing apparatus according to the first embodiment of the present invention, and is a cross-sectional view of an inductive coupling-type plasma torch unit T serving as one example of a plasma processing apparatus, taken along a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal direction thereof. Each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1C</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along a plane perpendicular to a substrate <b>2</b> and in parallel with the longitudinal direction of the inductive coupling-type plasma torch unit T. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along a broken line A-A&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along a broken line B-B&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. Moreover, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along the broken line of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. Furthermore, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> is a perspective view of the inductive coupling-type plasma torch unit T.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a view showing an assembly structure of the inductive coupling-type plasma torch unit T shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1D</figref>, which includes perspective views of respective parts (one portion) that are placed side by side. The inductive coupling-type plasma torch unit T is provided with a brass block <b>5</b>, a quartz block <b>4</b> serving as one example of a dielectric block, a gas supply device <b>90</b>, a conductor rod <b>3</b> serving as one example of a conductor member, a high-frequency power supply <b>91</b>, and a substrate mounting base <b>1</b>, and may be further provided with a shield gas supply device <b>92</b> and a shifting device <b>94</b>. The brass block <b>5</b> functions as one example-of a case or a device main-body block in combination with a brass lid <b>6</b>, which will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 2</figref>, a substrate <b>2</b> is mounted on the substrate mounting base <b>1</b>. In the inductive coupling-type plasma torch unit T, the quartz block <b>4</b>, which is formed by a single square pillar member <b>4</b><i>a </i>made of a dielectric material, is provided with an elongated chamber <b>7</b> formed in an intermediate portion in the center in the width direction orthogonal to the longitudinal direction of the square pillar member <b>4</b><i>a</i>, except for the two ends thereof in the longitudinal direction, as a recessed section that extends in the longitudinal direction, and recessed upward from its lower end opening. Two pairs of large through holes <b>12</b> are formed in the square pillar member <b>4</b><i>a </i>with the elongated chamber <b>7</b> sandwiched therebetween, and in each of these through holes <b>12</b>, a copper rod <b>3</b> serving as one example of a conductive rod forming one portion of a coil serving as one example of a conductive unit is inserted to be placed therein. Consequently, the copper rods <b>3</b> are disposed in the inner portions of the quartz block <b>4</b> that forms the elongated chamber <b>7</b> made of a dielectric member. The quartz block <b>4</b> is housed in a portion that is surrounded by: the brass block <b>5</b> having a concave portion <b>5</b><i>b </i>that is formed on the periphery of the quartz block <b>4</b> (that is, on the two side faces, the bottom face, and the two end faces, except for the upper face) and allowed to surround the quartz block <b>4</b>; and a rectangular plate-shaped brass lid <b>6</b> that covers the opening on the upper face of the brass block <b>5</b>. Since the brass block <b>5</b> and the brass lid <b>6</b> are grounded, a high-frequency leakage (noise) can be effectively prevented, and an undesirable abnormal discharge or the like can also be effectively prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The inner space of the elongated chamber <b>7</b> forms an elongated slit that is formed in the quartz block <b>4</b> with a rectangular shape in its longitudinal cross-section, and is elongated in the longitudinal direction of the quartz block <b>4</b>. In other words, in this structure, the elongated chamber <b>7</b> is surrounded by the dielectric member. The plasma, generated in the space inside the elongated chamber <b>7</b>, is ejected downward toward the substrate <b>2</b> through a plasma ejection port <b>8</b> serving as one example of an opening having a slit shape in the elongated chamber <b>7</b>. In this case, the longitudinal direction of the elongated chamber <b>7</b> and the longitudinal direction of the plasma ejection port <b>8</b> are disposed in parallel with each other. The plasma ejection port <b>8</b> is an opening having the same size as the lower end opening of the elongated chamber <b>7</b> of the quartz block <b>4</b>, and formed on the lower end portion of the brass block <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">A plasma gas manifold <b>9</b>, which extends in the longitudinal direction of the brass lid <b>6</b>, is formed near the upper surface in the center of the quartz block <b>4</b> of the lower portion of the brass lid <b>6</b>. To the center portion in the longitudinal direction of the plasma gas manifold <b>9</b>, a plasma gas supply pipe <b>21</b> is connected from above the brass lid <b>6</b> so that a plasma gas can be supplied from the plasma gas supply device <b>90</b> into the plasma gas manifold <b>9</b> through the plasma gas supply pipe <b>21</b>. Moreover, a plurality of plasma gas supply pipes <b>10</b> that connect the plasma gas manifold <b>9</b> with the elongated chamber <b>7</b> are formed along a vertical direction orthogonal to the longitudinal direction of the quartz block <b>4</b> so as to penetrate the quartz block <b>4</b>, for example, with predetermined intervals from each other. An opening on the lower end of each of the plasma gas supply pipes <b>10</b> that faces the elongated chamber <b>7</b> functions as a plasma gas supply hole <b>11</b> serving as one example of a gas introducing port. Thus, a gas, supplied into the plasma gas manifold <b>9</b>, is introduced into the space inside the elongated chamber <b>7</b> from the plasma gas supply hole <b>11</b> formed in the quartz block <b>4</b> through the plasma gas supply pipes <b>10</b> made of the through holes formed in the quartz block <b>4</b>. Since the plasma gas supply pipes <b>10</b> are formed in a plurality of portions of the quartz block <b>4</b> in the longitudinal direction, desirably with predetermined intervals from one another, a uniform gas flow can be easily formed in the longitudinal direction of the quartz block <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Four copper rods <b>3</b> are installed, with the respective end portions of the copper rods <b>3</b> being electrically connected to one another, so that a coil <b>3</b>C is formed as a whole. For example, one end of the copper rod <b>3</b> on the upper left of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> (right end of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>) and one end of the copper rod <b>3</b> on the upper right (right end of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>) are electrically connected with each other through a conductive coupler (connector) <b>19</b> that forms one portion of the coil, the other end of the copper rod <b>3</b> on the upper right (left end of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>) and the other end of the copper rod <b>3</b> on the lower left (left end of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>) are electrically connected with each other by the conductive coupler <b>19</b>, and one end of the copper rod <b>3</b> on the lower left of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> (right end of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>) and one end of the copper rod <b>3</b> on the lower right (right end of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>) are electrically connected with each other through the conductive coupler <b>19</b>. Consequently, the other end of the copper rod <b>3</b> on the upper left of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> (left end of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>) and the other end of the copper rod <b>3</b> on the lower right (left end of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>) are allowed to form two ends of the coil, and thus electrically connected to a high-frequency power supply <b>91</b> through a high-frequency matching circuit <b>93</b> so that high-frequency power is applied to the coil. In this case, a coil <b>3</b>C is formed by the copper rods <b>3</b> and the conductive couplers <b>19</b>. The respective copper rods <b>3</b> are disposed in parallel with the elongated chamber, and are placed inside copper rod inserting holes <b>12</b> that are elongated holes surrounded by quartz that is a dielectric material. Gaps between the copper rod inserting hole <b>12</b> and the copper rods <b>3</b> are allowed to form a cooling water channel functioning as one example of a coolant passage to be connected to a coolant supply device <b>98</b> so that the copper rods <b>3</b> can be cooled.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Moreover, a pair of shield gas nozzles <b>13</b>, serving as one example of a shield gas supply member, are disposed on a portion below the quartz block <b>4</b> and close to the substrate mounting base <b>1</b> (in other words, between the quartz block <b>4</b> and the substrate mounting base <b>1</b>), with the plasma ejection port <b>8</b> sandwiched therebetween. The paired shield gas nozzles <b>13</b> are supported, for example, onto the brass block <b>5</b> by a support arm <b>13</b><i>a </i>and secured thereon. On the surfaces on the plasma ejection port <b>8</b> side of the respective shield gas nozzles <b>13</b>, a large number of shield gas introducing ports <b>13</b><i>b </i>which are disposed in the longitudinal direction are opened, and in the inside of each of the shield gas nozzles <b>13</b>, a shield gas manifold <b>14</b> which connects the shield gas supply device <b>92</b> and the large number of shield gas introducing ports <b>13</b><i>b </i>with one another is installed. In this manner, two types of gas introducing systems for a plasma gas and a shield gas are prepared, and in a separated manner from the plasma gas suitable for generating a plasma, the shield gas is supplied to the shield gas manifold <b>14</b> so as to be ejected from a large number of nozzles of the shield gas nozzles <b>13</b>. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent gases, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and the like in the air, that are unnecessary for plasma processing or cause adverse effects thereto, from being mixed onto the plasma irradiation surface.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In the quartz block <b>4</b> and the brass block <b>5</b>, there are provided cooling water pipes <b>15</b> which penetrate the quartz block <b>4</b> and the brass block <b>5</b> in the longitudinal direction and are connected to a cooling water supply device <b>98</b> serving as one example of a coolant supply device. That is, on the upper portion of the copper rod inserting hole <b>12</b> on the upper side and on the lower portion of the copper rod inserting hole <b>12</b> on the lower side of the square pillar member <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the quartz block <b>4</b>, there are provided the cooling water pipes <b>15</b> which are prepared as through holes that respectively penetrate in the longitudinal direction. In the brass block <b>5</b>, a large number of the cooling water pipes <b>15</b> that penetrate in the longitudinal direction are formed near the quartz block <b>4</b>, in a manner so as to surround the quartz block <b>4</b>. Each of the cooling water pipes <b>15</b> is a through hole having a diameter smaller than the copper rod inserting hole <b>12</b>. Each of the cooling water pipes <b>15</b> of the quartz block <b>4</b> is made to have a diameter that is larger than each of the cooling water pipes <b>15</b> of the brass block <b>5</b> so that the quartz block <b>4</b> can be cooled more sufficiently than the brass block <b>5</b>. The copper rod inserting holes <b>12</b> and the cooling water pipes <b>15</b> are water channels (coolant passages) disposed in parallel with one another, and brass blocks <b>16</b> are respectively disposed on the two ends of the quartz block <b>4</b> and the brass block <b>5</b> so that the copper rod inserting holes <b>12</b> and the cooling water pipes <b>15</b> are respectively made to penetrate the brass blocks <b>16</b>. On the outside of the brass block <b>16</b>, a resin case <b>17</b> having a concave portion inside thereof is formed so that a space between the concave portion of the resin case <b>17</b> and the brass block <b>16</b> is allowed to form a cooling water manifold <b>18</b> serving as one example of a coolant manifold. The copper rod inserting holes <b>12</b> and the cooling water pipes <b>15</b> communicate with the cooling water manifold <b>18</b>. On the resin case <b>17</b>, a cooling water inlet <b>18</b><i>a </i>and a cooling water outlet <b>18</b><i>b</i>, serving as examples of a coolant introducing port and a coolant discharging port that are respectively connected to the coolant supply device <b>98</b>, are formed one by one (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>) so that the arrangement of the water cooling pipes onto the torch unit T are made very simple. Thus, it becomes possible to provide a small-size torch. In other words, two coolant manifolds <b>18</b> are placed on the two sides in the longitudinal direction of the elongated chamber <b>7</b> so that the coolant passages <b>12</b> and <b>15</b> that allow the two coolant manifolds <b>18</b> to communicate with the respective members <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> are prepared.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The copper rods <b>3</b> are electrically connected to one another by the couplers <b>19</b> inside the cooling water manifold <b>18</b> so that the four copper rods <b>3</b>, as a whole, form a solenoid coil having a spiral shape with the number of turns of <b>2</b>. All the copper rods <b>3</b> penetrate the brass block <b>16</b>, and among the four copper rods <b>3</b>, two copper rods <b>3</b> (for example, in the previous example, the other end of the copper rod <b>3</b> on the upper left of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> (left end of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>) and the other end of the copper rod <b>3</b> on the lower right (left end of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>)) are connected to a copper plate <b>20</b> through a high-frequency introducing terminal hole or a ground terminal hole formed on the resin case <b>17</b> so that they are connected to the high-frequency power supply <b>91</b> through the copper plate <b>20</b>, with the high-frequency matching circuit <b>93</b> interposed therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">As described above, in the first embodiment, since the copper rod inserting holes <b>12</b> and cooling water pipes <b>15</b>, each having a round cross-section, that penetrate the quartz block <b>4</b> are installed, a considerably greater amount of coolant is allowed to flow as compared with the water-cooling system having the double-pipe structure in the technique described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2009-545165 shown in the conventional examples.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Additionally, the gas introduction to the plasma gas manifold <b>9</b> is achieved by a plasma gas supply pipe <b>21</b> provided with a flow-rate control device such as a mass flow controller, which is placed on the upstream side thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">As described above, the plasma ejection port <b>8</b> having a rectangular slit shape is formed on the lower-end opening of the elongated chamber <b>7</b> of the square pillar member <b>4</b><i>a </i>made of a dielectric member of the quartz block <b>4</b>, and the substrate mounting base <b>1</b> (or the substrate <b>2</b> on the substrate mounting base <b>1</b>) is disposed so as to face the plasma ejection port <b>8</b>. In this state, while a plasma gas is supplied into the elongated chamber <b>7</b>, high-frequency power is supplied to the copper rods <b>3</b> forming a coil from the high-frequency power supply <b>91</b>, and a plasma gas is ejected from the plasma ejection port <b>8</b> toward the substrate <b>2</b>. Consequently, plasma is generated in the space inside the elongated chamber <b>7</b>, and the plasma is applied onto the substrate <b>2</b> from the plasma ejection port <b>8</b> so that a thin film <b>22</b> on the substrate <b>2</b> is be plasma-processed. The substrate <b>2</b> is processed by shifting the elongated chamber and the substrate mounting base <b>1</b> relative to each other at a constant velocity by using the shifting device <b>94</b>, in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the plasma ejection port <b>8</b> along the horizontal plane. In other words, in a lateral direction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, that is, in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the drawing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1C</figref>, the inductive coupling-type plasma torch unit T or the substrate mounting base <b>1</b> is moved.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref> shows one example of the shifting device <b>94</b> that shifts the plasma torch unit T relative to the substrate <b>2</b> on the fixed substrate mounting base <b>1</b> at a constant velocity. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, the shifting device <b>94</b> includes a bracket <b>94</b><i>b </i>to which the upper ends of the brass block <b>16</b> of the two ends of the plasma torch unit T are secured, a rail <b>94</b><i>c </i>that is extended along the shifting direction (a direction orthogonal to the longitudinal direction of the plasma torch unit T or the brass block <b>5</b>) of the shifting device <b>94</b>, and a shifting stage <b>94</b><i>e </i>to which the bracket <b>94</b><i>b </i>is secured, and which forwardly/reversely rotates a shift-driving motor <b>94</b><i>d </i>serving as one example of a shift-driving device so that the bracket <b>94</b><i>b </i>is shifted at a constant velocity along the rail <b>94</b><i>c </i>to which a screw shaft engaged with the motor <b>94</b><i>d </i>is secured. Thus, the shift-driving motor <b>94</b><i>d </i>is forwardly rotated under control by the control device <b>95</b> so that the shifting stage <b>94</b><i>e </i>proceeds or retreats at a constant velocity along the rail <b>94</b><i>c</i>, and the plasma torch unit T can be shifted relative to the substrate <b>2</b> through the bracket <b>94</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In this manner, the plasma processing can be carried out while the plasma torch unit T<b>3</b> is shifted at a constant velocity over the substrate <b>2</b> by the shifting device <b>94</b> under control by the control device <b>95</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">When the plasma torch unit T<b>3</b> is shifted over the substrate <b>2</b> by the shifting device <b>94</b>, the shifting direction may be set to one direction, or may be reciprocally shifted.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">The shifting device <b>94</b> may be applied to other embodiments or modified examples to be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The control device <b>95</b> respectively controls operations of the gas supply device <b>90</b>, the shield gas supply device <b>92</b>, the high-frequency power supply <b>91</b>, the shifting device <b>94</b>, the coolant supply device <b>98</b>, and the like so that desired plasma processing can be carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">The plurality of copper rods <b>3</b> are disposed in parallel with one another so that the four copper rods <b>3</b>, as a whole, form a solenoid coil having a spiral shape with the number of turns of <b>2</b>. That is, it is structured such that, among the plurality of conductor rods <b>3</b>, high-frequency currents with reversed phases are allowed to flow through the conductor rods <b>3</b> that are made to face each other with the elongated chamber <b>7</b> being interposed therebetween ;for example, the conductor rod <b>3</b> on the upper right and the conductor rod <b>3</b> on the upper left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, as well as the conductor rod <b>3</b> on the lower right and the conductor rod <b>3</b> on the lower left of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). In this case, on a cross-section taken along a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the torch unit T, an inductive electromagnetic field becomes stronger near the mid point of a line segment connecting the centers of the conductor rods <b>3</b> that are made to face each other with the elongated chamber <b>7</b> being interposed therebetween, so that an efficient plasma generating process may be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In contrast, as a modified example of the first embodiment, all of the two ends of the four copper rods <b>3</b> may be bundled with one another in the cooling water manifold <b>18</b>, and high-frequency power may be supplied to the one side in the longitudinal direction, with the other side in the longitudinal direction being grounded, so that high-frequency currents having the same phase are allowed to flow through all of the four copper rods <b>3</b>. That is, the structure may be such that among the plurality of conductor rods <b>3</b>, the high-frequency currents having the same phase are allowed to flow through the conductor rods <b>3</b> that are made to face each other with the elongated chamber <b>7</b> being interposed therebetween. In this case, on the cross-section taken along a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the torch unit T, an inductive electromagnetic field becomes almost zero near the mid point of a line segment connecting the centers of the conductor rods <b>3</b> that are made to face each other with the elongated chamber <b>7</b> being interposed therebetween. However, since a strong inductive electromagnetic field is generated near the upper and lower ends of the elongated chamber <b>7</b>, an efficient plasma generating process may be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Moreover, in this case, since the high-frequency current is branched into the four copper rods <b>3</b>, an electric current per rod becomes smaller. In other words, in the case where copper rods <b>3</b> having the same thickness are used, a direct current resistivity and an inductance of the entire coil become smaller. Therefore, the copper loss in the coil becomes smaller so that the power efficiency is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Furthermore, as another modified example of the first embodiment, coils with the number of turn of 1 may be disposed in parallel with each other on two upper and lower stages by bundling two conductor rods <b>3</b> disposed on the same side with the elongated chamber <b>7</b> interposed therebetween with each other inside the cooling water manifold <b>18</b>. In this case as well, although among the plurality of conductor rods <b>3</b>, high-frequency currents having the reversed phases are allowed to flow through the conductor rods <b>3</b> that are made to face each other with the elongated chamber <b>7</b> being interposed therebetween, a current per rod becomes smaller since the high-frequency currents are branched into the copper rods <b>3</b> of the two systems. In other words, in the case where copper rods <b>3</b> having the same thickness are used, a direct current resistivity and an inductance of the entire coil become smaller. Therefore, the copper loss in the coil becomes smaller and the power efficiency is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Such a method for reducing the copper loss by devising the wiring structure is particularly effective in the case where the width of a substrate <b>2</b> to be processed is large, that is, in the case where the inductive coupling-type plasma torch unit T is long in the longitudinal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Moreover, in this structure, on an arbitrary cross-section taken along a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal direction, which includes the elongated chamber <b>7</b>, the shortest distance between the copper rod <b>3</b> and a conductor other than the copper rod <b>3</b> (brass block <b>5</b> and brass lid <b>6</b>) becomes longer than the shortest distance between the copper rod <b>3</b> and the elongated chamber <b>7</b>. In this case, the shortest distance between the copper rod <b>3</b> and the elongated chamber <b>7</b> means the shortest distance between the copper rod <b>3</b> and the space (a rectangular parallelepiped defining the space) inside the elongated chamber <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">In general, since the inductive electromagnetic field formed by the high-frequency power supply is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the high-frequency power supply, when the distance from the copper rod <b>3</b> to a conductor other than the copper rod <b>3</b> is closer than the distance between the copper rod <b>3</b> and the elongated chamber <b>7</b>, an electromagnetic field that induces an eddy current inside a conductor other than the copper rod <b>3</b> becomes greater than the electromagnetic field that effectively generates plasma, and thus, the copper loss (eddy current loss) becomes greater.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">In order to avoid this issue, the distance between the copper rod <b>3</b> and a conductor ether than the copper rod <b>3</b> is made longer than the distance between the copper rod <b>3</b> and the elongated chamber <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">In such a structure, since it is necessary to keep a certain distance between the copper rods <b>3</b> and the plasma ejection port <b>8</b>, the cooling water pipe <b>15</b> for cooling the quartz block <b>4</b> is disposed at a portion closer to the plasma ejection port <b>8</b> than to the copper rod <b>3</b> closest to the plasma ejection port <b>8</b>. Similarly, the cooling water pipe <b>15</b> for cooling the quartz block. <b>4</b> is also disposed at a portion closer to the brass lid <b>6</b> than to the copper rod <b>3</b> closest to the brass lid <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Moreover, since a copper loss (eddy current loss) is generated in the brass block <b>5</b> and the brass lid <b>6</b> even if a distance from the copper rod <b>3</b> is kept, the cooling water pipe <b>15</b> is formed at a portion close to the copper rods <b>3</b> in order to avoid this issue.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Although various kinds of gases may be applicable as the plasma gas to be supplied into the elongated chamber <b>7</b>, it is desirable that an inert gas is mainly used in view of plasma stability, igniting characteristic, service life of members to be exposed to plasma, or the like. Among the inert gases, an Ar gas is typically used. In the case where only the Ar gas is used to generate plasma, the plasma has a considerably high temperature (10,000 K or more). On a portion corresponding to the downstream side of the plasma ejection port <b>8</b> of the brass block <b>5</b>, a pair of inclined surfaces <b>5</b><i>a</i>, each of which is opened wider toward the downward side, are formed so that a space that is gradually widened toward the substrate <b>2</b> is formed. With such a structure, it is possible to suppress a reduction in the plasma density due to contact of plasma against the brass block <b>5</b>, and also to install the cooling water pipe <b>15</b> on a position close to the contact portion with plasma.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">In this structure, since the length dimension in the longitudinal direction of the plasma ejection port <b>8</b> is set to be longer than the width dimension of the substrate <b>2</b>, a scanning process of one time (shifting the torch unit T and the substrate mounting base <b>1</b> relative to each other) makes it possible to process the entire thin film <b>22</b> on the proximity of the surface of the substrate <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">In such a plasma processing apparatus, by supplying high-frequency power of 13.56 MHz to the copper rods <b>3</b> forming a coil from the high-frequency power supply <b>91</b> while an Ar gas or Ar+H<sub>2 </sub>gas is supplied into the elongated chamber <b>7</b>, through a plasma gas supply hole <b>11</b> and while a plasma gas is injected toward the substrate <b>2</b> from the plasma ejection port <b>8</b>, a high-frequency electromagnetic field is generated in the space inside the elongated chamber <b>7</b> to generate plasma, and by applying the plasma onto the substrate <b>2</b> from the plasma ejection port <b>8</b> and scanning over the substrate <b>2</b> the torch unit T by the shifting device <b>94</b>, a heating treatment such as crystallizing of the semiconductor film can be carried out over the entire desired processing region of the substrate <b>2</b> in a short period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">As described above, since the elongated chamber <b>7</b> and the substrate mounting base <b>1</b> are relatively shifted in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the plasma ejection port <b>8</b>, with the longitudinal direction of the plasma ejection port <b>8</b> and the substrate mounting base <b>1</b> being kept in parallel with each other, the length dimension of plasma to be generated and the processing length dimension of the substrate <b>2</b> can be structured to be almost equal to each other. In this case, the width dimension (width dimension of the inner space of the chamber <b>7</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) on the cross-section of the elongated chamber <b>7</b> taken along a plane perpendicular to the center axis thereof may be the same as the width dimension of the plasma ejection port <b>8</b> (the width dimension of the gap in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>), or maybe set slightly larger than this width dimension. In other words, the volume of plasma to be generated can be made extremely smaller as compared with that of a conventional structure. As a result, it is possible to remarkably increase the power efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Moreover, in the inner space of the elongated chamber <b>7</b>, since plasma can be generated relatively uniform in the longitudinal direction, the substrate <b>2</b> can be more uniformly processed as compared with the conventional example disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2009-545165 or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Furthermore, the torch unit T is of an inductive coupling type, and since a plurality of conductor rods <b>3</b> are disposed on the two sides of the chamber <b>7</b> in a manner so as to bridge over the chamber <b>7</b>, the plasma generating efficiency becomes higher. Since the wall surface of the chamber <b>7</b> is surrounded by the water cooling passage, the wall surface of the chamber <b>7</b> can be efficiently cooled and the torch unit can be operated stably as a thermal plasma source.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">(Second Embodiment)</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">A second embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a structure of a plasma processing apparatus according to the second embodiment of the present invention, and is a cross-sectional view of an inductive coupling-type plasma torch unit T<b>2</b> taken along a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal direction thereof, which corresponds to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Since the second embodiment of the present invention is different from the first embodiment only in a shape of a quartz block <b>4</b>B, the description other than this will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the quartz block <b>4</b>B is housed inside the brass block <b>5</b> and the brass lid <b>6</b> serving as one example of a conductor case that is grounded with an air layer interposed therebetween. That is, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the width of the quartz block <b>43</b> is made shorter than that of the quartz block <b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a space <b>96</b> is formed by the quartz block <b>43</b>, the brass block <b>5</b>, and the brass lid <b>6</b>, and the space <b>96</b> is filled with air serving as one example of an abnormal discharging preventive gas so as to provide an air layer.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">In the first embodiment, when the torch unit T is driven for a long period of time, an inert gas such as Ar of the plasma gas invades into a gap between the quartz block <b>4</b> and the brass block <b>5</b> or the brass block <b>6</b>, so that an abnormal discharge may occur in this gap. In order to avoid this, the air layer is formed by the abnormal discharging preventive space <b>96</b> in the second embodiment. In order to suppress a residing inert gas such as Ar more reliably, a hole that allows the space <b>96</b> and the outside space of the torch unit to communicate with each other may be formed, or by using a fan or the like, the accelerated exchange of the gas forming the air layer of the space <b>96</b> and the gas in the space outside the torch unit may be effective.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">The description has been given here on the assumption that the ambient gas in the space outside the torch unit is air. However, even in the case where the ambient gas in the space outside the torch unit is a gas such as N<sub>2</sub>, that is, an inert gas that requires a high discharge starting voltage under the atmospheric pressure, the same effects can be obtained. Alternatively, air, N<sub>2</sub>, or the like may be supplied to this air layer by using a flow-rate control device so that a residing inert gas, such as Ar, can be effectively avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Moreover, in the second embodiment, another advantage is achieved in which weights of the quartz block <b>48</b> and the torch unit T<b>2</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">(Third Embodiment)</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">A third embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> shows a structure of a plasma processing apparatus according to the third embodiment of the present invention, and is a cross-sectional view of an inductive coupling-type plasma torch unit T<b>3</b> taken along a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal direction thereof, which corresponds to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, in place of the quartz block <b>4</b> of the first embodiment, a large number of quartz pipes <b>23</b> serving as one example of dielectric tubes are installed. That is, each of the copper rod inserting holes <b>12</b> used as elongated holes for housing the copper rods <b>3</b> and the cooling water pipes <b>15</b> is formed as an inner space of each of the quartz pipes <b>23</b> corresponding to cylindrical tubes made of a dielectric member. Moreover, the inner space of the elongated chamber <b>7</b> is formed by gaps among the plurality of bundled quartz pipes <b>23</b>. In other words, instead of installing the quartz block <b>4</b>, on the two sides of the inside of a concave portion <b>5</b>Bb in the lower center portion of the brass block. <b>58</b>, sets of quartz pipes <b>23</b>, each having three pipes, for forming the cooling water pipes <b>15</b> inside thereof, are aligned side by side in the vertical direction. Moreover, on the inner side thereof, a quartz pipe <b>23</b> for forming the cooling water pipe <b>15</b> inside thereof, two quartz pipes <b>23</b> for forming the copper rod inserting holes <b>12</b> inside thereof, and a quartz pipe <b>23</b> for forming the cooling water pipe <b>15</b> inside thereof, that is, the total of four quartz pipes <b>23</b>, are aligned side by side in the vertical direction. Thus, an elongated chamber <b>7</b> is formed by using spaces corresponding to gaps formed between surfaces of these four quartz pipes <b>23</b> that are made to face each another. In a brass block <b>58</b> located further inner side of the three quartz pipes <b>23</b> that are placed at each of the two sides inside the concave portion <b>5</b>Bb in the lower center portion of the brass block <b>5</b>B, a through hale for use as the cooling water pipe <b>15</b> having a diameter smaller than that of the inner through hole of each quartz pipe <b>23</b> is formed in the same manner as in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">In the quartz block <b>9</b> in the first embodiment, the parts becomes relatively expensive since a large number of thin elongated holes <b>12</b> and <b>15</b> are required to be formed in the longitudinal direction. However, the cylindrical quartz pipes <b>23</b> are inexpensive since these are ready-made products that are mass-produced, and by bundling the quartz pipes <b>23</b> with one another to form the elongated chamber <b>7</b>, an inexpensive plasma processing apparatus can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">As a modified example of the third embodiment, a structure in which the second embodiment and the third embodiment are combined with each other will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B to 4E</figref> show an inductive coupling-type plasma torch unit T<b>3</b>A according to the modified example of the third embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the inductive coupling-type plasma torch unit T<b>3</b>A of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4C and 4D</figref> are cross-sectional views taken along a plane that is in parallel with the longitudinal direction of the inductive coupling-type plasma torch unit T<b>3</b>A, and perpendicular to the substrate <b>2</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along broken line A-A&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along broken line B-B&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along a broken line of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>. Moreover, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref> is a view showing an assembly structure of the inductive coupling-type plasma torch unit T<b>3</b>A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B to 4D</figref>, which includes perspective views of respective parts (one portion) that are placed side by side.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">In. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, a quartz block <b>4</b>C is housed in a brass block <b>5</b> and a brass lid <b>6</b> serving as one example of a conductor case that is grounded, with an air layer interposed therebetween. That is, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the width of the quartz block <b>4</b>C is made shorter than that of the quartz block <b>4</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. Moreover, onto a curved concave portion (dielectric tube fitting concave portion) <b>4</b>Cc on the outside surface of the quartz block <b>4</b>C, four quartz pipes <b>23</b> are integrally secured with an adhesive or low-melting-point glass, with its inside half being embedded therein. In this structure, the four quartz pipes <b>23</b> on the right and left sides are secured by being aligned at the same height. Of the four quartz pipes <b>23</b> on the right and left sides, copper rods <b>3</b> are inserted to the two quartz pipes <b>23</b> in the center to be installed therein.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Thus, the quartz block <b>4</b>C, the four quartz pipes <b>23</b>, the brass block <b>5</b>, and the brass lid <b>6</b> are combined to form a space <b>96</b>, and this space <b>96</b> is filled with air so as to provide an air layer.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">In this modified example, both of the effects of the second embodiment and the third embodiment can be obtained. Moreover, since the quartz pipes <b>23</b> and the quartz block <b>4</b>C are formed into an integral unit by using the adhesive or low-melting-point glass, the inner wall surfaces of the chamber <b>7</b> that is in contact with plasma can be effectively cooled.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">(Fourth Embodiment)</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">A fourth embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a structure of a plasma processing apparatus according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention, and is a cross-sectional view of an inductive coupling-type plasma torch unit T<b>4</b> taken along a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal direction thereof, which corresponds to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in the mid portion in the vertical direction of the elongated chamber <b>7</b>, a wide width portion <b>7</b><i>a </i>is provided, and its width dimension in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the elongated chamber <b>7</b> is made wider than the width dimension in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the plasma ejection port <b>8</b>. With the wide width portion <b>7</b><i>a</i>, the discharging space can be made larger so that it is possible to generate plasma more stably.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">With this structure, by ensuring a discharging space having a sufficient size, a stable plasma processing operation can be achieved.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">(Fifth Embodiment)</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">A fifth embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a structure of a plasma processing apparatus according to the fifth embodiment of the present invention, and is a cross-sectional view of an inductive coupling-type plasma torch unit T<b>5</b> taken along a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal direction thereof, which corresponds to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the width dimension of the plasma ejection port <b>8</b> serving as one example of an opening <b>5</b><i>c </i>formed on the lowermost portion of the brass block <b>5</b> is made larger than the width dimension of the opening of the quartz block <b>4</b> forming the plasma ejection port <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">In this structure, since the high-frequency electromagnetic field generated by the copper rods <b>3</b> allows plasma excitation to exert further downward, the plasma discharging intensity is increased so that it becomes possible to exert plasma having a higher temperature on the substrate <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">(Sixth Embodiment)</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">A sixth embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a structure of a plasma processing apparatus according to the Sixth embodiment of the present invention, and is a cross-sectional view of an inductive coupling-type plasma torch unit T<b>6</b> taken along a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal direction thereof, which corresponds to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the width dimension of an opening <b>5</b><i>d </i>formed on the lowermost portion of the brass block <b>5</b> is made slightly larger than the width dimension of a plasma ejection port <b>8</b> serving as one example of the opening of the quartz block <b>4</b> forming the plasma ejection port <b>8</b>. In the first embodiment, these are almost the same width. The concentration of an inert gas such as Ar is increased in a space between the torch unit T<b>6</b> and the substrate <b>2</b>, and therefore, since the structure of the first embodiment allows the lowermost portion of the brass block <b>5</b> to block the high-frequency electromagnetic field, the plasma excitation in this space is effectively suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">In contrast, in order to suppress the plasma excitation in this space, the sixth embodiment has a structure in which a shield gas is ejected to the proximity of the plasma ejection port <b>8</b> from a shield gas supply pipe installed in the brass block <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">In other words, while an inert gas such as Ar is supplied to the space inside the elongated chamber <b>7</b> to generate plasma, a gas such as N<sub>2 </sub>serving as one example of a shield gas, that is, an inert gas that requires a high discharge starting voltage under the atmospheric pressure, is supplied to the proximity of the plasma ejection port <b>8</b> in a manner so as to sandwich a long ejecting plasma from directions perpendicular to the longitudinal direction, so that the plasma is formed into an elongated shape. In this case, a shield gas nozzle <b>13</b> is secured so as to form a gap with the outer surface of the lower portion of the brass block <b>5</b> so that a shield gas manifold <b>19</b> is formed between the shield gas nozzle <b>13</b> and the brass block <b>5</b>. On the proximity of the outer surface of the lower portion of the brass block <b>5</b>, a shield gas injection passage <b>24</b> the upper end of which communicates with the shield gas manifold <b>14</b>, and which is inclined toward the center of the lower end of the brass block <b>5</b>, is formed so as to allow the lower end thereof to form a shield gas ejection port <b>24</b><i>a</i>. This shield gas ejection port <b>24</b><i>a </i>may be prepared as a slit-shaped gas outlet that is in parallel with the plasma ejection port <b>8</b>, or as a large number of gas outlets formed as holes that are placed in parallel with the plasma ejection port <b>8</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0193" num="0192">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A to 10</figref>, a substrate <b>102</b> is mounted on a substrate mounting base <b>101</b>. In the inductive coupling-type plasma torch unit T<b>8</b>, a coil serving as one example of a conductive unit is prepared by connecting a plurality of conductor rods <b>103</b>, disposed in parallel with the longitudinal direction of a chamber <b>107</b>, with one another by the conductor links (conductive couplers or connectors) <b>123</b> that are disposed perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the chamber <b>107</b> so as to form a structure having a spiral shape as a whole, in which the inner space of the spiral shape and the inner space of the chamber <b>107</b> are overlapped with each other. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, one end of the conductor rod <b>103</b> on the left-side upper end (left end of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>) and one end of the conductor rod <b>103</b> in the middle on the right side (left end of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>) are electrically connected with each other by the conductor link <b>123</b>, the other end of the conductor rod <b>103</b> in the middle on the right side (right end of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>) and the other end of the conductor rod <b>103</b> in the middle on the left side (right end of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 98</figref>) are electrically connected with each other by the conductor link <b>123</b>, one end of the conductor rod <b>103</b> in the middle on the left side (left end of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>) and one end of the conductor rod <b>103</b> on the right-side lower end (left end of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>) are electrically connected with each other by the conductor link <b>123</b>, and the other end of the conductor rod <b>103</b> on the right-side lower end (right end of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>) and the other end of the conductor rod <b>103</b> on the left-side lower end (right end of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>) are electrically connected with each other by the conductor link <b>123</b> so that the other end of the conductor rod <b>103</b> on the left-side lower end (left end of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>) and the other end of the conductor rod. <b>103</b> on the right-side upper end (left end of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>) form two ends of the coil; thus, these are electrically connected to a high-frequency power supply <b>91</b> with a high-frequency matching circuit <b>93</b> interposed therebetween so that high-frequency power is applied to the coil. In this case, the conductor rods <b>103</b> and the conductor links (conductive coupler or connector) <b>123</b> form a coil <b>103</b>C. The plurality of conductor rods <b>103</b> are respectively inserted into through holes <b>104</b><i>g </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) inside of quartz pipes <b>104</b> serving as one example of dielectric tubes in a manner so as to penetrate the quartz pipes <b>104</b>. On the periphery of the quartz pipes <b>104</b>, a brass block <b>105</b> serving as one example of a case or a device main-body block forming the wall surfaces of the chamber <b>107</b> is disposed, and the outside of each of the quartz pipes <b>104</b> is in contact with the brass block <b>105</b>. In other words, the brass block <b>105</b> has a T-shape in its longitudinal cross-section with two divided blocks <b>105</b><i>a</i>, each having a J-shape in its longitudinal cross-section, being joined to each other, and its center portion in the width direction orthogonal to the longitudinal direction of the brass block <b>105</b> is extended in the longitudinal direction over the entire length in the longitudinal direction so that a concave portion <b>105</b><i>b </i>that recesses upward from the lower-end opening is formed. Inside this concave portion <b>105</b><i>b</i>, three quartz pipes <b>104</b> are secured on each of the curved concave portions (dielectric tube fitting concave portions) <b>105</b><i>c </i>of the two side faces of the concave portion <b>105</b><i>b</i>, with its outside half each being embedded therein. In this case, the right and left respectively three quartz pipes <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> are not secured by being aligned at the same height, but in different heights so that the six quarts pipes <b>104</b> are disposed alternately, for example, with the right-side three quartz pipes <b>104</b> being set to a higher position than that of the left-side three quartz pipes <b>104</b> with a difference of about the radius dimension thereof. Therefore, the inside space of the chamber <b>107</b> is a thin elongated space surrounded by the quartz pipes <b>104</b>, the concave portion <b>105</b><i>b </i>of the brass block <b>105</b>, and the brass blocks <b>117</b> that are disposed on the two sides in the longitudinal direction of the brass block <b>105</b>. In other words, one portion of each of the quartz pipes <b>104</b> (the outer surface of a semi-cylindrical portion protruding inward) is exposed to the space inside the chamber <b>107</b> so as to be placed to form one portion of the wall surface.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">Above the concave portion <b>105</b><i>b </i>of each of the divided blocks <b>105</b><i>a </i>forming the brass block <b>105</b>, a groove that makes a plasma gas manifold <b>108</b> is formed, and a groove, which makes a plasma gas supply hole <b>109</b> serving as one example of a gas introducing port that allows the plasma gas manifold <b>108</b> and the concave portion <b>105</b><i>b</i>, that is, the chamber <b>107</b>, to communicate with each other, is formed. Therefore, upon forming the brass block <b>105</b> by combining the two divided blocks <b>105</b><i>a </i>with each other, these grooves are respectively joined with each other to form closed spaces so that this structure defines and forms the plasma manifold <b>108</b> and the plasma gas supply hole <b>109</b>. Moreover, on the outside in the width direction orthogonal to the longitudinal direction of the brass block <b>105</b>, rectangular plate-shaped lids <b>106</b> are respectively placed. On the inner surface of the lid <b>106</b> on the brass block <b>105</b> side, a counterbore that provides a, sheath gas manifold <b>110</b> is formed, and when this is combined with the brass block <b>105</b>, the space surrounded by the brass block <b>105</b> and the lid <b>106</b> provides a closed space so that the sheath gas manifold <b>110</b> is defined and formed. Moreover, in the brass block <b>105</b>, a through hole that provides a sheath gas supply hole <b>111</b> that extends from each of the sheath gas manifolds <b>110</b> in the width direction of the brass block <b>105</b> to reach the outer surface of each of the quartz pipes <b>104</b> is formed. The sheath gas supply device <b>97</b> is connected to the respective sheath gas manifolds <b>110</b> so that a sheath gas (dielectric tube protective gas) can be supplied from the sheath gas supply device <b>97</b> controlled by the control device <b>95</b> to the sheath gas manifolds <b>110</b>. The sheath gas, which is supplied to the sheath gas manifolds <b>110</b>, reaches the outer surface of each of the quartz pipes <b>104</b> from the sheath gas supply holes <b>111</b>, and is directed around the outer surface of each quartz pipe <b>104</b> from the gap between the curved concave portion <b>105</b><i>c </i>and the quartz pipe <b>104</b> so that the sheath gas is introduced into the chamber <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">Moreover, on a portion near the substrate mounting base <b>101</b> below the lid <b>106</b> (in other words, between the lid <b>106</b> and the substrate mounting base <b>101</b>), a pair of shield gas nozzles <b>113</b> serving as one example of a shield gas supply member are disposed with the plasma ejection port <b>108</b> sandwiched therebetween. The paired shield gas nozzles <b>113</b> are supported on the brass block <b>105</b> by, for example, a not-shown support arm (see the support arm <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the first embodiment) to be secured therein. On the surface of each of the shield gas nozzles <b>113</b> on the plasma gas ejection port <b>108</b> side, a large number of shield gas introducing ports <b>113</b><i>a </i>placed in the longitudinal direction are opened, and in the inner portion of each shield gas nozzle <b>113</b>, a shield gas manifold <b>114</b> used for connecting the shield gas supply device <b>92</b> to the plurality of nozzles is installed. In this manner, three types of gas introducing systems for the plasma gas, sheath gas, and shield gas are prepared so that by appropriately adjusting the gas types, gas flow rates, or the like in a divided manner into a plasma gas suitable for generating plasma and a sheath gas for protecting the outer wall surface of each of the quartz pipes <b>104</b>, it is possible to carry out a stable plasma processing operation, and also to prevent gases, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and the like in the atmosphere, that are unnecessary for plasma processing or cause adverse effects thereto, from being mixed onto the plasma irradiation surface by additionally supplying a shield gas.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">In this structure, a coolant supply device <b>98</b> is connected to the inside of a through hole <b>104</b><i>g </i>inside the quartz pipe <b>104</b> in which the conductor rod <b>103</b> is placed so that the inside thereof is immersed with water serving as one example of an insulating fluid, and by allowing water serving as one example of the coolant to flow therethrough, the quartz pipe <b>104</b> and the conductor rod <b>103</b> are cooled. Moreover, each of the conductor rods <b>103</b> is a hollow tube, and water serving as one example an insulating fluid supplied from the coolant supply device <b>98</b> is allowed to also flow into the through hole <b>103</b><i>g </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) inside the conductor rod <b>103</b> so that the conductor rods <b>103</b> are cooled. In other words, the insulating fluid serving as one example of the coolant is allowed to flow through a space between the outer wall surface of each of the conductor rods <b>103</b> and the inner wall surface of each of the quartz pipes <b>104</b> so that the conductor rods <b>103</b> and the quartz pipes <b>104</b> are cooled, and in this structure, each conductor rod <b>103</b> is prepared as a hollow tube so that by allowing the insulating fluid serving as one example of the coolant to flow through the inner space of the tube formed by the conductor rod <b>103</b>, the conductor rod <b>103</b> is cooled.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">Moreover, in the brass block <b>105</b>, cooling water pipes <b>115</b> serving as coolant passages penetrating the block <b>105</b> are formed near the concave portion <b>105</b><i>b</i>, and are connected to the coolant supply device <b>98</b>. More specifically, these water channels (coolant passages) are allowed to communicate with the coolant supply device <b>98</b> through each of cooling water manifolds <b>122</b> which is placed outside of each brass block <b>117</b> and formed by a space between the resin case <b>118</b> and the brass block <b>117</b>. On the resin case <b>118</b>, a cooling water inlet <b>124</b><i>a </i>and a cooling water outlet <b>124</b><i>b </i>serving as a coolant introducing port and a coolant discharging port respectively connected to the coolant supply device <b>98</b> are formed one by one so that the arrangement of the water cooling pipes onto the inductive coupling-type plasma torch unit T<b>8</b> are made very simple, and thus, it becomes possible to provide a small-size torch.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">Among the conductor rods <b>103</b>, two long conductor rods <b>103</b><i>a </i>corresponding to two ends of a coil (the conductor rod <b>103</b> on the right-side upper end and the conductor rod <b>103</b> on the left-side lower end in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) are connected to a copper block <b>119</b> through a high-frequency introducing terminal hole <b>126</b> and a ground terminal hole <b>127</b> formed on the resin case <b>118</b> and further connected to a high-frequency matching circuit <b>93</b> through a copper plate <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">A rectangular slit-shaped plasma ejection port <b>112</b> (sometimes referred to as &#x201c;opening portion&#x201d;) that communicates with the chamber <b>107</b> is formed in the center of the lower end of the brass block <b>105</b>, and the substrate mounting base <b>101</b> (or the substrate <b>102</b> on the substrate mounting base <b>101</b>) is disposed so as to face the plasma ejection port <b>112</b>. In this state, high-frequency power is supplied to the conductor rods <b>103</b> forming a coil from the high-frequency power supply <b>91</b> through the high-frequency matching circuit <b>93</b>, while the gas is supplied into the chamber <b>107</b> with the gas being ejected from the plasma ejection port <b>112</b> toward the substrate <b>102</b>. Thus, plasma is generated inside the chamber <b>107</b>, and the plasma is applied onto the substrate <b>2</b> from the plasma ejection port <b>112</b> so that a thin film <b>116</b> on the substrate <b>102</b> can be plasma-processed.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">This structure is characterized by a structure in which all the longitudinal direction of the chamber <b>107</b>, the longitudinal direction of the conductor rods <b>103</b>, and the longitudinal direction of the ejection port <b>112</b> are made in parallel with one another, and by relatively shifting the chamber <b>107</b> and the substrate mounting base <b>101</b> in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the ejection port <b>112</b> by the shifting device (the same shifting device as the first embodiment) <b>94</b>, the substrate <b>102</b> is processed. That is, the inductive coupling-type plasma torch unit T<b>8</b> or the substrate mounting base <b>101</b> is moved in a lateral direction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, that is, a direction perpendicular to the plane of drawing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">The following description will discuss the structure of a gas supply system. A plasma gas supply pipe <b>141</b> is formed on a flange <b>125</b>. The flange <b>125</b> is combined with the upper end face of the brass block <b>105</b> so that the plasma gas supply pipe <b>141</b> is allowed to communicate with a plasma gas manifold <b>108</b> from the plasma gas supply pipe <b>141</b> and a through hole on the upper end face of the brass block <b>105</b>. Moreover, sheath gas supply pipes <b>142</b> are respectively formed on the lid <b>106</b>, and allowed to communicate with the sheath gas manifold <b>110</b> through a through hole inside the lid <b>106</b>. A groove to be formed into the plasma manifold <b>108</b> is deep, and is engraved on the chamber <b>107</b> in parallel with its longitudinal direction as a long groove so as to serve as a gas reservoir. Grooves to be formed into the plasma gas supply holes <b>109</b> are shallow, and are engraved on the chamber <b>107</b> in its longitudinal direction as short grooves, and a large number of the grooves are prepared.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">A gas outlet of each of the plasma gas supply holes <b>109</b> is positioned on a surface opposed to the ejection port <b>112</b>. Each of the quartz pipes <b>104</b> is fitted to a curved concave portion <b>105</b><i>c </i>that is formed in a curved shape on the side face of the concave portion <b>105</b><i>b </i>formed in the brass block <b>105</b>, and in this structure, a plasma gas is allowed to exude out from a small gap between the curved concave portion <b>105</b><i>c </i>of the brass block <b>105</b> and the quartz pipe <b>104</b> sideward, that is, in a direction perpendicular to a direction from the torch unit T<b>8</b> toward the substrate <b>102</b>. Suppose that the portion from which the gas exudes out into the gas chamber <b>107</b> is referred to as a gas introducing port, the gas introducing port is formed in parallel with the longitudinal direction of the ejection port <b>112</b>, and this structure introduces the gas along the outer wall surface of each quartz pipe <b>104</b>. In contrast, the shield gas is discharged toward a gap between the ejection port <b>112</b> and the substrate <b>102</b> from a plurality of holes, or a single groove, which are allowed to communicate with the shield gas manifold <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">In this case, by devising the direction of the holes or the single groove, the direction of gas ejection can be directed to the ejection port <b>112</b> or the surface of the substrate <b>102</b>, and the direction is selected on demand depending on the types of processes. With this structure, it becomes possible to protect the outer wall surface of each quartz pipe <b>104</b> serving as one example of a dielectric tube, by using a smaller gas flow rate.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">The following description will discuss the way in which the cooling water is allowed to flow. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the brass block <b>117</b> has a function for positioning the quartz pipes <b>104</b> so that the through holes <b>117</b><i>a </i>are formed according to the number of the quartz pipes <b>104</b>. In each of the through holes <b>117</b><i>a</i>, counterbores <b>117</b><i>b </i>and <b>117</b><i>c </i>are formed from both of the sides, and an O-ring <b>128</b> for preventing water leakage is placed on the counterbore <b>117</b><i>b </i>on the inside, and a portion <b>104</b><i>c </i>of the quartz pipe <b>104</b> with a widened diameter is fitted thereto. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, a rectangular through hole <b>129</b><i>a </i>is formed near the tip of each of the two ends of the quartz pipe <b>104</b> so that when fitted to the brass block <b>117</b>, the through hole <b>129</b><i>a </i>is placed into the counterbore <b>117</b><i>c </i>on the outside. The two ends of the quartz pipe <b>104</b> are closed by bushes <b>121</b> so as to make the center axes of the conductor rod <b>103</b> and the quartz pipe <b>104</b> coincident with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">Therefore, in this structure, from one of the cooling water manifolds <b>122</b>, the cooling water passes through the counterbore <b>117</b><i>c </i>on the outside of one of the brass blocks <b>117</b> and the through hole <b>129</b><i>a</i>, and is allowed to flow into the through hole <b>104</b><i>g </i>inside the quartz pipe <b>104</b> from one end side, and on the other end side of the through hole <b>104</b><i>g</i>, the cooling water passes through the through hole <b>129</b><i>a </i>and the outside counterbore <b>117</b><i>c </i>of the other brass block <b>117</b> and goes out toward the other cooling water manifold <b>122</b>. In this case, in the center of the bush <b>121</b>, a through hole <b>121</b><i>g</i>, which allows the conductor rod <b>103</b> to penetrate and protrude therethrough, is formed so that the cooling water is allowed to flow into one end of the through hole <b>103</b><i>g </i>inside the conductor rod <b>103</b> from one of the cooling water manifolds <b>122</b>, and to go out toward the other cooling water manifold <b>122</b> from the other end of the through hole <b>103</b><i>g. </i></p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">In this case, however, one end of the long conductor rod <b>103</b><i>a </i>has a structure to penetrate the high-frequency introducing terminal hole <b>126</b> and the ground terminal hole <b>127</b> formed on the resin case <b>118</b>, and in order to allow water to communicate with the inside thereof, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the through hole <b>129</b><i>b </i>is formed near one of the end sides of the long conductor rod <b>103</b><i>a </i>so that by allowing the through hole <b>129</b><i>b </i>to face one of the cooling water manifolds <b>122</b>, the cooling water is allowed to flow between one of the cooling water manifolds <b>122</b> and the through hole <b>129</b><i>b</i>. In other words, in this structure, the cooling water is allowed to flow from one of the cooling water manifolds <b>122</b> inside the counterbore formed in one of the resin cases <b>118</b> into one end of the through hole <b>103</b><i>g </i>inside the long conductor rod <b>103</b><i>a </i>through the through hole <b>129</b><i>b</i>, passes through the through hole <b>129</b><i>a </i>and the counterbore <b>117</b><i>c </i>outside the other brass block <b>117</b> from the other end of the through hole <b>103</b><i>g </i>inside the long conductor rod <b>103</b><i>a</i>, and goes out toward the other cooling water manifold <b>122</b> inside the counterbore formed in the other resin case <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">Moreover, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the plurality of conductor rods <b>103</b> are connected with one another by the conductor link <b>123</b> to form a spiral shape with the number of turns of 3 so that the inner space of the spiral shape and the inner space of the chamber <b>107</b> are, overlapped with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">In this structure, the length dimension in the longitudinal direction of the plasma ejection port <b>12</b> is equal to or is made longer than the width dimension of the substrate <b>102</b> so that even a scanning process of one time (shifting the torch unit T<b>8</b> and the substrate mounting base <b>101</b> relative to each other) makes it possible to carry out thermal treatment on the entire thin film <b>116</b> on the proximity of the surface of the substrate <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">In this plasma processing apparatus, by supplying high-frequency power of 13.56 MHz from the high-frequency power supply <b>91</b> to the conductor rods <b>103</b> forming a coil while a gas is being ejected toward the substrate <b>102</b> from the plasma ejection port <b>112</b>, with an Ar gas or Ar+H<sub>2 </sub>gas being supplied into the chamber <b>107</b> through a plasma gas supply hole <b>109</b>, and a N<sub>2 </sub>gas being supplied from the respective shield gas introducing ports <b>113</b><i>a </i>of the shield gas nozzle <b>113</b>, plasma is generated inside the chamber <b>107</b>. Then, by applying the plasma onto the substrate <b>102</b> from the plasma ejection port <b>112</b>, while scanning the substrate <b>102</b>, heating treatment such as crystallizing of the semiconductor film can be carried out over the entire desired processing region of the substrate <b>102</b> in a short period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">As described above, since the chamber <b>107</b> and the substrate mounting base <b>101</b> are relatively shifted in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the plasma ejection port <b>112</b>, with the longitudinal direction of the plasma ejection port <b>112</b> and the substrate mounting base <b>101</b> being kept in parallel with each other, the length dimension of plasma to be generated and the processing length dimension of the substrate <b>102</b> can be designed to be almost equal to each other. In this case, it is only necessary for the width dimension (width dimension of the inner space of the chamber <b>107</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>) on the cross-section of the chamber <b>107</b> taken along a plane perpendicular to the center axis thereof to be made longer than the width dimension (length dimension of the gap in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>) of the plasma ejection port <b>112</b> even in a small degree. In other words, the volume of plasma to be generated can be made extremely smaller as compared with that of a conventional structure. As a result, it is possible to remarkably increase the power efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">Moreover, in the inner space of the chamber <b>107</b>, since relatively uniform plasma can be generated in the direction toward the center axis, the plasma is made uniform in the longitudinal direction so that the substrate <b>102</b> can be more uniformly processed.</p>

<p id="p-0214" num="0213">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, only two conductor rods <b>103</b> (that is, two conductor rods <b>103</b> on the right-side lower end as well as on the left-side lower end in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>) are prepared, and both of the two conductor rods <b>103</b> are long conductor rods <b>103</b><i>a</i>.

<p id="p-0218" num="0217">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, since two conductor rods <b>103</b> are disposed on positions having the same height, the two conductor rods <b>103</b> are disposed with the same distance from the ejection port <b>112</b>, and by connecting the conductor rods <b>103</b> with the conductor link <b>123</b>, a coil with the number of turn of 1 is formed.</p>

<p id="p-0220" num="0219">An eleventh embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows a structure of a plasma processing apparatus according to the eleventh embodiment of the present invention, and is a cross-sectional view of an inductive coupling-type plasma torch unit T<b>11</b> taken along a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal direction thereof. Since the eleventh embodiment of the present invention is only different from the eighth embodiment in the layouts of the conductor rods <b>103</b> and the quartz pipes <b>104</b>, the description other than these will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, with respect to six conductor rods <b>103</b>, since three conductor rods <b>103</b> on the right and left sides are respectively disposed in the same height, two conductor rods form a pair and are disposed at the same distance from the ejection port <b>112</b>, and connected with one another by the conductor link <b>123</b> so that a coil with the number of turns of 3 is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">Alternatively, by connecting each pair of two conductor rods to different high-frequency power supplies, power to be supplied to the respective pairs can be independently controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">Moreover, as shown as an inductive coupling-type plasma torch unit T<b>11</b>A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, a sheath gas manifold <b>110</b> and a sheath gas supply hole <b>111</b> may be formed into different systems for every pairs. With this arrangement, it is possible to set a minimum amount of a sheath gas flow rate that is required for each of the pairs.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">Alternatively, the independent controlling process for power to be supplied to each of the pairs and the arrangement in which the sheath gas manifold <b>110</b> and the sheath gas supply hole <b>311</b> are formed into different systems for each of the pairs can be simultaneously prepared. In this case, different types of gases are supplied to the respective systems, and its ionization degree is controlled by using power balances so that plasma processing having superior controllability can be carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">The plasma processing apparatuses and methods thereof as exemplified above are only typical examples within the scope of applications of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">For example, each of the inductive coupling-type plasma torch units T to T<b>11</b>A may be scanned relative to a fixed substrate mounting base <b>1</b> or <b>101</b>, or the substrate mounting base <b>1</b> or <b>101</b> may be scanned relative to each of fixed inductive coupling-type plasma torch units T to T<b>11</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">By using various structures of the present invention, it becomes possible to carry out high-temperature treatment on the proximity of the surface of a substrate <b>2</b> or <b>102</b>, and in addition to applications to crystallization of a semiconductor film for use in TFTs, described in detail in the conventional example, or to modification of a semiconductor film for use in solar batteries, the present invention is also applicable to various surface treatments, such as cleaning or a reduction of degassing of a protective layer for a plasma display panel, a surface flattening process or a reduction of degassing of a dielectric layer made of aggregated bodies of silica fine particles, a reflow process of various electronic devices, or a plasma doping process using a solid impurity source. Moreover, with respect to a manufacturing method of solar batteries, the present invention is also applicable to a method in which powder, obtained by pulverizing a silicon ingot, is applied to a substrate and plasma is applied thereto to be fused so that a polycrystalline silicon film is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">Moreover, another structure may be proposed in which plasma gas supply pipes <b>10</b> and <b>110</b> are surrounded by conductors that are grounded. In the case where the plasma gas supply pipes <b>10</b> and <b>110</b> are made of a dielectric material, the inside of the pipes is irradiated with a high-frequency electromagnetic field to sometimes cause an undesired discharge inside the pipes. By using the structure in which the plasma gas supply pipes <b>10</b> and <b>110</b> are surrounded by conductors that are grounded, such an undesired discharge can be effectively suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">Moreover, the coil <b>3</b>H having a spiral shape may be prepared to have a shape with multiple spirals, as disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 8-83696). By using this structure, the inductance of the coil can be reduced, and the power efficiency can be improved. This structure is particularly effective when the width of a substrate <b>2</b> to be processed is large, that is, when the inductive coupling-type plasma torch unit or the coil is long in the longitudinal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">Moreover, the gas ejection ports (openings) may be prepared as a plurality of dot-shaped openings, or may be linearly formed.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">Furthermore, the structure using brass as metal, for a part material has been exemplified; however, among parts made of metal materials, it is possible to prevent a metal material from being mixed into plasma and also to suppress an arc discharge by coating portions corresponding to the inner walls of the chambers <b>7</b> and <b>107</b> with an insulator material.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">Moreover, in order to easily ignite plasma, an ignition source may be used. As the ignition source, an ignition spark device for use in a gas hot-water supplier or the like may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">For convenience of description, a square substrate is illustrated as the substrate <b>2</b> or <b>102</b>; however, the present invention is not limited thereto, and any shape such as a round shape may be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">Moreover, for convenience of description, the term &#x201c;thermal plasma&#x201d; is used; however, strictly speaking, the distinction between &#x201c;thermal plasma&#x201d; and &#x201c;low-temperature plasma&#x201d; is very difficult, and, for example, as described in &#x201c;Non-equilibrium in thermal plasma&#x201d;, Journal of Plasma Fusion Society, Vol. 82 No. 8 (2006) pp. 479-483, it is also difficult to distinguish the types of plasma only based upon thermal equilibrium. One of the objects of the present invention is to carry out thermal treatment on a substrate so that the present invention can be applied to techniques for applying high-temperature plasma, without being limited by the terms such as thermal plasma, thermally equilibrium plasma, or high-temperature plasma.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">Moreover, although the process in which high-temperature heating treatment is uniformly carried out on the proximity of the surface of a substrate only for a short period of time has been exemplified in detail, the present invention may also be applied to a process in which low-temperature plasma process is carried out on a substrate by applying plasma derived from a reaction gas or simultaneously applying plasma and a reaction gas flow to the substrate. By mixing a plasma gas or a sheath gas with a reaction gas, plasma derived from the reaction gas is applied to a substrate so that an etching or CVD process can be realized. Alternatively, as one example of the plasma gas or the sheath gas, a rare gas or a gas prepared by mixing a small amount of H<sub>2 </sub>gas with a rare gas is used, while, as one example of the shield gas, a gas containing a reaction gas is supplied so that by simultaneously applying the plasma and the reaction gas flow to a substrate, a plasma processing such as an etching, CVD, or doping process can also be realized. When a gas mainly composed of argon is used as the plasma gas or sheath gas, thermal plasma is generated as exemplified in the embodiments in detail. On the other hand, when a gas including helium as a main component is used as the plasma gas or sheath gas, relatively low-temperature plasma can be generated.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">By using these methods, an etching or film-forming process can be carried out without heating the substrate too much. As the reaction gas for use in etching, a halogen-containing gas, for example, CxFy (x and y are natural numbers), SF<sub>6</sub>, or the like are proposed so as to carry out an etching process on silicon or silicon compounds. By using O<sub>2 </sub>as the reaction gas, a removing process of an organic substance or a resist ashing process can be carried out. As the reaction gas for use in CVD, for example, monosilane or disilane is proposed so as to carry out a film-forming process of silicon or a silicon compound. Alternatively, by using a mixed gas between an organic gas containing silicon, typically represented by TEOS (Tetraethoxysilane), and O<sub>2</sub>, a film-forming process of a silicon oxide film can be executed.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">In addition to these, various low-temperature plasma processing operations such as surface treatments for improving water repellency or hydrophilicity can be carried out. As compared with the conventional technique (for example, the technique described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2007-287454), since the present invention uses inductive coupling-type materials, a transition to an arc discharge hardly occurs even when a high power density per unit volume is applied, and plasma with high density can be generated, thereby making it possible to obtain a high reaction speed and consequently to carry out treatment on the entire desired processing region of a substrate in a shorter period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">Moreover, the conductor rods <b>3</b> and <b>103</b> have been exemplified as one example of the conductor member; however, the conductor member is not limited to the rod-shaped member, and a plate-shaped member may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">Among the above-mentioned various embodiments and modified examples, by combining desired embodiments and modified examples with one another on demand, it is possible to obtain the respective effects.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">As described above, the present invention is applicable to crystallization of a semiconductor film for use in TFTs or modification of a semiconductor film for use in solar batteries. Of course, the present invention provides an effective method by which, in various surface treatments such as cleaning or a reduction of degassing of a protective layer for a plasma display panel, a surface flattening process or a reduction of degassing of a dielectric layer made of aggregated bodies of silica fine particles, a reflow process of various electronic devices, or a plasma doping process using a solid impurity source, the entire desired processing area of a substrate can be processed in a short time upon carrying out high-temperature thermal treatment uniformly on the proximity of a surface of the substrate for only a very short period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">Moreover, the present invention provides an effective method by which, in low-temperature plasma processes such as an etching, or film-forming, or surface-modifying process, upon producing various electronic devices or the like, the entire desired processing area of the substrate can be processed in a short time.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.</p>
