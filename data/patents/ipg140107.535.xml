<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A hinge assembly includes a shaft, a main body drive member, a follower, and a resilient member. The main body drive member, the follower, and the resilient member are mounted with the shaft in turn. One end of the main body drive member has a cam. One end of the follower has a cam engaging with the cam of the main body drive member. The resilient member causes the cam of the follower to resist the cam of the main body drive member due to the decompression of the resilient member, and when the follower is manually rotated relative to the main body drive member about an angle, the follower automatically rotates relative to the main body drive member due to the decompression of the resilient member.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention generally relates to hinge assemblies and, more particularly, to a hinge assembly for hinging together housings of foldable electronic devices.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With the development of the technologies of wireless communication and information processing, portable electronic devices such as mobile phones and notebooks are now in widespread use. Foldable electronic devices are particularly favored by consumers for their convenience. Generally, foldable electronic devices have a main body and a cover. Various types of hinge assemblies are used to join the main body and the cover of the foldable electronic device, so that the cover can unfold from and fold on the main body.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A conventional hinge assembly includes a shaft, a cam, a follower engaging with the cam, and a spring. The cam, the follower, and the spring are mounted on the shaft. However, when using such a hinge assembly, a cover generally is manually rotated to a relative large angle, for example, 70-80 degrees, relative to the main body, before the cover can automatically open.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, there is room for improvement within the art.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref> show a hinge assembly <b>100</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the present hinge system. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the hinge assembly <b>100</b>, in the embodiment illustrated, is used to interconnect a main body <b>320</b> and a cover <b>310</b> of a foldable electronic device <b>300</b>. The cover <b>310</b> has a hinge cavity <b>312</b> formed at one end. The main body <b>320</b> defines a mounting hole <b>322</b> in one end. The hinge assembly <b>100</b> includes a shaft <b>10</b>, a main body drive member <b>20</b>, a follower <b>30</b>, a first resilient member <b>40</b>, a second resilient member <b>50</b>, a cover drive member <b>60</b>, and a disk <b>70</b>. The shaft <b>10</b> extends through the main body drive member <b>20</b>, the follower <b>30</b>, the first resilient member <b>40</b>, the second resilient member <b>50</b>, the cover drive member <b>60</b>, and the disk <b>70</b>, thereby integrating the hinge assembly <b>100</b> into a complete unit. While the hinge assembly <b>100</b> is shown incorporated into the foldable electronic device <b>300</b>, it is to be understood that the hinge assembly <b>100</b> or obvious variations thereof may prove useful in other work environments (e.g., cabinet doors) as well.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The shaft <b>10</b> has a cylindrical head <b>12</b> having a larger diameter and a cylindrical rod <b>14</b> having a smaller diameter. The head <b>12</b> is formed at one end of the rod <b>14</b>. The other end of the rod <b>14</b> opposing to the head <b>12</b> defines an annular groove <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The main body drive member <b>20</b> includes a fixing portion <b>22</b> and a cam <b>24</b>. The fixing portion <b>22</b> is substantially cylindrical and has two symmetrical flat surfaces <b>222</b> on the outer peripheral wall. The fixing portion <b>22</b> engages with the main body <b>320</b> of the foldable electronic device <b>300</b> so that the main body drive member <b>20</b> rotates with the main body <b>320</b>. The fixing portion <b>22</b> defines a central hole <b>26</b> and has a plurality of positioning protrusions <b>262</b> on the inner wall. The head <b>12</b> is fixed in the central hole <b>26</b> due to the positioning protrusions <b>262</b> and moves with the main body drive member <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the cam <b>24</b> extends from an end of the fixing portion <b>22</b> and may be either integrally attached to or separately formed from the main body drive member <b>20</b>. Though being coaxial, a diameter of the cam <b>24</b> is smaller than the diameter of the fixing portion <b>22</b>. The cam <b>24</b> includes two symmetrical first cam portions <b>242</b>. A first stage <b>252</b> and a second stage <b>254</b> are respectively formed at bottoms of inner surfaces of the first cam portions <b>242</b>. A radial thickness of the first stage <b>252</b> is smaller than the radial thickness of the second stage <b>254</b>. The first stage <b>252</b> and the second stage <b>254</b> are formed by cutting away arcuate inner material of the first cam portions <b>242</b>. It not only causes a thickness of a bottom of each first cam portion <b>242</b> to be thicker than the thickness of the other part of each first cam portion <b>242</b>, but also causes two first cam portions <b>242</b> having a different radial thicknesses. Each first cam portion <b>242</b> has a vertical beginning slope <b>2421</b>, a resisting slope <b>2422</b>, a peak <b>2423</b>, a guiding slope <b>2424</b>, and a valley <b>2425</b>. Each of the first stage <b>252</b> and the second stage <b>254</b> at least partially surround the central hole <b>26</b>, and are opposite to each other. Each of the first stage <b>252</b> and the second stage <b>254</b> extend from a beginning point of the vertical beginning slope <b>2421</b> to an end point of the guiding slope <b>2424</b> along an inner circumferential edge of each first cam portion <b>242</b>. Each first cam portion <b>242</b> includes an arcuate inner surface <b>2427</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the follower <b>30</b> is substantially cylindrical. One end of the follower <b>30</b> has an engaging cam <b>302</b> for engaging with the cam <b>24</b>. The other end of the follower <b>30</b> has a flat end surface <b>304</b>. The follower <b>30</b> defines a circular hole <b>34</b> through a center for the shaft <b>10</b> travel through. The follower <b>30</b> has two sliding protrusions <b>36</b> formed on opposite sides of the peripheral wall. The engaging cam <b>302</b> has two symmetrical second cam portions <b>3020</b>. A first supporting wall <b>305</b> and a second supporting wall <b>306</b> are formed between the two second cam portions <b>3020</b> and are positioned on inner circumferential edges of the second cam portions <b>3020</b>. The first supporting wall <b>305</b> and the second supporting wall <b>306</b> at least partially surround the circular hole <b>34</b>. The thickness of the first supporting wall <b>305</b> and the second supporting wall <b>306</b> respectively correspond to the radial width of the first stage <b>252</b> and the second stage <b>254</b>. A thickness of the first supporting wall <b>305</b> is thinner than the thickness of the second supporting wall <b>306</b>. The first supporting wall <b>305</b> includes an arcuate outer surface <b>3050</b>, and the second supporting wall <b>306</b> includes an outer surface <b>3060</b>. A connecting wall <b>308</b> is formed between the two second cam portions <b>3020</b> and on the outer circumferential edge of the second cam portions <b>3020</b>. The connecting wall <b>308</b> is opposite to the first supporting wall <b>305</b>. Each second cam portion <b>3020</b> has a vertical beginning slope <b>3021</b>, a resisting slope <b>3022</b>, a peak <b>3023</b>, a guiding slope <b>3024</b>, and a valley <b>3025</b>. When the first supporting wall <b>305</b> abuts against the first stage <b>252</b> and the second supporting wall <b>306</b> abuts against the second stage <b>254</b>, the vertical beginning slopes <b>2421</b> of the first cam portions <b>242</b> can contact the vertical beginning slopes <b>3021</b> of the second cam portions <b>3020</b>. The peaks <b>2423</b> of the first cam portions <b>242</b> are received in the valley <b>3025</b> of the follower <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The first resilient member <b>40</b> is a coil spring in the present embodiment. An inner diameter of the first resilient member <b>40</b> is larger than an outer diameter of the rod <b>14</b>, so that the first resilient member <b>40</b> may be mounted around the rod <b>14</b>. One end of the first resilient member <b>40</b> abuts against the end surface <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The second resilient member <b>50</b> is a coil spring in the present embodiment. An inner diameter of the second resilient member <b>50</b> is larger than an outer diameter of the first resilient member <b>40</b>, so that the second resilient member <b>50</b> may be mounted around the first resilient member <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The cover drive member <b>60</b> is a substantially hollow cylinder. An outer diameter of the follower <b>30</b>, the outer diameter of the first resilient member <b>40</b>, and an outer diameter of the second resilient member <b>50</b> are all smaller than an inner diameter of the cover drive member <b>60</b>, so that the follower <b>30</b> and the first and second resilient members <b>40</b>, <b>50</b> can be received in the cover drive member <b>60</b>. The cover drive member <b>60</b> has an open end <b>62</b> and an opposite partially-closed end <b>64</b>. A diameter of the fixing portion <b>22</b> of the main body drive member <b>20</b> is smaller than a diameter of the open end <b>62</b>, so that the fixing portion <b>22</b> can move in the cover drive member <b>60</b>. The partially-closed end <b>64</b> defines a central aperture <b>642</b>. The cover drive member <b>60</b> has two parallel flat surfaces <b>66</b> on a peripheral wall. The cover drive member <b>60</b> defines two guiding slots <b>68</b> respectively through the two flat surfaces <b>66</b> for the two sliding protrusions <b>36</b> mounting therein. Each sliding protrusion <b>36</b> of the follower <b>30</b> is slidably received in one corresponding guiding slot <b>68</b>. The cover drive member <b>60</b> engages with the cover <b>310</b> of the foldable electronic device <b>300</b> so that the cover drive member <b>60</b> rotates with the cover <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The disk <b>70</b> is made of metal material. In the present embodiment, the disk <b>70</b> is substantially C-shaped and is clasped in the groove <b>142</b>, thereby mounting the shaft <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in assembly, the shaft <b>10</b> travels through the hole <b>26</b> of the main body drive member <b>20</b> and the positioning protrusions <b>262</b> resist the head <b>12</b>, so that the main body drive member <b>20</b> is fixed to the shaft <b>10</b>. The follower <b>30</b>, the first resilient member <b>40</b>, the second resilient member <b>50</b>, and the cover drive member <b>60</b> are mounted with the shaft <b>10</b> in turn. The second cam portions <b>3020</b> of the follower <b>30</b> engage with the first cam portions <b>242</b> of the cam <b>24</b>. The first supporting wall <b>305</b> and the second supporting wall <b>306</b> respectively abut against the first stage <b>252</b> and the second stage <b>254</b>. The hinge assembly <b>100</b> is at an assembled state. Each sliding protrusion <b>36</b> of the follower <b>30</b> is received in one corresponding guiding slot <b>68</b>. One end of each of the first and second resilient members <b>40</b>, <b>50</b> abuts against the end surface <b>304</b>, and the other end of each of the first and second resilient members <b>40</b>, <b>50</b> abuts against the partially-closed end <b>64</b>. The coiling direction of the second resilient member <b>50</b> is reverse relative to the coiling direction of the first resilient member <b>40</b>. One end the rod <b>14</b> travels through the aperture <b>642</b>, and the disk <b>70</b> is mounted in the groove <b>142</b>. Thus, the hinge assembly <b>100</b> is assembled.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, when mounting the hinge assembly <b>100</b> with the foldable electronic device <b>300</b>, the hinge assembly <b>100</b> is partially received in the hinge cavity <b>312</b>. The fixing portion <b>22</b> is pushed to move towards the disk <b>70</b>, hence the follower <b>30</b> moves and compresses the first and second resilient members <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>. When the fixing portion <b>22</b> is moved into the cover drive member <b>60</b> and the hinge cavity <b>312</b> and faces the mounting hole <b>322</b>, the fixing portion <b>22</b> is released and automatically moves into the mounting hole <b>322</b> due to the decompression of the first and second resilient members <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>. The main body drive member <b>20</b> non-rotatably engages with the main body <b>320</b>, and the cover drive member <b>60</b> non-rotatably engages with the cover <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, when the cover <b>310</b> is closed relative to the main body <b>320</b>, the follower <b>30</b> is rotated relative to the main body drive member <b>20</b> to an initial state from the assembled state. The resisting slope <b>3022</b> of the follower <b>30</b> abuts against the resisting slope <b>2422</b> of the main body drive member <b>20</b>. The first and second resilient members <b>40</b>, <b>50</b> are compressed to enable the cover <b>310</b> and the main body <b>320</b> to be in a closed, stable state.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">To open the foldable electronic device <b>300</b>, the cover <b>310</b> is manually rotated up relative to the main body <b>320</b>, hence the cover drive member <b>60</b> and the follower <b>30</b> rotate relative to the main body drive member <b>20</b> and the cam <b>24</b>. The peak <b>3023</b> of the follower <b>30</b> slides along the resisting slope <b>2422</b>, and the first and second resilient members <b>40</b>, <b>50</b> are compressed further. When the cover <b>310</b> is opened about an angle, for example, in between 0 degree and 50 degrees, the peak <b>3023</b> slides over the peak <b>2423</b> of the first cam portion <b>242</b>. In the present embodiment, the angle is about 25 degrees. At the same time, the first and second resilient members <b>40</b>, <b>50</b> are mostly compressed. Then the cover <b>310</b> is released, the follower <b>30</b> automatically rotates relative to the cam <b>24</b> due to the decompression of the first and second resilient members <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the peak <b>3023</b> slides along the guiding slope <b>2424</b> toward the valley <b>2425</b> to an open state. Thus, the cover <b>310</b> automatically rotates to a fully and stable open state, about 170 degrees relative to the main body <b>320</b>. The process of closing the cover <b>310</b> is reverse to the process of opening the cover <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">At the open state of the hinge assembly, the first supporting wall <b>305</b> is rotated to be opposite to the second stage <b>254</b>, and the second supporting wall <b>306</b> is rotated to be opposite to the first stage <b>252</b>. The thicker second supporting wall <b>306</b> prevents one first cam portion <b>242</b> from rotating toward the valley <b>3025</b>. Accordingly, the first cam portions <b>242</b> are prevented from falling down to the valley <b>3025</b> of the follower <b>30</b> in the opened state of the cover <b>310</b>. Peaks of conventional hinges are easily self-locking with the valleys. This structure of the present disclosure can effectively prevent the peaks of the first cam portions <b>242</b> from being latched in the valleys <b>3025</b>. Furthermore, the connecting wall <b>308</b>, the supporting walls <b>305</b>, <b>306</b> can enhance the strength of the two second cam portions <b>3020</b> and prevent the follower <b>30</b> from deforming. Additionally, the inner arcuate surfaces <b>2427</b> of the cam <b>24</b> contact with the outer surfaces <b>3050</b>, <b>3060</b> of the first supporting wall <b>305</b> and the second supporting wall <b>306</b>. Thus, the first supporting wall <b>305</b> and the second supporting wall <b>306</b> act as a buffer. This can prevent forceful impacts produced between the cam <b>24</b> and the follower <b>30</b> when the cam surfaces are steep.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">It should be understood that the cam portions of follower <b>30</b> and the cam <b>24</b> may have other shapes. The shape of the cam portion may be changed according to the open angle of the cover. For example, when changing the angle of the guiding slope, the cover may be opened over 180 degrees relative to the main body.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It should be understood that the disk <b>70</b> may be mounted with the shaft <b>110</b> by weld.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">It is to be understood, however, that even though numerous characteristics and advantages of the present embodiments have been set forth in the foregoing description, together with details of the structures and functions of the embodiments, the disclosure is illustrative only, and changes may be made in detail, especially in matters of shape, size, and arrangement of parts within the principles of the invention to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed.</p>
