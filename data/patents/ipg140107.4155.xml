The head is positioned over a track minus a first delta and a first frequency pattern is written at a first frequency. The head is positioned over the track plus a second delta and a second frequency pattern is written at a second frequency different from the first frequency. After writing the first frequency pattern and second frequency pattern, a third frequency pattern is written substantially centered on the track at a third frequency. After writing the third frequency pattern, the head is scanned across the track while reading the disk to generate a read signal. A first frequency component is extracted from the read signal representing the first frequency, and a second frequency component is extracted from the read signal representing the second frequency.</p>

<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows a disk drive according to an embodiment of the present invention comprising a head <b>16</b> actuated over a disk <b>18</b> comprising a plurality of tracks <b>20</b>. The disk drive further comprises control circuitry <b>22</b> operable to execute the flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, wherein the head is positioned over a track minus a first delta and a first frequency pattern is written at a first frequency (block <b>24</b>). The head is positioned over the track plus a second delta and a second frequency pattern is written at a second frequency different from the first frequency (block <b>26</b>). After writing the first frequency pattern and second frequency pattern, a third frequency pattern is written substantially centered on the track at a third frequency (block <b>28</b>). After writing the third frequency pattern, the head is scanned across the track while reading the disk to generate a read signal (block <b>30</b>). A first frequency component is extracted from the read signal representing the first frequency (block <b>32</b>), and a second frequency component is extracted from the read signal representing the second frequency (block <b>34</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the disk <b>18</b> comprises embedded servo sectors <b>36</b><sub>0</sub>-<b>36</b><sub>N </sub>that define the tracks <b>20</b>. The control circuitry <b>22</b> processes a read signal <b>38</b> emanating from the head <b>16</b> to demodulate the servo sectors <b>36</b><sub>0</sub>-<b>36</b><sub>N </sub>and generate a position error signal (PES) representing an error between the actual position of the head and a target position relative to a target track. The control circuitry <b>22</b> filters the PES using suitable compensation filters to generate a control signal <b>40</b> applied to a voice coil motor (VCM) <b>42</b> which rotates an actuator arm <b>44</b> about a pivot, thereby actuating the head <b>16</b> radially over the disk <b>18</b> in a direction that reduces the PES. The servo sectors <b>36</b><sub>0</sub>-<b>36</b><sub>N </sub>may comprise any suitable position information, such as a track address for coarse positioning and servo bursts for fine positioning as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The servo bursts may comprise any suitable pattern, such as an amplitude based servo pattern as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, or a suitable phase based servo pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3D</figref> graphically illustrate the flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, wherein the head <b>16</b> comprises a write element <b>46</b> and a read element <b>48</b>. The read element <b>48</b> is used to read the servo sectors <b>36</b><sub>0</sub>-<b>36</b><sub>N </sub>in order to position the write element <b>46</b> over a track <b>50</b> minus a first delta (&#x2212;&#x394;) while writing the first frequency pattern at the first frequency during a first revolution of the disk as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. During a second revolution of the disk, the write element <b>46</b> is positioned over the track <b>50</b> plus a second delta (+&#x394;) while writing the second frequency pattern at the second frequency as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. In one embodiment, the second frequency may be higher than the first frequency by any suitable amount, and in another embodiment, the first frequency may be higher than the second frequency by any suitable amount. During a third revolution of the disk, the write element <b>46</b> is positioned over the center of the track <b>50</b> while writing the third frequency pattern at the third frequency as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. In one embodiment, the third frequency is between the first frequency and the second frequency. After writing the third frequency pattern, the read element <b>48</b> is scanned across the track <b>50</b> while reading the track as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> in order to generate a track profile as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>. In one embodiment, the read element <b>48</b> is scanned across the track <b>50</b> in a single operation without repositioning the read element <b>48</b> in order to generate the read signal.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The track profile in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref> comprises a center pulse <b>52</b> with a peak at the center of the track that is generated by filtering the read signal in order to extract the third frequency component representing the third frequency. The track profile also comprises a first microtrack side pulse <b>54</b>A on a first side of the track and a second microtrack side pulse <b>54</b>B on a second side of the track, wherein the first and second microtrack side pulses represent a signal strength of the read signal at the first and second frequencies. The first and second microtrack side pulses <b>54</b>A and <b>54</b>B of the track profile are generated by filtering the read signal in order extract the first and second frequency components, respectfully. The first and second microtrack side pulses <b>54</b>A and <b>54</b>B are smaller in amplitude than the center pulse as they represent the residual signal of the first frequency pattern and the second frequency pattern after having been partially overwritten by the third frequency pattern (leaving the two microtracks).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>, the first delta (&#x2212;&#x394;) is substantially equal to the second delta (+&#x394;); however, in other embodiments the first delta may be different than the second delta by any suitable amount. In one embodiment, at least one of the first and second deltas is less than the width of the read element <b>48</b>, and in one embodiment at least one of the first and second deltas is less than half the width of the read element <b>48</b>. Writing the first and/or second frequency pattern offset by a small delta from the center of the track, and then overwriting the first and second frequency patterns with the third frequency pattern results in at least one narrow microtrack as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>. Because the first and second frequency patterns are written at different frequencies, the intertrack interference between the microtracks (at the respective frequencies) is reduced when scanning the head across the track and extracting the first and second frequency components to generate the first and second microtrack side pulses <b>54</b>A and <b>54</b>B in the track profile of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment, the well defined, narrow microtrack side pulses <b>54</b>A and <b>54</b>B in the track profile enables a more accurate estimate of various magnetic recording parameters. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> (a normalized track profile corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>) illustrates various magnetic recording parameters that may be estimated according to embodiments of the present invention. In one embodiment, a microtrack width of the read element (uWRE) may be estimated based on the width of at least one of the microtrack side pulses <b>54</b>A and <b>54</b>B, and in one embodiment, the uWRE may be estimated as the average between the widths of two microtrack side pulses <b>54</b>A and <b>54</b>B. In another embodiment, a width of the write element (WWE) may be estimated based on the width of the center pulse. A write and erase width (WEW) may be estimated based on a distance between the first and second side pulses, wherein in one embodiment a radial offset between the write element and the read element may be estimated based on the WEW. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> also shows an erase band width (EBW) estimated based on the difference between the center of each microtrack side pulse and the corresponding width of the write element (WWE) on each side of the track.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> shows an embodiment of the present invention wherein the width of the read element (WRE) may be estimated based on a slope of the center pulse. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the WRE is estimated as the distance between the x-axis intercepts of the center pulse slopes minus the WWE. The WRE is typically a wider estimate than the actual width of the read element due to a side reading effect that manifests when reading the wider center track. The uWRE shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is typically a more accurate estimate of the actual width of the read element due to the narrow width of the microtracks. In one embodiment, an adjusted width of the write element (WWE&#x2032;) is estimated based on the WWE, the uWRE, and the WRE. For example, in one embodiment the WWE&#x2032; is estimated by subtracting a side reading width (SRW) from the WWE, where the SRW is the difference between the WRE and the uWRE.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Ideally, the uWRE estimated based on the left microtrack side pulse <b>54</b>A should equal the uWRE estimated based on the right microtrack side pulse <b>54</b>B since they are measured with the same reader. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the slopes of left side of the left microtrack, right side of the left microtrack, left slope of the right microtrack, and right slope of the right microtrack are denoted as m<sub>LL</sub>, m<sub>LR</sub>, m<sub>RL</sub>, and m<sub>RR</sub>, respectively. If the writing and reading are symmetric, and the overwrite is sufficient, the slopes on the same side of the two microtracks should be approximately equivalent:
<br/>

</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">If the head is too weak to overwrite the back tracks sufficiently, there are excessive residuals left on the right skirt of the left microtrack and on the left skirt of the right microtrack, and the slopes m<sub>LR </sub>and m<sub>RL </sub>will be smaller than the expected values, that is:</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6D</figref> illustrate another embodiment of the present invention which is further understood with reference to the flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The head is positioned over a track minus a first delta and a first frequency pattern is written at a first frequency over a first linear section of the track (block <b>56</b>). The head is positioned over the track plus a second delta and a second frequency pattern is written over a second linear section of the track different from the first linear section (block <b>58</b>). After writing the first frequency pattern and second frequency pattern, a third frequency pattern is written substantially centered on the track at a third frequency, wherein the third frequency pattern overwrites at least part of the first and second frequency patterns (block <b>60</b>). After writing the third frequency pattern, the head is scanned across the track while reading the disk to generate a read signal (block <b>62</b>). A first frequency component is extracted from the read signal representing the first frequency (block <b>64</b>), and a second frequency component is extracted from the read signal representing the second frequency (block <b>66</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0028">In the example embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, the first frequency pattern is written along a number of linear sections separated by a gap, and the second frequency pattern is written within the gap so that the first and second frequency patterns are written in an interleaved manner. Each linear section may comprise any suitable length, such as a data sector, multiple data sectors, or a data wedge (area between consecutive servo sectors). The third frequency pattern is then written in a continuous manner so as to overwrite at least part of the first and second frequency patterns as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>. The head is then scanned across the track <b>50</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref> and the frequency components of the first and second frequency patterns are extracted from the read signal to generate a track profile (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6E</figref>). In one embodiment, when extracting each frequency component of the first and second frequency patterns, the part of the read signal representing the corresponding linear segment that was written is processed, and the part of the read signal representing the gap between each linear segment is ignored.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0029">In one embodiment, when writing the first and second frequency patterns in an interleaved manner, the first frequency may be different from the second frequency as described above. In an alternative embodiment, the first frequency may substantially equal the second frequency when writing the first frequency pattern and the second frequency pattern in an interleaved manner. In either embodiment, the third frequency of the third frequency pattern is different from the first and second frequencies of the first and second frequency patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0030">In the embodiments wherein the first frequency of the first frequency pattern is different from the second frequency of the second frequency pattern, the difference between the frequencies may be any suitable amount. In one embodiment, the difference between the frequencies is selected so as to provide sufficient separation in the frequency spectrum generated when processing the read signal (e.g., using a discrete Fourier transform).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0031">In the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3E and 6E</figref>, the track profile is shown as comprising a center pulse <b>52</b> together with the microtrack side pulses <b>54</b>A and <b>54</b>B. However, depending on which magnetic recording parameters are estimated, it may not be necessary to generate the center pulse <b>52</b> track profile. That is, a magnetic recording parameter may be estimated based on the microtrack side pulses <b>54</b>A and <b>54</b>B without needing to generate the center pulse <b>52</b> track profile.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0032">Any suitable control circuitry may be employed to implement the flow diagrams in the embodiments of the present invention, such as any suitable integrated circuit or circuits. For example, the control circuitry may be implemented within a read channel integrated circuit, or in a component separate from the read channel, such as a disk controller, or certain operations described above may be performed by a read channel and others by a disk controller. In one embodiment, the read channel and disk controller are implemented as separate integrated circuits, and in an alternative embodiment they are fabricated into a single integrated circuit or system on a chip (SOC). In addition, the control circuitry may include a suitable preamp circuit implemented as a separate integrated circuit, integrated into the read channel or disk controller circuit, or integrated into an SOC.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0033">In one embodiment, the control circuitry comprises a microprocessor executing instructions, the instructions being operable to cause the microprocessor to perform the flow diagrams described herein. The instructions may be stored in any computer-readable medium. In one embodiment, they may be stored on a non-volatile semiconductor memory external to the microprocessor, or integrated with the microprocessor in a SOC. In another embodiment, the instructions are stored on the disk and read into a volatile semiconductor memory when the disk drive is powered on. In yet another embodiment, the control circuitry comprises suitable logic circuitry, such as state machine circuitry.</p>
