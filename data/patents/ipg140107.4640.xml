<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A communication system including a phase-locked loop, a signal division controller, a divider, and a transmitter. The phase-locked loop is configured to generate an output signal in response to a common reference clock signal. The output signal is in phase lock with the common reference clock signal. The signal division controller is configured to receive a select signal, select an edge of a rising edge of the output signal and a falling edge of the output signal in response to the select signal, and generate a divider reset signal in response to the selected edge. The divider is configured to generate a communication clock signal by performing frequency division of the output signal. The divider reset signal controls a start time of the frequency division. The transmitter is configured to operate in response to the communication clock signal.</p>

No. 8,170,167), which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/790,689 filed on Mar. 3, 2004 (now U.S. Pat. No. 7,903,777). The entire disclosures of the above applications are incorporated herein by reference.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to noise and interference reduction in information communication systems. More particularly, the present invention relates to a system and method for reducing electromagnetic interference and ground bounce in an information communication system by controlling the phase of clock signals among a plurality of information communication devices of the information communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A gigabit transceiver chip can, for example, transmit information from several ports simultaneously. Such simultaneous transmission can lead to a condition known as &#x201c;ground bounce&#x201d; that can cause unwanted transients in the supply voltage and current on the chip. Ground bounce is a voltage oscillation between the ground pin on a component package and the ground reference level on the component die. Ground bounce is essentially caused by a current surge passing through the lead inductance of the package. More particularly, the output voltage of an IC package can be referenced to the ground on the chip. The bond wire connection between the chip and the lead frame of the package contributes a small amount of inductance in the circuit. When the output voltage goes low, a spike of current flows through this inductance and creates a voltage spike at the ground on the chip. A device connected to the output of the circuit will see a logical low that is the specified low for the device plus the voltage spike across the inductance of the lead frames. This effect is the ground bounce.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The effect is most pronounced when all outputs switch simultaneously. Consequently, ground bounce is sometimes referred to as &#x201c;simultaneous switching noise.&#x201d; While the inductance is the combined effect of the package lead, the package lead frame, the bond wire and the inductance in the die pad, a majority of the inductance is caused by the bond wire. Ground bounce can cause, for example, signal degradation in the output waveform of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, in a gigabit transceiver chip, each port can derive its port clock from a common reference clock. Transitions in each port clock can cause a small ground bounce. When all of the port clocks are aligned (i.e., all of the port clocks are in phase), the small ground bounce caused by each port clock can aggregate to produce a large ground bounce. Similarly, each transmitter of the network switch chip can derive its transmitter clock from a common system transmitter clock. Each transmitter clock can generate a tone of electromagnetic interference (EMI) at the transmit frequency. When all of the transmitter clocks are aligned (i.e., all of the transmitter clocks are in phase), the EMI produced by each transmitter clock can aggregate to produce an amplified tone of EMI. Thus, clock alignment can cause increased ground bounce and EMI in, for example, the gigabit transceiver chip.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A system and method are disclosed for reducing electromagnetic interference and ground bounce in an information communication system by controlling the phase of clock signals among a plurality of information communication devices of the information communication system. In accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present invention, according to a first aspect, an information communication system can include a plurality of information communication devices. Each of the plurality of information communication devices can be responsive to a respective information communication clock signal.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A system and method are disclosed for reducing electromagnetic interference and ground bounce in an information communication system by controlling the phase of clock signals among a plurality of information communication devices of the information communication system. The information communication system, such as, for example, a multi-port transceiver or network device compliant with I.E.E.E. 802.3ab, can communicate information on several ports simultaneously. Such simultaneous communication can lead to &#x201c;ground bounce,&#x201d; causing unwanted transients in the supply voltage and current in the information communication system. For example, each port of the information communication system can derive its port clock from a common reference clock. Transitions in each port clock can cause a small ground bounce. When all of the port clocks are aligned (i.e., all of the port clocks are in phase), the small ground bounces contributed by each port clock can aggregate to produce a large ground bounce. According to exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the phase of each port clock can be staggered in a deterministic manner relative to all other port clocks so that the port clocks are not aligned (i.e., not in phase). For example, the phase of each port clock can be staggered by 45 or 90 degrees using, for example, a clock divider and combinatorial logic. By staggering the phase of each of the port clocks relative to one another, the small ground bounces contributed by each port clock do not aggregate, thereby reducing the effects of ground bounce in the information communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to an alternative exemplary embodiment, the information communication system can include a plurality of, for example, transmitters. Each transmitter of the information communication system can derive its transmitter clock from a common system transmitter clock. Each transmitter clock can generate a tone of electromagnetic interference (EMI) at the transmit frequency. When all of the transmitter clocks are aligned (i.e., all of the transmitter clocks are in phase), the EMI contributed by each transmitter clock can aggregate to produce an amplified tone of EMI. According to exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the phase of each transmitter clock can be staggered in a deterministic manner relative to all other transmitter clocks, such as, for example, by 45 or 90 degrees. By staggering the phase of each of the transmitter clocks relative to one another, the amplitude of the EMI can be decreased, while the frequency of the EMI can be increased, thereby helping to mitigate the EMI of the information communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">These and other aspects of the present invention will now be described in greater detail. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a system for controlling phase of clock signals among a plurality of information communication devices of an information communication system <b>100</b>, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Information communication system <b>100</b> includes a plurality of information communication devices <b>105</b>. Information communication system <b>100</b> can be comprised of any number N of information communication devices. Each of the plurality of information communication devices <b>105</b> is responsive to a respective information communication clock signal. Each information communication clock signal of each of the plurality of information communication devices <b>105</b> is associated with a common reference clock signal <b>122</b>. In other words, each information communication clock signal can be derived, either directly or indirectly, from a common reference clock signal <b>122</b> or several of such reference clock signals (e.g., where the number of common reference clock signals <b>122</b> is less than the number of information communication devices <b>105</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The information communication system <b>100</b> includes a phase controller <b>110</b>. A single phase controller <b>110</b> can be in communication with each of the plurality of information communication devices <b>105</b>. Alternatively, each of or groups of the plurality of information communication devices <b>105</b> can be in communication with a separate phase controller <b>110</b>. The phase controller <b>110</b> is responsive to the common reference clock signal <b>122</b>. For example, the common reference clock signal <b>122</b> can be generated by a reference clock signal generator <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to exemplary embodiments, phase controller <b>110</b> alters the phase of each information communication clock signal of each of the plurality of information communication devices <b>105</b> by a predetermined amount. In other words, phase controller <b>110</b> can stagger the phase of each information communication clock signal of each of the plurality of information communication devices <b>105</b> relative to each other. The predetermined amount can be any suitable change in phase in each of the information communication clock signals relative to the other information communication clock signals. According to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, phase controller <b>110</b> alters the phase of each information communication clock signal of each of the plurality of information communication devices <b>105</b> by a multiple of 90 degrees. For example, if there are four information communication devices <b>105</b>, then the corresponding four information communication clock signals can each be staggered in phase by 90 degrees relative to each other by phase controller <b>110</b> according to, for example, (0&#xb0;, 90&#xb0;, 180&#xb0;, 270&#xb0;), (0&#xb0;, 180&#xb0;, 270&#xb0;, 90&#xb0;), or any other suitable combination of phases such that the phases of the individual information communication clock signals are not aligned. For example, if there are eight information communication devices <b>105</b>, then the corresponding eight communication clock signals can each be staggered in phase by 45 degrees relative to each other by phase controller <b>110</b> according to, for example, (0&#xb0;, 45&#xb0;, 90&#xb0;, 135&#xb0;, 180&#xb0;, 225&#xb0;, 270&#xb0;, 315&#xb0;) or any other suitable combination of phases.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Alternatively, the phase controller <b>110</b> alters the phase of the information communication clock signals such that the phase of two or more of the information communication clock signals are substantially identical, so long as the number of information communication clock signals with substantially identical phase is less than the total number of information communication clock signals of the information communication system <b>100</b>. For the example of eight information communication devices <b>105</b>, the corresponding eight communication clock signals can each be staggered in phase by 90 degrees relative to each other by phase controller <b>110</b> according to, for example, (0&#xb0;, 90&#xb0;, 180&#xb0;, 270&#xb0;, 0&#xb0;, 90&#xb0;, 180&#xb0;, 270&#xb0;) or any other suitable combination of phase such that the phases of less than all of information communication clock signals are not aligned. However, according to exemplary embodiments, phase controller <b>110</b> can alter the phase of each of the information communication clock signals relative to each other by any appropriate amount.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to exemplary embodiments, each of the plurality of information communication devices <b>105</b> is responsive to the common reference clock signal <b>122</b> altered by phase controller <b>110</b>. For example, each of the plurality of information communication devices includes a device clock <b>115</b> for generating the respective information communication clock signal from the common reference clock signal <b>122</b> altered by phase controller <b>110</b>. According to an exemplary embodiment, the device clock <b>115</b> of each of the plurality of information communication devices <b>105</b> derives the respective information communication clock signal from the common reference clock signal <b>122</b>. Thus, to alter the phase of each information communication clock signal of each of the plurality of information communication devices <b>105</b> by the predetermined amount, phase controller <b>110</b> alters the phase of the common reference clock signal <b>122</b> for each of the plurality of information communication devices <b>105</b> by the predetermined amount. In other words, by staggering the phase of the common reference clock signal <b>122</b> for each of the information communication devices <b>105</b>, phase controller <b>110</b> can stagger the phases of the information communication clock signals relative to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">For example, phase controller <b>110</b> can include a plurality of time delay elements. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a system for controlling phase of clock signals among a plurality of information communication devices <b>105</b> of an information communication system <b>100</b> using a plurality of time delay elements <b>205</b>, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the plurality of time delay elements <b>205</b> are cascaded or otherwise arranged in serial communication with each other to provide varying time delays of the common reference clock signal <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to exemplary embodiments, each of the plurality of information communication devices <b>105</b> can be in communication with at least one of the plurality of time delay elements <b>205</b>. The time delay introduced by each of the time delay elements <b>205</b> is cumulative as the common reference clock signal <b>122</b> is propagated along the chain of time delay elements <b>205</b>. Consequently, the phase of the common reference clock signal <b>122</b> can be altered for each of the information communication devices <b>105</b> by delaying the common reference clock signal <b>122</b> by the desired amount using an appropriate number of time delay elements <b>205</b>. For example, each time delay element <b>205</b> introduces a time delay of t<sub>d </sub>seconds (where t<sub>d </sub>can be any appropriate length of time delay), although each of the time delay elements can introduce the same or different amounts of time delay. For the exemplary embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the common reference clock signal <b>122</b> is delayed by t<sub>d </sub>seconds into information communication device <b>1</b>, by 2*t<sub>d </sub>seconds into information communication device <b>2</b>, by 3*t<sub>d </sub>seconds into information communication device <b>3</b>, and by N*t<sub>d </sub>seconds into information communication device N.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the time delay of the common reference clock signal <b>122</b> into each of the plurality of information communication devices <b>105</b> is based on the cumulative effect of the cascaded or otherwise serially-arranged time delay elements <b>205</b>. However, each of the time delay elements <b>205</b> can be affected by slight variations in voltage, process, temperature and the like, which alters the length of time delay introduced by each of the time delay elements <b>205</b>. To address this condition, an alternative structure can be used for phase controller <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a system for controlling phase of clock signals among a plurality of information communication devices <b>105</b> of an information communication system <b>100</b> using a phase controller <b>110</b> comprised of a plurality of time-delayed communication channels, in accordance with an alternative exemplary embodiment of the present invention. According to the alternative exemplary embodiment, the phase controller <b>110</b> includes at least one delay locked loop <b>305</b>. The at least one delay locked loop <b>305</b> is in communication with each of the plurality of information communication devices <b>105</b> via an information communication channel <b>312</b>. For example, the delay locked loop <b>305</b> can be in communication with each of the plurality of information communication devices <b>105</b> using a separate information communication channel <b>312</b>, or an information communication channel <b>312</b> can be in communication with groups of information communication devices <b>105</b>. To control the amount of time delay of the common reference clock signal <b>122</b> into each of the plurality of information communication devices <b>105</b>, each information communication channel <b>312</b> includes at least one of the plurality of time delay elements <b>310</b>. The amount of time delay introduced through each information communication channel <b>312</b> is altered by, for example, changing the number of time delay elements <b>310</b> located along an information communication channel <b>312</b>, changing the amount of time delay supplied by the one or more time delay elements <b>310</b> in the information communication channel <b>312</b>, and the like. The embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> can also be used to address issues related to clock skew.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to an exemplary embodiment, phase controller <b>110</b> alters the phase of each information communication clock signal of each of the plurality of information communication devices <b>105</b> by, for example, altering the phase of the common reference clock signal <b>122</b> supplied to each of the information communication devices <b>105</b> from which each information communication clock signal can be generated. Alternatively, the phase of each information communication clock signal can be directly altered by the phase controller <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a system for controlling phase of clock signals among a plurality of information communication devices of an information communication system using a phase controller comprised of a phase locked loop, in accordance with an alternative exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Phase controller <b>110</b> includes a phase locked loop <b>405</b> that is configured to receive the common reference clock signal <b>122</b>. For example, phase locked loop <b>405</b> includes a phase detector <b>410</b>, a loop filter <b>415</b>, a voltage-controlled oscillator <b>420</b> and a divider <b>425</b>. Phase locked loop <b>405</b> produces an output signal <b>440</b> at any appropriate frequency. The output signal <b>440</b> is supplied to a divider <b>435</b>. Divider <b>435</b> is configured to perform signal division or decimation on output signal <b>440</b> to generate an information communication clock signal <b>460</b> of equal or lesser frequency than output signal <b>440</b>. The output signal <b>440</b> is associated with the information communication clock signal <b>460</b>. In other words, divider <b>435</b> divides the frequency of output signal <b>440</b> by any appropriate amount to generate the desired frequency of information communication clock signal <b>460</b>. For purposes of illustration and not limitation, if the frequency of output signal <b>440</b> is 500 MHz, and if each of the information communication devices <b>105</b> uses a 125 MHz information communication clock signal, then divider <b>435</b> divides output signal <b>440</b> by a factor of four to generate an information communication clock signal <b>460</b> of 125 MHz. Other frequencies and division ratios can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">To control the phase of each information communication clock signal <b>460</b> relative to the other information communication clock signals <b>460</b>, the phase controller <b>110</b> includes a signal division controller <b>430</b>. Signal division controller <b>430</b> is configured to control the start time of signal division performed by divider <b>435</b> on the output signal <b>440</b> of phase locked loop <b>405</b>. In other words, signal division controller <b>430</b> varies the start time of signal division of the output signal <b>440</b> performed by divider <b>435</b> to alter the phase of each information communication clock signal <b>460</b> generated for each of the plurality of information communication devices <b>105</b>. For example, signal division controller <b>430</b> can be comprised of combinatorial logic that is responsive to the common reference clock signal <b>122</b>, as well as the output signal <b>440</b>. Signal division controller <b>430</b> can also be responsive to a system reset signal <b>445</b> that can be from, for example, a power management system associated with information communication system <b>100</b>. For example, when an information communication device(s) <b>105</b> is (are) powered up or otherwise activated, the system reset signal <b>445</b> can be used as notification to begin controlling signal division to create information communication clock signal(s) <b>460</b> for the powered-up device(s). As the system reset signal <b>445</b> may not be synchronous with common reference clock signal <b>122</b> and/or output signal <b>440</b>, system reset signal <b>445</b> can be gated so that it is synchronous with common reference clock signal <b>122</b> and/or output signal <b>440</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Signal division controller <b>430</b> can also be responsive to a signal select <b>450</b>. Signal select <b>450</b> can be used to select the phase of the information communication signal <b>460</b> to be generated. For purposes of illustration and not limitation, if there are four information communication devices <b>105</b>, each information communication device <b>105</b> can be assigned one of four unique phases.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Thus, a two-bit selection signal can be used for signal select <b>450</b> to choose one of the four phases for information communication clock signal <b>460</b>. In other words, for a chosen information communication clock signal <b>460</b>, signal division controller <b>430</b> generates a divider reset signal <b>455</b> that resets divider <b>435</b> so that division of output signal <b>440</b> is begun at the proper time. By beginning division of output signal <b>440</b> at different times (e.g., at different rising edges and/or falling edges of output signal <b>440</b>), the phase of the information communication clock signal <b>460</b> is varied. The number of bits used for signal select <b>450</b> will depend on, for example, the number of information communication clock signals <b>460</b> to be generated, the total number of phase values from which an information communication clock signal <b>460</b> can be selected, and the like. For example, a three-bit selection signal can be used to select one of eight possible phase values. Other bit widths of signal select <b>450</b> are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to an exemplary embodiment, a single phase controller <b>110</b> can be used to generate information communication clock signals <b>460</b> for all of the plurality of information communication devices <b>105</b>. Alternatively, two or more phase controllers <b>110</b> can be used to generate information communication clock signals <b>460</b> for different groups of information communication devices <b>105</b>, or each information communication device <b>105</b> can have a separate phase controller <b>110</b>. However, according to each of these exemplary embodiments, the signal division controller(s) <b>430</b> generates the divider reset signal <b>455</b> at the proper time to alter the phase of each information communication clock signal of each of the plurality of information communication devices <b>105</b> by a predetermined amount relative to one or more other information communication clock signals.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">For purposes of illustration and not limitation, according to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the information communication system <b>100</b> can comprise a multi-port transceiver or network device compliant with, for example, I.E.E.E. 802.3ab. For example, the information communication devices <b>105</b> can be the ports of the multi-port transceiver or network device. For example, the information communication devices <b>105</b> can be the individual transmitters of the multi-port transceiver or network device, such as, for example, individual class B transmitters. The multi-port network device compliant with I.E.E.E. 802.3ab can be comprised of a plurality of transceivers, where the plurality can be, for example, four or eight or any other number of transceivers. Alternatively, the information communication system <b>100</b> can be an Ethernet transceiver, such as an Ethernet transceiver compliant with, for example, I.E.E.E. 802.3ab.

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention can be used to mitigate the effects of ground bounce and EMI in information communication systems. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> are graphs illustrating how EMI can be mitigated, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. For purposes of illustration and not limitation, the plurality of information communication devices <b>105</b> can comprise two transmitters (e.g., two class B transmitters) of the information communication system <b>100</b>, each using an information communication clock signal of 125 MHz. Each information communication clock signal can be derived from a common reference clock signal. Each transmitter can have a center-tapped current into a respective output transformer, I<sub>CT1 </sub>and I<sub>CT2</sub>, respectively. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the information communication clock signals for the two transmitters are in phase. Graph (<b>1</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> illustrates the current waveform of I<sub>CT1</sub>, with an amplitude of I<sub>o </sub>and a period of 8 nanoseconds, corresponding to a frequency of 125 MHz. Graph (<b>2</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> illustrates the current waveform of I<sub>CT2</sub>, with an amplitude of I<sub>o </sub>and a period of 8 nanoseconds, corresponding to a frequency of 125 MHz. As the waveforms of I<sub>CT1 </sub>and I<sub>CT2 </sub>are in phase, the addition of the individual waveforms can result in a combined waveform I<sub>CT1</sub>+I<sub>CT2 </sub>that is the same frequency, but twice the amplitude, of I<sub>CT1 </sub>and I<sub>CT2</sub>, as shown in Graph (<b>3</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. Graph (<b>4</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> illustrates the frequency spectrum of the combined waveform I<sub>CT1</sub>+I<sub>CT2</sub>. As the resulting generated signals of I<sub>CT1 </sub>and I<sub>CT2 </sub>are in phase, an EMI frequency component can be created at 125 MHz.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, however, the information communication clock signals for the two transmitters are out of phase by 180 degrees, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Graph (<b>1</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> illustrates the current waveform of I<sub>CT1</sub>, with an amplitude of I<sub>o </sub>and a period of 8 nanoseconds, corresponding to a frequency of 125 MHz. Graph (<b>2</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> illustrates the current waveform of I<sub>CT2</sub>, with an amplitude of I<sub>o </sub>and a period of 8 nanoseconds, corresponding to a frequency of 125 MHz. However, as the information communication clock signals used for the two transmitters are 180 degrees out of phase, I<sub>CT1 </sub>is also 180 degrees out of phase with I<sub>CT2</sub>. As the waveforms of I<sub>CT1 </sub>and I<sub>CT2 </sub>are out of phase by 180 degrees, the addition of the individual waveforms can result in a combined waveform I<sub>CT1</sub>+I<sub>CT2 </sub>that is twice frequency (e.g., 250 MHz or a period of four nanoseconds) of either I<sub>CT1 </sub>and I<sub>CT2</sub>, as shown in Graph (<b>3</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, and half the amplitude of the combined waveform illustrated in Graph (<b>3</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. Graph (<b>4</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> illustrates the frequency spectrum of the combined waveform I<sub>CT1</sub>+I<sub>CT2</sub>. As the resulting generated signals of I<sub>CT1 </sub>and I<sub>CT2 </sub>are out of phase by 180 degrees, an EMI frequency component can be created at 250 MHz, twice the frequency of the EMI frequency component in Graph (<b>4</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. Additionally, the EMI frequency component at 250 MHz is half the amplitude of the frequency component of Graph (<b>4</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. Thus, exemplary embodiments of the present invention can reduce EMI by creating a EMI frequency component that is of lower amplitude and higher frequency when the information communication clock signals are staggered in phase relative to each other.</p>
