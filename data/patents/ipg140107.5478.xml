<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/052,962, filed on Jan. 18, 2002, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. This application claims priority to Japanese Patent Application JP 2001-013524, and the disclosure of that application is also incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an advertisement space auction method, an apparatus, and a storage medium thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There exist a variety of advertisements in the modern society such as (1) a mass media type advertisement to be broadcasted on TVs, radios, posted on journals and the like, (2) a public advertisement to be displayed in a public space such as in sports stadium, a theater and the like, and (3) a one-to-one type advertisement such as a banner advertisement posted on an internet web site, a direct mail and the like. These various types of advertisements accommodate respective advertisement spaces for which an advertiser, who wants to advertise a product or an item, can obtain a right to post his/her advertisement through transaction of the advertisement spaces.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, according to a conventional method of transaction for the advertisement spaces, there has been such a problem that its method of transaction is likely to depend largely on a specific relationship between an advertisement provider and an advertiser/advertisement agent, and thus not open to the public.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">On the other hand, there has been disclosed such an internet auction method directing to the advertisement in Japan Patent Application Laid-open No. 2000-501868. An object of transaction according to this advertisement auction method is directed to an abstract object of catching attention of consumers. In order to implement its object, it is essential to extract preference and trend of the consumers appropriately and precisely.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Because the preference and trend of the consumers thus extracted in the above cited advertisement auction method contain pieces of private information, the following constraints are attached for the purpose of privacy protection.

Through these installing steps, the auction system <b>10</b> is constructed for execution of the auction process of the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Now, the processing to be executed in the auction system <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment will be described. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a flowchart is shown to illustrate an example of processing to be executed among a terminal apparatus <b>3</b> of a user (bidder) who take part in the auction by submitting a bid, the auction management server <b>2</b>A and the advertisement space information management server <b>2</b>B. In the auction system <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment, on the basis of the bid information offered from one or more bidders submitted via the terminal apparatuses <b>3</b>, an advertisement space auction process is performed by the auction management server <b>2</b>A and the advertisement space information management server <b>2</b>B. The process of transaction of the advertisement space is executed upon completion of the auction process by settlement of accounts between the operator of the auction and the winning bidder, and by presenting the contents of the advertisement to the users designated by the winning bidder. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, as a first step S<b>1</b>, access information from a bidder is submitted from the terminal apparatus <b>3</b> to the advertisement space information management server <b>2</b>B. The advertisement space information management server <b>2</b>B handles a plurality of access information submitted from the plurality of terminal apparatuses <b>3</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> indicates an example of data structures of access information to be sent from these terminal apparatuses <b>3</b>. The access information is comprised, for example, of an identification information uniquely assigned to each one of the terminal apparatuses <b>3</b>, an identification information of the advertisement space information management server <b>2</b>B to which the access information is addressed, and pieces of information indicating desirable conditions defined by the bidder for the advertisement space of his/her interest. In the following, an exemplary instance for communicating with one terminal apparatus <b>3</b> and a transaction therewith will be described representatively.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">When the access information from a bidder is received by the advertisement space information management server <b>2</b>B, particular pieces of advertisement space information relating to one or more advertisement spaces corresponding to the access information received is specified in the advertisement space information management server <b>2</b>B. Here, it is assumed that the one or more advertisement space information is provided in advance in the database under control thereof. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an example of data structures of the advertisement space information set in the database of the advertisement space information management server <b>2</b>B is indicated. The advertisement space information is comprised, for example, of an identification information of the terminal apparatus <b>3</b> of the bidder who is interested in the advertisement space, an identification information of the advertisement space information management server <b>2</b>B, an identification information of the advertisement space, current bid status information of the advertisement space, and information indicating winning bid terms and conditions for the advertisement space. Among those described above, the identification information of the advertisement space may further include information relating to the advertisement space such as contents to be inserted in its advertisement, a type of insertion of the advertisement, a title of the advertisement space, a date and time for posting the advertisement, recipient addressees of the advertisement, and the like. The current bid status information of the advertisement space includes information relating to the advertisement space such as the number of bidders, a highest bid price currently offered, and the like. Further, the terms and conditions requested for winning the bid on the advertisement space includes information relating to the advertisement space such as a lowest winning bid price, a bid submission date and time, a scheduled date and time for providing winning bid information, a method of transaction with a winning bidder and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">On the basis of the desired conditions described by the bidder for the advertisement space contained in the access information, the advertisement space information stored in the data base as described above is searched and identified by the advertisement space information management server <b>2</b>B. For example, when the above-mentioned identification information of the advertisement space, the current bid status information on the advertisement space, the conditions requested for winning the bid on the advertisement space and the like are contained in the access information sent from the bidder together with his/her desired conditions for acquisition of the advertisement space, the data base is searched through on the basis of these information.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">When the advertisement space information is identified and specified, in the next step S<b>3</b>, the advertisement space information thus specified is forwarded from the advertisement space information management server <b>2</b>B to the terminal apparatus <b>3</b> of the corresponding bidder via the network <b>1</b>. Further, in step S<b>3</b>, a format data for entry of the bid information is sent from the advertisement space information management server <b>2</b>B to the terminal apparatus <b>3</b> of the corresponding bidder via the network <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an example of format data for entry of the bid information is indicated. The format data for the bid information is comprised, for example, of an identification information of the auction management server <b>2</b>A, a format for entry of information relating to the bidder, and a format for entry of information relating to his/her bidding. The format of information relating to the bidder further includes an identification information of the bidder, a contact address of the bidder, an identification information of a representative/agent of the bidder, and the like. The identification information of the bidder may be the name of the bidder, or may be issued uniquely to the bidder who accessed to the advertisement space information management server <b>2</b>B. Further, the identification information of the representative/agent of the bidder may be omitted if they place no representative/agent. The format of the bid information includes an identification information of the advertisement space for which to tender a bit, a bid price, a voucher to a transaction agreement and transaction method at the time of winning of the advertisement space, and the like. The identification information of the advertisement space for which to tender the bit can be selected, for example, from those provided from the advertisement space information management server <b>2</b>B to the terminal apparatus <b>3</b> of the bidder when the bidder accessed to the advertisement space information management server <b>2</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">By enabling to provide the bid information in such formatted way as described above to those who want to bid, process efficiency in the auction system <b>10</b> can be substantially improved. Further, by submitting the formatted data for entry of the bid information from the auction system <b>10</b> to the terminal apparatuses <b>3</b> of the bidders, an open auctioning may be realized thereby allowing participation of any arbitrary bidder.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The format for entry of the bid information is received at the terminal apparatus <b>3</b> of the bidder. In accordance with the received format for entry of the bid information, required information is filled in for preset items one by one until the bid information is completed. The completed bid information is then sent from the terminal apparatus <b>3</b> of the bidder to the auction management server <b>2</b>A via the network <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The completed bid information is received by the auction management server <b>2</b>A, and stored, for example, in storage section <b>21</b>. At this instant, original data of the bid status information is updated (step S<b>5</b>). As described above, in the auction system <b>10</b>, the original data of the bid status information is stored in the auction management server <b>2</b>A. When the original data of the bid status information is updated in the auction management server <b>2</b>A, in the next step S<b>6</b>, new bid status information after updating is sent from the auction management server <b>2</b>A to the terminal apparatus <b>3</b> of the corresponding bidder via the network <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Subsequent steps S<b>7</b>, S<b>8</b> and S<b>9</b> are executed only when required. In the step S<b>7</b>, a bid contents update request information which contains renewed bid contents for updating is sent from the terminal apparatus <b>3</b> of the bidder to be received by the auction management server <b>2</b>A via the network <b>1</b>. In the next step S<b>8</b>, on the basis of the bid contents update information received, the current bid information is corrected and also the bid status information is updated in the auction management server <b>2</b>A. Then, in step S<b>9</b>, the updated bid status information is sent to the terminal apparatus <b>3</b> of the bidder via the network <b>1</b>. By way of example, the steps S<b>7</b> through S<b>9</b> may be executed in repetition though not indicated.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The auction management server <b>2</b>A will close bidding of the auction at a predetermined timing (step S<b>10</b>). For example, with respect to any advertisement space information, a predetermined period of time allowed for bidding until its closure is determined at the start of its auction. When the bidding is closed, winning bid information is generated on the basis of the result of bidding offered during the predetermined period of time allowed therefor. In step S<b>11</b>, the winning bid information thus generated is sent from the auction management server <b>2</b>A to the terminal apparatuses <b>3</b> of the bidders, the advertisement space information management server <b>2</b>B and the transaction execution system <b>4</b> via the network <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">When the advertisement space information management server <b>2</b>B receives the winning bid information, it deletes the advertisement space information of which the winning bidder has been determined from the database of the advertisement space information.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Meanwhile, the transaction execution system <b>10</b> when it receives the winning bid information, on the basis of the result of the auction performed by the auction system <b>10</b>, allows for the advertisement information designated by the winning bidder to be provided to contents users via the advertisement space thereof awarded to the winning bidder. Further, a process of settlement of accounts (the winning bid transaction) with the winning bidder for the advertisement space is executed by the transaction execution system <b>4</b>. This process of settlement of accounts can be executed prior to or after the provision of the advertisement information to the contents users via the advertisement space granted to the winning bidder.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">By way of example, the advertisement space information to be posted on the auction according to the present embodiment may include such an advertisement space that is provided in a state as directly inserted into the contents to be provided to the contents users. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an example how an advertisement is inserted into the contents is illustrated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an example of advertisement spaces wherein a specific object designated by the bidder as the advertisement object is inserted or superimposed, for example, into a scene of a movie. As shown in this example, an object <b>41</b> is displayed as superimposed in one scene <b>40</b> of the movie as the advertisement space relating to the auctioning performed by the auction system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In this case the advertisement is provided to the contents users in this manner as described above, the contents into which the advertisement object <b>41</b> is to be inserted or superimposed and the object <b>41</b> are carried separately in separate data streams <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> to the contents users. Here, it is assumed that the data stream <b>42</b> carrying the contents and the data stream <b>43</b> carrying the object <b>41</b> are reproduced in synchronism therebetween and displayed to the contents users by a reproducing terminal apparatus on the side of users receiving the contents. By posting this insertion type advertisement on the advertisement space auction according to the present embodiment, it is possible to realized a more open and versatile advertisement transactions.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to another embodiment of the present invention, address information of scheduled recipient addressees of the advertisement may be contained in the advertisement space information. By arranging as above, participants in the auction can decide his/her bid more effectively in consideration of the information on the scheduled recipient addressees.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Furthermore, according to another embodiment of the present invention, a group of addressee clusters may be formulated, which contains contents users having a common characteristic such as a common hobby, taste, preference or the like. Each advertisement space may be set up corresponding to the group of addressee clusters respectively, and the information relating to the above-mentioned common characteristics may be contained in the advertisement space information. By arranging as above, the auction participants can submit their bids more effectively and strategically in consideration of their common characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Still more, according to another embodiment of the present invention, information relating to an evaluation of the advertisement space may be contained in the advertisement space information Here, the information relating to the evaluation of the advertisement space refers to such information or items that have influences on the effect of its advertisement, for example, such as an advertisement distribution (broadcast) hour, distribution recipient addressees, a distribution method and the like. By arranging as above, respective auction participants are allowed to submit their bids more effectively in consideration of the particular information relating to the evaluation of each advertisement space.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Although the present invention has been described in its preferred form with a certain degree of particularity, obviously many changes, variations and combinations are possible therein. It is therefore to be understood that any modifications will be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">For example, in the embodiment of the present invention described hereinabove, its exemplary configuration and structure have been described for enabling to specify one or more advertisement spaces on the basis of the information that indicates the desired conditions of the bidder with respect to the advertisement space as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. However, it is not limited thereto and many other modifications thereof may be conceived within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">According to another embodiment of the present invention, various other constructions for enabling to specify the appropriate advertisement space can be adopted on the basis of, for example, the identification information of the bidder and the particularity information of the business the bidder is engaged or concerned with.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the present embodiment, it becomes necessary to receive their business characteristic information from the bidders at the time of their accessing or in advance. Using the business characteristic information unique to each bidder, it becomes possible effectively to provide the advertisement space information which is more suitable to the business characteristic of each bidder. For example, in the case where a particular bidder is engaged in a business for providing services to a particular customer segment, this information is especially effective. Namely, if the above-mentioned arrangement of the present invention is adopted in the above case, and the information relating to the particular customer segment is included in the business characteristic information, it becomes possible selectively to provide an appropriate advertisement space which is to be scheduled for provision to the particular bidder.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the above described embodiments, it has been described that the format data for entry of the bid information is provided from the auction system <b>10</b> to the terminal apparatuses <b>3</b> at the time of execution of the auction. However, it is not limited thereto. For example, the bid information may be submitted in arbitrary format. Also, the format data for entry of the bid information may be provided to the terminal apparatuses <b>3</b> of the bidders in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Further, in the above described embodiments, it has been described by way of example of the configuration and construction of the auction system <b>10</b> that has two servers of the auction management server <b>2</b>A and the advertisement space information management server <b>2</b>B. However, it is not limited thereto. For example, as indicated in an auction system <b>10</b>&#x2032; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the present invention may be implemented also with such a construction that the functions of the auction management server <b>2</b>A and the advertisement space information management server <b>2</b>B are distributed and shared by a plurality of bidders' servers <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">According to the arrangement of the auction system <b>10</b> of the foregoing embodiment, while a load and risk imposed on the auction management server <b>2</b>A and the advertisement space information management server <b>2</b>B increase, there is such an advantage that its system design becomes relatively easy because there is no need to contrive for an exact synchronization of processing between the servers <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B, or sharing of functions therebetween. On the other hand, according to the arrangement of the auction system <b>10</b>&#x2032; as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, while it is necessary to contrive for the exact synchronization of the processing and sharing of functions by the bidders' servers <b>30</b>, there is such an advantage that the load and the risk to be imposed on respective servers are decreased. By way of example, according to the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a relationship between a group of the bidders' servers that share the function of the auction management server and a group of the bidders' servers that share the function of the advertisement space information management server may be either of all match, a partial match, all disparity, or one inclusive of the other. Alternatively, if the servers have a redundant capability, one of the servers may be assigned with both the functions of the auction management server and the advertisement space information management server.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Still further, although the auction system according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention has been described hereinabove that it has the auction management server and the advertisement space information management server, or that it has the plurality of servers to which the functions of the above-mentioned two types of servers are distributed to be shared therebetween. However, the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, the present invention can also be implemented as applied to a pier-to-pier type system in which direct data swapping among the respective apparatuses <b>3</b> is performed, or to a server-less system.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Still more, although it has been described hereinabove that according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the advertisement space information of which the winning bidder is determined is deleted from the data base of the advertisement space information on the advertisement space information management server <b>2</b>B. However, it is not limited thereto. The present invention can also be implemented so as to have such an arrangement that allows for the advertisement space information of which the winning bidder is determined to be processed in other various ways, for example, such as consequently to record in the data base the fact that the advertisement space has been awarded to the winning bidder, or to transfer its advertisement space information to another data base provided for recording the advertisement space information the winning bidder of which has been determined.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Furthermore, although according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention it has been described hereinabove that the storage section <b>21</b>, the processing section <b>22</b> and the I/F section <b>24</b> are integrated in the servers <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B, it is not limited thereto. The present invention can also be implemented by such an arrangement that all or part of the functions of the storage section <b>21</b>, the processing section <b>22</b> and the I/F section <b>24</b> are distributed and shared by a plurality of computers.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Still more, according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention described hereinabove, although an access control when accessing to the storage section <b>21</b> is not referred to, such control methods as the password authentication, apparatus authentication or individual authentication may be adopted therefor.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Still further, according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention described hereinabove, although it has been described that each identification information unique to each terminal apparatus <b>3</b> is assigned. However, it is not limited thereto. For example, the present invention may adopt such an arrangement in which there is assigned each identification information unique to each participant who takes part in the auction. Thereby, the plurality of participants can take part in each step of the auction via different terminal apparatuses <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Finally, as the configurations and structures of respective units and portions described specifically with respect to the preferred embodiments of the present invention are only examples of realization of the present invention, so the embodiments thereof should not be construed as to limiting the technical scope of the present invention, the present invention is not limited to the preferred embodiments described above, thus any variation as well as any combination and/or sub combination of the embodiments is permitted, without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
