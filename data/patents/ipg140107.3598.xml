<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This description relates to methods and apparatus related to an improved complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (CMOS) switch device.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Known complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (CMOS) switch devices can have an on-resistance and/or an on-capacitance that can affect the functionality of the CMOS switch devices in an undesirable fashion. For example, a CMOS switch device with a relatively high on-resistance and/or a relatively high on-capacitance can attenuate, introduce delay into, or otherwise distort a signal passing-through the CMOS switch device. The fidelity of a signal controlled at known CMOS switch devices can be compromised by an undesirable level of on-resistance and/or on-capacitance of the CMOS switch device. Thus, a need exists for systems, methods, and apparatus to address the shortfalls of present technology and to provide other new and innovative features.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In one general aspect, an apparatus can include a complementary switch circuit including a first portion and a second portion, and a first driver circuit coupled to the first portion of the complementary switch circuit. The apparatus can include a positive charge pump device coupled to the first driver, and a second driver circuit coupled to the second portion of the complementary switch circuit. The apparatus can also include a negative charge pump device coupled to the second driver circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In another general aspect an apparatus can include a positive charge pump device, and a negative charge pump device. The apparatus can include a transmission gate switch including an N-type metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) device operatively coupled to the positive charge pump device via a first driver circuit, and a P-type MOSFET device operatively coupled to the negative charge pump via a second driver circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In yet another general aspect, a method can include receiving a switch enable signal at an input terminal of a charge pump switch, and applying a positive charge pump voltage higher than a regulation voltage to a first portion of a switch circuit included in the charge pump switch in response to the receiving the switch enable signal. The method can include applying a negative charge pump voltage lower than a ground voltage to a second portion of the switch circuit included in the charge pump switch in response to the receiving the switch enable signal.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.</p>

<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram that illustrates a charge pump switch <b>100</b>, according to an embodiment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the charge pump switch <b>100</b> is coupled to a signal generator <b>180</b> and the charge pump switch <b>100</b> is coupled to a signal receiver <b>190</b>. The charge pump switch <b>100</b> is configured so that a data signal <b>12</b> produced by the signal generator <b>180</b> can be passed through the charge pump switch <b>100</b> to the signal receiver <b>190</b> when (e.g., in response to) the charge pump switch <b>100</b> is enabled (e.g., turned on, activated, changed to an on-state or pass-through state). The charge pump switch <b>100</b> is also configured so that the data signal <b>12</b> produced by the signal generator may not be passed through the charge pump switch <b>100</b> to the signal receiver <b>190</b> when the charge pump switch <b>100</b> is disabled (e.g., turned off, high impedance, deactivated, changed to an off-state or cut-off state). In some embodiments, a portion of the data signal <b>12</b> into the charge pump switch <b>100</b> (from the signal generator <b>180</b>) can be referred to as an input portion of the data signal <b>12</b> or as an input data signal, and a portion of the data signal <b>12</b> out of the charge pump switch <b>100</b> (to the signal receiver <b>190</b>) (not shown) can be referred to as an output portion of the data signal <b>12</b> or as output data signal.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In this embodiment, the charge pump switch <b>100</b> can be enabled or disabled in response to a switch control signal <b>10</b>. In other words, the charge pump switch <b>100</b> can be triggered to pass or cut-off a signal produced by the signal generator <b>180</b> to the signal receiver <b>190</b> in response to the switch control signal <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the charge pump switch <b>100</b> includes a switch circuit <b>110</b> coupled to the signal generator <b>180</b> and to the signal receiver <b>190</b>. The switch circuit <b>110</b> includes a first portion <b>112</b> and a second portion <b>114</b>. The first portion <b>112</b> and the second portion <b>114</b> can each be configured to change between an on-state (e.g., an active state, a conducting state) and an off-state (e.g., a deactivated state, a non-conducting state) when the charge pump switch <b>100</b> is enabled and disabled, respectively. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the data signal <b>12</b> can be coupled to the switch circuit <b>110</b> included in the charge pump switch <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, the first portion <b>112</b> and/or the second portion <b>114</b> can include, for example, one or more metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) (e.g., vertical MOSFET device(s), lateral MOSFET device(s), an array of MOSFET devices). In some embodiments, the first portion <b>112</b> can include one or more N-type MOSFET (NMOS) devices. In some embodiments, the second portion <b>114</b> can include one or more P-type MOSFET (PMOS) devices. In some embodiments, the switch circuit <b>110</b> can include one or more inverters, logic gates, and/or so forth. In some embodiments, the switch circuit <b>110</b> (and the charge pump switch <b>100</b>) can function as (e.g., can be configured to function as), for example, a pass gate or as a blocking component. Moreover, the switch circuit <b>110</b> (and the charge pump switch <b>100</b>) can function as a pass gate or as a blocking component between the signal generator <b>180</b> and the signal receiver <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">For example, in some embodiments, when the charge pump switch <b>100</b> is enabled, both the first portion <b>112</b> and the second portion <b>114</b> can both be in an on-state or activated. The first portion <b>112</b> and the second portion <b>114</b> can both be in an on-state so that the data signal <b>12</b> can be passed through the switch circuit <b>110</b> to the signal receiver <b>190</b>. When the charge pump switch <b>100</b> is disabled, both the first portion <b>112</b> and the second portion <b>114</b> can both be in an off-state or deactivated. The first portion <b>112</b> and the second portion <b>114</b> can both be in an off-state so that the data signal <b>12</b> may not be passed through (e.g., may be prevented from passing through) the switch circuit <b>110</b> to the signal receiver <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, the first portion <b>112</b> can be referred to as a low common mode portion, and in some embodiments, the second portion <b>114</b> can be referred to as a high common mode portion. In some embodiments, the first portion <b>112</b> can be referred to as the low common mode portion because the first portion <b>112</b> can have a relatively low impedance when a relatively low common mode voltage is passed through the first portion <b>112</b>, and the second portion <b>114</b> can be referred to as a high common mode portion can have a relatively low impedance when a relatively high common mode voltage is passed through the second portion <b>114</b>. In some embodiments, the switch circuit <b>110</b> can be referred to as a complementary switch circuit or as a pass-gate circuit. In particular, switch circuit <b>110</b> can be referred to as a complementary switch circuit when including complementary MOSFET devices (e.g., an NMOS device and a PMOS device).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the first portion <b>112</b> is coupled to (e.g., operatively coupled to) a first driver circuit <b>120</b>, and the second portion <b>114</b> is coupled to (e.g., operatively coupled to) a second driver circuit <b>130</b>. In some embodiments, the first driver circuit <b>120</b> and the second driver circuit <b>130</b> can collectively be referred to as driver circuits <b>120</b>, <b>130</b>. The first driver circuit <b>120</b> can be configured to trigger (e.g., drive) the first portion <b>112</b> to change (e.g., switch) between an on-state and an off-state in response to the switch control signal <b>10</b> into an input terminal <b>102</b> of the charge pump switch <b>100</b>. Similarly, the second driver circuit <b>130</b> can be configured to trigger the second portion <b>114</b> to change between an on-state and an off-state in response to the switch control signal <b>10</b>.
