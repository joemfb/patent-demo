<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is generally related to recreational apparatus, and more particularly to a recreational camper wind restraint system and method.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Discussion of the Background</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many types of recreational apparatuses such as certain types of recreational campers, vehicles or trailers are susceptible to weather elements during setup. One such recreational camper, vehicle or trailer is an A-frame type recreational vehicle. An A-frame type recreational vehicle, also known as an A-frame camper, is a folding tent trailer and is typically associated with camping and other recreational uses. A-frame campers are also commercially known, without limitation, under the names &#x201c;Aliner,&#x201d; &#x201c;A'Van,&#x201d; &#x201c;Chalet&#x201d; and &#x201c;Forest River.&#x201d; An A-frame has an A-frame roof which is collapsible during transportation. During setup, the A-frame roof is unlocked and the A-frame roof is extended and locked into place. The A-frame roof is susceptible to wind or other weather elements until the roof is locked into place or otherwise secured. A sudden or unexpected wind gust while the A-frame roof is being raised could damage or at least delay the setup of the A-frame. Other types of camping or recreational apparatuses also suffer from similar deficiencies relating to sudden or unexpected movements.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, there currently exist deficiencies associated with recreational apparatuses, and, in particular, with restraining such apparatuses from sudden or unexpected movements caused by weather conditions.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention is to provide a recreational camper wind restraint system that includes a housing, a recreational camper having a movable portion, a retractable belt having a first end rotatably contained within the housing and a second end operatively connected to the moveable portion, a winding means contained within the housing for operatively winding and unwinding the retractable belt longitudinally within a predetermined range of movement defined substantially by a compacted position and an expanded position of the moveable portion, and an energy-absorbing element adapted to cooperate with the retractable belt to absorb energy and temporarily lock the retractable belt in a fixed position when a predetermined force is exceeded by a wind condition. The housing is connected to a portion of a recreational camper. The movable portion has a compacted position and an expanded position. The position of the movable portion may be affected by the force caused by the wind condition.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a recreational collapsible tent apparatus wind restraint system that includes a housing, a recreational collapsible tent apparatus having a movable portion, a retractable flexible member having a first end rotatably contained within the housing and a second end operatively connected to the moveable portion, a winding means contained within the housing for operatively winding and unwinding the retractable flexible member longitudinally within a predetermined range of movement defined substantially by a compacted position and an expanded position of the moveable portion, and a means for absorbing energy and temporarily locking the retractable flexible member in a fixed position when a predetermined force is exceeded by a wind condition. The housing is connected to a portion of a recreational collapsible tent apparatus. The movable portion has a compacted position and an expanded position. The position of the movable portion may be affected by a force caused by a wind condition.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Yet another aspect of the present invention is to provide a recreational camper wind restraint system method for securing a recreational camper against the wind. The method includes attaching a housing to a portion of a recreational camper having a movable portion, winding and unwinding from the housing a reeled retractable belt longitudinally within a predetermined range of movement, and temporarily locking the retractable belt in a fixed position when a predetermined force is exceeded by a wind condition via an energy-absorbing element adapted to cooperate with the retractable belt to absorb energy and temporarily lock the retractable belt in the fixed position. The movable portion has a compacted position and an expanded position. The position of the movable portion may be affected by a force caused by a wind condition. The retractable belt has a first end rotatably contained within the housing and a second end operatively connected to the moveable portion. The predetermined range of movement is defined substantially by the compacted position and the expanded position of the moveable portion.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views, preferred embodiments of the present invention are described.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Many types of recreational apparatuses such as certain types of recreational campers, vehicles and trailers, collapsible tent structures and the like are susceptible to weather elements during setup. In fact, it is well known in the art that the first line of defense for a collapsible recreational camper is to fold the camper and seek shelter in a more stable structure. When a bad storm hits, regardless of the model of the recreational camper, a user is advised to not open or extend the recreational camper until the wind has died down to a safe level. Such actions could cause the recreational camper to fly apart if the wind is strong enough. Users of smaller, lighter recreational camper models are advised to fold them down early and, if possible, hook them up to a tow vehicle to anchor them. These smaller, lighter models may not have enough weight to hold them down in even moderate wind gusts.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">One type of recreational apparatus that is susceptible to weather elements is an A-frame camper. An A-frame camper is a portable folding tent trailer and is typically associated with camping and other recreational uses. An A-frame has an A-frame roof which is collapsible during transportation. During setup, the A-frame roof is unlocked and the A-frame roof is raised and locked into place. The A-frame roof is susceptible to wind or other weather elements until the roof is locked into place or otherwise secured. A sudden or unexpected wind gust while the A-frame roof is being raised could damage or at least delay the setup of the A-frame camper.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Other types of camping or recreational apparatuses also suffer from similar deficiencies. Presently, there is no solution to the above-identified deficiencies.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Alternatively, any other type of retractable flexible member may be utilized instead of retractable belt <b>24</b>. For instance, without limitation, the retractable cord, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a rope, mesh, wire, band and the like may be utilized within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Seat belt locking mechanisms are well-known in the automotive industry. Most seat belt locking mechanisms used in the automotive industry are stowed on spring-loaded reels called retractors equipped with inertial locking mechanisms that stop the belt from extending off the reel during severe deceleration.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">One type of seat belt locking mechanism used in the automobile industry is known as a vehicle-sensitive lock. A vehicle-sensitive lock is based on a pendulum swung away from its plumb position by rapid deceleration or rollover of the vehicle. In the absence of rapid deceleration or rollover, the reel spool is unlocked and the seat belt strap may be pulled from the reel spool against the spring tension of the reel. The vehicle occupant can move around with relative freedom while the spring tension of the reel keeps the belt taut against the occupant. When the pendulum swings away from its normal plumb position due to sudden deceleration or rollover, a pawl is engaged, the reel locks and the strap restrains the belted occupant in position.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Another type of belt locking mechanism is known as a webbing-sensitive lock. A webbing-sensitive lock is based on a centrifugal clutch activated by rapid acceleration of the webbing from the reel spool. The belt can be pulled from the reel only slowly and gradually, as when the seat belt is slowly extended to fasten. A sudden rapid pull of the belt causes the reel spool to lock, restraining the belt in its current position.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">U.S. Pat. No. 6,213,510, incorporated herein, teaches an arrangement in which a belt runs through a restraining device which mechanically actuates an energy-absorbing device for clamping a belt. The energy-absorbing device includes a plastically deformable plastic strip, allowing the belt to unwind in a controlled manner before being stopped completely. However, the energy-absorbing device described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,213,510 along with similar energy-absorbing devices are designed and configured to restrain an occupant in a vehicle during a collision. U.S. Pat. No. 5,788,281, incorporated herein, teaches a seat belt locking mechanism having a lock ring with a predetermined number of internal teeth and rotatably mounted on a reel shaft, and a carrier. The lock ring is provided with a cam hole through which a cam of a pawl is inserted. The carrier is usually kept at a non-engaging position free from the internal teeth due to a spring force of a spiral spring, and moves to an engaging position in which the internal teeth stops when the carrier shifts relative to the lock ring. U.S. Pat. No. 4,167,254, incorporated herein, teaches another seat belt locking mechanism. U.S. Pat. No. 5,931,401, incorporated herein, teaches a webbing-sensitive belt locking mechanism. Manufactures of webbing-sensitive belt locking mechanisms include, without limitation: All Island Webbing &#x26; Trim, LLC, 258 Broadway, Unit C, Huntington, N.Y. 11746; Ningbo Linkai Auto Part Co., Ltd., Panhuo village, Yinzhou district, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China; and Seatbelt Planet.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to at least one embodiment, a distinction between the energy-absorbing portion <b>30</b> of the present invention and a typical seat belt locking mechanism used in the automotive industry (e.g., the vehicle-sensitive lock) is that a typical seat heft locking mechanism is arranged to operate in a limited degree range in order to lock in an automobile rollover event whereas the energy-absorbing portion <b>30</b> of the present invention preferably is arranged to operate in 360 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, an energy-absorbing element in respectively a non-energy-absorbing position and an energy-absorbing position in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is shown. The energy-absorbing element <b>40</b> is operatively connected to belt spool <b>28</b> and is adapted to cooperate with the retractable belt <b>24</b> to absorb energy and temporarily lock the retractable belt <b>24</b> in its current position upon the occurrence of a sudden or unexpected wind gust which results in a sudden centrifugal force retractable belt <b>24</b>. The sudden centrifugal force causes pivot piece <b>42</b> to pivot outward where it contacts cam piece <b>44</b>. Pin <b>46</b> travels through slot <b>50</b> in pawl in engaging piece <b>48</b> causing it to engage teeth <b>52</b> in ratchet ring. Alternatively, energy-absorbing element <b>40</b> may include any type of now known or unknown arrangement within the scope of the present invention. The energy-absorbing element may include, without limitation, any type of clamp or pinching device and may or may not have engaging teeth. For instance, a deformable plastic as taught by U.S. Pat. No. 6,213,510 may be utilized within the scope of the present invention.</p>
