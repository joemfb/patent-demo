<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to functionalization of vinyl terminated polyolefins by metathesis reactions.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Metathesis is generally thought of as the interchange of radicals between two compounds during a chemical reaction. There are several varieties of metathesis reactions, such as ring opening metathesis, acyclic diene metathesis, ring closing metathesis and cross metathesis. These reactions, however, have had limited success with the metathesis of functionalized olefins.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Methods for the production of polyolefins with end-functionalized groups are typically multi-step processes that often create unwanted by-products and waste of reactants and energy.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">R. T. Mathers and G. W. Coates <i>Chem. Commun. </i>2004, 422-423 disclose examples of using cross-metathesis to functionalize polyolefins containing pendant vinyl groups to form polar-functionalized products with a graft-type structure.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">D. Astruc et al. <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>2008, 130, 1495-1506, and D. Astruc et al. <i>Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. </i>2005, 44, 7399-7404 disclose examples of using cross metathesis to functionalize non-polymeric molecules containing vinyl groups.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For reviews of methods to form end-functionalized polyolefins, see: (a) S. B. Amin and T. J. Marks <i>Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. </i>2008, 47, 2006-2025; (b) T. C. Chung <i>Prog. Polym. Sci. </i>2002, 27, 39-85; (c) R. G. Lopez, F. D'Agosto, C. Boisson <i>Prog. Polym. Sci. </i>2007, 32, 419-454.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">U.S. Ser. No. 12/487,739, filed Jun. 19, 2009 discloses certain vinyl terminated oligomers and polymers that are functionalized for use in lubricant applications.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">U.S. Ser. No. 12/143,663, filed on Jun. 20, 2008 discloses certain vinyl terminated oligomers and polymers that are functionalized in U.S. Ser. No. 12/487,739, filed Jun. 19, 2009.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Additional references of interest include: U.S. Pat. No. 4,988,764.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thus, there is a need to develop a means to provide functionalized polyolefins (particularly end-functionalized) by metathesis reactions, particularly reactions with good conversion, preferably under mild reaction conditions is a minimal number of steps. There is also a need for a single reaction type that allows for a variety of functional groups to be added to polyolefins in an economical manner. The instant invention's use of olefin alkene metathesis to introduce functional groups is both a commercially economical and an &#x201c;atom-economical&#x201d; route to end functionalized polyolefins.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">This invention further provides vinyl-terminated polyolefins that react with functionalized alkenes in the presence of a metathesis catalyst to form polar end-functionalized polyolefins.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">End-functionalized polyolefins that feature a chemically reactive or polar end group are of interest for use in a broad range of applications as compatibilizers, tie-layer modifiers, surfactants, and surface modifiers. Herein is described a novel method for their production by the metathesis of vinyl-terminated polyolefins with functionalized alkenes. This method is useful in a range of polyolefins, including isotactic polypropylene (iPP), atactic polypropylene (aPP), ethylene propylene copolymer (EP), and polyethylene (PE).</p>

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">This invention relates to a process to functionalize vinyl terminated polyolefin comprising contacting an alkene metathesis catalyst with a heteroatom containing alkene, and one or more vinyl terminated oligomers or polymers, preferably comprising one or more of the vinyl terminated oligomers described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The reactants are typically combined in a reaction vessel at a temperature of 20 to 200&#xb0; C. (preferably 50 to 160&#xb0; C., preferably 60 to 140&#xb0; C.) and a pressure of 0 to 1000 MPa (preferably 0.5 to 500 MPa, preferably 1 to 250 MPa) for a residence time of 0.5 seconds to 10 hours (preferably 1 second to 5 hours, preferably 1 minute to 1 hour).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Typically, from about 0.7 to about 4.0 (e.g., 0.8 to 2.6), preferably from about 1.0 to about 2.0, and most preferably from about 1.1 to about 1.7 moles of the heteroatom containing alkene reactant are charged to the reactor per mole of polyolefin charged.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Typically, 0.00001 to 0.1 moles, preferably 0.0001 to 0.02 moles, preferably 0.0005 to 0.01 moles of catalyst are charged to the reactor per mole of polyolefin charged.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The process is typically a solution process, although it may be a bulk or high pressure process. Homogeneous processes are preferred. (A homogeneous process is defined to be a process where at least 90 wt % of the product is soluble in the reaction media.) A bulk homogeneous process is particularly preferred. (A bulk process is defined to be a process where reactant concentration in all feeds to the reactor is 70 volume % or more.) Alternately no solvent or diluent is present or added in the reaction medium, (except for the small amounts used as the carrier for the catalyst or other additives, or amounts typically found with the reactants; e.g. propane in propylene).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Suitable diluents/solvents for the process include non-coordinating, inert liquids. Examples include straight and branched-chain hydrocarbons such as isobutane, butane, pentane, isopentane, hexanes, isohexane, heptane, octane, dodecane, and mixtures thereof; cyclic and alicyclic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane, cycloheptane, methylcyclohexane, methylcycloheptane, and mixtures thereof such as can be found commercially (Isopar&#x2122;); perhalogenated hydrocarbons such as perfluorinated C<sub>4-10 </sub>alkanes, chlorobenzene, and aromatic and alkyl substituted aromatic compounds such as benzene, toluene, mesitylene, and xylene. In a preferred embodiment, the feed concentration for the process is 60 volume % solvent or less, preferably 40 volume % or less, preferably 20 volume % or less.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The process may be batch, semi-batch or continuous. As used herein, the term continuous means a system that operates without interruption or cessation. For example, a continuous process to produce a polymer would be one where the reactants are continually introduced into one or more reactors and polymer product is continually withdrawn.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Useful reaction vessels include reactors (including continuous stirred tank reactors, batch reactors, reactive extruder, pipe or pump.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a preferred embodiment, the productivity of the process is at least 200 g of polar end-functionalized polyolefin per mmol of catalyst per hour, preferably at least 5000 g/mmol/hour, preferably at least 10,000 g/mmol/hr, preferably at least 300,000 g/mmol/hr.</p>

Sun, P. Brant, R. R. Chance, and W. W. Graessley, Macromolecules, Volume 34, Number 19, 6812-6820, (2001) and references therein. Three Polymer Laboratories PLgel 10 mm Mixed-B columns are used. The nominal flow rate is 0.5 cm<sup>3</sup>/min, and the nominal injection volume is 300 &#x3bc;L. The various transfer lines, columns and differential refractometer (the DRI detector) are contained in an oven maintained at 135&#xb0; C. Solvent for the SEC experiment is prepared by dissolving 6 grams of butylated hydroxy toluene as an antioxidant in 4 liters of Aldrich reagent grade 1, 2, 4 trichlorobenzene (TCB). The TCB mixture is then filtered through a 0.7 &#x3bc;m glass pre-filter and subsequently through a 0.1 &#x3bc;m Teflon filter. The TCB is then degassed with an online degasser before entering the SEC. Polymer solutions are prepared by placing dry polymer in a glass container, adding the desired amount of TCB, then heating the mixture at 160&#xb0; C. with continuous agitation for about 2 hours. All quantities are measured gravimetrically. The TCB densities used to express the polymer concentration in mass/volume units are 1.463 g/ml at room temperature and 1.324 g/ml at 135&#xb0; C. The injection concentration is from 1.0 to 2.0 mg/ml, with lower concentrations being used for higher molecular weight samples. Prior to running each sample the DRI detector and the injector are purged. Flow rate in the apparatus is then increased to 0.5 ml/minute, and the DRI is allowed to stabilize for 8 to 9 hours before injecting the first sample. The concentration, c, at each point in the chromatogram is calculated from the baseline-subtracted DRI signal, I<sub>DRI</sub>, using the following equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>c=K</i><sub>DRI</sub><i>I</i><sub>DRI</sub>/(<i>dn/dc</i>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>

The refractive index, n=1.500 for TCB at 135&#xb0; C. and &#x3bb;=690 nm. For purposes of this invention and the claims thereto (dn/dc)=0.104 for propylene polymers and 0.1 otherwise. Units on parameters throughout this description of the SEC method are such that concentration is expressed in g/cm<sup>3</sup>, molecular weight is expressed in g/mole, and intrinsic viscosity is expressed in dL/g.

<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Activators and Activation Methods for Catalyst Compounds to Make Vinyl Terminated Oligomers</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0135">The terms &#x201c;cocatalyst&#x201d; and &#x201c;activator&#x201d; are used herein interchangeably and are defined to be any compound which can activate any one of the catalyst compounds described above by converting the neutral catalyst compound to a catalytically active catalyst compound cation. Non-limiting activators, for example, include alumoxanes, aluminum alkyls, ionizing activators, which may be neutral or ionic, and conventional-type cocatalysts. Preferred activators typically include alumoxane compounds, modified alumoxane compounds, and ionizing anion precursor compounds that abstract one reactive, &#x3c3;-bound, metal ligand making the metal complex cationic and providing a charge-balancing noncoordinating or weakly coordinating anion.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0136">In one embodiment, alumoxane activators are utilized as an activator in the catalyst composition. Alumoxanes are generally oligomeric compounds containing &#x2014;Al(R<sup>1</sup>)&#x2014;O&#x2014; sub-units, where R<sup>1 </sup>is an alkyl group. Examples of alumoxanes include methylalumoxane (MAO), modified methylalumoxane (MMAO), ethylalumoxane and isobutylalumoxane. Alkylalumoxanes and modified alkylalumoxanes are suitable as catalyst activators, particularly when the abstractable ligand is an alkyl, halide, alkoxide or amide. Mixtures of different alumoxanes and modified alumoxanes may also be used. It may be preferable to use a visually clear methylalumoxane. A cloudy or gelled alumoxane can be filtered to produce a clear solution or clear alumoxane can be decanted from the cloudy solution. Another alumoxane is a modified methyl alumoxane (MMAO) cocatalyst type 3A (commercially available from Akzo Chemicals, Inc. under the trade name Modified Methylalumoxane type 3A, covered under U.S. Pat. No. 5,041,584).</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0137">When the activator is an alumoxane (modified or unmodified), some embodiments select the maximum amount of activator at a 5000-fold molar excess Al/M over the catalyst precursor (per metal catalytic site). The minimum activator-to-catalyst-precursor is a 1:1 molar ratio. Alternate preferred ranges include up to 500:1, alternately up to 200:1, alternately up to 100:1 alternately from 1:1 to 50:1.</p>

<p id="p-0110" num="0142">In another embodiment the functionalized co(oligomers) described herein have less than 10% allyl chain ends, preferably less than 5%, preferably less than 1%, (relative to total unsaturations as measured by <sup>1</sup>H NMR, using the protocol described in U.S. Ser. No. 12/143,663, filed on Jun. 20, 2008); and less than 10 wt % vinylidene unsaturations, preferably less than 5%, preferably less than 1%, (relative to total unsaturations as measured by <sup>1</sup>H NMR); and/or less than 10% vinylene unsaturations, preferably less than 5%, preferably less than 1%, (relative to total unsaturations as measured by <sup>1</sup>H NMR, using the protocol described in U.S. Ser.

No hydrogen or chain transfer/termination agent should be used during functionalization, derivitization or stripping (of unreacted monomer) for measurement of unsaturations.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0143">In another embodiment, the functionalized co(oligomers) consist essentially of propylene, functional group and optionally ethylene. Alternately C<sub>4 </sub>olefins (such as isobutylene, butadiene, n-butene) are substantially absent from the functionalized co(oligomers). Alternately C<sub>4-20 </sub>olefins are substantially absent from the functionalized co(oligomers). Alternately isobutylene is substantially absent from the functionalized co(oligomers). By substantially absent is meant that the monomer is present in the oligomer/co-oligomer at 1 wt % or less, preferably at 0.5 wt % or less, preferably at 0 wt %.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0144">In another embodiment, the number of functional groups is present at 0.60 to 1.2, alternately 0.75 to 1.1 functional groups per chain (preferably assuming that Mn has not altered by more than 15% as compared to the Mn of the oligomer or co-oligomer prior to functionalization and optional derivatization). Number of functional groups per chain=F/Mn, as determined by <sup>1</sup>H NMR as follows: The instrument used is a 400 MHz Varian pulsed fourier transform NMR spectrometer equipped with a variable temperature proton detection probe operating at 120&#xb0; C. The sample is dissolved in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane-d<sub>2 </sub>(TCE-d<sub>2</sub>) or CDCl<sub>3 </sub>and transferred into a 5 mm glass NMR tube. (The solvent has less than 10,000 ppm water and is free of other contaminants that could change the chemical shifts in the NMR spectrum). Acquisition parameters are pulse width=45&#xb0;, acquisition delay=8 s and number of scans=120. Chemical shifts are determined relative to the residual TCE-d<sub>1 </sub>signal which is set to 5.98 ppm and residual CHCl<sub>3</sub>. which is set at 7.24 ppm. VRA is the normalized integrated signal intensity for the vinyls with shifts between from about 4.9 to 5.1 ppm. VRDA is the normalized integrated signal intensity for the vinylidene resonances between from about 4.65 to 4.85 ppm and the vinylene resonances at from about 5.15 to 5.6 ppm. IA is the normalized integrated signal intensities for the aliphatic region of interest between from about 0 to 2.1 ppm (IA). The number of vinyl groups/1000 Carbons (VI) is determined from the formula: (VRA*1000)/(IA+VRA+VDRA). Likewise, the number of vinylidene &#x26; vinylene groups/1000 carbons (VE) is determined from the formula: (VDRA*1000)/(IA+VRA+VDRA). VRA, VDRA and IA are the normalized integrated signal intensities in the chemical shift regions defined above. Mn is calculated assuming one unsaturated end-group per oligomer chain. Mn=(14,000 g/mol)/(VI+VE).</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0145">After the oligomer in question is functionalized it is necessary to determine the resonances/chemical shift regions of the functional group to determine % functionalization. To do so, repeat the above <sup>1</sup>H NMR procedure on a clean sample of the functionalized oligomer (e.g. washed to remove unreacted materials, contaminants, etc.). Refer to &#x201c;The Sadtler Guide to NMR Spectra&#x201d;, ed. William Walter Simons, published by the Sadtler Research Laboratories, 1972 for assistance in determining the shift regions for specific functional groups. The number of functional groups/1000 C's (F)=(FA*1000)/(FA+IA+VRA+VDRA), where FA=normalized integrated signal intensities in the chemical shift region of the functional group, and IA, VRA, VDRA are as defined above.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0146">Percent functionalization of the oligomer=(F*100)/(F+VI+VE). The number of vinyl groups/1000 carbons (VI*) and number of vinylidene groups/1000 carbons (VE*) for the functionalized oligomer are determined from the <sup>1</sup>HNMR spectra of the functionalized oligomer in the same manner as VI and VE for the unfunctionalized oligomer.

<p id="p-0131" num="0163">Melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>) and glass transition temperature (Tg) are measured using Differential Scanning calorimetry (DSC) using commercially available equipment such as a TA Instruments 2920 DSC. Typically, 6 to 10 mg of the sample, that has been stored at room temperature for at least 48 hours, is sealed in an aluminum pan and loaded into the instrument at room temperature. The sample is equilibrated at 25&#xb0; C., then it is cooled at a cooling rate of 10&#xb0; C./min to &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. The sample is held at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. for 5 min and then heated at a heating rate of 10&#xb0; C./min to 25&#xb0; C. The glass transition temperature is measured from the heating cycle. Alternatively, the sample is equilibrated at 25&#xb0; C., then heated at a heating rate of 10&#xb0; C./min to 150&#xb0; C. The endothermic melting transition, if present, is analyzed for onset of transition and peak temperature. The melting temperatures reported are the peak melting temperatures from the first heat unless otherwise specified. For samples displaying multiple peaks, the melting point (or melting temperature) is defined to be the peak melting temperature (i.e., associated with the largest endothermic calorimetric response in that range of temperatures) from the DSC melting trace.</p>

<p id="p-0137" num="0169">1-Octadecene (2.00 mL, 6.24 mmol) and MA (1.13 mL, 12.5 mmol) were combined with hexane (14 mL) and benzene (2 mL). The homogeneous mixture was heated to gentle reflux on a heating plate kept at 73&#xb0; C. Then a benzene solution of catalyst B (1.31 mL, 0.0312 mmol) was added. Vigorous gas evolution was observed within minutes. After 2 h the volatiles were removed by evaporation under a stream of nitrogen. The resulting brownish suspension was mixed with pentane (12 mL), and the mixture was passed through a short column of neutral alumina that had been slurried with pentane. The column was washed with additional pentane (30 mL). The combined organics were evaporated and dried under reduced pressure at 75&#xb0; C. for 2 h to yield the ester-capped product as a low-melting, colorless solid.
