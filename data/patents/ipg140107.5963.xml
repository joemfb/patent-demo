<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to communication devices, and more particularly to a communication device that reads external device information from an external device using proximity wireless communication and transmits the external device information to a server connected via a general-purpose network.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In recent years, services provided via the Internet have been increasingly prevalent. As servers manage text information, images, videos, and the like created by users as well as news, weather forecast, movie information, and other contents created by companies, services for supplying these contents any time via the Internet have also been rapidly increased.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One of the services is photograph sharing service. A user can upload photographs taken by the user himself/herself to a server, and later view the photographed images any time by accessing the server from a personal computer or the like via the Internet.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to upload photographed images to a server, products have recently been developed to facilitate the uploading procedure. Digital cameras, memory cards, and the like have wireless LAN function to automatically upload photographed images directly to a server by simple procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">On the other hand, in order to download and display images uploaded to a server, the following television sets (hereinafter, TVs) are currently on the market. The TVs are connectable to the Internet. A user uses such a TV to access a server and logins with, for example, a user ID and a password, thereby obtaining images from the server.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the downloading procedures still use conventional interface techniques of personal computers. Therefore, the operability is not improved. The TVs with Internet function, which are recently on the market, require pressing buttons of a remote controller some dozens times to download data such as photographs. A user needs to read a manual to follow the complicated procedures. This would not be a high obstacle for young generations and those having high computer skills. However, such procedures requiring relatively high skills are complicated and bothersome for middle-aged and elderly people and general women. Users not familiar with computer operations find difficult to enjoy the services. The problem in operability has been examined to be improved, but the improved techniques are not different from the conventional computer operation methods. The operability is not significantly improved.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Patent Reference 1 discloses the following technique. A display device connected to a server has a Radio Frequency IDentification (RF-ID) reader. An object (commodity, merchandise, or the like) is provided with a RF-ID tag including a non-rewritable memory in which object Unique IDentification (UID) is stored. A server has a database in which the object ID (UID) is associated with an image such as a user's face photograph. When the object is brought to proximity of the RF-ID reader, the RF-ID reader reads the UID from the tag, and the image, such as a user's face photograph, associated with the UID is retrieved from the database to be displayed on the display device. Thereby, the owner of the object is determined.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problems that Invention is to Solve</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As described earlier, the system for providing the photograph sharing service by using a TV has a problem. Since a TV is generally operated by a remote controller, it is quite bothersome to access a server and to enter a user ID and a password.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Patent Reference 1 discloses that the display device having a RF-ID reader and an object provided with a RF-ID tag make it possible to easily display image data, such as a face photograph of an owner of the object. However, the RF-ID tag merely holding UID does not exchange information to facilitate access between the TV terminal and the server. The RF-ID tag fails to facilitate the operation procedures. Since a RF-ID tag provided to an object holds only UID, it is not possible to obtain image information associated with UID when each object is connected to a different server.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition, the above-described Patent Reference 1 has another problem. The TV terminal needs to hold various different application programs (programs for downloading images, for example) compliant to various items, item kinds, or application systems of the objects provided with RF-ID. Therefore, the TV terminal needs a storage device to store these various application programs. Moreover, it is burdensome to follow version-up of the programs.</p>

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">The following describes communication devices according to embodiments of the present invention in detail with reference to the drawings. In the following first to thirteenth embodiments, various aspects of the communication device according to the present invention are described. Among them, the eighth embodiment is the most preferred embodiment directly related to the primary aspect of the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">The first embodiment according to the present invention is described below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram of the first embodiment of the present invention. Here, a communication system including an image capturing device (camera) <b>1</b>, a TV <b>45</b>, and a server <b>42</b> is illustrated. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the image capturing device <b>1</b> capturing images is illustrated on a left-hand side, while the image capturing device <b>1</b> reproducing the captured images is illustrated on a right-hand side.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">The image capturing device <b>1</b> is an example of the communication device according to the aspect of the present invention. Here, the image capturing device <b>1</b> is implemented as a digital camera. For units used in capturing images, the image capturing device <b>1</b> includes a first power supply unit <b>101</b>, a video processing unit <b>31</b>, a first antenna <b>20</b>, a first processing unit <b>35</b>, a second memory <b>52</b>, and a RF-ID antenna (second antenna) <b>21</b>. The second memory <b>52</b> holds medium identification information <b>111</b>, captured image state information <b>60</b>, and server specific information <b>48</b>. The RF-ID antenna <b>21</b> is used for a RF-ID unit. For units used in reproducing images, the image capturing device <b>1</b> includes the first power supply unit <b>101</b>, a first memory <b>174</b>, a power detection unit <b>172</b>, an activation unit <b>170</b>, the second memory <b>52</b>, a second processing unit <b>95</b>, a modulation switch unit <b>179</b>, a communication unit <b>171</b>, a second power supply unit <b>91</b>, and the RF-ID antenna <b>21</b>. The second memory <b>52</b> holds medium identification information <b>111</b>, captured image state information <b>60</b>, and the server specific information <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">The TV <b>45</b> is an example of an apparatus (device) connected to a reader via a communication path. In more detail, the TV <b>45</b> is a television receiving apparatus used to display image data captured by the image capturing device <b>1</b>. The TV <b>45</b> includes a display unit <b>110</b> and a RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">The server <b>42</b> is a computer that holds image data uploaded from the image capturing device <b>1</b> and that downloads the image data to the TV <b>45</b>. The server <b>42</b> has a storage device in which data <b>50</b> is stored.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">When images of objects such as scenery are captured, the images are converted to captured data (image data) by the video processing unit <b>31</b> data. Then, in communicable conditions, the image data is transmitted to an access point using the first antenna <b>20</b> for a wireless Local Area Network (LAN) or Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), and eventually recorded as the data <b>50</b> via the Internet to the predetermined server <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">Here, the first processing unit <b>35</b> records the captured image state information <b>60</b> regarding the captured image data onto the second memory <b>52</b> in a RF-ID unit <b>47</b>. The captured image state information <b>60</b> indicates at least one of (a) date of time of capturing each of the images, (b) the number of the captured images, (c) date and time of finally transmitting (uploading) an image, (d) the number of transmitted (uploaded) images, and (e) date and time of finally capturing an image. In addition, the captured image state information <b>60</b> includes (f) serial numbers of images that have already been uploaded or images that have not yet been uploaded; (g) a serial number of a finally captured image; and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">In addition, the first processing unit <b>35</b> generates a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the data <b>50</b> that is uploaded to the server <b>42</b>. The first processing unit <b>35</b> records the server specific information <b>48</b> onto the second memory <b>52</b>. The server specific information <b>48</b> is used to access the image data. The medium identification information <b>111</b> is also recorded on the second memory <b>52</b>. The medium identification information <b>111</b> is used to determine whether the device embedded with the RF-ID (RF-ID unit) is a camera, a card, or a post card.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">When a main power of the camera (the first power supply unit <b>101</b> such as a battery) is ON, the second memory <b>52</b> receives power from the main power. Even if the main power of the camera is OFF, the external RF-ID reader/writer is located outside supplies power to the RF-ID antenna <b>21</b>. This enables the passive second power supply unit <b>91</b> without any power like a battery to adjust a voltage to provide power to respective units in a RF-ID circuit unit including the second memory. Thereby, it is possible to supply power to the second memory <b>52</b> so that the data is exchanged between the second memory <b>52</b> and the external device to be recorded and reproduced. Here, the second power supply unit <b>91</b> is a circuit generating power from radio waves received by the second antenna (RF-ID antenna) <b>21</b>. The second power supply unit <b>91</b> includes a rectifier circuit and the like. Whenever the main power is ON or OFF, the data in the second memory <b>52</b> is read and written by the second processing unit <b>95</b>. When the main power is ON, the data in the second memory <b>52</b> can be read and written also by the first processing unit <b>35</b>. In other words, the second memory <b>52</b> is implemented as a nonvolatile memory, and both the first processing unit <b>35</b> and the second processing unit <b>95</b> can read and write data from and to the second memory <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">When the image capturing device <b>1</b> completes capturing images of a trip or the like and then the captured images are to be reproduced, the image capturing device <b>1</b> is moved into proximity of the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> of the TV <b>45</b>, as illustrated on the right side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as being the situation of reproducing images. Then, the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> supplies power to the RF-ID unit <b>47</b> via the second antenna <b>21</b>, and thereby the second power supply unit <b>91</b> provides power to the units in the RF-ID unit <b>47</b>, even if the main power (the first power supply unit <b>101</b>) of the image capturing device <b>1</b> is OFF. The captured image state information <b>60</b> and the server specific information <b>48</b> are read by the second processing unit <b>95</b> from the second memory <b>52</b>, and transmitted to the TV <b>45</b> via the second antenna <b>21</b>. The TV <b>45</b> generates a URL based on the server specific information <b>48</b>, then downloads the image data of the data <b>50</b> from the server <b>42</b>, and eventually displays, on the display unit <b>110</b>, thumbnails or the like of images in the image data. If it is determined based on the captured image state information <b>60</b> that there is any captured image not yet been uploaded to the server <b>42</b>, the determination result is displayed on the display unit <b>110</b>. If necessary, the image capturing device <b>1</b> is activated to upload, to the server <b>42</b>, image data of the captured image not yet been uploaded.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B, and <b>2</b>C are an external front view, an external back view, and an external right side view, respectively, of the image capturing device <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the first antenna <b>20</b> used for a wireless LAN and the second antenna <b>21</b> used for the RF-ID unit are embedded in a right side of the image capturing device <b>1</b>. The antennas are covered with an antenna cover <b>22</b> made of a material not shielding radio waves. The RF-ID unit operates at a frequency of 13.5 MHz, while the wireless LAN operates at a frequency of 2.5 GHz. The significant difference in frequency prevents interference between them. Therefore, the two antennas <b>20</b> and <b>21</b> are seen overlapping with each other from the outside, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>. The structure decreases an installation area of the antennas, eventually reducing a size of the image capturing device <b>1</b>. The structure also enables the single antenna cover <b>22</b> to cover both of the two antennas as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, so that the part made of the material not shielding radio waves is minimized. The material not shielding radio waves, such as plastic, has a strength lower than that of a metal. Therefore, the minimization of the material can reduce a decrease in a strength of a body of the image capturing device <b>1</b>. The image capturing device <b>1</b> further includes a lens <b>6</b> and a power switch <b>3</b>. The units assigned with numeral references <b>2</b> to <b>16</b> will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a detailed block diagram of the image capturing device <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">Image data captured by an image capturing unit <b>30</b> is provided to a recording/reproducing unit <b>32</b> via the video processing unit <b>31</b> and then recorded onto a third memory <b>33</b>. The image data is eventually recorded onto an Integrated Circuit (IC) card <b>34</b> that is removable from the image capturing device <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">The above processing is instructed by the first processing unit <b>35</b> that is, for example, a Central Processing Unit (CPU). The image data, such as captured photographs or video, is provided to an encryption unit <b>36</b>, a transmission unit <b>38</b> in a communication unit <b>37</b>, and then the first antenna <b>20</b>, in order to be transmitted to an access point or the like by radio via a wireless LAN, WiMAX, or the like. From the access point or the like, the image data is transmitted to the server <b>42</b> via the Internet <b>40</b>. In the above manner, the image data such as photographs is uploaded.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">There is a situation where a part of the image data fails to be uploaded because, for example, the communication state is not good or there is no nearby access point or base station. In the situation, some images have already been uploaded to the server <b>42</b>, and the other images have not yet been uploaded. Therefore, the image data in the server <b>42</b> is different from the image data captured by the image capturing device <b>1</b>. In the first embodiment of the present invention, the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> of the TV <b>45</b> or the like reads the server specific information <b>48</b> and the like from the second memory <b>52</b> in the RF-ID unit <b>47</b> of the image capturing device <b>1</b>. Then, based on the readout information, a URL or the like of the server <b>42</b> is generated. According to the URL, the TV <b>45</b> accesses the server <b>42</b> to access the data <b>50</b> such as a file, folder, or the like uploaded by the image capturing device <b>1</b>. Then, the TV <b>45</b> downloads the uploaded images from among the images captured by the image capturing device <b>1</b>, and displays the downloaded images. The above method will be described in more detail later.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">If a part or all of the captured images is not uploaded as image data of the data <b>50</b> in the server <b>42</b>, a problem would occur that a user downloading the images to the TV <b>45</b> cannot watch a part of the images on the TV <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">In order to solve the problem, in the first embodiment of the present invention, the first processing unit <b>35</b> causes a recording/reproducing unit <b>32</b> to indicate information regarding a state of captured images, such as information of uploading state, to the captured image state information <b>55</b> in the second memory <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">The above is described in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In the second memory <b>52</b>, synchronization information <b>56</b> is recorded. The synchronization information <b>56</b> indicates whether or not image data in the server <b>42</b> matches image data captured by the camera, in other words, whether or not the image data in the server <b>42</b> is in synchronization with the image data captured by the camera. In the first embodiment of the present invention, the TV <b>45</b> reads the captured image state information <b>55</b> from the second memory <b>52</b> via the second antenna <b>21</b>. The captured image state information <b>55</b> makes it possible to instantly determine whether or not the data <b>50</b> in the server lacks any image. If the determination is made that there is any image that has not yet been uploaded, then the determination result is displayed on the display unit of the TV <b>45</b>. Here, the TV <b>45</b> also displays a message of &#x201c;Please upload images&#x201d; to a viewer. Or, the TV <b>45</b> issues an instruction to the camera via the RF-ID antenna <b>21</b> to transmit an activation signal to the activation unit <b>170</b>, thereby supplying power to the first power supply unit <b>101</b> of the image capturing device <b>1</b>. Thereby, the TV <b>45</b> causes the image capturing device <b>1</b> to upload, to the server <b>42</b>, the images in the first memory <b>174</b> or the like of the image capturing device <b>1</b>, which have not yet been uploaded, via a wireless LAN, a wired LAN, the second antenna (RF-ID antenna) <b>21</b>, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">Since transmission via the RF-ID antenna <b>21</b> has a small transfer amount, transmission of the image data as originally captured takes a considerable time to upload and display the image data. This causes a user to feel unpleasant. In order to avoid this, according to the first embodiment of the present invention, when the image data is transmitted via the RF-ID antenna <b>21</b>, thumbnails of the images not yet been uploaded are transmitted instead. The thumbnails can shorten apparent upload time and display time, suppressing unpleasant feeling of the user. Most of current RF-ID having a high communication ability has a transfer amount of several hundreds kbps. However, development of RF-ID having a quad-speed has been examined. The quad-speed RF-ID has a possibility of achieving a transfer amount of several Mbps. If thumbnails of images not yet been uploaded are transmitted, it is possible to transmit several dozens of thumbnails in one second. If thumbnails are displayed in a list, thumbnails of all images including images not yet been uploaded can be displayed on the TV within a time period a general user can tolerate. The above is one of practical solutions.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">If the image capturing device is forced to be activated to upload images not yet been uploaded as described above, the most speedy and stable path is selected from a wireless LAN, the RF-ID antenna <b>21</b>, and a wired LAN, to be used for uploading and displaying on the TV. In the situation where the image capturing device <b>1</b> receives power from the outside via the second antenna <b>21</b>, the communication unit <b>171</b> transmitting signals to the second antenna <b>21</b> performs communication with the outside by a low-speed modulation method. On the other hand, in the situation where the image capturing device <b>1</b> can receive power from the first power supply unit <b>101</b> or the like, the communication unit <b>171</b> switches the modulation method to a modulation method having a large signal point, such as Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK), 16-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM), or 64-QAM, as needed, in order to achieve high-speed transfer to upload the image data not yet been uploaded in a short time. Furthermore, when the power detection unit <b>172</b> detects, for example, that the first power supply unit <b>101</b> or the like does not have enough power or that the image capturing device <b>1</b> is not connected to an external power, the first power supply unit <b>101</b> stops supplying power and a modulation switch unit <b>175</b> switches the modulation method employed by the communication unit <b>171</b> to a modulation method having a smaller signal point or less transfer rate. As a result, it is possible to prevent that the capacity of the first power supply unit <b>101</b> is reduced to be equal to or less than a set value.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">There is another solution for power. When power is not enough, the second processing unit <b>95</b>, the communication unit <b>171</b>, or the like sends a power increase request signal to the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> of the TV <b>45</b> via the second antenna <b>21</b>, to request for power support. In response to the request, the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> increases providing power to have a value greater than the set value for the power used in reading data from the RF-ID unit. Since the RF-ID unit receives more power via the second antenna <b>21</b>, the RF-ID unit can provide power to the communication unit <b>171</b> or the first processing unit <b>35</b>. Thereby, a power amount of a battery <b>100</b> for the first power supply unit <b>101</b> is not reduced. Or, without the battery <b>100</b>, the image capturing device <b>1</b> can practically and unlimitedly continue transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">As still another method, uploaded-image-data information <b>60</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> can be used. In uploaded-image-data information <b>60</b>, uploaded-image information <b>61</b> such as serial numbers of photographs, is recorded. It is also possible to use hashed information <b>62</b> generated by hashing the information <b>61</b>. As a result, a data amount is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">The TV <b>45</b> can read the above information to be compared to information of images captured by the camera, thereby obtaining information of images not yet been uploaded.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">As still another method, not-yet-uploaded image data existence identification information <b>63</b> can be used. The not-yet-uploaded image data existence identification information <b>63</b> includes an existence identifier <b>64</b> indicating whether or not there is any image not yet been uploaded. Since existence of images not yet been uploaded is notified, data in the second memory <b>52</b> can be significantly reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">It is also possible to use not-yet-uploaded-image number <b>65</b> indicating the number of images not yet been uploaded. Since the image capturing device <b>1</b> allows the TV <b>45</b> to read the information, a viewer can be informed of the number of images to be uploaded. In this case, a data capacity in addition to the number is recorded as the captured image state information <b>55</b>. Thereby, the image capturing device <b>1</b> enables the TV <b>45</b> to display a more exact prediction time required to upload images not yet been uploaded.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">It is also possible to use not-yet-uploaded image information hashed information <b>67</b> that is generated by hashing information regarding images not yet been uploaded.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">In addition, it is also possible to record a final capturing time (final capturing date/time) <b>68</b> in the second memory <b>52</b>. Later, the TV <b>45</b> reads the final capturing time <b>68</b>. The TV <b>45</b> is connected to the server <b>42</b> to compare the final capturing time <b>68</b> to a capturing date of an image that has been finally uploaded to the server <b>42</b>. Thereby, it is possible to easily determine whether or not there is any image not yet been uploaded. If images are captured and assigned with serial numbers sequentially from an older image, it is possible to record only a final image serial number <b>69</b>. The final image serial number <b>69</b> is compared to a serial number of an image that has been finally uploaded to the server <b>42</b>. Thereby, it is possible to determine whether or not there is any image not yet been uploaded. It is also possible to record, onto the second memory <b>52</b>, captured image information <b>70</b> that is, for example, serial numbers of all captured images. Thereby, the TV <b>45</b> later accesses the server <b>42</b> to match the serial numbers to images uploaded to the server <b>42</b>. As a result, it is possible to determine whether or not there is any image not yet uploaded. When the captured image information <b>70</b> is used, use of hashed information <b>71</b> generated by hashing the captured image information <b>70</b> can compress the captured image information <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">The second memory <b>52</b> further stores Unique IDentification (UID) <b>75</b> of the RF-ID unit, camera ID <b>76</b>, and the medium identification information <b>111</b>. Even if the main power of the camera (except a sub-power for backup etc. of a clock) is OFF, these pieces of information can be read by the TV <b>45</b> via the second antenna <b>21</b> to be used for identifying the camera or the user or authenticating a device (apparatus). When the user comes back from an overseas trip or the like, the camera is likely to have a small charge amount of the battery. However, according to the first embodiment of the present invention, the camera can be operated to transmit information without battery, which is highly convenient for the user. The medium identification information <b>111</b> includes an identifier or the like indicating whether the medium or device embedded with the RF-ID unit is a camera, a camcorder, a post card, a card, or a mobile phone. The identifier enables the TV <b>45</b> to identify the medium or device. Thereby, the TV <b>45</b> can display a mark or icon of the camera or postcard on a screen as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, as will be described. The TV <b>45</b> can also change processing depending on the identifier.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">The second memory <b>52</b> also stores image display method instruction information <b>77</b>. For example, in the situation where a list display <b>78</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is selected, when the second antenna <b>21</b> is moved into proximity of the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> of the TV <b>45</b>, the image capturing device <b>1</b> (camera) causes the TV <b>45</b> to display a list of thumbnails of images, such as photographs.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">In the situation where slide show <b>79</b> is selected, the image capturing device <b>1</b> causes the TV <b>45</b> to sequentially display images from a newer one or an older one.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">In a lower part of the second memory <b>52</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, there is a region for recording the server specific information <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">The server specific information <b>48</b> allows a camera operator to display images on the TV screen by a preferred method.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">The server specific information <b>48</b> includes server URL generation information <b>80</b> that is source information from which a server URL is generated. An example of the server URL generation information <b>80</b> is login ID <b>83</b>. The server specific information <b>48</b> has a region in which server address information <b>81</b> and user identification information <b>82</b> are recorded. In practical, login ID <b>83</b> and the like are recorded. In addition, there is a region for storing a password <b>84</b>. An encrypted password <b>85</b> may be stored in the region. The above pieces of information are used to generate an URL by a URL generation unit <b>90</b> that is provided in the image capturing device <b>1</b>, the RF-ID unit <b>47</b>, the camera function used for capturing images in the image capturing device <b>1</b>, or the TV <b>45</b>. The URL is used for accessing a group of images corresponding to the image capturing device <b>1</b> or the user in the server <b>42</b>. If the URL generation unit <b>90</b> is provided in the RF-ID unit <b>47</b>, the URL generation unit <b>90</b> receives power from the second power supply unit <b>91</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">It is also possible to generate URL <b>92</b> without using the above pieces of information and store the generated URL <b>92</b> directly to the second memory <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">It is characterized in that the above-described pieces of information stored in the second memory <b>52</b> can be read by both the second processing unit <b>95</b> in the RF-ID unit and the first processing unit <b>35</b> in the camera function.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">The above structure allows the TV <b>45</b> reading the RF-ID unit <b>47</b> in the camera to instantly obtain the pieces of information regarding uploading state, the sever address information, the login ID, the password, and the like. Thereby, the TV <b>45</b> can download image data corresponding to the camera from the server <b>42</b>, and display the image data at a high speed.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">In the above situation, even if the main power of the image capturing device <b>1</b> is OFF, the RF-ID reader/writer supplies power to the second power supply unit <b>91</b> to activate (operate) the image capturing device <b>1</b>. Therefore, power of the battery <b>100</b> in the image capturing device <b>1</b> is not reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the first power supply unit <b>101</b> receives power from the battery <b>100</b> to provide power to the units in the camera. In a quiescent state, however, a third power supply unit <b>102</b> provides weak power to the clock <b>103</b> and the like. In some cases, the third power supply unit <b>102</b> supplies backup power to a part of the second memory <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">The RF-ID unit <b>47</b> receives power from the second antenna to provide power to the second power supply unit <b>91</b>, thereby operating the second processing unit <b>95</b>, or operating a data receiving unit <b>105</b>, a recording unit <b>106</b>, a reproducing unit <b>107</b>, a data transfer unit <b>108</b> (the communication unit <b>171</b>), and the second memory <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">Therefore, in a quiescent state of the camera, no power is consumed. As a result, it is possible to keep the battery <b>100</b> of the camera longer.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">The processing performed by the image capturing device <b>1</b> (referred to also as a &#x201c;medium&#x201d; such as a camera or card) and the processing performed by the TV and the RF-ID reader/writer are explained with reference to a flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">If the main power is OFF at Step <b>150</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, it is determined at Step <b>150</b><i>b </i>whether or not activation setting of the RF-ID reader/writer for the main power OFF is made. If the activation setting is made, then the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> is turned ON at Step <b>150</b><i>c </i>and changed to be in a power saving mode at Step <b>150</b><i>e. </i></p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">At Step <b>150</b><i>f</i>, impedance or the like of an antenna unit is measured, or a nearby sensor is measured. When the RF-ID unit is moved into proximity of an antenna of the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> at Step <b>150</b><i>j</i>, it is detected at Step <b>150</b><i>g </i>whether or not the RF-ID unit is in proximity of or contacts the antenna. If it is detected that the RF-ID unit is in proximity of or contacts the antenna, then the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> starts supplying power to the antenna of the medium at Step <b>150</b><i>h</i>. At Step <b>150</b><i>k</i>, in the medium, the second power supply unit is turned ON and thereby the second processing unit starts operating. As Step <b>150</b><i>m</i>, communication between the medium (camera or card) and the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> starts.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">When at Step <b>150</b><i>i</i>, the TV determines whether or not the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> receives communication from the medium. If the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> receives communication, then mutual authentication starts at Steps <b>151</b><i>a </i>and <b>151</b><i>f </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. If it is determined at Steps <b>151</b><i>b </i>and <b>151</b><i>g </i>that the mutual authentication is successful, information is read out from the second memory at Step <b>151</b><i>d</i>. At Step <b>151</b><i>e</i>, the readout information is transmitted to the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b>. At Step <b>151</b><i>i</i>, the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> receives the information. At Step <b>151</b><i>j</i>, the TV <b>45</b> side makes a determination as to whether or not the identification information or the like of the second memory is correct. If the identification information or the like is correct, then it is determined at Step <b>151</b><i>p </i>whether or not the TV <b>45</b> has identification information indicating automatic power ON. If the TV <b>45</b> has identification information, then it is determined at Step <b>151</b><i>r </i>whether or not a main power of the TV is OFF. If the main power of the TV is OFF, the main power of the TV is turned ON at Step <b>152</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. At Step <b>152</b><i>b</i>, the TV <b>45</b> side makes a determination as to whether or not the second memory <b>52</b> has forced display instruction. If the second memory <b>52</b> has the forced display instruction, then the TV <b>45</b> side changes an input signal of the TV to a screen display signal for displaying the RF-ID at Step <b>152</b><i>d</i>. At Step <b>152</b><i>e</i>, the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> reads format identification information. At Step <b>152</b><i>f</i>, the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> reads information from the second memory by changing a format of the information to a format according to the format identification information. At Step <b>152</b><i>g</i>, the TV <b>45</b> side makes a determination as to whether or not the second memory has a &#x201c;password request flag&#x201d;. If the second memory has the &#x201c;password request flag&#x201d;, then the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> reads an &#x201c;ID of TV not requesting password entry&#x201d; from the second memory at Step <b>152</b><i>h</i>. At Step <b>152</b><i>i</i>, the TV <b>45</b> side makes a determination as to whether or not ID of the TV <b>45</b> matches the &#x201c;ID of TV not requesting password entry&#x201d;. If the ID of the TV <b>45</b> does not match the &#x201c;ID of TV not requesting password entry&#x201d;, then the medium reads out a password from the second memory at Step <b>152</b><i>q</i>. At Step <b>152</b><i>v</i>, the medium decrypts the password that has been encrypted. At Step <b>152</b><i>s</i>, the medium transmits the decrypted password to the TV <b>45</b> side. Here, at Steps <b>152</b><i>q</i>, <b>152</b><i>r</i>, and <b>152</b><i>s</i>, it is also possible to store the password in a storage device in the server <b>42</b> as the data <b>50</b> in the server <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">At Step <b>152</b><i>j</i>, the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> receives the password. At Step <b>152</b><i>k</i>, the TV <b>45</b> displays a password entry screen.

At Step <b>160</b><i>g</i>, the terminal prints the image data. At Step <b>160</b><i>h</i>, the printing is completed. At Step <b>160</b><i>i</i>, for each image data, the terminal records, onto the server, an identifier indicating that one printing process is completed. At Step <b>160</b><i>n</i>, the server assigns a print completion identifier to the image data that is stored in the server and has been printed.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">Next, the following describes the situation where the medium such as a camera or a post card does not have a memory for storing data.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">Steps of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> follow the numbers <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>5</b> in circles in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. At Step <b>161</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, a main power of the TV is turned ON. At Step <b>161</b><i>k</i>, the TV reads UID of the RF-ID unit from the second memory. At Step <b>161</b><i>b</i>, the TV obtains the UID. At Step <b>161</b><i>m</i>, the TV reads the server specific information <b>48</b> from the second memory. At Step <b>161</b><i>c</i>, the TV accesses a server directory. At Step <b>161</b><i>d</i>, the TV searches the server directories for a final server providing service corresponding to the UID. At Step <b>161</b><i>e</i>, the TV determines whether or not such a final server exists. If there is such a final server, then at Step <b>161</b><i>g</i>, the TV accesses the final server and reads a user ID, a password, and a service name from a UID list at Step <b>161</b><i>g</i>. At Step <b>161</b><i>h</i>, the TV determines whether or not a password is requested. If the password is requested, then the TV determines at Step <b>161</b><i>i </i>whether or not the readout password is correct. At Step <b>162</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the TV determines whether or not the service is regarding photographs or video. If the service is regarding photographs or video, then at Step <b>162</b><i>b</i>, the TV reads (i) reads, from a specific directory in the server associated with the UID, (a) a corresponding program such as a billing program, (b) a list including an address or a file name of image data to be displayed, (c) image display instruction information, (d) forced display instruction, (e) forced print instruction, and (f) camera ID, and (ii) automatically displays the image data or causes the image data to be printed, based on the above pieces of information and procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">If needed, password entry is requested at Step <b>162</b><i>b</i>. At Step <b>162</b><i>c</i>, the TV determines whether or not the user desires to print a specific image. If the user desires to print a specific image, then at Step <b>162</b><i>d</i>, the TV adds data of the specific image to the server associated with the UID or to a print directory of the TV. At Step <b>162</b><i>e</i>, the TV determines whether or not the TV is connected to a printer and there is an independent printer. If so, then, at Step <b>162</b><i>f</i>, the RF-ID unit of the medium such as a post card is moved into proximity of a RF-ID reader/writer of the printer. At Step <b>163</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref>, the printer (i) reads UID of the RF-ID from the medium, (ii) thereby reads image data to be printed or a location of the image data from the print directory on the server having the modified information, and (iii) prints the image data. At Step <b>163</b><i>b</i>, the printing is completed. Thereby, the above processing is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">Step <b>163</b><i>i </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref> is the number <b>23</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.

If the service is for shopping, then the TV determines at Step <b>163</b><i>e </i>whether or not authentication is successful. If the authentication is successful, then at Step <b>163</b><i>f</i>, the TV reads, from the server, a shopping/billing program associated with the UID, and executes the program. At Step <b>163</b><i>g</i>, the execution of the program is completed. Thereby, the above processing is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">Next, the following describes a method of reading information from a RF-ID unit embedded in a postcard without a RF-ID reader.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">At Step <b>164</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref>, a second RF-ID unit, on which URLs of relay servers are recorded, is attached to or embedded in the medium such as a post card. On the outer surface of the second RF-ID unit, (a) UID of the second RF-ID unit and (b) information for identifying a first URL of a certain relay server are printed to be displayed by a two-dimensional bar-code.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">At Step <b>164</b><i>b</i>, there is a camera capable of being connected to a main server. The camera has a first RF-ID unit on which a first URL of the main server is recorded. An image capturing unit in the camera optically reads the two-dimensional bar-code, and converts the readout information to information for identifying (a) the UID of a second RF-ID unit in the post card and (b) a second URL of a relay server.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">At Step <b>164</b><i>c</i>, the converted information is recorded onto a memory in the camera.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">At Step <b>164</b><i>d</i>, the camera selects a specific set of images from images captured by the camera, and stores the set of images into a specific first directory in the main server. At the same time, the camera uploads information of first directory (first directory information) as well as the first URL of the main server, a specific second directory in the relay server having the second URL. The camera uploads information for associating the UID of the second RF-ID unit with the second directory, to the relay server having the second URL. At Step <b>164</b><i>e</i>, the medium such as a post card is mailed to a specific person.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">At Step <b>164</b><i>f </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref>, the person receiving the post card moves the RF-ID unit of the post card into proximity of a RF-ID reader of a TV or the like. Thereby, the TV reads, from the RF-ID unit, the second URL of the relay server and the UID of the post card.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">At Step <b>164</b><i>g</i>, the TV accesses the relay server having the second URL. Then, the TV reads, from the relay server, (a) a program in the second directory associated with the UID and/or (b) the first URL and the first directory information of the main server on which specific image data is recorded. The TV downloads the image data from the main server. The TV displays the image data on a screen. In the above case, the image capturing unit in the image capturing device according to the first embodiment of the present invention reads information from the two-dimensional bar-code that is generally printed in a product or post card to record server information. Then, the image capturing device records the information read from the two-dimensional bar-code, as digital information, onto the second memory of the RF-ID unit. Thereby, the image capturing device allows a RF-ID reader of a TV to read the information. As a result, even a TV without an optical sensor for two-dimensional bar-codes can indirectly read information of two-dimensional bar-codes and automatically access a server or the like.</p>

Here, the image capturing device <b>1</b> is implemented as a camera which has the RF-ID unit <b>47</b> to perform proximity wireless communication with the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b>. The RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> is connected to the TV <b>45</b> by an infrared communication path. The camera includes the second antenna <b>21</b>, the data receiving unit <b>105</b>, the second memory <b>52</b>, and the data transfer unit <b>108</b>. The second antenna <b>21</b> is used for the proximity wireless communication. The data receiving unit <b>105</b> receives, via the second antenna <b>21</b>, an input signal provided from the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b>. The second memory <b>52</b> is a nonvolatile memory holding at least (a) the UID unit <b>75</b> that is identification information for identifying the image capturing device <b>1</b>, and (b) the operation program <b>116</b> that is to be executed by the TV <b>45</b> with reference to the UID unit <b>75</b>.

The following explains the above units in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">The RF-ID unit <b>47</b> in the image capturing device <b>1</b> has the second memory <b>52</b>. The second memory <b>52</b> holds the operation program <b>116</b>.

In more detail, the operation program <b>116</b> is an example of the program executed by the TV <b>45</b> with reference to the identification information of the image capturing device <b>1</b>. The operation program <b>116</b> is, for example, an execution program such as Java&#x2122; program, a virtual-machine script program such as Javascript&#x2122; program, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">The reproducing unit in the RF-ID unit <b>47</b> reads necessary information and the operation program <b>116</b> from the second memory <b>52</b>.

<p id="p-0248" num="0247">The RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> of the remote controller <b>827</b> receives the necessary information and the operation program from the RF-ID unit <b>47</b> of the image capturing device <b>1</b> and stores them into a RF-ID storage unit <b>6001</b>.</p>

The remote-controller signals, such as infrared signals, are widely used in communication for present remote controllers.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">To the TV <b>45</b>, a remote-controller signal transmission unit <b>6003</b> transmits the remote-controller signals including the operation program which are generated by the remote-controller signal generation unit <b>6002</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">A remote-controller signal receiving unit <b>6004</b> in the TV <b>45</b> receives the remote-controller signals from the remote controller <b>827</b>.

<p id="p-0253" num="0252">When the remote controller is moved into proximity of the image capturing device <b>1</b>, the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> of the remote controller provides power to the RF-ID unit <b>47</b> in the image capturing device <b>1</b> via RF-ID communication. Thereby, the UID <b>75</b> unique to the image capturing device <b>1</b>, the URL <b>48</b> of the image server (image server URL), and the operation program <b>116</b> are read from the second memory <b>52</b> (S<b>6001</b>). The readout UID, image server URL, and operation program are transmitted to the remote controller <b>827</b> via the data transfer unit <b>108</b> and the second antenna <b>21</b> (S<b>6002</b>). Here, as presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the operation program includes server connection instruction <b>6006</b>, download instruction <b>6008</b>, slide show display instruction <b>6010</b>, download-completion-time processing set instruction <b>6007</b>, and download-completion-time instruction <b>6009</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">The remote controller <b>827</b> receives the UID, the image server URL, and the operation program from the image capturing device <b>1</b> via the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> (S<b>6003</b>). A determination is made as to whether or not receiving is completed (S<b>6004</b>). If receiving is completed, then the UID, the image server URL, and the operation program are stored in the RF-ID storage unit <b>6001</b> (S<b>6005</b>). Then, the UID, the image server URL, and the operation program are converted to remote-controller signals transmittable by infrared ray (S<b>6006</b>). A determination is made as to whether or not the user performs a predetermined input operation by the remote controller <b>827</b> to instruct to transmit the remote-controller signals to the TV <b>45</b> (S<b>6007</b>). If the instruction is received by from user, then the remote-controller signal transmission unit <b>6003</b> transmits the remote-controller signals including the image server URL and the operation program to the TV <b>45</b> (S<b>6008</b>). In other words, serving as a common remote controller, the remote controller <b>827</b> serves also as a relay device that transfers the UID, the image server URL, and the operation program from the image capturing device <b>1</b> to the TV <b>45</b> by using the embedded RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">Next, the TV <b>45</b> receives the remote-controller signals from the remote controller <b>827</b> (S<b>6009</b>). The decryption unit <b>5504</b> in the TV <b>45</b> retrieves (decrypts) the UID, the image server URL, and the operation program from the remote-controller signals (S<b>6010</b>). Then, the program execution unit <b>6005</b> executes the operation program with reference to the image server URL (S<b>6011</b> to S<b>6015</b>). More specifically, by the operation program, connection between the TV <b>45</b> and the image server <b>42</b> on a communication network is established with reference to the image server URL (S<b>6012</b>, and <b>6006</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>). Then, with reference to the UID unique to a corresponding image capturing unit, image data captured by a specific image capturing unit is selected from the image data <b>50</b> stored in the storage device of the image server <b>42</b>, and the selected image data is downloaded to the TV <b>45</b> (S<b>6013</b>, and <b>6008</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>). In other words, the UID is used to select image data associated with the image capturing device <b>1</b> indicated by the UID, from among pieces of image data stored in the image server <b>42</b>. A determination is made as to whether or not the image download is completed (S<b>6014</b>). If the image download is completed, the downloaded images are sequentially displayed as a slide show (S<b>6015</b>, and <b>6007</b>, <b>6009</b>, and <b>6010</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>). The download-completion-time processing set instruction <b>6007</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is instruction for setting processing to be performed when image downloading is completed. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the download-completion-time processing set instruction <b>6007</b> instructs the download-completion-time instruction <b>6009</b> as the processing to be performed when image downloading is completed. Moreover, the download-completion-time instruction <b>6009</b> calls the slide show display instruction <b>6010</b> for performing a slide show of the images.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">It should be noted that, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</figref>, it has been described that the operation program and the necessary information for the operation program are transferred from the image capturing device <b>1</b> to the TV <b>45</b> via the remote controller <b>827</b>. However, the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> of the remote controller <b>827</b> may be provided to the TV <b>45</b>. In other words, the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> may be embedded in the TV <b>45</b>. Furthermore, the communication path connecting the reader (RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b>) to the apparatus may be a wireless communication path such as infrared communication path, or a wired signal cable.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">It should also be noted that, in the above-described execution example, the UID is used to select image data associated with the image capturing device <b>1</b> from among pieces of image data stored in the image server <b>42</b>. However, it is also possible to use the UID to identify the image server storing the image data. Here, it is assumed that, in a communication system including a plurality of image servers, UID is associated with an image server storing image data captured by an image capturing device identified by the UID. Under the assumption, if the operation program is created so that a URL of the image server can be identified with reference to the UID, the TV <b>45</b> executing the operation program can identify, by using the UID, the image server associated with the UID from the plurality of image servers and thereby download the image data from the identified image server.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">It should also be noted that the identification information for identifying the image capturing device <b>1</b> is not limited to UID. The identification information maybe any other information regarding the image capturing device <b>1</b>, such as a serial number, a product serial number, a Media Access Control (MAC) address, or information equivalent to the MAC address, for example, an Internet Protocol (IP) address. Moreover, if the image capturing device <b>1</b> serves as an access point on a wireless LAN, the identification information maybe a Service Set Identifier (SSID) or any information equivalent to SSID. It should also be noted that, in the above-described second memory <b>52</b>, the identification information (UID unit <b>75</b>) for identifying the image capturing device <b>1</b> has been described to be stored separately from the operation program <b>116</b>. However, the identification information may be stored (described) in the operation program <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">It should also be noted that the remote-controller signals (in other words, the communication path connecting the reader to the apparatus) are described to employ infrared ray. However, the remote-controller signals are limited to the above, but may employ a wireless communication method such as Bluetooth. The use of wireless communication that is generally speedier than infrared communication can shorten a time required to transfer an operation program and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">It should be noted that the operation program is not limited to the program in the format presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. The operation program may be described in any other programming language. For example, the operation program described in Java&#x2122; can be easily executed by various apparatuses (devices), because the program execution circumstances called JavaVM&#x2122; have broad versatility. The operation program may be described in a compact programming language in a script format represented by Javascript&#x2122; so as to be stored in a small storage capacity. The operation program in such a compact programming language can be stored in the RF-ID unit <b>47</b> in the second memory <b>52</b> even if the RF-ID unit <b>47</b> has a small storage capacity. Moreover, the operation program may be in an executable format applied with processing such as compiling, rather than a source code presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. The program can reduce a processing load on apparatuses having program execution environments.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">The following describes, in detail, the processing of changing execution of a program depending on information unique to a display device (such as the TV <b>45</b>) having a RF-ID reader, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">The TV <b>45</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> further includes a language code holding unit <b>6013</b>. When the operation program received as remote-controller signals is executed to connect the TV <b>45</b> to the server <b>42</b>, the program execution unit <b>6005</b> reads a language code from the language code holding unit <b>6013</b> to connect the TV <b>45</b> to the server <b>42</b> compliant to the language code. Then, the operation program is executed to download a server program from the server <b>42</b>, and executes the downloaded server program. For example, if the language code indicates Japanese language, the TV <b>45</b> is connected to the server <b>42</b> having a program storage unit <b>6011</b> in which a server program compliant to Japanese language is stored, and then the server program is obtained from the program storage unit <b>6011</b> to be executed in the TV <b>45</b>. More specifically, the operation program stored in the RF-ID unit <b>47</b> of the image capturing device <b>1</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> executes only connection to the server <b>42</b>, while other processing such as image display is executed by the server program downloaded from the server <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262">The steps in the above processing are described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. The processing by which the TV <b>45</b> receives the operation program and the necessary information for the operation program from the RF-ID unit <b>47</b> of the image capturing device <b>1</b> is the same as the processing described previously with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, it is assumed that the server specific information which the TV <b>45</b> receives as remote-controller signals includes two different server addresses which are (a) a sever address of a server <b>42</b> compliant to English and (a) a server address of a different server <b>42</b> compliant to Japanese. It is also assumed that the operation program which the TV receives as remote-controller signals includes instruction for connecting the TV <b>45</b> to a server indicated by the server connection instruction <b>6006</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">In the execution environments, the TV <b>45</b> obtains a language code of the TV <b>45</b> (S<b>6016</b>).

If the language code indicates Japanese language, then the TV <b>45</b> selects, from the server specific information, a sever address of a server having a program storage unit <b>6011</b> storing an operation program for processing compliant to Japanese (S<b>6018</b>). On the other hand, if the language code does not indicate Japanese language, then the TV <b>45</b> selects, from the server specific information, a server address of a server having a program storage unit <b>6011</b> storing an operation program for processing compliant to English (S<b>6019</b>). Next, the TV <b>45</b> is connected to the server <b>42</b> with reference to the selected server address (S<b>6021</b>). The TV <b>45</b> downloads a server program from the server <b>42</b> (S<b>6022</b>, S<b>6023</b>). The TV <b>45</b> executes the downloaded server program in the program execution environments (for example, a virtual machine) of the TV <b>45</b> (S<b>6024</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0264">It should be noted that the use of the language code has been described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref>, but the language code may be replaced by other information.

<p id="p-0266" num="0265"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> illustrates a configuration of a home network <b>6500</b> in which the image capturing device <b>1</b> and the TV <b>45</b> are connected to each other via a wireless LAN or Power Line Communication (PLC). When the image capturing device <b>1</b> has a direct communication unit <b>6501</b> and the TV <b>45</b> has a direct communication unit <b>6502</b> so that the image capturing device <b>1</b> and the TV <b>45</b> can communicate directly with each other via the wireless LAN, the image capturing device <b>1</b> can transmit images to the TV <b>45</b> without using the server on the Internet. In other words, the image capturing device <b>1</b> serves also as a server. In this case, however, some communication mediums such as the wireless LAN used in the home network <b>6500</b> is easily intercepted by others. Therefore, safe data communication requires mutual authentication and exchange of encrypted data. For example, for existing wireless-LAN terminals (devices), access points serve as authentication terminals. If such an existing terminal is to authenticate its communication party, the terminal displays all connectable access points on its screen. The user selects one of the displayed access points from the screen. Then, the user presses a Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) key to perform encrypted communication. However, the above processing bothers general users. In addition, if a wireless LAN is embedded in home appliances such as a TV, there are so many terminals with which the existing terminal can communicate with authentication. If the user lives in an apartment house, the user can communicate even with terminals in neighbors. As a result, it is difficult for the user to select a terminal to be authenticated. For instance, if a neighbor has a TV <b>6503</b> that is the same model of the user's TV <b>45</b>, the user has difficulty in distinguishing the TV <b>45</b> in the user's house from the TV <b>6503</b> based on the information displayed on the screen of the existing device.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">The first embodiment of the present invention can solve the above problem. In the first embodiment of the present invention, RF-ID is used to perform authentication. In more detail, an authentication program including a MAC address <b>58</b> is recorded, as an operation program, in the second memory <b>52</b> in the RF-ID unit <b>47</b> of the image capturing device <b>1</b>. When the image capturing device <b>1</b> is moved into proximity of the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> of the TV <b>45</b>, the image capturing device <b>1</b> provides the authentication program to the TV <b>45</b>. The authentication program includes not only the MAC address but also a cryptography key for authentication (hereinafter, &#x201c;authentication cryptography key&#x201d;) and an authentication command. When the TV <b>45</b> recognizes that the information provided from the RF-ID unit <b>47</b> includes the authentication command, the TV <b>45</b> performs authentication processing. The communication unit <b>171</b> in the RF-ID unit <b>47</b> cannot communicate with the TV <b>45</b>, until the image capturing device <b>1</b> is physically located in proximity of the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b>. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to intercept the communication between the image capturing device <b>1</b> and the TV <b>45</b> which is performed in a house. In addition, since the image capturing device <b>1</b> is moved into proximity of the TV <b>45</b> to exchange data, it is possible to prevent that the image capturing device <b>1</b> authenticates a wrong device (apparatus), such as the TV <b>6503</b> in a neighbor or a DVD recorder <b>6504</b> in the user's house.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">The following is an example of an authentication method without using RF-ID with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. A user inputs, to the TV <b>45</b>, (a) MAC addresses of terminals to be authenticated, such as the camera (the image capturing device <b>1</b>) and the DVD recorder <b>6504</b>, which the user intends to authenticate for communication, and (b) authentication cryptography keys <b>6511</b> for the terminals. The TV <b>45</b> receiving the inputs transmits an appropriate message called a challenge <b>6513</b>, to a target terminal having the MAC address. When the image capturing device <b>1</b> receives the challenge <b>6513</b>, the image capturing device <b>1</b> encrypts the challenge <b>6513</b> using the authentication cryptography key <b>6511</b>, and returns the encrypted challenge <b>6513</b> to the TV <b>45</b> that is a terminal from which the challenge <b>6513</b> has been provided. In receiving the encrypted challenge <b>6513</b>, the TV <b>45</b> decrypts the encrypted challenge <b>6513</b> using the authentication cryptography key <b>6511</b>. Thereby, the TV <b>45</b> can authenticate the authentication cryptography key <b>6511</b> to prevent user's error and intervention of other malicious users. Next, the TV <b>45</b> encrypts a cryptography key <b>6512</b><i>a </i>for data (hereinafter, a &#x201c;data cryptography key <b>6512</b><i>a</i>&#x201d;) using the authentication cryptography key <b>6511</b>. Then, the TV <b>45</b> transmits the encrypted data cryptography key <b>6512</b><i>a </i>to the image capturing device <b>1</b>. Thereby, it is possible to perform the encrypted data communication between the TV <b>45</b> and the image capturing device <b>1</b>. The TV <b>45</b> performs the above-described processing also with the DVD recorder <b>6504</b> and other apparatuses (terminals) <b>6505</b> and <b>6506</b> in order to share the data cryptography key <b>6512</b><i>a </i>among them. Thereby, the TV <b>45</b> can perform encrypted communication with all terminals (devices, apparatuses, or the like) connected in the home network.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">On the other hand, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> illustrates an authentication method using RF-ID. In the authentication method using RF-ID, the image capturing device <b>1</b> (camera) generates an authentication program <b>6521</b><i>a</i>. The camera provides the generated authentication program <b>6521</b><i>a </i>from the RF-ID unit <b>47</b> in the camera to a RF-ID unit <b>46</b> in the TV <b>45</b>. The authentication program <b>6521</b><i>a </i>includes an authentication command, a MAC address of the camera, and an authentication cryptography key <b>6511</b> for the camera. When the TV <b>45</b> receives the authentication program <b>6521</b><i>a </i>with the authentication command, the TV <b>45</b> retrieves the MAC address and the authentication cryptography key <b>6511</b> from the RF-ID unit <b>46</b>. The TV <b>45</b> encrypts a data cryptography key <b>6512</b><i>a </i>using the retrieved authentication cryptography key <b>6511</b> and transmits the encrypted data cryptography key <b>6512</b><i>a </i>to the retrieved MAC address. The transmission is performed by a wireless-LAN device (terminal). In the authentication method using RF-ID, the authentication is performed automatically without any user's input. Therefore, there is no problem caused by user's input errors. In addition, since the image capturing device <b>1</b> (camera) needs to moved into proximity of the TV <b>45</b>, it is possible to prevent intervention of other malicious users. This authentication method using RF-ID can eliminate pre-processing such as the above-described challenge. Moreover, the action of physically moving the image capturing device <b>1</b> (camera) into proximity of the TV <b>45</b> enables the user to easily recognize which terminals the camera has authenticated. Furthermore, if the authentication cryptography key <b>6511</b> is not included in the authentication program, the authentication may be performed by a technique of general public key authentication. In addition, the communication device (medium) is not limited to a wireless LAN, but may be any medium, such as PLC or Ethernet&#x2122; included in the home network. Moreover, the MAC address may be any identification information for uniquely identifying a communication terminal in the home network.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> illustrates an authentication method using RF-ID when it is difficult to move a terminal into proximity of another terminal. For example, when the terminals are a refrigerator and a TV which are difficult to move, it is almost impossible to directly exchange an authentication program between the terminals using RF-ID. In such a situation, the first embodiment of the present invention can be implemented by relaying the authentication program between the terminals using a device (such as a remote controller <b>6531</b>) that is an accessory of the terminal. In more detail, a RF-ID reader/writer embedded in the remote controller <b>6531</b> reads the authentication program from a RF-ID unit in the refrigerator. Thereby, the authentication program is stored in a memory in the remote controller <b>6531</b>. A user moves the remote controller <b>6531</b> that is mobile. When the remote controller <b>6531</b> is moved into proximity of the TV <b>45</b>, the remote controller <b>6531</b> transfers the authentication program from the memory of the remote controller <b>6531</b>, to the RF-ID unit of the TV <b>45</b>. It should be noted that the transfer from the remote controller <b>6531</b> to the TV <b>45</b> is not limited to use RF-ID technology. Other communication means, such as infrared ray or ZigBee, that is previously set in the remote controller <b>6531</b> can be used. Any medium for which security in communication has already been established may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> is a flowchart of authentication performed by the camera (image capturing device <b>1</b>) side. In an authentication mode, the camera generates an authentication cryptography key and sets a timer (S<b>6541</b>). The camera writes a MAC address of the camera, the generated authentication cryptography key, and an authentication command, into a memory in the RF-ID unit (S<b>6542</b>). When the user moves the camera to bring the RF-ID unit of the camera into proximity of the RF-ID unit of the TV, the camera transfers the information stored in the memory of the RF-ID unit of the camera to the RF-ID unit of the TV (S<b>6543</b>). The camera determines whether or not a response of the transfer is received from the TV within a predetermined time period counted by the timer (S<b>6544</b>). If the response is received within the predetermined time period, then the camera decrypts, by using the authentication cryptography key, encrypted data cryptography key included in the response (S<b>6545</b>). The camera starts communicating with the other device (apparatus) using the data cryptography key (S<b>6546</b>). The camera determines whether or not data communication with the TV is successful (S<b>6547</b>). If the data communication is successful, then the authentication is completed. On the other hand, if data cannot be correctly decrypted (in other words, data communication is not successful), then a notification of authentication error is displayed and the authentication is terminated (S<b>6548</b>). Referring back to Step S<b>6544</b>, if there is no response within the predetermined time period, then the camera cancels the authentication mode (S<b>6549</b>) and then displays a notification of time out error (S<b>6550</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> is a flowchart of authentication performed by the TV <b>45</b> side. The TV <b>45</b> determines whether or not received information, which is provided from the RF-ID unit of the camera to the RF-ID unit of the TV <b>45</b>, includes an authentication command (S<b>6560</b>). If the received information does not include the authentication command, then the TV <b>45</b> performs other processing according to the received information (S<b>6561</b>). On the other hand, if the received information includes the authentication command, the TV <b>45</b> determines that the information received from the RF-ID unit of the camera is an authentication program, and therefore encrypts a data cryptography key in the TV <b>45</b> using an authentication cryptography key in the authentication program (S<b>6562</b>). Then, the TV <b>45</b> transmits the encrypted data cryptography key to the terminal (the camera) having the MAC address designated in the authentication program (S<b>6563</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">Next, the following situation is described in detail with reference to figures. Here, the image capturing device <b>1</b> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> generates or updates a program executable by the TV <b>45</b>. Then, the image capturing device <b>1</b> transmits the program to the TV <b>45</b> via the data transmission unit <b>173</b>. Thereby, the TV <b>45</b> executes the program.</p>

From the above pieces of information, the URL generation unit <b>7004</b> generates a URL that is an address of the server <b>42</b> to which images have been uploaded from the image capturing device <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">The UID <b>75</b> is identification information for identifying the image capturing device <b>1</b>. The UID <b>75</b> is unique to each image capturing device <b>1</b>. The URL generated by the URL generation unit <b>7004</b> includes UID. For instance, the image server <b>42</b>, to which images are uploaded, has an image file in a directory unique to each UID. Thereby, a URL address can be generated for each image capturing device <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">The server specific information <b>48</b> is a server name for identifying the server to which the images are uploaded. Via a Domain Name Server (DNS), an IP address of the server <b>42</b> is determined to connect the image capturing device <b>1</b> to the server <b>42</b>. Therefore, the server specific information <b>48</b> is included in the generated URL.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">The image display method instruction information <b>77</b> is information for enabling the user to optionally select the list display <b>78</b>, the slide show display <b>79</b>, or the like.

In other words, since the generated URL includes information indicating the list display <b>78</b> or the slide show display <b>79</b>, the image server (the server <b>42</b>) can determine based on the URL whether the images are to be displayed as the list display or the slide show display.</p>

<p id="p-0281" num="0280">The program generation unit <b>7005</b> generates a program executable by the TV <b>45</b>, based on (a) the URI generated by the URL generation unit <b>7004</b>, and (b) forced display instruction <b>7000</b>, forced print instruction <b>136</b>, and format identification information <b>7001</b> stored in the second memory <b>52</b>. It should be noted that the program generation unit <b>7005</b> can generate a new operation program based on the above-described information, which is a method of generating a new operation program.

<p id="p-0282" num="0281">The program generated by the program generation unit <b>7005</b> is executable by the TV <b>45</b>. The program should be compiled into a machine language used in a system controller (not shown) of the TV <b>45</b>, so that the system controller can execute the program.

<p id="p-0283" num="0282">However, the above-described compiler is not necessary if the program in a text format (script) (for example, a general Java&#x2122; script) is executed by a browser in the TV <b>45</b>.</p>

If the slide show <b>79</b> is selected, then the program generation unit <b>7005</b> generates a slide show command for causing the TV <b>45</b> to display a slide show of the image file stored in the server <b>42</b> (S<b>7012</b>). The generated slide show command is added to the program (S<b>7013</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0302">As described above, based on the information set in the second memory <b>52</b>, the program generation unit <b>7005</b> in the image capturing device <b>1</b> generates a program used to display images on the TV <b>45</b>, by using an instruction command set that is stored in the program part storage unit <b>7006</b> to generate the program.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0303">It should be noted that, in the first embodiment, there are commands for the forced display instruction, the forced print instruction, the list display, and the slide show display. However, the commands (programs) are not limited to the above. For example, if a command for the forced display instruction is to be generated as a program, the program generation unit <b>7005</b> can also generate a determination command for determining whether or not the apparatus (device) executing the program has a display device or display function, and adds the generated determination command to the program. Thereby, the command for the forced display instruction is executed only if the apparatus executing the program has a display device or display function. As a result, the determination command can prevent confusion in the apparatus executing the program. The same goes for a command for the forced print instruction. It is preferable that the program generation unit <b>7005</b> also generates a determination command for determining whether or not the apparatus executing the program has or is connected to a printing function, and adds the generated determination command to the program. Thereby, the command for the forced print instruction is executed only if the apparatus executing the program has or is connected to a printing function.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0304">The following describes execution of the program generated or updated by the program generation unit <b>7005</b> in the image capturing device <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0305"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> is a flowchart of execution of the program generated or updated by the program generation unit <b>7005</b>. The program is transmitted from the image capturing device <b>1</b> to a device (apparatus) different from the image capturing device <b>1</b> via the second antenna <b>21</b> of the image capturing device <b>1</b>. Then, the program is executed by the different device. In the first embodiment, the different device is the TV <b>45</b>. The TV <b>45</b> receives the program via the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> and executes the received program by a controller or virtual machine (not shown) in the TV <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0306">First, the program is executed to read the language code set in the TV <b>45</b>, as unique information of the TV <b>45</b> (S<b>7020</b>). The language code is predetermined by the user to be used in displaying a menu and the like on the TV <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0307">Next, the program is executed to determine a language indicated in the language code. First, a determination is made as to whether or not the language code indicates Japanese language (S<b>7021</b>). If the determination is made that the language code indicates Japanese language, then a connection command for a Japanese site is selected from the connection commands in the program (S<b>7022</b>). On the other hand, if the determination is made that the language code does not indicate Japanese language, then a connection command for an English site is selected from the connection commands in the program (S<b>7023</b>). It should be noted that it has been described in the first embodiment that a determination is made as to whether or not the language code indicates Japanese language, and thereby a connection command is selected from the connection command for connecting to a Japanese site and the connection command for connecting to an English command. However, it is also possible that the program includes a plurality of connection programs compliant to various language codes. Thereby, the program can be compliant to two or more language codes. As a result, usability is improved. Next, according to the selected connection command, the program is executed to connect the TV <b>45</b> to the URL indicted in the connection command (S<b>7024</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0308">Then, a determination is made as to whether or not the connection to the URL indicted in the connection command is successful (S<b>7025</b>). If the connection is failed, then the display unit of the TV <b>45</b> displays warning indicating the connection failure (S<b>7027</b>). On the other hand, if the connection is successful, then a command for displaying a slide show of an image file stored in the server is executed to display the slide show (S<b>7026</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0309">It should be noted that the above is the situation where the operation program is for displaying images as a slide show. However, the operation program is not limited to the above. The program may be used for performing list display, forced display, or forced printing. If the operation program is for forced display, a step (command) of automatically changing setting of the TV <b>45</b> to setting of displaying an image file stored in the server is added to the program. Thereby, the user does not need to change the setting of the TV <b>45</b> by manual in order to display images provided from the image server. In the case of the forced printing, a command for automatically changing setting of the TV <b>45</b> to a printable mode is added to the program. Moreover, in the case of each of the forced printing and forced display, a determination command for determining whether or not the TV <b>45</b> has a printing function or a displaying function is added to the program. Thereby, the forced print command is not executed in an apparatus (device) without a printing function. Furthermore, the operation program in the first embodiment of the present invention may be a connection program for leading other programs. For example, the operation program may be a loader program, such as a boot-loader for loading other programs to be executed.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0310">As described above, the first embodiment of the present invention is characterized in that the program generation unit <b>7005</b> is included in the first processing unit <b>35</b> of the image capturing device <b>1</b> that is a device having RF-ID communication means (such as the data transfer unit <b>108</b> and the second antenna <b>21</b>). It is also characterized in that the program generated or updated by the program generation unit <b>7005</b> is executed by a different device (apparatus) except the image capturing device <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment of the present invention that is a communication device having RF-ID.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0311">Conventionally, a device having RF-ID needs to transfer ID information (tag information), which the device has, from a RF-ID communication unit to another device (for example, the TV <b>45</b> according to the first embodiment of the present invention). The device (apparatus) receiving the ID information should previously hold operation programs each unique to a corresponding device having RF-ID. Therefore, if new products having RF-ID technology appear, the receiving device needs to install an operation program corresponding to the new products and execute the program. Otherwise, the receiving device is excluded as not being compliant to the new products. The installation of operation programs requires technical knowledge. Not everyone can perform the installation. Therefore, if various new devices having RF-ID are produced, other devices such as the TV <b>45</b> of the first embodiment of the present invention become obsolete. As a result, property values of user's devices are damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0312">According to the disclosure of the first embodiment of the present invention, the device having RF-ID technology has the program generation unit <b>7005</b> and sends not ID information (tag information) but a program to another device (apparatus) such as the TV <b>45</b>. The apparatus such as the TV <b>45</b> receives and executes the program. Therefore, the receiving apparatus does not need to previously have operation programs for various devices having RF-ID. Even if a new device having RF-ID technology appears, the receiving apparatus does not need to install a new program for the device. Therefore, usability is significantly improved.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0313">Therefore, the terminal such as a TV does not need to previously have application programs for respective items, kinds, or application systems of various objects having RF-ID. Thereby, the terminal such as a TV does not need to previously have a storage device, either, for holding various application programs. In addition, maintenance such as version-up of the programs in the terminal is not necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0314">The program generated by the program generation unit <b>7005</b> is useful if it is executable in any execution platforms such as a Java&#x2122; language. Therefore, if the device (apparatus) such as the TV <b>45</b> executing programs has a Java&#x2122; virtual machine, programs generated by any devices (apparatuses) can be executed.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0315">It should be noted that the program generation unit <b>7005</b> according to the first embodiment of the present invention may has a function of updating the program previously stored in the program storage unit <b>7003</b> of the second memory <b>52</b>. The situation of updating a program produces the same advantages as that in the situation of generating a program. The generating or updating performed by the program generation unit <b>7005</b> may be generating or updating data used in executing a program by the TV <b>45</b>. In general, the program includes additional initialization setting data. The additional data is used to switch an execution mode or to set a flag. Therefore, generating or updating of the additional data is equivalent to generating or updating of the program, without deviating from the inventive concepts of the present invention. This is because, for execution of a program, it depends on design whether a parameter for mode switching or the like is to be hold and read as data, or is to be included in the program to be executed. Therefore, when the program generation unit <b>7005</b> according to the first embodiment of the present invention generates or updates a program, the program generation unit <b>7005</b> can also generate data such a parameter sequence used by the program. The parameter is generated based on the forced display instruction <b>7000</b>, the forced print instruction <b>136</b>, the image display method instruction information <b>77</b>, the format identification information <b>7001</b>, or the like stored in the second memory <b>52</b>.</p>

The use status detection unit detects a trouble related to operation, a power consumption status, or the like. The image capturing device <b>1</b> generates a program for displaying the result of the detection (use status) on the TV <b>45</b> that is a device (apparatus) different from the image capturing device <b>1</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0322" num="0321">The camera ID <b>135</b> includes a product serial number, a manufacturing year/month/date, a manufacturer, a manufacturing line, a manufactured location, and the like of the image capturing device <b>1</b>. The camera ID <b>135</b> also includes camera model information for identifying a model of the image capturing device <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0322">The first processing unit <b>35</b> includes the second memory reading unit <b>7003</b>, a use status detection unit <b>7020</b>, the program generation unit <b>7005</b>, the program part storage unit <b>7006</b>, and the program writing unit <b>7007</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0323">The second memory reading unit <b>7003</b> reads information from the second memory <b>52</b> via the recording/reproducing unit <b>51</b>. In the first embodiment of the present invention, the second memory reading unit <b>7003</b> reads the UID <b>75</b>, the server specific information <b>48</b>, and the camera ID <b>135</b> from the second memory <b>52</b>, and provides the pieces of information to the program generation unit <b>7005</b>. Reading of the pieces of information from the second memory <b>52</b> is performed when a readout signal is provided from a use status detection unit <b>7020</b> that is described later.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0324">The use status detection unit <b>7020</b> detects a use status of each unit included in the image capturing device <b>1</b>. The use status detection unit <b>7020</b> includes sensors each detecting a trouble in operation of a corresponding unit included in the image capturing device <b>1</b>. Results of the detection of the sensors in respective units are provided to the use status detection unit <b>7020</b>. The sensors for the respective units provide the use status detection unit <b>7020</b> with trouble information, battery duration, a power consumption amount, and the like. For example, the image capturing unit <b>30</b> provides the use status detection unit <b>7020</b> with information indicating whether or not an image capturing operation of the image capturing unit <b>30</b> has any trouble (whether or not the image capturing unit <b>30</b> functions correctly, and whether or not the image capturing unit <b>30</b> responds to a call from the use status detection unit <b>7020</b>). The video processing unit <b>31</b> provides the use status detection unit <b>7020</b> with information indicating whether or not data processing for image data captured by the image capturing unit <b>30</b> has any trouble (whether or not the video processing unit <b>31</b> functions correctly, and whether or not the video processing unit <b>31</b> responds to a call from the use status detection unit <b>7020</b>). The first power supply unit <b>101</b> provides the use status detection unit <b>7020</b> with a voltage level of the battery and a total power consumption amount. The communication unit <b>37</b> provides the use status detection unit <b>7020</b> with information indicating whether or not the communication unit <b>37</b> is successfully connected to the server or the Internet (whether or not the communication unit <b>37</b> functions correctly, and whether or not the communication unit <b>37</b> responds to a call from the use status detection unit <b>7020</b>).

Based on the above pieces of status information provided regarding the respective units, the internal trouble detection unit <b>7021</b> in the use status detection unit <b>7020</b> determines whether or not each of the units has any trouble in its functional operation. If there is a trouble, then the use status detection unit <b>7020</b> provides the program generation unit <b>7005</b> with information for specifying the trouble. The use status detection unit <b>7020</b> has a power consumption detection unit <b>7022</b>. The power consumption detection unit <b>7022</b> generates power consumption information based on the total power consumption information provided form the power supply unit, and then provides the power consumption information to the program generation unit <b>7005</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0325">The program generation unit <b>7005</b> generates a program for displaying, on the TV <b>45</b>, the information for specifying a trouble or the power consumption information which is provided from the use state detection unit <b>7020</b>. For generation of a program, instruction sets to be included in the program are previously stored in the program part storage unit <b>7006</b>. Therefore, the program generation unit <b>7005</b> generates (a) a display command (&#x201c;display&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>) for displaying a trouble or a power consumption amount, and (b) a program for displaying information for specifying a location of the trouble and information for specifying the trouble in detail.

The program is transmitted to the TV <b>45</b> that displays the trouble information or the use status information of the image capturing device <b>1</b>. Thereby, the TV <b>45</b> can present the trouble information or the use status information to the user, without installing a plurality of programs compliant to various devices including the image capturing device <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0330">In conventional systems, each of devices such as an image capturing device, a camcorder, an electric toothbrush, and a weight scale is provided with a simple display function such as a liquid crystal device, so as to display the trouble information or the use status information on the corresponding display function. Therefore, the display function has a low display capability for merely displaying the trouble information as a symbol sequence or an error code. When the trouble information is presented, the user needs to read instruction manual to check what kind of trouble it is. Some users have lost instruction manual and therefore obtain more information from a website on the Internet.</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0331">In the system according to the first embodiment of the present invention, however, a program for displaying trouble information can be executed by the TV <b>45</b> not by the image capturing device <b>1</b>.

In the third situation, the program generated by the image capturing device <b>1</b> is transmitted indirectly to the TV <b>45</b> via the remote controller (with display function) <b>6520</b>, and executed by the TV <b>45</b>. In the fourth situation, the program generated by the image capturing device <b>1</b> is transmitted to the remote controller (with display function) <b>6520</b>, and executed by the remote controller (with display function) <b>6520</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0339">The first situation has been already described above in the first embodiment. Therefore, the first situation is not described again below.</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0340">The following describes the above second to fourth situations.</p>

<p id="p-0351" num="0350">Next, a determination is made as to whether or not the remote controller <b>6520</b> has a display function (S<b>6602</b>). If the remote controller <b>6520</b> does not have any display function (N at S<b>6602</b>), then the program is transmitted to the TV <b>45</b> via the transmission unit <b>6521</b> and then the processing is completed. In this situation, the program is executed by the TV <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0351">If the remote controller <b>6520</b> has a display function (Y at S<b>6602</b>), then a further determination is made as to whether or not the remote controller <b>6520</b> is paired with the TV <b>45</b> that is a transmission destination (S<b>6603</b>). If the remote controller <b>6520</b> is not paired with the TV <b>45</b> (N at S<b>6603</b>), then a rest processing of the program is executed by the display unit <b>6523</b> of the remote controller <b>6520</b>. On the other hand, if the remote controller <b>6520</b> is paired with the TV <b>45</b> (Y at S<b>6603</b>), then the display unit <b>6523</b> displays a dialog message &#x201c;Display on TV or on Remote Controller?&#x201d; to encourage the user to select one of the options (S<b>6604</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0352">Then, the remote controller <b>6520</b> receives user's entry by the input unit <b>6524</b> (S<b>6605</b>). A determination is made as to whether or the user selects to display data on the TV <b>45</b> (S<b>6606</b>). If the user selects the TV <b>45</b> to display data (Y at S<b>6606</b>), then the program is transmitted to the TV <b>45</b> via the transmission unit <b>6521</b> and thereby the processing is completed. In this situation, the program is executed by the TV <b>45</b>. On the other hand, if the user selects the remote controller to display data (N at S<b>6606</b>), then a rest processing of the program is executed by the remote controller <b>6520</b> using the display unit <b>6523</b> (S<b>6607</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0353">It should be noted that the &#x201c;rest processing of the program&#x201d; refers to displaying of a status of a battery, a trouble status, or an instruction manual regarding the image capturing device <b>1</b>, but, of course, not limited to those described in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0355" num="0354">With the above structure, a program generated by the image capturing device <b>1</b> is transmitted to the remote controller with display function, then a capability of the remote controller with display function is examined, and a determination is made by the remote controller as to which apparatus (device) is to execute rest processing of the program. Thereby, the remote controller does not need to previously install various programs compliant to a plurality of apparatuses. The user can execute the program in his/her preferred manner.</p>
<p id="p-0356" num="0355">It should be noted that it has been described in the first embodiment that the determination is made based on whether or not the remote controller has a display function and based on a pairing status of the remote controller. However, it is not limited to the above. A program may execute any determination based on a capability of the apparatus, such as a communication capability, an audio-video reproduction capability, a capability of an input unit, a capability of an output device, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0356">It should also be noted that it has been described in the first embodiment that the remote controller (without display function) <b>6530</b> transmits information to the TV <b>45</b> every time one RF-ID (the image capturing device <b>1</b> in this example) is read out. However, the remote controller (without display function) <b>6530</b> may read two or more pieces of RF-ID and then transmit all of them to the TV <b>45</b> at once. This makes it possible, for example, that the remote controller obtains pieces of information sequentially from a RF-ID-attached heat rate meter and also sequentially from RF-ID-attached Pedometer&#x2122;, and then transmits the pieces of information to the TV <b>45</b>. Therefore, the TV <b>45</b> can display a single graph of a history of steps versus a history of a heart rate. If the heat rate meter and the Pedometer&#x2122; store programs individually, a program to be executed by the TV <b>45</b> may be set to be a program stored in an apparatus (device) from which information is read last time, or may be selected by a user. Or, the user may select a device executed by the program. Of course, the remote controller (with display function) <b>6520</b> may also read two or more pieces of RF-ID and then display all of them on the display unit of the remote controller <b>6520</b> at once.</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0357">As described above, the storage region of the RF-ID unit holds not only information but also a program describing operations of an apparatus (device). This considerably simplify changing or updating of a program, which has been necessary for conventional techniques to change operations of apparatuses. In addition, it is possible to deal with addition of various new functions and an increase of cooperative apparatuses. Moreover, proximity communication using RF-ID technology is a simple operation achieved by simply bringing a device into proximity of an apparatus, which the user can easily understand. Therefore, conventional bothersome device operations by using buttons and a menu are simplified. As a result, the complicated device operations are changed to be convenient.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0359" num="0358">The following describes the second embodiment of the present invention. In the second embodiment, actual operations of the communication system are described. In the communication system, images captured by a camera are uploaded to a server, and then downloaded by a simple operation to a TV to be displayed. The whole configuration of the communication system according to the second embodiment is the same as that of the communication system according to the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0360" num="0359"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40A to 40E</figref> are flowcharts of processing performed by a camera (the image capturing device <b>1</b>) to upload photographs (images). First, the camera captures images (Step S<b>5101</b>). Then, the captured images are stored into the third memory (Step S<b>5102</b>). Then, the camera updates information stored in the second memory (Step S<b>5103</b>). The second memory updating process will be described later. Next, the camera determines whether or not the communication unit is connectable to the Internet (Step S<b>5104</b>). If connectable, then the camera generates a URL (Step S<b>5105</b>). The URL generation process will be described in more detail later. After generating the URL, the camera uploads the captured images (Step S<b>5106</b>). In completing the uploading process, the camera disconnects the communication unit from the Internet (Step S<b>5107</b>). As a result, the processing is completed. The uploading process will be described in more detail later.</p>
<p id="p-0361" num="0360">The second memory updating process of Step S<b>5103</b> enables the server <b>42</b> and the camera to share identification information for distinguishing photographs that have already been uploaded to the server <b>42</b> from photographs that have not yet been uploaded to the server <b>42</b>. Examples of the uploading process at Step S<b>5106</b> are given as following cases <b>1</b> to <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0362" num="0361">In case <b>1</b>, the final capturing time (final capturing date/time) <b>68</b> is previously stored in the second memory, and then updated after the captured images are stored into the third memory (Step S<b>5111</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0363" num="0362">Comparison of a time of uploading the captured images to the final capturing time <b>68</b> of the camera allows the server <b>42</b> and the camera to share identification information of the uploaded photographs.</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0363">In case <b>2</b>, the above advantages can be produced also by generating existence identifiers <b>64</b> of images not yet been uploaded to the server <b>42</b>, with reference to images uploaded to the server <b>42</b> among the captured images, and storing the generated existence identifiers <b>64</b> into the second memory (Step S<b>5121</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0365" num="0364">In case <b>3</b>, it is also possible that the not-yet-uploaded image information hashed information <b>67</b> is stored in the second memory (Step S<b>5131</b>). Thereby, an amount of the information stored in the second memory is reduced, thereby saving a capacity of the second memory.</p>
<p id="p-0366" num="0365">In case <b>4</b>, it is further possible that image serial numbers are chronologically generated for captured images, and thereby the final image serial number <b>69</b> in the second memory is updated (Step S<b>5141</b>). Thereby, even if a time counted by the camera is not correct, it is possible to synchronize information of uploaded photographs between the server <b>42</b> and the camera.</p>
<p id="p-0367" num="0366"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref> depicts details of the URL generation process at Step S<b>5105</b>. The camera reads, from the second memory, the server specific information <b>48</b> including the server address information <b>81</b>, the login ID <b>83</b>, and the password <b>84</b> (Step S<b>5201</b>). Based on the server specific information <b>48</b>, the camera generates a URL (Step S<b>5202</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0367"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42A to 42D</figref> depict details of the uploading process at Step S<b>5106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0369" num="0368">The cases <b>1</b> to <b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42A to 42D</figref> correspond to the above-described cases <b>1</b> to <b>4</b> of the second memory updating process in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40B to 40E</figref>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0370" num="0369">In case <b>1</b>, the camera receives, from the server <b>42</b>, a final upload time (final upload date/time) that is a time of finally uploading to the server <b>42</b> (Step S<b>5211</b>). Then, the camera compares the final upload time to the final capturing time (Step S<b>5212</b>). If the final capturing time is later than the final upload time (in other words, if there is any image captured after final uploading), then the camera uploads, to the server <b>42</b>, any images captured after the final upload time (Step S<b>5213</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0371" num="0370">In case <b>2</b>, the camera checks not-yet-uploaded image data existence identifiers <b>64</b> in the second memory (Step S<b>5231</b>). Thereby, the camera determines whether or not there is any image not yet been uploaded (Step S<b>5232</b>). If there is any image not yet been uploaded, then the camera uploads images not yet been uploaded, to the server <b>42</b> (Step S<b>5233</b>). Then, the camera updates the uploaded-image information <b>61</b> in the second memory (Step S<b>5234</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0372" num="0371">In case <b>3</b>, the camera checks the not-yet-uploaded image information hashed information <b>67</b> in the second memory (Step S<b>5301</b>). Thereby, the camera determines whether or not the not-yet-uploaded image information hashed information <b>67</b> in the second memory is the same as hashed information that is generated by hashing NULL (Step S<b>5302</b>). If the not-yet-uploaded image information hashed information <b>67</b> is not the same as the hashed information regarding NULL, then the camera determines that there is an image not yet been uploaded to the server <b>42</b> and therefore uploads, to the server <b>42</b>, any images that are stored in the third memory but have not yet been uploaded to the server <b>42</b> (Step S<b>5303</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0373" num="0372">In case <b>4</b>, the camera receives, from the server <b>42</b>, an image serial number of a finally uploaded image (Step S<b>5311</b>). Then, the camera determines whether or not the image serial number matches the final image serial number <b>69</b> in the second memory (Step S<b>5312</b>). If the image serial number does not match the final image serial number <b>69</b>, then the camera uploads any images having UIDs that are newer than UID of the final image serial number <b>69</b> that is received from the server <b>42</b> (Step S<b>5313</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0374" num="0373"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref> is a flowchart of RF-ID proximity communication between the image capturing device <b>1</b> and the TV <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0375" num="0374">First, the second antenna <b>21</b> embedded in the image capturing device <b>1</b> receives weak radio power from polling of the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> of the TV <b>45</b>, and thereby activates the RF-ID unit <b>47</b> operated under the second power supply unit <b>91</b> (S<b>5401</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0376" num="0375">The RF-ID unit <b>47</b> of the image capturing device <b>1</b>, which is activated by receiving weak power at Step S<b>5401</b>, responds to the polling of the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> of the TV <b>45</b> (Step S<b>5402</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0377" num="0376">After responding to the polling at Step S<b>5402</b>, mutual authentication is performed to determine whether or not the RF-ID unit <b>47</b> of the image capturing device <b>1</b> and the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> of the TV <b>45</b> are legitimate devices, and also to share a cryptography key used for secure information communication between the image capturing device <b>1</b> and the TV <b>45</b> (Step S<b>5403</b>). The mutual authentication employs a public key cryptography algorism such as elliptic curve cryptography. In general, the employed method for the mutual authentication is the same as that of mutual authentication used in communication via High Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) or IEEE1394.</p>
<p id="p-0378" num="0377">As described earlier, at Step S<b>5403</b>, the mutual authentication is performed between the RF-ID unit <b>47</b> of the image capturing device <b>1</b> and the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> of the TV <b>45</b> to generate a common cryptography key. After that, the server URL generation information <b>80</b> is read from the server specific information <b>48</b> stored in the second memory <b>52</b> readable from the RF-ID unit <b>47</b>. The server URL generation information <b>80</b> is transmitted to the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> of the TV <b>45</b> via the second antenna <b>21</b> (Step S<b>5404</b>). The server URL generation information <b>80</b> includes: the server address information <b>81</b> indicating address information of the server <b>42</b>; the user identification information <b>82</b> that is the login ID <b>83</b> to the server <b>42</b>; and the password <b>84</b> that is a login password to the server <b>42</b>. The password <b>84</b> is important information for preventing unauthorized acts of a malicious third person. Therefore, the password <b>84</b> is sometimes encrypted beforehand as the encrypted password <b>85</b> to be stored, and then transmitted to the TV <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0379" num="0378">After the server URL generation information <b>80</b> is transmitted to the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> of the TV <b>45</b> at Step S<b>5404</b>, the captured image state information <b>55</b> stored in the second memory <b>52</b> is also transmitted to the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> of the TV <b>45</b> via the second antenna <b>21</b> (Step S<b>5405</b>). The captured image state information <b>55</b> is: the final capturing time <b>68</b> (case <b>1</b>); the existence identifiers <b>64</b> which are existence identification information regarding images not yet been uploaded and each of which is assigned to a corresponding one of the captured images so that it is possible to determine whether the image has not yet been uploaded (case <b>2</b>); the not-yet-uploaded image information hashed information <b>67</b> (case <b>3</b>); or the final image serial number <b>69</b> from among image serial numbers chronologically assigned to captured images (case <b>4</b>). The captured image state information <b>55</b> is important for examining synchronization between captured images in the image capturing device <b>1</b> and captured images in the server <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0380" num="0379">In case <b>1</b>, the final capturing time <b>68</b> is used as the captured image state information <b>55</b>. Therefore, the TV <b>45</b> compares the final capturing time <b>68</b> to the final upload time. If the final capturing time <b>68</b> is temporally later than the final upload time that is a time of finally uploading to the server <b>42</b>, then it is determined that the image data in the image capturing device <b>1</b> is not in synchronization with the image data in the server <b>42</b>. Therefore, warning information regarding the synchronization failure is displayed on the display unit of the TV <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0381" num="0380">In case <b>2</b>, the captured image state information <b>55</b> is the existence identifiers <b>64</b> each of which is assigned to a corresponding one of the captured images so that it is possible to determine whether the image has not yet been uploaded. Therefore, the TV <b>45</b> examines the existence identifiers <b>64</b> to determine whether or not there is any image not yet been uploaded. If there is any image not yet been uploaded, then it is determined that the image data in the image capturing device <b>1</b> is not in synchronization with the image data in the server <b>42</b>. Therefore, warning information regarding the synchronization failure is displayed on the display unit of the TV <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0382" num="0381">In case <b>3</b>, the not-yet-uploaded image information hashed information <b>67</b> is employed as the captured image state information <b>55</b>. Therefore, the TV <b>45</b> examines the not-yet-uploaded image information hashed information <b>67</b> to determine whether or not there is any image not yet been uploaded. If there is any image not yet been uploaded, then it is determined that the image data in the image capturing device <b>1</b> is not in synchronization with the image data in the server <b>42</b>. Therefore, warning information regarding the synchronization failure is displayed on the display unit of the TV <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0383" num="0382">In case <b>4</b>, the captured image state information <b>55</b> is the final image serial number <b>69</b> from among image serial numbers chronologically assigned to the captured images. Therefore, the TV <b>45</b> compares (a) the final image serial number <b>69</b> from among image serial numbers chronologically assigned to the captured images to (b) an image serial number of an image finally uploaded to the server <b>42</b>. Here, the final image serial number <b>69</b> is provided from the image capturing device <b>1</b>, while the image serial number is provided from the server <b>42</b>. Based on the comparison, the TV <b>45</b> can determine whether or not there is any image not yet been uploaded. If there is any image not yet been uploaded, then it is determined that the image data in the image capturing device <b>1</b> is not in synchronization with the image data in the server <b>42</b>. Therefore, warning information regarding the synchronization failure is displayed on the display unit of the TV <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0384" num="0383">After transmitting the captured image state information <b>55</b> from the second antenna <b>21</b> of the image capturing device <b>1</b> to the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> of the TV <b>45</b> at Step S<b>5405</b>, the image display method instruction information <b>77</b> is also transmitted from the second memory <b>52</b> of the image capturing device <b>1</b> to the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> of the TV <b>45</b> via the second antenna <b>21</b> (Step S<b>5406</b>). The image display method instruction information <b>77</b> is identification information indicating how the display unit of the TV <b>45</b> is to display the images downloaded from the server <b>42</b>. The image display method instruction information <b>77</b> includes the list display (indicator) <b>78</b> indicating that the images are to be displayed in a list, and the slide show (indicator) <b>79</b> indicating that the images are to be displayed as a slide show.</p>
<p id="p-0385" num="0384">As described above, at Steps S<b>5401</b> to S<b>5406</b>, the image capturing device <b>1</b> transmits the server URL generation information <b>80</b>, the captured image state information <b>55</b>, and the image display method instruction information <b>77</b>, which are stored in the second memory <b>52</b> of the image capturing device <b>1</b>, from the second antenna <b>21</b> of the image capturing device <b>1</b> to the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> of the TV <b>45</b>. Here, it is desirable to encrypt all of the above pieces of information to be transmitted, by using the cryptography key information shared between the image capturing device <b>1</b> and the TV <b>45</b> at the mutual authentication. The encryption achieves secure information communication between the image capturing device <b>1</b> and the TV <b>45</b>. As a result, intervention of a malicious third person can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0386" num="0385">Since the server URL generation information <b>80</b> is transmitted to the TV <b>45</b>, the server <b>42</b> (and directory) to which the first antenna <b>20</b> of the image capturing device <b>1</b> transmits data is the same as the server (and directory) from which the TV <b>45</b> downloads the data. Therefore, the TV <b>45</b> can display the images that have been captured by the image capturing device <b>1</b> and then uploaded to the server <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0387" num="0386">In addition, the transmission of the captured image state information <b>55</b> to the TV <b>45</b> makes it possible to examine synchronization between the captured images stored in the third memory <b>33</b> of the image capturing device <b>1</b> and the images uploaded from the first antenna <b>20</b> to the server <b>42</b>. Therefore, the TV <b>45</b> can detect a failure of the synchronization. The display of the warning information indicating the synchronization failure on the TV <b>45</b> can prevent unnecessary confusion of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0388" num="0387">Moreover, the transmission of the image display method instruction information <b>77</b> to the TV <b>45</b> enables the user to view images by a set image viewing method without designating the image viewing method on the TV <b>45</b>. The user merely needs to move the image capturing device <b>1</b> into proximity of the TV <b>45</b>. The complicated operations using a remote controller or the like of the TV <b>45</b> are not necessary. The images can be automatically displayed by the set viewing method.</p>

Moreover, the data processing unit <b>5510</b> sets a mode of displaying the downloaded image data, according to the image display method instruction information <b>77</b> provided from the decryption unit <b>5504</b>. For example, if the list display (flag) <b>78</b> in the image display method instruction information <b>77</b> is ON, then the data processing unit <b>5510</b> generates a list of the downloaded images and provides the list to the memory unit <b>5511</b>.

<p id="p-0471" num="0470">As described above, in the system according to the second embodiment of the present invention, the image capturing device <b>1</b> uploads captured images to the server connected to the image capturing device <b>1</b> via the first antenna. When the image capturing device <b>1</b> is prevented to the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> of the TV <b>45</b>, the image capturing device <b>1</b> transmits the server URL generation information <b>80</b>, the captured image state information <b>55</b>, and the image display method instruction information <b>77</b> from the RF-ID unit <b>47</b> to the TV <b>45</b> by the RF-ID communication. Then, the TV <b>45</b> connects to the server to which the image capturing device <b>1</b> has uploaded the captured images, then downloads the captured images from the server, and displays the captured images. Here, it is determined whether or not the captured images in the server <b>42</b> are in synchronization with the captured images in the image capturing device <b>1</b>. If the synchronization is failure, the TV <b>45</b> displays notification of the synchronization failure on the display unit <b>5512</b>. Thereby, the user can display the captured images only by presenting the image capturing device <b>1</b> to the TV <b>45</b>, although the user conventionally has to remove a recording memory from the camera (the image capturing device <b>1</b>) to be equipped to the TV <b>45</b> in order to view the images. Thereby, even the user who is not familiar with operations of digital devices can easily display the images on the TV <b>45</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Third Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0472" num="0471">The third embodiment according to the present invention is described below.</p>
<p id="p-0473" num="0472">First, the third embodiment is explained in summary. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> is a schematic block diagram of an electronic catalog display system according to the third embodiment. The electronic catalog display system according to the third embodiment includes an electronic catalog server information input device <b>500</b>, an electronic catalog notification card <b>502</b>, the TV <b>45</b>, and an electronic catalog server <b>506</b>. The electronic catalog server information input device <b>500</b> includes a RF-ID writer <b>501</b>. The electronic catalog notification card <b>502</b> includes a RF-ID unit <b>47</b>. The TV <b>45</b> includes a RF-ID reader <b>504</b> and a network communication unit <b>509</b>. The electronic catalog server <b>506</b> includes an electronic catalog database <b>507</b> and a customer attribute database <b>508</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0474" num="0473">The electronic catalog server information input device <b>500</b> writes electronic catalog server information from the RF-ID writer <b>501</b> to the RF-ID unit <b>47</b> attached to the electronic catalog notification card <b>502</b>. The electronic catalog server information is provided from a user who provides services of an electronic catalog (hereinafter, referred to as a &#x201c;provider user&#x201d;). When a user who receives the services of the electronic catalog (hereinafter, referred to as a &#x201c;customer user&#x201d;) brings the electronic catalog notification card <b>502</b>, in which the electronic catalog server information is written, into proximity of the TV <b>45</b>, the RF-ID reader <b>504</b> in the TV <b>45</b> reads the electronic catalog server information from the RF-ID unit <b>47</b>. In addition, the TV <b>45</b> transmits, based on the readout electronic catalog server information, a request for obtaining an electronic catalog to the electronic catalog server <b>506</b> set on a network via the network communication unit <b>509</b>. Furthermore, when transmitting the request to the electronic catalog server, the TV <b>45</b> transmits also user information, which is previously inputted in the TV <b>45</b>, to the electronic catalog server <b>506</b>. The electronic catalog server <b>506</b> receives the request for the electronic catalog and the user information from the TV <b>45</b>. First, the electronic catalog server <b>506</b> obtains customer attribute data from the customer attribute database <b>508</b> based on the user information. Next, from the electronic catalog database <b>507</b>, the electronic catalog server <b>506</b> obtains electronic catalog data associated with the customer attribute data. Then, the electronic catalog server <b>506</b> transmits the obtained electronic catalog data to the TV <b>45</b> from which the request for the electronic catalog has been transmitted. The TV <b>45</b> displays the electronic catalog data received from the electronic catalog server <b>506</b>, and thereby receives purchase operations from the customer user to purchase products in the electronic catalog data.</p>
<p id="p-0475" num="0474">The following describes the electronic catalog display system according to the third embodiment in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0476" num="0475"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref> is a functional block diagram illustrating a structure of the electronic catalog server information input device according to the third embodiment. First, a key input receiving unit <b>520</b> receives an input by input keys operated by the provider user, in order to obtain the electronic catalog server information. The electronic catalog server information obtained by the key input receiving unit <b>520</b> includes: a sever address such as a URL; server login ID; a server login password; an electronic catalog display password; electronic catalog display information; and a medium identification information. The electronic catalog display information indicates whether images of products/services in the electronic catalog are to be displayed in a list (as thumbnails) or sequentially (as a slide show). The medium identification information is used for identifying a medium such as a card or a postcard to which RF-ID is attached. The electronic catalog server information obtained by the key input receiving unit <b>520</b> is stored into a storage unit <b>522</b>. Next, when a RF-ID transmission key and the like are received after receiving of the electronic catalog server information, a RF-ID transmission input receiving unit <b>521</b> notifies a transmission unit <b>523</b> of a transmission request. Then, the transmission unit <b>523</b> reads the electronic catalog server information from the storage unit <b>522</b>. An antenna unit <b>524</b> transmits the electronic catalog server information. The processing performed by the electronic catalog server information input device is presented in more detail with reference to a flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0477" num="0476"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref> is a block diagram of a structure of the RF-ID unit <b>47</b> included in the electronic catalog notification card <b>502</b>. A structure and processing of the RF-ID unit <b>47</b> are the same as those described in the first and second embodiments. The second power supply unit <b>91</b> obtains current from signals received by the second antenna <b>21</b>, and provides power to each unit in the electronic catalog notification card <b>502</b>. Received information is recorded into the second memory <b>52</b> via the data receiving unit <b>105</b>, the second processing unit <b>95</b>, and the recording unit <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0478" num="0477"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref> is a functional block diagram of a structure of the TV <b>45</b>. The structure of the TV <b>45</b> according to the third embodiment differs from the structure of the TV <b>45</b> according to the second embodiment in that a user information input unit <b>588</b> is added. The user information input unit <b>588</b> receives the user information and stores the user information into a memory unit <b>583</b> temporarily. The user information is an attribute of the customer user and previously inputted by the customer user himself/herself. The user information is preferably gender or age information of the customer user. The user information may be other information, such as a residence or a family structure, which is private information for selecting product/service data in the electronic catalog. The user information is transmitted to the electronic catalog server via the communication unit <b>509</b>, together with the URL of the electronic catalog server generated by the URL generation unit. In the same manner as described in the first embodiment, in the third embodiment, when the customer user moves the electronic catalog notification card <b>502</b> into proximity of a RF-ID reader <b>504</b> of the TV <b>45</b>, the TV <b>45</b> receives the electronic catalog server information and thereby generates a URL of the server to connect to the server. The details of this processing are the same as those described in the first embodiment with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 20</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0479" num="0478"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref> is a functional block diagram of a structure of the electronic catalog server <b>506</b>. The electronic catalog server <b>506</b> receives an electronic catalog destination address and the user information from the TV <b>45</b> via a communication unit <b>600</b>. The electronic catalog destination address is a network address of the TV <b>45</b> on a network to which the TV <b>45</b> and the electronic catalog server <b>506</b> belong. Next, based on the user information received by the customer attribute data obtainment unit, the electronic catalog server <b>506</b> obtains customer attribute data from the customer attribute database <b>508</b>. For instance, if the user information includes a gender and an age of the customer user using the TV <b>45</b>, the electronic catalog server <b>506</b> obtains, as the customer attribute data, information of a product/service genre and a product/service price range which are in association with the age and gender of the customer user, based on the customer attribute database <b>508</b> having a data structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref>. Then, the electronic catalog data obtainment unit <b>602</b> obtains the electronic catalog data from the electronic catalog database <b>507</b> based on customer attribute data. For example, if the customer attribute data includes product/service genres and product/service price ranges, the electronic catalog server <b>506</b> obtains, as the electronic catalog data, all of product/service data corresponding to the product/service genres and the product/service price ranges, from the electronic catalog database <b>507</b> having a data structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>. The electronic catalog server <b>506</b> transmits the electronic catalog data obtained by the electronic catalog data obtainment unit <b>602</b> to the TV <b>45</b> having the electronic catalog destination address, via a communication unit <b>600</b>. The processing performed by the electronic catalog server <b>506</b> is presented in more detail in a flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0480" num="0479">The following describes processing of the TV <b>45</b> after downloading the electronic catalog data, with reference to a flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref>. The processing regarding obtaining of the electronic catalog server information from the RF-ID unit at Steps S<b>630</b> to S<b>632</b> is the same whichever the electronic catalog data is downloaded or not. At S<b>633</b>, it is determined whether or not the electronic catalog data associated with the electronic catalog server information received from the RF-ID unit has already been downloaded and displayed. If the electronic catalog data has not yet been downloaded, then the TV <b>45</b> downloads the electronic catalog data from the server at S<b>634</b> and displays the electronic catalog data at S<b>635</b>. The download processing is the same as the download processing described in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0481" num="0480">If it is determined at S<b>633</b> that the electronic catalog data has already been downloaded, then the TV <b>45</b> issues a signal of a predetermined key (for example, a signal of a Decide key) to execute operations for the displayed electronic catalog data (S<b>636</b>). Here, as illustrated in an example of a screen display of the electronic catalog data in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>, a screen presents the customer user with a few of options for a next operation to be executed by the customer user for the displayed electronic catalog data. Then, a focus circulates among the options on the screen (as illustrated as options <b>652</b> and <b>653</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>) to indicate one of them as a selection candidate every time a predetermined time period passes. This allows the customer user to execute an operation for selecting or purchasing each product in the electronic catalog data, for example, only by presenting the electronic catalog notification card <b>502</b> having the RF-ID unit <b>47</b> to the TV <b>45</b>, when the focus indicates a desired option of the customer user.</p>
<p id="p-0482" num="0481">The second memory <b>52</b> according to the third embodiment, which is embedded in the RF-ID unit <b>47</b> on the electronic catalog notification card <b>502</b>, may be a Read Only Memory (ROM). In this aspect, the electronic catalog server information input device <b>500</b> serves as a RF-ID memory data input unit in manufacturing the RF-ID unit, or a RF-ID memory data input means in a RF-ID manufacturing system. In general, a RF-ID unit having a ROM unit is inexpensive more than a RF-ID unit having a rewritable memory. Therefore, the RF-ID unit having a ROM allows the provider user sending a great number of electronic catalog notification cards to reduce a cost.</p>
<p id="p-0483" num="0482">It should be noted that it has been described in the third embodiment that a focus circulates among the options on the screen of the TV <b>45</b> (as illustrated as options <b>652</b> and <b>653</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>) to indicate one of them as a selection candidate every time a predetermined time period passes. However, the method of operating the electronic catalog data displayed on the screen by using the electronic catalog notification card <b>502</b> having the RF-ID unit <b>47</b> is not limited to the above. For example, it is also possible that the receiving unit <b>571</b> of the TV <b>45</b> sequentially receive pieces of information from the RF-ID unit and counts the sequential receiving processes, then thereby calculates a time period (RF-ID proximity time period) during which the RF-ID unit is in proximity of the TV <b>45</b>, and eventually moves a focus indicating a selection candidate displayed on the screen based on the RF-ID proximity time period. With the above structure, the following operation for the electronic catalog is possible. Only when the RF-ID unit is in proximity of the TV, the focus displayed on the screen is circulated to change the selection candidate. If the RF-ID unit is away from the TV, the focus is stopped. After a predetermined time period after stopping of the focus, the selection candidate on which the focus is stopped is decided as selection. In this operation for the electronic catalog, the customer user can actively operate the electronic catalog by using the RF-ID unit, without waiting for the focus, which automatically circulates among options every predetermined time period, to arrive at a user's desired option.</p>
<p id="p-0484" num="0483">It should also be noted that it has been described in the third embodiment that the electronic catalog server information input device <b>500</b> has the key input receiving unit <b>520</b> which receives inputs by the input keys operated by the provider user in order to obtain the electronic catalog server information. However, the following configuration is also possible. That is, the electronic catalog server information input device <b>500</b> has a communication interface to communicate with the image server. The image server holds the server information to be transmitted to the electronic catalog server information input device <b>500</b>. The electronic catalog server information input device <b>500</b> receives the server information from the image server, in order to obtain the server information. This configuration in which the server information is stored in the image server allows the electronic catalog server information input device <b>500</b> to eliminate inputting to the image server. Especially, when a plurality of the electronic catalog server information input devices <b>500</b> are operated for a single image server, this configuration is highly convenient.</p>
<p id="p-0485" num="0484">The conventional techniques have a program that users who are not familiar with operations of digital devices such as personal computers should learn operations of the devices to do online shopping. However, the system according to the third embodiment enables users using electronic catalogs to do online shopping and the like, simply by bringing received cards or post cards into proximity of TVs. Therefore, even users who are not familiar with online terminals such as personal computers and mobile phones can easily enjoy shopping on TV screens.</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="1">Fourth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0486" num="0485">The fourth embodiment according to the present invention is described below.</p>
<p id="p-0487" num="0486"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref> is a schematic diagram of the fourth embodiment. In the fourth embodiment, it is described a method of sending, to a remote location, a post card attached with RF-ID used to access an image server. First, a first user, who is a sender of a post card, brings the image capturing device <b>1</b> having the RF-ID unit <b>47</b> into proximity of the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> of the TV <b>45</b>. Thereby, the TV <b>45</b> generates a server URL used to connect the TV <b>45</b> to the image server <b>42</b>, thereby obtains image data from the image server <b>42</b>, and eventually displays the image data on a screen. This processing is the same as described in the first embodiment. Next, by using an input means such as a remote controller of the TV <b>45</b>, the first user selects an image(s) to be printed on a post card and images to be registered in association with the post card (in other words, images to be shown to a second user living in a remote location), from among the image data displayed by the TV <b>45</b>. In addition, the first user inputs address information such as a destination address of the post card by using the remote controller or the like. The TV <b>45</b> transmits, to the image server <b>42</b>, ID of the image selected by the first user to be printed on the post card (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;print image ID&#x201d;), ID of the images to be registered for the post card (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;registration image ID&#x201d;), and the destination information of the post card (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;post card destination information&#x201d;). The image server <b>42</b> retrieves the image data identified by the print image ID and then transmits the image data and the post card destination information to a printer <b>800</b>. The printer <b>800</b> prints the image data and the post card destination information on the post card. In addition, to the image server information input unit <b>500</b>, the image server <b>42</b> transmits the registration image ID received from the TV <b>45</b>, together with image server information. The image server information includes: a sever address such as a URL; server login ID; a server login password; an image display password, image display information indicating whether the image data (images) is to be displayed in a list (as thumbnails) or sequentially (as a slide show); and medium identification information indicating a medium, such as a card or post card, to which RF-ID is to be attached. The image server information input device <b>500</b> writes the image server information and the registration image ID to the RF-ID unit <b>47</b> of the post card on which the image and the destination information are printed by the printer <b>800</b>. The post card <b>801</b> applied with printing and RF-ID writing is mailed to the printed destination. Thereby, the second user, who is designated by the first user as being the destination, receives the post card <b>801</b>. When the second user brings the mailed post card <b>801</b> into proximity of a RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> of a TV <b>45</b> of the second user, the TV <b>45</b> of the second user obtains the image server information and the registration image ID from the RF-ID unit <b>47</b>, downloads the images identified by the registration image ID, and displays the downloaded images.</p>
<p id="p-0488" num="0487">The structure and processing of the image capturing device <b>1</b> according to the fourth embodiment are the same as described in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0489" num="0488"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref> is a block diagram of a structure of the TV <b>45</b> according to the fourth embodiment. A receiving unit <b>811</b> receives the image server information from the RF-ID unit <b>47</b> of the image capturing device <b>1</b> or the post card <b>801</b> via a wireless antenna <b>570</b>. If the RF-ID unit <b>47</b> of the post card <b>801</b> holds the registration image ID, the receiving unit <b>811</b> receives also the registration image ID. An image selection unit <b>584</b> receives an image selection operation from the user via a key unit <b>585</b> and an infrared ray receiving unit <b>586</b>, and thereby obtains ID of an image which the first user has selected to be printed on the post card (namely, the print image ID) and ID of images which the first user has selected to be registered for the post card (namely, the registration image ID). Then, the image selection unit <b>584</b> provides the obtained IDs to the communication unit <b>509</b> (the network communication unit <b>509</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref> illustrates an example of a screen display on the TV <b>45</b> in the image selection operation. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref>, <b>821</b> is a screen display from which the first user selects an image to be printed on the post card. <b>820</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref> is a screen display from which the first user selects images to be registered for the post card. A post card destination information input unit <b>810</b> receives a character input operation of the first user via the key unit <b>585</b> and the infrared ray receiving unit <b>586</b>. Thereby, the post card destination information input unit <b>810</b> obtains the post card destination information including an address and a name of the destination of the post card. Then, the post card destination information input unit <b>810</b> provides the post card destination information to the communication unit <b>509</b>. <b>823</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref> is an example of a screen display on which the post card destination information is inputted. The communication unit <b>509</b> transmits the post card destination information, the print image ID, and the registration ID to the image server via a transmission unit <b>575</b> and a communication interface <b>576</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0490" num="0489"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</figref> is a flowchart of processing performed prior to mailing of the post card <b>801</b>, by the image server <b>42</b>, the printer <b>800</b>, and the image server information input device <b>500</b>. When the post card <b>801</b> is applied with printing and RF-ID writing, the post card <b>801</b> is mailed to the printed destination. The second user, who is designated by the first user as being the destination, receives the post card <b>801</b>. When the second user presents the received post card <b>801</b> to the TV <b>45</b>, the receiving unit <b>811</b> receives the image server information and the registration image ID from the RF-ID unit <b>47</b> via the wireless antenna <b>570</b>. A decryption unit <b>572</b> decrypts encrypted information in the image server information and the registration image ID. Next, the URL generation unit <b>573</b> generates a URL from which only images identified by the registration image ID from among images stored in the image server <b>42</b> are downloaded to the TV <b>45</b>. More specifically, the URL generation unit <b>573</b> may designate an internal directory of the server in the generated URL or may use a method of embedding the registration image ID to the URL as a URL option. By using the URL generated by the URL generation unit <b>573</b> to designate the server, the TV <b>45</b> accesses the image server to obtain the images, which is the same as described in more detail in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0491" num="0490">It should be noted that it has been described in the fourth embodiment that the user inputs the destination information to the TV <b>45</b>, but the user may input not only the destination information such as an address and a name but also a message to be printed with an image on a post card. The TV <b>45</b> receives the input message together with the destination information and provides them to the image server <b>42</b>. The printer <b>800</b> prints them on the post card. <b>822</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref> illustrates an example of a screen of the TV <b>45</b> on which a message to be printed is inputted. If the user can select an image to be printed on the post card and also input an message added to the image, a flexibility in generating a post card with RF-ID is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0492" num="0491">It should also be noted that the TV <b>45</b> according to the fourth embodiment may allow the user to perform operations for images displayed on the TV <b>45</b> by using the post card with RF-ID, in the same manner as described in the third embodiment for the processing in which the user operates an electronic catalog displayed on a screen by using RF-ID.</p>
<p id="p-0493" num="0492">As described above, the system according to the fourth embodiment enables the user to mail a post card with RF-ID to a person living in a distant location, without creating a post card attached with RF-ID by the user himself/herself. In addition, when the user wishes to print the image(s) stored in the image server onto the post card to be mailed, the system allows the user to perform operation on a TV screen to select an image(s) to be printed. As a result, high usability is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0494" num="0493">Conventionally, if the user intends to show images, on a large screen display device, to a different user living in a remote location, the user in the remote location needs to learn operations of the device (apparatus), an operation acquirer has to go to the remote location to operate the device, or the display device in the remote location should be remotely controlled. The system according to the fourth embodiment, however, enables such a user in a remote location to easily view images by a simple operation, for example, by bringing a physical medium such as a post card with RF-ID into proximity of a display device.</p>
<heading id="h-0015" level="1">Fifth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0495" num="0494">The fifth embodiment of the present invention has the following configuration. A mailing object such as a post card is written with fixed information. The image capturing device associates the fixed information with an image or a group of images (image data) stored in the server. A reproduction side reads the fixed information from the RF-ID attached to the post card or the like in order to display the image data associated with the fixed information. The configuration is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</figref>, first, the image capturing device reads the fixed information from the mailing object, then associates the fixed information with an image(s), and registers information of the association (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;association information) into the server. When the user receives the mailing object for which the registration is completed, the user brings the mailing object into proximity of a RF-ID reader of a TV to read the fixed information from the mailing object. The TV queries the server using the fixed information, and thereby displays the image(s) associated with the mailing object.</p>
<p id="p-0496" num="0495">The fifth embodiment is characterized in that the RF-ID information in the mailing object is not rewritable (ROM) or in non-rewritable environments so that image data in the server is associated with the mailing object without rewriting the fixed information in the mailing object.</p>
<p id="p-0497" num="0496">&#x3c;Image Uploading and Mailing Object Associating by Image Capturing Device&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0498" num="0497">The images captured by the image capturing device are uploaded to the server using the method described in the prior embodiments. Here, an identifier is assigned to an uploaded image or image group. The identifier makes it possible to identify the image or an group of images stored in the server.</p>
<p id="p-0499" num="0498">The following describes a method of associating (i) an image or image group which is captured and uploaded to the server by the image capturing device with (ii) fixed information recorded in a RF-ID tag of a mailing object. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 64A to 64C</figref> illustrate examples of the fixed information recorded in the RF-ID tag of the mailing object. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64A</figref> illustrates fixed information including: mailing object UID unique to the mailing object; and information such as an address for accessing the image server. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64B</figref> illustrates fixed information including: the mailing object UID; and information such as an address for accessing a relay server. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64C</figref> illustrates fixed information including the mailing object UID only. The fixed information may also include a login ID, password information, and the like for accessing the server. It is assumed in the fifth embodiment that such information necessary to access the server is included in a URL including the address information.</p>
<p id="p-0500" num="0499"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</figref> is a flowchart of processing performed by the image capturing device to associate the RF-ID with image data stored in the server, when the image capturing device has a RF-ID reader function.</p>
<p id="p-0501" num="0500">First, the image capturing device reads information from the RF-ID of the mailing object by using the RF-ID reader (S<b>2500</b>). In more detail, the second antenna <b>21</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> communicates with the RF-ID of the mailing object, and thereby the data receiving unit <b>105</b> receives the fixed information from mailing object. Then, the second processing unit <b>95</b> performs processing to provide the fixed information of the mailing object to the first processing unit <b>35</b> via the recording unit <b>106</b>, the second memory <b>52</b>, and the recording/reproducing unit <b>51</b>. The first processing unit <b>35</b> associates the mailing object UID read from the mailing object with an image or image group, according to designation from the user (S<b>2501</b>). Then, the image capturing device accesses the server <b>42</b> via the first antenna <b>20</b> (S<b>2502</b>). Thereby, the image capturing device registers, to the server <b>42</b>, the association information regarding the association between the mailing object UID and the image data stored in the server <b>42</b> (S<b>2503</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0502" num="0501">If the fixed information read from the mailing object includes an address of the image server or a URL including the address, then the processing is completed. On the other hand, if the fixed information read from the mailing object does not include an address of the image server or a URL including the address, the image capturing device sets a relay server (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0503" num="0502">In order to set a relay server, the image capturing device accesses the relay server (S<b>2510</b>). In more detail, if the fixed information read from the mailing object includes an address of a relay server or a URL including the address, then the image capturing device accesses the relay server. Otherwise, the image capturing device accesses a relay server that is previously set for the image capturing device.</p>
<p id="p-0504" num="0503">After accessing the relay server, the image capturing device sets, in a database of the relay server, association information regarding association between the mailing object UID and the server that is a redirection destination (transfer destination) (S<b>2511</b>). Thereby, association between the mailing object UID and an address of the transfer destination is registered in the database of the relay server.</p>
<p id="p-0505" num="0504">If the image capturing device does not have a RF-ID reader function and the mailing object is printed with a two-dimensional code or the like indicating information of the RF-ID reader, the image capturing device captures an image of the two-dimensional code using an image capturing unit to read information from the code so that the image capturing device can obtain the same information as the fixed information recorded in the RF-ID unit of the mailing object. The two-dimensional code may be a QR Code&#x2122;, a PDF417, Veri Code, Maxi Code, or the like. Any other code can be used if the image capturing device can read information from the code by capturing an image of the code. In addition, the same advantages as described in the fifth embodiment can be produced by using a bar-code in a one-dimensional direction only, although a printing area is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0506" num="0505"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</figref> is an example of the mailing object attached with a RF-ID unit <b>2520</b> and printed with a two-dimensional code <b>2521</b> indicating the same information as that recorded on the RF-ID unit <b>2520</b>. A flow of processing data when the two-dimensional code is read by the image capturing device is described with reference to the block diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The two-dimensional code printed on the mailing object is captured by the image capturing unit <b>30</b>, then converted into an imaged by the video processing unit <b>31</b>, and provided to the first processing unit <b>35</b> via the recording/reproducing unit <b>32</b>. The first processing unit <b>35</b> analyzes the captured two-dimensional code and retrieves the information from the two-dimensional code. The information indicated by the two-dimensional code is basically the same as the information recorded in the RF-ID unit. The information indicated by the two-dimensional code includes at least the mailing object UID.</p>
<p id="p-0507" num="0506">The following describes a flow of the processing from reading the information of the two-dimensional code to associating the information with an image or image group in the server with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0508" num="0507">Firstly, the image capturing unit captures an image of the two-dimensional code (S<b>2530</b>). Then, it is determined whether or not the captured image is a two-dimensional code (S<b>2531</b>). If the captured image is not a two-dimensional code, then error processing is performed (S<b>2532</b>). Or, normal image capturing processing may be performed. On the other hand, if the captured image is a two-dimensional code, then the two-dimensional code is analyzed (S<b>2533</b>). Thereby, information is read from the mailing object based on the result of the analysis (S<b>2534</b>). After reading the fixed information from the mailing object, the image capturing device associates the mailing object UID with image data stored in the server (S<b>2535</b>). Then, the image capturing device accesses the server (S<b>2536</b>). Then, the image capturing device sets the association information to the server (S<b>2537</b>). The Steps S<b>2535</b> to S<b>2537</b> are the same as the Steps S<b>2501</b> to S<b>2503</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</figref>. Here, if the readout information does not include an address of the image server or a URL including the address, then the image capturing device performs transfer setting to a relay server. The transfer setting to the relay server has been previously described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0509" num="0508">As described above, by reading information from the two-dimensional bar-code printed on the mailing object, it is possible to complete to associate the information recorded on the RF-ID unit with image data stored in the server.</p>
<p id="p-0510" num="0509">If the image capturing device does not have a RF-ID reader function and the mailing object is not printed with a code such as a two-dimensional code, the image capturing device can read information from the mailing object if the user manually inputs, to the image capturing device, the mailing object UID and the URL such as a sever address which are printed on the mailing object. The user inputs the information using buttons <b>7</b> to <b>15</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In this aspect, the URL and the mailing object UID may be printed directly as a plane text or coded to be a code which the user easily inputs.</p>
<p id="p-0511" num="0510">As described above, even if the image capturing device does not have a RF-ID reader function and the mailing object is not printed with a two-dimensional code, it is possible to associate the mailing object with image data stored in the server.</p>
<p id="p-0512" num="0511">&#x3c;Image Reproducing and Viewing by Using RF-ID on Mailing Object&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0513" num="0512">Next, the steps for viewing images stored in the server on the TV using the mailing object for which association is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0514" num="0513"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 69</figref> is a flowchart of processing performed by the TV to read RF-ID from the mailing object and eventually access the image server.</p>
<p id="p-0515" num="0514">When the user brings the mailing object into proximity of the RF-ID reader of the TV, the TV reads information of the RF-ID on the mailing object (S<b>2540</b>). Then, a determination is made as to whether or not the readout information includes a sever address or a URL including the server address (S<b>2541</b>). If the readout information includes a sever address or a URL including the sever address, then the TV accesses the designated server (S<b>2542</b>). Then, the TV transmits the mailing object UID (S<b>2543</b>). Then, a determination is made as to whether or not the server receiving the transmission is a relay server (S<b>2544</b>). If the server is a relay server, then the relay server redirects to a server (the image sever) designated in the relay server (S<b>2547</b>). Thereby, the TV accesses an image or image group in the image server (S<b>2548</b>). On the other hand, if it is determined at S<b>2544</b> that the server receiving the transmission is the image server, then redirecting is not performed and access to the image server is performed (S<b>2548</b>). Moreover, if it is determined at S<b>2541</b> that the readout information does not include a sever address, then the TV accesses a server set by a predetermined default (S<b>2545</b>). Then, the TV transmits the mailing object UID to the default server (S<b>2546</b>). The default server redirects to a server (the image server) designated in the default server (S<b>2547</b>) to access the image server.</p>
<p id="p-0516" num="0515">Here, if association between the mailing object UID and the designated server as a destination of the relay is not registered in a database of the relay or default server, the relay or default server redirects to an error page. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 70</figref> is a flowchart of processing performed by the relay or default server after receiving the mailing object UID. When the relay or default server receives the mailing object UID (S<b>2550</b>), the server searches its database for information regarding the mailing object UID (S<b>2551</b>). Then, the relay or default server determines whether or not the database holds information regarding the mailing object UID (S<b>2552</b>). If the database holds the information, then the relay or default server redirects to a server associated with the mailing object UID in the database (S<b>2554</b>). On the other hand, if the database does not hold the information (in other words, if there is no association), then the relay or default server redirects to an error page (S<b>2553</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0517" num="0516">As described above, the mailing object having fixed information in the RF-ID is previously associated with image data stored in the image server. Thereby, when the mailing object with the association is presented to the TV, the user can view an image or image group in the server which is associated with the mailing object UID, without rewriting of the RF-ID of the mailing object. Therefore, even if the user is away from home and cannot rewrite the RF-ID of the mailing object, or even if the RF-ID of the mailing object is not rewritable, the user can associate images in the server with the mailing object. As a result, the user allows a person receiving the mailing object to view the images associated with the mailing object.</p>
<p id="p-0518" num="0517">It should be noted that it has been described in the fifth embodiment that the mailing object UID is transmitted after accessing the server. However, it is also possible to generate a URL from the mailing object UID and the sever address recorded on the mailing object in order to access the server. In this aspect, it is possible to perform the access to the server and the transmission of the mailing object UID at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0519" num="0518">According to the fifth embodiment, even in an environment where the RF-ID cannot be rewritten, such as in a sight-seeing location, for example, the user can associate captured images with a post card and send the post card to a friend. Thereby, the friend receiving the post card presents the post card to a TV to view the images the user captured in the sight-seeing location. As explained above, even in an environment where the RF-ID cannot be rewritten, the user can create a mailing object associated with images in the server and then send the mailing object to a person to which the user desires to show the images.</p>
<p id="p-0520" num="0519">If the image capturing device has a RF-ID writer function to rewrite the RF-ID of the mailing object, the processing is the same as processing performed by the TV for associating the mailing object with image data in the server, which will be described below in the sixth embodiment. Therefore, the processing is not described in the fifth embodiment.</p>
<heading id="h-0016" level="1">Sixth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0521" num="0520">In the sixth embodiment, the following configuration is described. The image capturing device captures images and uploads the images to the image server. Then, a user transmitting the images (hereinafter, referred to as a &#x201c;sending user&#x201d;) selects an image group from the images in the server. Information for accessing the selected image group is recorded in the RF-ID on the mailing object. The mailing object is mailed to a user receiving the images (hereinafter, referred to as a &#x201c;receiving user&#x201d;). The receiving user accesses the image group in the image server by using the RF-ID on the mailing object.</p>

The images are recorded as the image data <b>50</b> onto the image server <b>42</b> via the internet <b>40</b>. Then, the image capturing device <b>1</b> is moved into proximity of the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> of the TV <b>45</b> in order to establish connection with the TV <b>45</b> by wireless communication via the first antenna <b>21</b> of the image capturing device <b>1</b> used for RF-ID. The TV <b>45</b> obtains, from the image capturing device <b>1</b>, information for accessing the image data <b>50</b> in the image server <b>42</b>. Then, the TV <b>45</b> downloads the images of the image data <b>50</b> to be displayed on the display unit <b>110</b>. The above processing is the same as described in the prior embodiments. The above is just a summary.</p>
<p id="p-0529" num="0528">Next, the sending user checks the images displayed on the display unit <b>110</b> of the TV <b>45</b> in order to set transmission image selection information indicating whether or not each of the images is to be transmitted to the receiving user (in other words, whether or not each of the images is to be permitted to be viewed by the receiving user). The sending user can set also restriction on display for the receiving user, utility form information such as a slide show and printing, which is described in the prior embodiments. The transmission image selection information and the utility form information are transmitted to and recorded onto the image server. The image server manages, as an image group, a set of images selected as transmission images in the transmission image selection information.</p>
<p id="p-0530" num="0529">The following describes steps performed by the TV <b>45</b> for recording, onto the mailing object <b>3001</b>, information regarding the image group selected by the sending use, with reference to a flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0531" num="0530">It is assumed that transmission images have been selected and an image group set with the utility form information has been generated. Under the assumption, the sending user brings the mailing object <b>3001</b> having the RF-ID unit <b>3002</b> into proximity of the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> of the TV <b>45</b> in order to establish wireless communication between the RF-ID unit <b>3002</b> and the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0532" num="0531">When the TV <b>45</b> becomes able to communicate with the RF-ID unit <b>3002</b> on the mailing object <b>3001</b> via the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b>, the TV <b>45</b> reads information from the memory unit <b>3003</b> (S<b>3101</b>). Then, the TV <b>45</b> determines whether or not the medium identification information indicates that the current communication partner is a mailing object (S<b>3102</b>). If the current communication partner is a mailing object, then the TV <b>45</b> proceeds to steps for writing to the mailing object. Here, if it is determined at Step S<b>3102</b> that the current communication partner is not a mailing object, then the subsequent steps are not described here but the TV <b>45</b> proceeds to steps depending on a medium indicated by the medium identification information.</p>
<p id="p-0533" num="0532">In order to write to the mailing object <b>3001</b>, first, the TV accesses the image server <b>42</b> via the internet <b>40</b> (S<b>3103</b>). Thereby, the TV <b>45</b> obtains, from the image server <b>42</b>, image group designation information, such as a server URL and an image group address, for allowing the image receiving side to access the image group in the image server <b>42</b> (S<b>3104</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0534" num="0533">The TV <b>45</b> transmits the obtained image group designation information to the RF-ID unit <b>3002</b> on the mailing object <b>3001</b> via the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> of the TV <b>45</b> in order to write the image group designation information to the memory unit <b>3003</b> in the mailing object <b>3001</b>, and the RF-ID unit <b>3002</b> on the mailing object <b>3001</b> records the image group designation information to a rewritable region of the memory unit <b>3003</b> (S<b>3105</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0535" num="0534">As described above, the mailing object <b>3001</b> on which the image group designation information is recorded is mailed by the sending user to a user of the image receiving side.</p>
<p id="p-0536" num="0535">&#x3c;Image Reproducing and Viewing by Image Receiving Side&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0537" num="0536">Next, the image receiving side is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref> illustrating the schematic block diagram of the image receiving side and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</figref> illustrating a flowchart of processing performed by the TV in the image receiving side.</p>
<p id="p-0538" num="0537">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref>, the receiving user receives the mailing object <b>3001</b> from the sending user. Then, the receiving user checks the RF-ID unit <b>3002</b> or characters or design indicated on the mailing object <b>3001</b> to determine whether the mailing object is incorporated with a means for accessing images. Here, the receiving user needs only to understand that the receiving user can access to the images by using the mailing object <b>3001</b>. The receiving user does not need to care about the image group designation information and the like in the RF-ID unit <b>3002</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0539" num="0538">In order to reproduce and view the images, the receiving user brings the mailing object <b>3001</b> into proximity of the RF-ID reader/writer <b>3046</b> of the TV <b>3045</b> in the image receiving side so as to start viewing of the images.</p>
<p id="p-0540" num="0539">If the RF-ID unit <b>3002</b> on the mailing object <b>3001</b> is in enough proximity of the RF-ID reader/writer <b>3046</b> of the TV <b>3045</b>, the RF-ID reader/writer <b>3046</b> supplies power to the RF-ID unit <b>3002</b> of the mailing object <b>3001</b> via antennas (not shown) of both the RF-ID reader/writer <b>3046</b> and the RF-ID unit <b>3002</b> in order to activate the RF-ID unit <b>3002</b>. Thereby, wireless communication between the TV <b>3045</b> and the RF-ID unit <b>3002</b> of the mailing object <b>3001</b> starts. When the wireless communication starts, the TV <b>3045</b> reads information from the memory unit <b>3003</b> of the RF-ID unit <b>3002</b> (S<b>3151</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0541" num="0540">A determination is made as to whether or not the medium identification information in the readout information indicates that the current communication partner is a mailing object (S<b>3152</b>). If the current communication partner is a mailing object, then the TV <b>3045</b> proceeds to processing of reading the image group designated by the sending user from the image server <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0542" num="0541">The access to the image server <b>42</b> makes it possible to generate an URL for accessing the image group in the image server <b>42</b> by using the image group designation information in the information read by the RF-ID unit <b>3002</b> at Step S<b>3151</b>, such as an image group address, and thereby to access the image server <b>42</b> via the internet <b>40</b> (S<b>3153</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0543" num="0542">The TV <b>3045</b> connected to the image server <b>42</b> at the above step obtains the images (the image group) which are permitted to be displayed, from among the image data <b>50</b> in the image server <b>42</b>, based on the transmission image selection information indicating the image group managed by the image server <b>42</b> (S<b>3154</b>). Then, the TV <b>3045</b> displays the images on the display unit <b>110</b> (S<b>3155</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0544" num="0543">Furthermore, according to the transmission image selection information indicating the image group managed by the image server <b>42</b> and the utility form information, the receiving user can use functions of, for example, reproducing the images as a slide show, printing the images, and downloading the images to a recording medium (not shown) attached to the TV <b>3045</b> or connected to the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0545" num="0544">In addition, for image printing, the user can print the images by the printer on a LAN (not shown), and also ask, via the internet <b>40</b>, a photograph print service provider to print the images.</p>
<p id="p-0546" num="0545">As described above, with the above configuration according to the sixth embodiment of the present invention, the image group designation information is provided from the RF-ID unit <b>3002</b> on the mailing object <b>3001</b> to the TV <b>3045</b> in the image receiving side. Therefore, the receiving user does not need to input characters of a network access destination to obtain images, for example. In other words, the intuitive and simple operation of simply bringing the mailing object <b>3001</b> into proximity of the TV <b>3045</b> enables the receiving user to access the image data <b>50</b> stored in the image server <b>42</b>. As a result, the receiving user can obtain images from the image server, without knowledge of complicated operations such as menu selection and character inputs.</p>
<p id="p-0547" num="0546">It should be noted that it has been described in the sixth embodiment that the mailing object <b>3001</b> is previously attached or incorporated with the RF-ID unit <b>3002</b>. However, the mailing object may be a general post card or letter paper attached with an independent RF-ID unit <b>3002</b> that is provided separately. In this aspect, the above effect can be produced by later attaching the RF-ID unit to the mailing object. This produces further advantages that the sending user can use the sixth embodiment for any desired mailing object.</p>
<p id="p-0548" num="0547">It should also be noted that, if the access to the image server <b>42</b> requires a login operation, a server login ID and a server login password may also be written at Step S<b>3105</b> into the rewritable region of the memory unit <b>3003</b> in the RF-ID unit <b>3002</b> on the mailing object <b>3001</b>. Here, it is desirable that the login ID and the login password are not plane texts but are written in an encrypted format for security.</p>
<p id="p-0549" num="0548">It should also be noted that it has been described in the sixth embodiment that the TV <b>45</b> in the image transmission side performs selection of transmission images, setting of the utility form information, and writing of the image group designation information to the RF-ID unit <b>3002</b> on the mailing object <b>3001</b>. However, it is also possible that the image capturing device <b>1</b> having a RF-ID reader/writer function performs setting of the transmission image selection information and the utility form information and writing of the image group designation information, in order to produce the same effect as described above for obtaining images by the simple operation of the receiving user.</p>
<heading id="h-0017" level="1">Variation of Sixth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0550" num="0549"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 75A and 75B</figref> are flowcharts of processing performed by the TV <b>45</b> in the image transmission side according to a variation of the sixth embodiment of the present invention. Here, the same step numerals of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</figref> are assigned to the identical steps of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 75A and 75B</figref>, so that the identical steps are not explained again below.</p>
<p id="p-0551" num="0550">According to the variation of the sixth embodiment, the mailing object UID is previously recorded on the memory unit <b>3003</b> of the RF-ID unit <b>3002</b> on the mailing object <b>3001</b>. Here, it is desirable to record the mailing object UID on a ROM region of the memory unit <b>3003</b> in order to reduce risks of data damages or data manipulation caused by accidental operations. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76</figref> illustrates a diagram of an example of a data structure of the memory unit <b>3003</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0552" num="0551">The TV <b>45</b> in the image transmission side sets the transmission image selection information and the utility form information into the above-described RF-ID unit in order to designate an image group in the image serve <b>42</b>. In this situation, the TV <b>45</b> performs processing according to the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0553" num="0552">The TV <b>45</b> reads information from the RF-ID unit <b>3002</b> on the mailing object <b>3001</b> (S<b>3101</b>) and determines based on the medium identification information that the communication partner is a mailing object (S<b>3102</b>). After that, the TV <b>45</b> obtains the mailing object UID (S<b>3201</b>). The mailing object UID may be the information read at Step S<b>3101</b> or be newly obtained from the RF-ID unit <b>3002</b>. Next, the TV <b>45</b> accesses the image server <b>42</b> via the Internet <b>40</b> (S<b>3202</b>). The TV <b>45</b> transmits the mailing object UID to the image server <b>42</b>, and thereby the image server <b>42</b> associates with the transmitted mailing object UID with an address of the image group and then stores the manages information of the association (association information) (S<b>3203</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0554" num="0553">The TV <b>45</b> obtains, from the image server <b>42</b>, the server URL enabling the image receiving side to access the image server <b>42</b> (S<b>3204</b>). The obtained server URL is written into the rewritable region of the memory unit <b>3003</b> in the RF-ID unit <b>3002</b> on the mailing object <b>3001</b> via the RF-ID reader/writer <b>46</b> (S<b>3205</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0555" num="0554">As described above, if the image server associates the image group with the mailing object UID and then stores and manages the association information, the utility form information can be managed separately for each mailing object UID. Therefore, in the situation where there are a plurality of the mailing objects <b>3001</b>, it is possible to change an operation for receiving images for each mailing object, namely, for each different receiving user.</p>
<p id="p-0556" num="0555">If, in the configuration described in the sixth embodiment, the image receiving side designates an image group for each mailing object, generates a different image group address for each designated image group, and writes the image group address into a corresponding RF-ID unit, the image transmission side needs complicated operations for designating image groups separately although the same advantages as those of the sixth embodiment can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0557" num="0556">Therefore, when the sending user selects the same transmission image group for a plurality of mailing objects, it is preferable that the sending user records and manages different utility form information for each mailing object by using the mailing object UID as described earlier. Thereby, it is possible to reduce operations of the sending user, and to reduce a memory capacity of the image server because it is not necessary to hold pieces of the transmission image selection information separately, thereby producing further advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0558" num="0557">The processing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75B</figref> differs from the processing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75A</figref> in that Steps S<b>3204</b> and S<b>3205</b> are replaced by Steps S<b>3214</b> and <b>3215</b>. At Step <b>3214</b>, the TV <b>45</b> obtains an image group address in addition to the server URL. At Step S<b>3215</b>, the TV <b>45</b> writes the image group address together with the server URL into the memory unit <b>3003</b> of the RF-ID unit <b>3002</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0559" num="0558">Thereby, when the image receiving side is to receive images, the image receiving side accesses the designated image group in the image server <b>42</b>. Here, the access is permitted only when the mailing object UID of the image group stored and managed in the image server matches the mailing object UID used by the receiving server requesting the access. Thereby, security is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0560" num="0559">Conventionally, if the user intends to show images, on a large screen display device (apparatus), to a different user living in a remote location, the user in the remote location needs to learn operations of the device, an operation acquirer has to go to the remote location to operate the device, or the display device in the remote location should be remotely controlled. However, like the fourth embodiment, the system according to the sixth embodiment enables such a user in a remote location to easily view images by a simple operation, for example, by bringing a physical medium such as a post card with RF-ID into proximity of a display device. In the fourth embodiment, generation of the post card with RF-ID and writing of data into the RF-ID is not performed by the user (who captures and sends images or who views the images), but by a service provider. In the sixth embodiment, however, the sending user in the image transmission side performs generation of the post card with RF-ID and writing of data into the RF-ID.</p>

<p id="p-0639" num="0638">As described above, the use of the RF-ID card <b>2100</b> enables the user to perform setting of the recorder <b>2000</b> without complicated operations. Even if the user is not familiar with operations of apparatuses (devices) the user can easily change the setting of the recorder <b>2000</b> by using the RF-ID card <b>2100</b>. Moreover, the operation executable for the recorder <b>2000</b> by using the RF-ID card <b>2100</b> is not limited to the setting change. For example, the instruction detail information can designate an operation of obtaining a list of recorded contents in the recorder. In this case, the list is registered in the RF-ID card or the server. Thereby, the user can check the list on a different apparatus (device) other than the recorder by using the RF-ID card. In addition, the RF-ID card holding information illustrated in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 84</figref> allows the user to perform timer recording in the recorder simply by presenting the RF-ID card to the recorder. In more detail, if the change target information associated with Index <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 84</figref> is applied, the recorder can perform timer recording according to setting of &#x201c;TV program ID&#x201d; and &#x201c;recording mode&#x201d; designated in the instruction target information, simply by presenting the RF-ID card to the recorder. Thereby, the timer recording can be performed without accessing the server. In addition, if the change target information associated with Index <b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 84</figref> is applied, the recorder can perform timer recording according to &#x201c;TV program code&#x201d; designated in the instruction target information, simply by presenting the RF-ID card to the recorder. Here, the recorder can obtain, from the server, (a) program ID or a start time and end time, and (b) channel information. As a result, the time recording can be performed according to the setting of the &#x201c;recording mode&#x201d;. Furthermore, it is also possible that &#x201c;recommended TV program&#x201d; is designated in the instruction target information in the RF-ID card. After presenting the RF-ID card to the recorder, the recorder obtains ID of the recommended TV program from the server. Thereby, the recorder can obtain a content of the recommended TV program from the server and performs timer recording of the content. The above functions may be used as service for providing the RF-ID card as being a supplement of a TV program guide magazine, for example. This RF-ID card can reduce user's bothersome procedures for timer recording. For another service, it is also possible in the RF-ID card that the instruction detail information designates a download operation, the instruction target information designates video or software in a version where a function is restricted, and the communication information designates a URL of a download website. Such RF-ID cards are provided for free to users. The users can use the video or software as trial, and purchase it if the user likes it.</p>

<p id="p-0641" num="0640">For example, the seventh embodiment of the present invention may be implemented as a TV having a reader/writer for the RF-ID card and the setting information processing unit. The TV can register, as the change target information, (a) setting of an initial display channel or initial sound volume immediately after power-on, (b) setting of child lock for excluding adult broadcasts and violence scenes, (c) setting of zapping for favorite channels, (d) setting of contrast and brightness of a screen, (e) setting of a language, (f) setting of a continuous use time, and the like, simply by presenting the RF-ID card to the TV. Thereby, the TV can perform settings according to usability. Furthermore, the seventh embodiment may be implemented also as a vehicle navigation system having a reader/writer for the RF-ID card and the setting information processing unit. In this aspect, the instruction detail information designates &#x201c;highlighted display&#x201d; and the instruction target information designates &#x201c;landmark information&#x201d;. Thereby, by using the RF-ID card, the vehicle navigation system can display the designated landmark as being highlighted, by changing a character font, character size, or color. The landmark information may be obtained from a server. In this case, the RF-ID cards, on which the apparatus operation information illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85</figref> is recorded, are offered to users at rest areas or interchanges on expressways, sightseeing spots, and the like. Thereby, the RF-ID cards allow vehicle navigation systems of the users to display a recommended landmark, where an even is currently held for example, as highlighted display. In addition, the seventh embodiment may be implemented as a laptop having a reader/writer for the RF-ID card and the setting information processing unit. The laptop can designate (a) setting of a resolution of a screen, (b) setting of a position of an icon or the like on a display, (c) setting of a wallpaper, (d) setting of a screen saver, (e) setting of start-up of resident software, (f) setting of employed peripheral devices, (g) setting of a dominant hand for a mouse or the like, and the like, by simply by presenting the RF-ID card to the laptop. Therefore, if the user brings the RF-ID card in a business trip, the user can operate a different personal computer at the business trip location, with the same settings as those the user usually uses. The seventh embodiment may be implemented further as a game machine having a reader/writer for the RF-ID card and the setting information processing unit. The user visiting a friend's house uses a RF-ID card in which the instruction detail information designates setting change. By presenting the RF-ID card to the game machine at the friend's house, the user can change (a) setting of positions of keys on a remote controller and (b) setting of a structure of a menu screen. In addition, the user can save data in the game machine by using the RF-ID card. Moreover, the following service using the RF-ID card is also possible. The RF-ID card holds the instruction detail information designating a download operation. Such RF-ID cards are offered to users as supplements of magazines or the like. The users can use the RF-ID cards to download an additional scenario, a rare item, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0642" num="0641">The RF-ID card according to the seventh embodiment of the present invention can be also applied to home appliances connected to one another via a network. In this aspect, the RF-ID card previously holds (a) setting of a temperature of an air conditioner, (b) setting for a temperature of hot water in a bus tab, and the like, depending of the user's preference. Thereby, the user presents the RF-ID card to RF-ID reader/writers in the user's house so as to manage settings of the home appliances at once. In addition, the RF-ID card may designate an operation for checking foods stored in a refrigerator. Here, information of the foods which is registered in the refrigerator is obtained by using RF-ID tags previously attached to the foods. Or, video of the inside of the refrigerator is captured by using camcorder. Thereby, the user can check a list of the foods on a TV by using a RF-ID reader/writer to obtain information from the RF-ID card. As described above, the RF-ID card according to the seventh embodiment of the present invention can be applied for various usages. It is also possible to combine (a) RF-ID cards for designating apparatuses (such as four different cards indicating &#x201c;heating appliance&#x201d;, &#x201c;cooling appliance&#x201d;, &#x201c;stove&#x201d;, and &#x201c;fan&#x201d;, respectively) and (b) RF-ID cards for designating setting of the apparatuses (such as three different cards indicating &#x201c;weak&#x201d;, &#x201c;medium&#x201d;, and &#x201c;strong&#x201d;, respectively). It is further possible that such RF-ID cards having the apparatus-designating and setting-designating functions are integrated into a single RF-ID card. And, the settings of the apparatuses can be customized.</p>
<p id="p-0643" num="0642">Although only some exemplary embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail above, those skilled in the art will be readily appreciate that many modifications are possible in the exemplary embodiments without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages of the present invention. Accordingly, all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0644" num="0643">For example, if two users (hereinafter, referred to as a user A and a user B) exchanges photographs between them, the user B can view photographs taken by the user A by the following method. The user B has a TV having an apparatus ID and a relay server having a URL. The apparatus ID and the URL are previously stored in a RF-ID (hereinafter, referred to as a RF tag B). The user B generates information (hereinafter, referred to as device generation information B) from the information in the RF tag B and stores the generated device generation information B into the RF tag B. The user B transmits the device generation information B to the user A via e-mail or the like. The user A stores a URL of a server holding the photographs into the relay server, in association with the received device generation information B. Thereby, the user B simply presents the RF tab B to a RF-ID reader/writer of the TV in order to view the photographs taken by the user A. Here, it is assumed that the RF tag B previously holds an e-mail address of the user A. When the user B simply presents the RF tag B to the RF-ID reader/writer of the TV, the device generation information B may be automatically written into the TV and a notification of the device generation information B may be automatically transmitted to the e-mail address of the user A. Thereby, even if the user B is not familiar with operations of the devices, the user B can exchange photographs with the user A. Furthermore, it is also possible that the user A encrypts at least one of a URL, login ID, and a password by using the device generation information B and sends, to the user B, a post card with RF-ID on which the encrypted information is recorded. This makes it possible to restrict an apparatus permitted to display the photographs, only to the TV of the user B. It is further possible that the user A sends, to the user B, a post card with two RF-IDs that are a RF-ID for sending and a RF-ID for returning. In this aspect, the user A records, onto the RF-ID for returning, device generation information A that is previously generated by a TV or the like of the user A. This can restrict an apparatus permitted to display photographs stored by the user B. More specifically, when the user B receives the post card with the two RF-IDs and returns the post card to the user A, the user B encrypts, by using the device generation information A, a URL, a login ID, or a password of a server storing the photographs of the user B, and then records the encrypted data onto the RF-ID for returning. Or, when the user B stores the photographs, the user B associates the photographs with the device generation information A. Therefore, an apparatus permitted to display photographs stored by the user B can be restricted.</p>
<p id="p-0645" num="0644">Moreover, the mailing object UID of the RF-ID on the mailing object may be a combination of (a) a group ID that is common among a plurality of mailing objects and (b) a UID unique that is unique to each mailing object. Thereby, image data in the server is associated not with every mailing object UID but with the group ID. Therefore, when post cards with RF-ID on which the image data is associated with a plurality of targets are mailed, it is possible to eliminate user's bothersome procedures for performing registration for each of the UIDs. It is also possible that the image data stored in the server in association with the group ID is switched to be permitted or inhibited to be viewed for each of the UID. Thereby, if, for example, a printer prints destination addresses on the mailing objects, the printer having a RF-ID reader/writer reads the UIDs on the mailing objects and thereby associates the UIDs with addresses in an address list, respectively. Thereby, the address list can be used to manage the permission/inhibition of viewing the images stored in the server.</p>
<p id="p-0646" num="0645">It is also possible that a post card or card is provided with a plurality of RF-ID tags having various different functions. In this aspect, the single post card or card can switch the functions by disconnecting communication of a part of the RF-ID tags which are not currently used. For example, a post card has (a) an upper portion on which a RF-ID tag having a function of displaying a slide show of photographs is attached and (b) a lower portion on which a RF-ID tag having a function of reproducing video. A user can switch the display function or the reproduction function, by selecting the upper portion or the lower portion to be brought into proximity of a RF-ID reader/writer. The RF-ID tags having different functions can be provided to a front side and a back side of the post card. It is also possible that covers made of a material blocking communications are applied on the RF-ID tags so that the user can select a RF-ID tag to be used by opening the cover on it.</p>
<p id="p-0647" num="0646">It is further possible that photographs are stored in a plurality of servers, and a RF-ID tag holds URLs of the servers. Thereby, a user can access the servers to obtain the photographs to display them in a list.</p>
<p id="p-0648" num="0647">Moreover, the RF-ID reader/writer may be provided not only to an apparatus (device) such as the TV or the recorder but also to the input means such as a remote controller for operating the apparatus. For instance, if a plurality of apparatuses are connected to one another via a network, an input means for collectively operating the apparatuses may be provided with a RF-ID reader/writer to operate the respective apparatuses. Furthermore, an input means such as a remote controller may be provided with an individual authentication means for biometric authentication such as fingerprint authentication or face authentication, password, or the like. In this aspect, the input means having a RF-ID reader/writer exchanges data with a RF-ID tag, only when the individual authentication is successful. It is also possible that the individual authentication information is previously stored in the RF-ID tag, and individual authentication is performed by the apparatus or the remote controller using the RF-ID tag.</p>
<p id="p-0649" num="0648">It should be noted that the definition of the term &#x201c;RF-ID&#x201d; frequently used in the description of the present invention is not limited to narrow meaning. In general, the term &#x201c;RF-ID&#x201d; narrowly refers to a &#x201c;tag having a nonvolatile memory on which identification information is recorded&#x201d;. RF-ID having a dual interface function or a security function seems commonly called as a &#x201c;IC card&#x201d; or the like. However, in the embodiments of the present invention, the &#x201c;RF-ID&#x201d; widely refers to an &#x201c;electronic circuit which has a nonvolatile memory on which individual identification information is recorded and which can transmit the individual identification information to the outside via an antenna&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0650" num="0649">Conventionally, if a user who is not familiar with operations of an apparatus (device) wishes to perform complicated settings for the apparatus, it is necessary that a seller, repairer, or serviceperson of the apparatus visits a location of the apparatus to perform the settings or controls the apparatus remotely. Even in remotely controlling the apparatus, the seller, repairer, or serviceperson has to visit the location for setting of the remote control. In the seventh embodiment of the present invention, however, the RF-ID card <b>2100</b> enables the user to perform the settings of the apparatus (the recorder <b>2000</b>) without complicated operations. Therefore, even the user not familiar with operations of the recorder can easily change the settings of the recorder.</p>
<p id="p-0651" num="0650">The present invention can be implemented also as an image presentation method of presenting image related to a communication device on an apparatus (device) having a display screen, in a communication system having (a) the apparatus having the display screen, (b) a reader device connected to the apparatus via a communication path, and (c) the communication device performing proximity wireless communication with the reader device. The present invention can be implemented further as a program stored in the communication device with identification information of the communication device, the program being described by codes executed by a virtual machine included in a device performing proximity wireless communication with the communication device, and being for executing: accessing a server connected via a communication network; downloading, form the server, image associated with the identification information from among image stored in the accessed server; and displaying the downloaded image. In addition, the present invention can be implemented as a computer-readable recording medium such as a CD-ROM on which the above program is recorded.</p>
<p id="p-0652" num="0651">The communication device according to the present invention may be used, of course, as various devices having a RF-ID unit in which identification information and a virtual machine program are stored. For example, the communication device may be electronic devices such as a camera, home appliances such as a rice cooker and a refrigerator, and daily commodities such as a toothbrush.</p>
<p id="p-0653" num="0652">Here, an embodiment in which a RF-ID reader is provided to a remote controller of a TV or the like is described with reference to diagrams (a) and (b) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 86</figref>, a flowchart (c) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 86</figref>, and a flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 87</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0654" num="0653">First, as described earlier, a child device (or child communicator) <b>5050</b> such as a camera has the memory (second memory) <b>52</b> and the antenna (second antenna) <b>21</b>. When an antenna <b>5063</b> of a remote controller <b>5051</b> is moved into proximity of the antenna <b>21</b>, the antenna <b>5063</b> supplies power to the antenna <b>21</b>. Thereby, data in the memory <b>52</b> is transmitted from the antenna <b>21</b> to the antenna <b>5063</b>. The remote controller <b>5051</b> converts the received data into digital data by a communication circuit <b>5064</b>, and then stores the digital data into a memory <b>5061</b> (Step <b>5001</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 87</figref>). Then, a transmission unit of the remote controller <b>5051</b> is faced to the TV <b>45</b> and a transmission switch <b>6065</b> on the remote controller <b>5051</b> is pressed (Step <b>5001</b><i>b</i>). Thereby, the data in the memory <b>5061</b> is transmitted as light to a light receiving unit <b>5058</b> of the parent device (apparatus) <b>45</b> (the TV <b>45</b>) via a light emitting unit <b>5062</b> (Step <b>5001</b><i>c</i>). The communication may be not light but wireless.</p>
<p id="p-0655" num="0654">Referring back to a flowchart (c) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 86</figref>, the embodiment of the present invention used in social systems should be applicable even in twenty or thirty years. An example of the program described in a virtual machine language or the like is known Java&#x2122;. However, such programs are expected to be extended or replaced by totally different programs described in more efficient languages. In order to address the above situation, in the embodiment of the present invention, the parent device <b>45</b> such as the TV holds parent device version information <b>5059</b> (or parent device version information n<sub>1</sub>) that indicates a language type or version of a virtual machine language or the like (Step <b>5060</b><i>i </i>in (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 86</figref>). In the beginning of the memory <b>52</b> of the child device <b>5050</b>, child device version information <b>5052</b> (or child device version information n<sub>2</sub>) indicating a version of a program language or the like for the child device is recorded ((a) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 86</figref>). Following to the child device version information <b>5052</b>, a program region <b>5053</b> is recorded in the memory <b>52</b>. The program region <b>5053</b> stores a program <b>5056</b><i>a </i>in a version <b>5055</b><i>a</i>, a program <b>5056</b><i>b </i>in a version <b>5055</b><i>b</i>, and a program <b>5056</b><i>c </i>in a version <b>5055</b><i>c</i>. Following to the program region <b>5053</b>, a data region <b>5054</b> is recorded in the memory <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0656" num="0655">At Step <b>5060</b><i>i </i>in the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 86</figref>, the parent device <b>45</b> stores the parent device version information n<sub>1 </sub>of the parent device <b>45</b> is stored. Then, the parent device <b>45</b> obtains the child device version information n<sub>2 </sub>from the memory of the child device (Step <b>5060</b><i>a</i>). Then, the parent device <b>45</b> selects an execution program n having a maximum value of n<sub>1</sub>&#x2267;n<sub>2 </sub>(Step <b>5060</b><i>b</i>). The parent device <b>45</b> executes the selected execution program (Step <b>5060</b><i>c</i>). Then, it is determined whether or not the parent device <b>45</b> is connected to the Internet (Step <b>5060</b><i>d</i>). If the parent device <b>45</b> is connected to the Internet, then the parent device <b>45</b> is connected to the server via the Internet (Step <b>5060</b><i>e</i>). The parent device <b>45</b> thereby transmits language information <b>5065</b>, which is set in the parent device <b>45</b>, to the server (Step <b>5060</b><i>f</i>). The server provides the parent device <b>45</b> with a program in the language indicated in the transmitted language information <b>5065</b>, for example in French, and causes the parent device <b>45</b> to execute the program. Alternatively, the server may execute the program on the server itself.</p>
<p id="p-0657" num="0656">On the other hand, if it is determined at Step <b>5060</b><i>d </i>that the parent device <b>45</b> is not connected to the Internet, then the processing proceeds to Step <b>5060</b><i>h</i>. At Step <b>5060</b><i>h</i>, the parent device <b>45</b> executes a local program in order to display, on a screen of the parent device <b>45</b>, attribute information of the child device <b>5050</b>. The attribute information is, for example, information for notifying a trouble or information regarding the number of stored photographs. As described above, the memory <b>52</b> in the child device <b>5050</b> holds the child device version information <b>5052</b>. The memory <b>52</b> stores a program, procedure, URL, or the like of each generation. The program, procedure, URL, or the like will be developed every 10 years. Such data format on which information is recorded for each generation can be kept being used even in twenty or thirty years in order to operate the parent device <b>45</b>. (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 86</figref> illustrates an example of information on which versions or generations of a program are recorded. However, the same advantages are also offered in another example illustrated in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 86</figref>. In (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 86</figref>, addresses of data stored in the server are recorded in associated with respective different versions. In this example, a URL <b>5057</b><i>a </i>in a version <b>5055</b><i>d</i>, a URL <b>5057</b><i>b </i>in a version <b>5055</b><i>e</i>, and a URL <b>5057</b><i>c </i>in a version <b>5055</b><i>f </i>are recorded. The above can achieve backward compatibility for many years. For example, it is assumed that a user purchases a product (the parent device <b>45</b>) in version 1 this year and the product has RF-ID. Under the assumption, it is expected that, in twenty or thirty years, programs described in virtual machine languages or the like such as Java&#x2122;, which are compliant to versions 1, 2, and 3, will be installed into the parent device <b>45</b>. In the situation, the child device <b>5050</b> can provide the parent device <b>45</b> with the child device version information <b>5052</b>. Based on the child device version information <b>5052</b>, the parent device <b>45</b> can select a program to be compliant to an appropriate version. It is also expected that, in thirty years, the child device will hold information of programs in all versions 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, a different parent device <b>45</b> in version 3 employs the best function of a version among them. On the other hand, the former parent device <b>45</b> in version 1 employs a rather limited function of a version older than the version employed by the parent device <b>45</b> in version 3. As a result, perfect compatibility can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0658" num="0657">The flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 87</figref> is explained below. At Step <b>5001</b><i>a</i>, pressing a read switch <b>6066</b> on the remote controller <b>5051</b>, a user brings the remote controller <b>5051</b> into proximity of the antenna <b>21</b> of the child device <b>5050</b>. Thereby, data in the memory <b>52</b> of the child device <b>5050</b> is transmitted to the memory <b>5061</b> of the remote controller <b>5051</b>. Next, at Step <b>5001</b><i>b</i>, facing the remote controller <b>5051</b> to the parent device <b>45</b> such as a TV, the user presses a transmission switch <b>6065</b> (Step <b>5001</b><i>b</i>). Thereby, the data in the memory <b>5061</b> is transmitted as light to the parent device <b>45</b> (Step <b>5001</b><i>c</i>). In the embodiment of the present invention, the data is referred to as &#x201c;tag data&#x201d; for convenience. The parent device <b>45</b> extracts or selects an execution program from the tag data (Step <b>5001</b><i>d</i>). The parent device <b>45</b> executes the extracted or selected execution program by a virtual machine language set in the parent device <b>45</b> (Step <b>5001</b><i>e</i>). The parent device <b>45</b> reads Internet connection identification information for the parent device <b>45</b> (Step <b>5001</b><i>f</i>). At Step <b>5001</b><i>g</i>, it is determined whether or not the identification information does not indicate &#x201c;Connectable to the Internet&#x201d; (in other words, it is determined based on the identification information whether or not the parent device <b>45</b> is connectable to the Internet. If the identification information does not indicate &#x201c;Connectable to the Internet&#x201d; until Step <b>5001</b><i>g</i>, then the parent device <b>45</b> executes a non-connectable-state program in the execution program (Step <b>5001</b><i>t</i>). The non-connectable-state program is to be executed when the parent device <b>45</b> is not connectable to the Internet. Then, the parent device <b>45</b> displays a result of the execution on its screen (Step <b>5001</b><i>u</i>). In the embodiment of the present invention, the memory <b>52</b> stores not only the information regarding connection to the Internet, but also the non-connectable-state program to be executed when the parent device <b>45</b> is not connectable to the Internet. Therefore, the parent device <b>45</b> can display a result of a minimum required operation when the parent device <b>45</b> is not connectable to the Internet.</p>
<p id="p-0659" num="0658">On the other hand, if it is determined at Step <b>5001</b><i>g </i>that the identification information indicates &#x201c;Connectable to the Internet&#x201d;, then the parent device <b>45</b> executes a connection program (Step <b>5001</b><i>h</i>). The connection program includes a part of the above execution program.</p>
<p id="p-0660" num="0659">The connection program may be generated by adding, into the execution program in the tag data, data such as a URL of the server, user ID, and a password. More specifically, the added such as a URL of the server, user ID, and a password are added in the data region <b>5054</b> illustrated in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 86</figref>. Such connection program can extend the execution program in the tag data, and also reduce a capacity of the nonvolatile memory in the memory <b>52</b>. In this case, it is also possible that the connection program in the memory <b>52</b> is recorded onto a memory such as a non-rewritable ROM in the program region <b>5053</b>, while the URL of the server and the like are recorded onto the data region <b>5054</b> that is rewritable. As a result, a tip area and a cost can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0661" num="0660">At Step <b>5001</b><i>i</i>, the parent device <b>45</b> connects to a server having a specific URL. At Step <b>5001</b><i>j</i>, it is determined whether or not the server requests the parent device <b>45</b> to upload data to the server. If the server requests for uploading of data, then at Step <b>5001</b><i>p</i>, the parent device <b>45</b> uploads data and/or a program to the server. The server executes a program using the data (Step <b>5001</b><i>q</i>). The server provides a result of the execution to the parent device <b>45</b> (Step <b>5001</b><i>r</i>). The parent device <b>45</b> displays the result and the like of the execution on its screen (Step <b>5001</b><i>s</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0662" num="0661">On the other hand, if it is determined at Step <b>5001</b><i>j </i>that the server does not request for uploading of data, then, the parent device <b>45</b> downloads information including a specific program from the server having the URL (Step <b>5001</b><i>k</i>). The parent device <b>45</b> executes the downloaded program (Step <b>5001</b><i>m</i>). Then, the parent device <b>45</b> displays the result of the execution on its screen (S<b>5001</b><i>n</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0663" num="0662">The memory in the RF-ID unit or the child device has a limited capacity due to restriction on power consumption, a volume, or a cost. Therefore, a common program cannot be stored in the memory. However, the use of the connection program and the server as described in the embodiment of the present invention allows an infinitely large program to be executed.</p>
<p id="p-0664" num="0663">A huge program may be executed on the server. Or, such a program may be downloaded from the server to be executed. These aspects are in the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0665" num="0664">The embodiment described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 86</figref> has been described to use a remote controller of a TV. In this example, the remote controller has a battery, buttons for switching TV channels, an antenna for reading RF-ID, a communication circuit, and an infrared light emitting unit. The remote controller can be replaced by a mobile phone to produce the same effects as described above. Since mobile phones generally have an infrared light emitting unit, they are easily used instead of remote controllers. In addition, mobile phones have a communication line. Therefore, mobile phones can offer the same capability of that of remote controller, being directly connected to the server. However, a communication cost of a mobile phone is burden of a user. A display screen of a mobile phone is significantly smaller than that of a TV. Therefore, a mobile phone may have the transmission switch <b>6065</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 86</figref>. Thereby, if there is a TV near the mobile phone, the user faces the light emitting unit of the mobile phone to the TV to transmit tag data in the memory <b>52</b> of the mobile phone directly to the TV. As a result, the user can view data on a large screen of the TV having a high resolution. The above method does not incur a cost, which is greatly advantageous for the user. The communication using the readout tag data via the mobile phone line is stopped in cooperation with the transmission switch.</p>
<p id="p-0666" num="0665">In this case, in the same manner as described for as the remote controller with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 86</figref>, the mobile phone has at least a reader for RF-ID or a Near Field Communication (NFC) unit. In the future, mobile phones are expected to have a reader function for reading RF-ID or the like. If RF-ID readers are provided to mobile phones, the present invention can be implemented with a much lower additional cost, which is greatly advantageous for the user. Moreover, the present invention can be easily implemented not only as a remote controller or a mobile phone, but also as a Personal Digital Assistance (PDA) terminal, a laptop, or a mobile media player.</p>
<heading id="h-0019" level="1">Eighth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0667" num="0666">The following describes the eighth embodiment according to the present invention with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0668" num="0667">The eighth embodiment describes an aspect different from the aspects described in the first to seventh embodiments. However, the eighth embodiment is a system having the basically same configuration as described in the first to seventh embodiments, including: a terminal device, such as the image capturing device <b>1</b>, which has a RF-ID tag; a communication device, such as the TV <b>45</b>, which has a RF-ID reader/writer; and a server, such as the server <b>42</b>, which is connected to the communication device via a general-purpose network to communicate with the communication device.</p>
<p id="p-0669" num="0668">In the eighth embodiment, for example, a TV remote controller or mobile phone terminal (hereinafter, referred to also as a &#x201c;communication device&#x201d;) which has a RF-ID reader/writer is moved to touch an external device having RF-ID. Thereby, the communication device reads information including ID and the like regarding the external device (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;external device information&#x201d;) from the external device. Then, the communication device pairs the external device information with information regarding the communication device itself (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;communication device information&#x201d;), and transfers the paired information to a server. As a result, it is possible to register, into a database in the server, the external device information in association with the communication device information. The above configuration is useful when a user of the external device wishes to perform user registration of the external device by a single operation using the communication device such as a mobile terminal. For example, it is assumed that the external device information is a product serial number (warranty number) of the external device, and that the communication device information is an e-mail address registered in the communication device. Under the assumption, a single operation of the communication device can read the product serial number of the external device and then register, to the database in the server, the product serial number in association with the e-mail address registered in the communication device. This can simplify user registration of the external device.</p>
<p id="p-0670" num="0669">Conventionally, operations for registering an e-mail address, a product serial number, and the like into a server are performed by a user. The complicated operations inhibit increase of the external devices with user registration. A method described in the eighth embodiment, however, enables a user of the external device to complete user registration by a single operation. Therefore, even if the user is not familiar with Information Technology (IT) devices, the user can easily, speedily, and intuitively perform the user registration. As a result, the registered devices are expected to be increased.</p>

As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 88</figref>, the system according to the eighth embodiment is the basically same system as described in the first to seventh embodiments. The system according to the eighth embodiment includes an external device <b>8001</b>, a communication device <b>8002</b>, and a server <b>8003</b>.</p>

Basically, the external device <b>8001</b> may be anything that can communicate with a reader/writer using a passive/active RF-ID or Near Field Communication (NFC) unit.</p>
<p id="p-0673" num="0672">Examples of the communication device <b>8002</b> according to the eighth embodiment are the communication device such as the TV <b>45</b> described in the first to seventh embodiments, and also a mobile phone terminal and a mobile device. The communication device <b>8002</b> may be anything having a reader/writer which can communicate with the RF-ID or NFC unit of the external device <b>8001</b>. Desirably, the communication device <b>8002</b> is portable.</p>
<p id="p-0674" num="0673">An example of the server <b>8003</b> according to the eighth embodiment is a server connected to the communication device via a general-purpose network, in the same manner as described for the server <b>42</b> according to the first to seventh embodiments. The server <b>8003</b> according to the eighth embodiment includes at least a database <b>8839</b>. The server <b>8003</b> has a function of registering data into the database <b>8839</b> based on information (registration information) transmitted from the communication device <b>8802</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0675" num="0674">For the convenience of the explanation, it is assumed in the following example that the external device <b>8001</b>, the communication device <b>8002</b>, and the server <b>8003</b> are connected in the system. However, each of the external device <b>8001</b>, the communication device <b>8002</b>, and the server <b>8003</b> has specific characteristics in its structure, and the system connecting them has also characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0676" num="0675">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 88</figref>, the external device <b>8001</b> includes a CPU <b>8802</b>, the second memory <b>52</b>, a first encryption unit <b>8803</b>, a modulation/demodulation unit <b>8804</b>, a power induction unit <b>8805</b> (having the same function as that of the second power supply unit <b>91</b>), and an antenna <b>8806</b> for proximity wireless communication.</p>
<p id="p-0677" num="0676">The CPU <b>8802</b> is a system control unit of the external device <b>8001</b>. The CPU <b>8802</b> is supplied with power from the power induction unit <b>8805</b>, a battery (not shown), or other power source.</p>
<p id="p-0678" num="0677">The second memory <b>52</b> has the same structure as that of the second memory <b>52</b> described in the first to seventh embodiments. Therefore, the identical elements in the second memory <b>52</b> are assigned with the same numeral references and will not be explained again below. The second memory <b>52</b> according to the eighth embodiment holds at least UID (product serial number or the like of the external device) for identifying the external device <b>8001</b>. If the external device <b>8001</b> has a function of accumulating use histories of the external device <b>8001</b> or a function of detecting a trouble, for example, the second memory <b>52</b> holds information of the use histories of the external device <b>8001</b> or error codes defining troubles. The information or code corresponds to the captured image state information <b>55</b> in the image capturing device <b>1</b> according to the first to seventh embodiment. Therefore, the second memory <b>52</b> according to the eighth embodiment holds all pieces of information, such as the server specific information for specifying the server <b>8003</b>, which are recorded in the second memory <b>52</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0679" num="0678">The first encryption unit <b>8803</b> encrypts information (detailed data) in the second memory <b>52</b> to prevent tapping and manipulation of the information along a transmission path when the information is to be transmitted to the communication device <b>8002</b> using proximity wireless communication. The encryption is performed using a first cryptography key. The first cryptography key may be a public key or a private key.</p>
<p id="p-0680" num="0679">The modulation/demodulation unit <b>8804</b> performs modulation and demodulation when the external device <b>8001</b> performs proximity wireless communication with the communication device <b>8002</b>. When the information in the second memory <b>52</b> which is encrypted using the first cryptography key is to be transmitted to the communication device <b>8002</b>, the modulation/demodulation unit <b>8804</b> modulates the information to be outputted. On the other hand, when information is received from the communication device <b>8002</b>, the modulation/demodulation unit <b>8804</b> demodulates the received information.</p>
<p id="p-0681" num="0680">The power induction unit <b>8805</b> induces power from radio waves using electromagnetic induction to perform proximity wireless communication with the communication device <b>8002</b>. The power induction unit <b>8805</b> may supply power generated using the electromagnetic induction, to other units included in the external device <b>8001</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0682" num="0681">The antenna <b>8806</b> is a loop antenna for the proximity wireless communication. In the eighth embodiment, it is assumed in proximity wireless communication that the RF-ID or NFC unit operates at a High Frequency (HF) of 15.56 MHz. However, the frequency band is not limited to the above. The frequency band may be an Ultra High Frequency (UHF) ranging from 900 Mz to 1 GHz, or may exceed 2 GHz.</p>
<p id="p-0683" num="0682">Here, the eighth embodiment aims at a simple operation for user registration of the external device <b>8001</b>. Therefore, the second memory <b>52</b> needs to hold UID for identifying each external device <b>8001</b>. It is desirable that the second memory <b>52</b> further holds information for specifying a manufacturer of the external device <b>8001</b>, information for specifying a manufacturing date, information for specifying manufacture processes (factory, line, lot, person in charge of manufacturing), and the like. It is further desirable that the second memory <b>52</b> holds the server specific information <b>48</b> allowing the communication device <b>8002</b> to easily access a specific server of each manufacturer of the external device <b>8001</b>. Thereby, the communication device <b>8802</b> can be connected to the specific server of its manufacturer that differs for each external device <b>8001</b>, without any complicated operations. As a result, a cost of the communication device <b>8002</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0684" num="0683">Next, a structure of the communication device <b>8002</b> is explained. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 88</figref>, the communication device <b>8002</b> according to the eighth embodiment includes a CPU <b>8807</b>, an antenna <b>8808</b>, a modulation/demodulation unit (proximity wireless communication unit) <b>8809</b>, an output switch unit <b>8810</b>, a modulation/demodulation switch unit <b>8811</b>, a registration information generation unit <b>8812</b>, a device information storage unit <b>8813</b>, an input unit <b>8820</b>, a key <b>8821</b>, an external device information memory <b>8822</b>, a second encryption unit <b>8823</b>, an access control information generation unit <b>8824</b>, a server information storage unit <b>8825</b>, a server communication unit <b>8830</b>, an Internet Protocol (IP) communication information storage unit <b>8831</b>, and a display unit <b>8842</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0685" num="0684">The CPU <b>8807</b> is a system controller of the communication device <b>8002</b>. The CPU <b>8807</b> manages operations of each unit included in the communication device <b>8002</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0686" num="0685">The antenna <b>8808</b> corresponds to the antenna unit according to the aspect of the present invention. The antenna <b>8808</b> serves as a partner of the antenna <b>8806</b> in the external device <b>8001</b>. The antenna <b>8808</b> communicates with the external device <b>8001</b> using proximity wireless communication.</p>
<p id="p-0687" num="0686">The modulation/demodulation unit <b>8809</b> corresponds to the proximity wireless communication unit according to the aspect of the present invention. The modulation/demodulation unit <b>8809</b> performs modulation and demodulation for a proximity wireless communication path connected to the external device <b>8001</b>. The modulation/demodulation unit <b>8809</b> demodulates information (the external device information, for example) provided from the external device <b>8001</b>, and modulates information to be transmitted to the external device <b>8001</b>. The modulation method or demodulation method is compatible with various methods such as a high-speed high-output method and a low-speed low-output method. This has been already described in detail in the first embodiment, and therefore will not be described again below.</p>
<p id="p-0688" num="0687">The output switch unit <b>8810</b> is one of the characteristic units in the eighth embodiment. The output switch unit <b>8810</b> is included in the antenna unit according to the aspect of the present invention. The output switch unit <b>8810</b> switches an output power of radio wave signals to be transmitted from the antenna <b>8808</b>. When, for example, the communication device <b>8002</b> is far from the external device <b>8001</b> so that stable communication is impossible between them, the output switch unit <b>8810</b> selects high-output (high-powered) signals. On the other hand, when the communication device <b>8002</b> is near the external device <b>8001</b>, the output switch unit <b>8810</b> selects low-output (low-powered) signals to prevent that the output signals transmitted from the antenna <b>8808</b> interfere with signals transmitted from other devices.</p>
<p id="p-0689" num="0688">The switch of output power is desirably performed according to a request from the external device <b>8001</b>. In this aspect, the external device <b>8801</b> is provided with, for example, a communication radio wave strength measurement unit which detects a voltage value of inducted power or a size of output power of communication radio waves and thereby causes the external device <b>8801</b> to transmit an output switch command to the communication device <b>8802</b>. Based on the command, the output switch unit <b>8810</b> in the communication device <b>8002</b> changes a strength of output signals transmitted from the antenna <b>8808</b>. Here, the information indicating a power level of power inducted by the external device <b>8001</b>, such as the voltage value of inducted power or the size of output power of communication radio waves may be included in the external device information to be transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0690" num="0689">The modulation/demodulation switch unit <b>8811</b> is included in the proximity wireless communication unit according to the aspect of the present invention. The modulation/demodulation switch unit <b>8811</b> switches a modulation method between a high-speed modulation method and a low-speed modulation method. Thereby, when the communication device <b>802</b> is far from the external device <b>8001</b> so that communication quality is not good, the modulation/demodulation switch unit <b>8811</b> selects a low-speed modulation method to assure communication reliability. Here, the switch of speed in modulation/demodulation is desirably performed according to a request from the external device <b>8001</b>. In this aspect, the external device <b>8801</b> is provided with, for example, a communication radio wave strength measurement unit which detects a voltage value of inducted power or a size of output power of communication radio waves and thereby causes the external device <b>8801</b> to transmit a modulation/demodulation switch command to the communication device <b>8802</b>. Based on the command, the modulation/demodulation switch unit <b>8811</b> in the communication device <b>8002</b> changes a modulation method for a communication path for proximity wireless communication with the external device <b>8001</b>. Here, the information indicating a power level of power inducted by the external device <b>8001</b>, such as the voltage value of inducted power and the size of output power of communication radio waves may be included in the external device information to be transmitted. The switch of modulation methods has already been described in the first embodiment in detail, and therefore will not be described again below.</p>
<p id="p-0691" num="0690">An external device ID storage unit <b>8850</b> included in the communication device <b>8002</b> stores external device ID for identifying each external device <b>8001</b>. The external device ID is obtained by proximity wireless communication with the external device <b>8001</b>. The external device ID storage unit <b>8850</b> holds information of output power of communication radio waves and a modulation method for each external device ID. Thereby, only the external device ID which has a small data amount is securely read out at low speed and high output. On the other hand, reading of the information of use histories of regarding the external device (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;use history information&#x201d;) is controlled according to stored data in the external device ID storage unit <b>8850</b> to determine whether or not the use history information can be read at high speed and low output. As a result, it is possible to control the switch of output power of radio waves and the switch of modulation methods for access to each external device <b>8001</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0692" num="0691">In the eighth embodiment, the external device <b>8001</b> may be any various devices as described earlier. The communication device <b>8002</b> cannot access all kinds of external devices <b>8001</b> using the same reading method, because the external devices <b>8001</b> have RF-ID units on respective different positions. It is bothersome to adjust output power and a modulation method for each access. Therefore, in the eighth embodiment, the communication device <b>8002</b> is provided with the external device ID storage unit <b>8850</b> for recording status histories of communication with each external device <b>8001</b>. The recorded histories are used to achieve high-speed proximity wireless communication on the whole, without adjustment for each access. In short, the output switch unit <b>8810</b> and the modulation/demodulation switch unit <b>8811</b> perform their switching processes according to data stored in the external device ID storage unit <b>8850</b>, thereby achieving high-speed proximity wireless communication on the whole. The external device ID storage unit <b>8850</b> may be physically included in the device information storage unit <b>8813</b>. If so, a partial area of the device information storage unit <b>8813</b> is dedicated to the external device ID storage unit <b>8850</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0693" num="0692">The registration information generation unit <b>8812</b> corresponds to the registration information generation unit according to the aspect of the present invention. The registration information generation unit <b>8812</b> generates information (registration information) to be transmitted to the server <b>8003</b>, by adding the communication device information regarding the communication device <b>8002</b> itself which is stored in the device information storage unit <b>8813</b> to the external device information provided from the external device <b>8801</b>. The communication device information added to the external device information is stored in the device information storage unit <b>8813</b>. The communication device information includes communication device identification information <b>8814</b> and user information <b>8815</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0694" num="0693">The communication device identification information <b>8814</b> is identification information for uniquely identifying the communication device <b>8002</b>. The communication device identification information <b>8814</b> is different from a MAC address and an IP address used in communication control. If the communication device <b>8002</b> is a mobile phone terminal, the communication device identification information <b>8814</b> is, for example, identification information for identifying a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card, or identification information registered for each RF-ID reader/writer control application installed in the mobile telephone terminal. Or, the communication device identification information <b>8814</b> may be a product serial number or a serial number of the communication device <b>8002</b>. The user information <b>8815</b> is information for identifying a user of the communication device <b>8002</b>. The user information <b>8815</b> includes, for example, a telephone number <b>8816</b>, an electronic mail (e-mail) address <b>8817</b>, user identification information <b>8818</b>, and a post code <b>8819</b> (or an address, of course).</p>
<p id="p-0695" num="0694">The input unit <b>8820</b> is used to register the communication device information into the device information storage unit <b>8813</b> using the key <b>8821</b>. A slot for a SIM card inserted to a mobile phone terminal is also the input unit <b>8820</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0696" num="0695">The external device information memory <b>8822</b> is a memory that temporarily stores the external device information provided from the external device <b>8001</b> by the proximity wireless communication. The external device information memory <b>8822</b>, which serves as a work memory for the registration information generation unit <b>8812</b>, adds the communication device information to the stored external device information to generate transmission information to be transmitted to the server <b>8003</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0697" num="0696">Here, it is preferable that the registration information generation unit <b>8812</b> generates the registration information in which the communication device information is indicated as parent (primary, stem) information and the external device information is indicated as child (secondary, branch) information. If the communication device information is registered as parent information and the external device is registered as child information in the database <b>8839</b> in the server <b>8003</b> as described later, loads on the server <b>8003</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0698" num="0697">The second encryption unit <b>8823</b> encrypts the transmission information (registration information) that is generated by the registration information generation unit <b>8812</b> to be transmitted to the server <b>8003</b>. A cryptography key used in the second encryption unit <b>8823</b> is a second cryptography key different from the first cryptography key used in the first encryption unit <b>8803</b> of the external device <b>8001</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0699" num="0698">The following describes advantages of employing both the first encryption unit <b>8803</b> in the external device <b>8001</b> and the second encryption unit <b>8823</b> in the communication device <b>8002</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0700" num="0699">The encryption by the first encryption unit <b>8803</b> has two purposes. For the first purpose, the encryption by the first encryption unit <b>8803</b> prevents tapping and manipulation of the external device information transmitted from the external device <b>8001</b> in proximity wireless communication between the external device <b>8001</b> and the communication device <b>8002</b>. For the second purpose, the encryption by the first encryption unit <b>8803</b> prevents that the external device information itself transmitted from the external device <b>8001</b> is inspected by the communication device <b>8002</b>. For example, in the situation where a communication device <b>8002</b> manufactured by a B company reads external device information of an external device <b>8001</b> manufactured by an A company, there is a risk that the communication device <b>8802</b> manufactured by the B company which is a competitor of the A company reads and analyzes use history information of the external device <b>8001</b> manufactured by A company. Therefore, if the external device information regarding the external device <b>8001</b> manufactured by the A company is encrypted in the external device <b>8001</b>, it is possible to reduce the risk that the communication device <b>8002</b> manufactured by the B company reads the external device information.</p>
<p id="p-0701" num="0700">On the other hand, the encryption by the second encryption unit <b>8823</b> has a purpose of preventing tapping and manipulation of the transmission information (registration information) in communication with the server <b>8003</b>. In the configuration according to the eighth embodiment, the external device information transmitted to the server <b>8003</b> has been applied with double encryption processes of the first encryption in the external device <b>8001</b> and the second encryption in the communication device <b>8002</b>. The second cryptography key may be a private key generated depending on a result of authentication with the server <b>8003</b>, or a public key.</p>
<p id="p-0702" num="0701">The access control information generation unit <b>8824</b> corresponds to the access control information generation unit according to the aspect of the present invention. The access control information generation unit <b>8824</b> generates access control information used when the communication device <b>8002</b> accesses the server <b>8003</b>. The access control information is a so-called Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) generated by adding definition of a communication protocol or the server specific information stored in the server information storage unit <b>8825</b> to the transmission information (registration information) generated by the registration information generation unit <b>8812</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0703" num="0702">Here, the server specific information stored in the server information storage unit <b>8825</b> includes a server name <b>8826</b>, a sever address <b>8827</b>, and a login account <b>8828</b> and a login password <b>8829</b> for login to the server <b>8003</b>. Thereby, the access control information that is a so-called URI is generated in a form of a transmission command to be transmitted to the server <b>8003</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0704" num="0703">The server communication unit <b>8830</b> transmits the access control information generated by the access control information generation unit <b>8824</b> to the server <b>8003</b> via the Internet <b>8834</b> on a packet-by-packet basis. In general, communication via the Internet needs IP communication. Therefore, the server communication unit <b>8830</b> automatically adds an IP address <b>8832</b> and a MAC address of the communication device <b>8002</b> which are stored in the IP communication information storage unit <b>8831</b>, to the access control information on a packet-by-packet basis to be transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0705" num="0704">The communication device identification information <b>8814</b> added to the external device information by the registration information generation unit <b>8812</b> is clearly different from the IP address and the MAC address stored in the IP communication information storage unit <b>8831</b>. The MAC address is information for uniquely identifying the communication device <b>8002</b> in communication control. Therefore, the MAC address is information for identifying the device within the Internet communication network. The communication device identification information <b>8814</b>, however, is information registered to specify product attributes of the communication device <b>8002</b>, such as a manufacturer and a product type of the communication device <b>8002</b>. Moreover, while the IP address and the MAC address are added for each transmission packet to the server for communication control, the communication device identification information <b>8814</b> is one of the registration information to be registered into the database <b>8839</b> of the server <b>8003</b>. In addition, the MAC address of the communication device <b>8002</b> is replaced by a MAC address of a router when the packet passes the router before arriving at the server <b>8003</b>. Therefore, the MAC address of the communication device <b>8002</b> has already been deleted when the packet arrives at the server <b>8003</b>. The IP address also has a possibility of being changed by a personal computer or the like. Therefore, the IP address is not information for always identifying the communication device <b>8802</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0706" num="0705">Furthermore, the communication device identification information <b>8814</b> is added to each transmission information (registration information) generated by the registration information generation unit <b>8812</b> to be transmitted to the server <b>8003</b>, while the IP address and the MAC address are added to each communication packet in the communication path to the server <b>8003</b>. Moreover, the communication device identification information <b>8814</b> is applied with the second encryption as the transmission information (registration information) generated by the registration information generation unit <b>8812</b>. However, the IP address and the MAC address added to each packet are not encrypted. The IP address would be encrypted when communication with the server <b>8003</b> is performed using Security Architecture for Internet Protocol (IPsec). However, this encryption is different from the second encryption for encrypting the transmission information (registration information) generated by the registration information generation unit <b>8812</b>. The encryption of IPsec is performed for each IP packet.</p>
<p id="p-0707" num="0706">Next, the server <b>8003</b> according to the eighth embodiment is descried. The server <b>8003</b> according to the eighth embodiment includes a communication unit <b>8835</b>, a second decryption unit <b>8836</b>, a first decryption unit <b>8837</b>, a database registration unit <b>8838</b>, the database <b>8839</b>, a display detail selection unit <b>8840</b>, and a WEB server <b>8841</b>.</p>

The second decryption unit <b>8836</b> thereby extracts the communication device identification information <b>8814</b> and the user information <b>8815</b> added by the communication device <b>8002</b> and the external device information encrypted by the external device <b>8001</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0710" num="0709">The first decryption unit <b>8837</b> decrypts the encrypted external device information that is obtained by the decryption of the second decryption unit <b>8836</b>. The first decryption unit <b>8837</b> thereby extracts the external device information.</p>

Next, the external device information is further encrypted by the communication device <b>8002</b> and transmitted to the server <b>8003</b>. Then, the external device information received by the server <b>8003</b> is decrypted in the server <b>8003</b>. Therefore, the external device information is not inspected by the communication device <b>8802</b>. This produces advantages when the external device <b>8001</b> and the communication device <b>8002</b> are manufactured by different manufacturers, which has already been described earlier and therefore will note be described again here.</p>
<p id="p-0712" num="0711">The database registration unit <b>8838</b> registers (stores) the decrypted communication device information and external device information into the database <b>8839</b>. The communication device information includes the communication device identification information <b>8814</b> and the user information <b>8815</b>. The external device information includes the external device identification information such as a manufacturer and a product serial number for specifying a product type of the external device, the use history information of the external device, trouble history information, and failure codes.</p>
<p id="p-0713" num="0712">The database registration unit <b>8838</b> registers the communication device information as parent (stem) information and the external device information as child (branch, leaf) information, according to the registration information in which the communication device information is indicated as parent (primary, stem) information and the external device information is indicated as child (secondary, branch) information. Therefore, the database <b>8839</b> can manage the communication device information as parent (stem) information and the external device information as child (branch, leaf) information.</p>
<p id="p-0714" num="0713">For example, since the communication device information includes the user information and the like, the communication device information can offer the same effect as that produced by the user registration of the external device <b>8001</b>. More specifically, while a user of the external device <b>8001</b> conventionally needs to perform user registration requiring complicated processes such as entry of user information, a product serial number, and the like, the configuration according to the eighth embodiment enables the user to perform the user registration simply by presenting the communication device <b>8002</b> to the external device <b>8001</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0715" num="0714">In addition, the configuration according to the eighth embodiment allows a manufacturer of the external device <b>8001</b> to examine information associated with the communication device in order to determine which user possesses which product. As a result, a traceability of products can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0716" num="0715">The display detail selection unit <b>8840</b> selects, from the WEB server <b>8841</b>, detail to be displayed on the display unit <b>8842</b> of the communication device <b>8002</b>. More specifically, the display detail selection unit <b>8840</b> selects data to be displayed on the communication device <b>8802</b>, depending on the external device information decrypted by the first decryption unit <b>8837</b>. Thereby, the external device information allows the communication device <b>8002</b> to display a website depending on each external device <b>8001</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0717" num="0716">For example, if the external device <b>8001</b> is a washing machine, a website of the washing machine which includes an instruction manual of the washing machine is displayed. When if the external device <b>8001</b> is a microwave, a website of the microwave is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0718" num="0717">The external device information decrypted in the first decryption unit <b>8837</b> includes, for example, failure codes regarding the external device <b>8001</b>. The display detail selection unit <b>8840</b> can select display detail based on a failure code. Therefore, the display detail selection unit <b>8840</b> can cause the communication device <b>8002</b> to display a website describing how to deal with failures of the external device information.</p>
<p id="p-0719" num="0718">Combination of the display detail selection unit <b>8840</b> and the database <b>8839</b> can transmit, to the communication device <b>8002</b>, a notification of a product having a possibility of causing serious accidents. For example, it is assumed that it is found that a microwave A as the external device <b>8001</b> has a possibility of causing serious accidents. The microwave A has already been touched by the communication device <b>8802</b> (hereinafter, referred to as a &#x201c;communication device A&#x201d;) to register information of the microwave A to the server (in other words, to perform user registration). This means that the information of the microwave A is already registered in the database <b>8839</b> in association with the communication device A. Under the assumption, a user of the communication device A purchases a washing machine B as a new external device <b>8001</b>, and touches the washing machine B by the communication device A. Thereby, the information of the washing machine B is newly registered in the database <b>8839</b> of the server <b>8003</b> in association with the communication device A. This allows the server <b>8003</b> to notice that the communication device A is associated with the microwave A having a possibility of accidents. Therefore, the display detail selection unit <b>8840</b> transmits a registration screen for registering the information of the washing machine B together with a notification for asking to stop use of the microwave A. As a result, the possibility of serious accidents can be significantly reduced.</p>

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 89</figref>, a communication device <b>1</b> touches external devices <b>1</b> to <b>3</b> to register information of these external devices into the database <b>8839</b>, and a communication device <b>2</b> touches external devices <b>4</b> to <b>7</b> to register information of these external devices into the database <b>8839</b>. Here, the communication devices <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> are examples of the communication device <b>8002</b>, and the external devices <b>1</b> to <b>7</b> are examples of the external device <b>8001</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0721" num="0720">The management as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 89</figref> shows that a possessor of the communication device <b>1</b> possesses the external devices <b>1</b> to <b>3</b> and a possessor of the communication device <b>2</b> possesses the external devices <b>4</b> to <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0722" num="0721">Thus, the eighth embodiment is characterized in managing, at least, information of an external device in association with a communication device without registering private information. For example, if a telephone number, an e-mail address, and the like are previously registered in the communication device <b>8002</b> such as a mobile phone, it is possible to manage information of the external device <b>8001</b> in association with the private information registered in the communication device <b>8002</b>. In any cases, the simple operation of touching the external device <b>8001</b> by the communication device <b>8002</b> allows a system to perform user registration or the like.</p>

<p id="p-0725" num="0724">As described above, the user of the external device <b>8001</b> can perform user registration regarding the external device <b>8001</b> by the simple operation of a single touching process using the communication device <b>8002</b>. The system according to the eighth embodiment enables even the external device <b>8001</b> that cannot possess an Internet communication function to perform registration of its external device information including ID, such as user registration, by relaying the information by the communication device <b>8802</b> connectable to the Internet. Conventionally, the user registration requires complicated operations in which a user should enter data by hands to a personal computer or mobile phone connectable to the Internet. The eighth embodiment can simplify the complicated operations. In the eighth embodiment, the external device <b>8001</b> does not need to have an expensive Internet connection device. Instead, the external device <b>8001</b> is provided with a module for proximity wireless communication, such as a RF-ID unit, which is implemented at a significantly low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0726" num="0725">As described above, according to the eighth embodiment, the system configuration connecting the external device <b>8001</b>, the communication device <b>8002</b>, and the server <b>8003</b> can simplify user registration regarding the external device <b>8001</b>. As described earlier, each of the external device <b>8001</b>, the communication device <b>8002</b>, and the server <b>8003</b> has a characteristic structure.</p>
<p id="p-0727" num="0726">Although the eighth embodiment has been described in detail above for the communication device according to the present invention, those skilled in the art will be readily appreciate that many modifications are possible in the embodiment without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages of the present invention.

<p id="p-0729" num="0728">The following describes the ninth embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 91</figref> illustrates environments of home networks assumed in the ninth embodiment. A home network is established in each of houses M<b>1001</b>, M<b>1002</b>, and M<b>1003</b>. Each of the home networks is connected to a registration server M<b>1005</b> via the Internet M<b>1004</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0730" num="0729">If services provided via a home network are limited within a corresponding house, the registration server M<b>1005</b> may exist in the house. It is also possible that a home network is divided into various places such as a vacation house and an office, and that a plurality of home networks are used in a single house such as a dormitory or a room-sharing house.</p>
<p id="p-0731" num="0730">It is assumed that, in a house, there are home appliances which are always connected to the Internet M<b>1004</b> (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;always-connected home appliances&#x201d;) and home appliances which are not always connected to the Internet M<b>1004</b> (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;non-always-connected home appliances&#x201d;). The always-connected home appliances, such as TVs M<b>1008</b> and M<b>1009</b>, a DVD recorder M<b>1010</b>, and the like, are connected to the Internet M<b>1004</b> via a router M<b>1006</b> or a wireless Access Point (AP) M<b>1007</b>. The non-always-connected home appliances, such as a digital camera M<b>1011</b>, a microwave M<b>1012</b>, and a refrigerator M<b>1013</b>, are indirectly connected to the Internet M<b>1004</b> as needed. In the ninth embodiment, a mobile terminal such as a mobile phone M<b>1014</b> is also a terminal included in the home network.</p>
<p id="p-0732" num="0731">The devices in the ninth embodiment can perform simple data communication with other device each other by using a proximity wireless communication device. Each of the devices obtains information of other device using the proximity wireless communication device, and registers the obtained information into the registration server M<b>1005</b> using a home network device.</p>
<p id="p-0733" num="0732"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 92</figref> is a hardware diagram of a communication device M<b>1101</b> according to the ninth embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0734" num="0733">The communication device M<b>1101</b> is assumed to have two devices for communication.</p>
<p id="p-0735" num="0734">One of them is a proximity wireless communication device M<b>1102</b>. The proximity wireless communication device M<b>1102</b> is generally a so-called NFC or RF tag.</p>
<p id="p-0736" num="0735">The other device is a home network communication device M<b>1103</b>. Examples of the home network communication device M<b>1103</b> are: a wireless communication device using wireless Local Area Network (LAN) or ZigBee, which is used in connecting home appliances to each other; a wired communication device using Ethernet&#x2122; or Poser Line Communication (PLC); and a communication device using WiMax or Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), which is used in mobile phones.</p>
<p id="p-0737" num="0736">The communication device M<b>1101</b> also includes a user interface (IF) device M<b>1104</b>. The user IF device is, for example, an input device such as buttons, a display, and an output device using a Light Emitting Diode (LED) or the like. For devices such as TVs and air conditioners, data input/output is generally performed by using a remote controller that is physically separated from the device. For convenience of the description, such a remote controller is also considered as the user IF device M<b>1104</b> in the ninth embodiment of the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0739" num="0738">A device UID obtainment unit M<b>1202</b> in the communication device M<b>1101</b> obtains information including device UID for identifying a registration device M<b>1201</b> (that is a device to be registered), by using the proximity wireless communication device M<b>1102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0740" num="0739">Here, the registration device M<b>1201</b> transmits a registration command and registration information including device UID of the registration device M<b>1201</b> to the communication device M<b>1101</b>, by using the proximity wireless communication device M<b>1102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0741" num="0740">A registration information generation unit M<b>1204</b> obtains the registration information including the device UID from the device UID obtainment unit M<b>1202</b>, and obtains home ID from a home ID management unit M<b>1205</b>. Then, the registration information generation unit M<b>1204</b> adds the home ID to the registration information obtained from the registration device M<b>1201</b> via the device UID obtainment unit M<b>1202</b>, to generate information-added registration information. If position information of the registration device M<b>1201</b> or the like is to be added to the registration information, the registration information generation unit M<b>1204</b> obtains the position information from a position information obtainment unit M<b>1206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0742" num="0741">Examples of the position information are address information based on a post code inputted to a TV, geographical position information generated by a Global Positioning System (GPS) of a mobile phone, and the like.

<p id="p-0745" num="0744">In conventional home networks, a master device of each communication device manages information for the communication device. The management method is different depending on a type of the corresponding communication device. Therefore, it is not possible to manage information on home-by-home basis. Although there is a situation where ID is inputted by a user for each service, this results in quite low usability.</p>
<p id="p-0746" num="0745">In the ninth embodiment, introduction of new different ID that is home ID makes it possible to manage pieces of information of devices included in a home network without using a communication device or services.</p>
<p id="p-0747" num="0746">When the home ID management unit M<b>1205</b> registers information of a device to the server at the first time, the home ID management unit generates home ID. The home ID may be generated based on position information or UID of the communication device. It is also possible to generate home ID based on a random number to check whether or not the generated home ID does not overlap with any other ID in the registration server. It is further possible that a user sets the home ID.</p>
<p id="p-0748" num="0747">When a registration information transmitting/receiving unit M<b>1207</b> in the communication device M<b>1101</b> receives registration information from the registration information generation unit M<b>1204</b>, the registration information transmitting/receiving unit M<b>1207</b> transmits the received registration information to the registration server M<b>1005</b> using the home network communication device M<b>1103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0749" num="0748">The registration server M<b>1005</b> compares the received registration information to pieces of information stored in the registration database M<b>1208</b> to determine whether or not the received registration information can be registered.

On the other hand, if the communication device M<b>1101</b> has the home ID (YES at M<b>1302</b>), the communication device M<b>1101</b> generates information of the communication device to be registered into the communication device M<b>1101</b> itself (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;registration information&#x201d; or &#x201c;home ID&#x201d;) (M<b>1304</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0754" num="0753">Next, the communication device M<b>1101</b> transmits the registration information to the registration server M<b>1005</b> by using the registration information transmitting/receiving unit M<b>1207</b> (M<b>1305</b>).</p>

On the other hand, if the communication device M<b>1101</b> receives the response, then the communication device M<b>1101</b> presents the user with an inquiry asking whether or not to register the generated information into the communication device M<b>1101</b> (M<b>1308</b>). If the user replies OK, then the communication device M<b>1101</b> completes the registration processing. If the user replies NO, the communication device M<b>1101</b> returns to the home ID obtainment. When it is difficult to obtain home ID, the registration processing is terminated as a failure.</p>
<p id="p-0756" num="0755"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 95</figref> is a flowchart of the home ID obtainment.</p>
<p id="p-0757" num="0756">The communication device M<b>1101</b> determines whether or not the communication device M<b>1101</b> has a function of automatically generating home ID (hereinafter, referred to also as an &#x201c;automatic generation function&#x201d;) (M<b>1401</b>). If the communication device M<b>1101</b> has the function, then the communication device M<b>1101</b> automatically generates the home ID. On the other hand, if the communication device M<b>1101</b> does not have the function, the communication device M<b>1101</b> asks the user to manually input the home ID. If there is no method for manually inputting home ID or the user refuses to the manual input, then the communication device M<b>1101</b> notifies the user of a failure of the registration processing (M<b>1403</b>) to persuade the user to obtain the home ID by any different method. When the communication device M<b>1101</b> automatically generates home ID, the communication device M<b>1101</b> selects an appropriate automatic generation function (M<b>1404</b>). If the communication device M<b>1101</b> can obtain geographical position information by a GPS or the communication device M<b>1101</b> is a terminal such as a TV for which an address as position information has been generally registered, the communication device M<b>1101</b> generates the home ID using the position information (M<b>1405</b>). If the communication device M<b>1101</b> is a terminal generally set in a house, the communication device M<b>1101</b> generates the home ID using a unique identifier of the communication device M<b>1101</b> (M<b>1406</b>). Especially if it is difficult to generate effective home ID, the communication device M<b>1101</b> generates the home ID using a random number (M<b>1407</b>). After generating the home ID, the communication device M<b>1101</b> transmits the home ID to the server (M<b>1408</b>).

<p id="p-0762" num="0761">Communication devices M<b>1101</b>S and M<b>1101</b>R included in a home network share the same home ID using a home network M<b>1601</b> and the home network communication devices M<b>1103</b>. The communication devices M<b>1101</b>S and M<b>1101</b>R may share the home ID using the proximity wireless communication devices M<b>1102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0763" num="0762">The communication device according to the tenth embodiment (hereinafter, referred to as a &#x201c;transmitting communication device M<b>1101</b>S&#x201d;) can share the home ID with another communication device (hereinafter, referred to as a &#x201c;receiving communication device M<b>1101</b>R&#x201d;) in the same house, by transferring a sharing command and home ID to the receiving communication device via the proximity wireless communication devices M<b>1102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0764" num="0763">In the transmitting communication device M<b>1101</b>S, a home ID sharing unit M<b>1602</b>S in a home ID management unit M<b>1205</b>S provides the sharing command and the home ID that is held in a home ID storage unit M<b>1209</b>S, to a proximity wireless communication device M<b>1102</b>S.</p>
<p id="p-0765" num="0764">For example, when the proximity wireless communication device M<b>1102</b>S of the transmitting communication device M<b>1101</b>S is moved into proximity of a proximity wireless communication device M<b>1102</b>R of the receiving communication device M<b>1101</b>R, information is transferred between them.</p>

The registration server M<b>1005</b> may notify both communication devices of one of the home IDs to unify them. Even in this case, the registration server M<b>1005</b> manages both home IDs virtually as a single home ID since there are non-always-connected devices in the home network. It is possible that ID of a non-always-connected device is updated every time of being connected to the home network and the virtual management by the registration server M<b>1005</b> ends when updating of all of the registration devices (namely, devices to be registered which are included in the home network) are completed. Thereby, it is possible to unify originally plural home networks into a single network.</p>
<p id="p-0768" num="0767">The home ID sharing can be performed by using the home network. When a communication device is to be connected to the home network M<b>1601</b> and a home network connection detection unit M<b>1603</b>S of the communication device detects that the communication device does not hold home ID, the communication device broadcasts a request for home ID sharing to terminals connected to the home network M<b>1601</b>. Terminals holding home ID among the terminals connected to the home network M<b>1601</b> transmit the home ID to the communication device. Thereby, the home ID sharing is completed prior to start of communication. Here, if a master terminal to respond to requests for home ID sharing is previously selected from among terminals holding the home ID, it is possible to prevent that a device requesting home ID sharing receives responses from a plurality of terminals thereby overburdening the home network. If there is no response, the communication device terminal requesting home ID sharing may obtain home ID by itself.</p>

A piece of failure information detected by the failure sensor unit Y<b>012</b> is accumulated in a RAM in the memory Y<b>014</b>. The detected failure information is represented by an error code that is uniquely defined depending on a location and condition of the failure.</p>
<p id="p-0789" num="0788">The use history logging unit Y<b>013</b> is a unit that performs logging for each piece of use history information every time the terminal device Y<b>01</b> is operated by the user. The use history information applied with logging is accumulated into the RAM Y<b>016</b> in the memory Y<b>014</b>. In general, when use history information is used to examine how a failure has occurred, several pieces of use history information up to occurrence of the failure have high priorities of being examined. Therefore, it is desirable that the use history logging unit Y<b>013</b> according to the eleventh embodiment uses the RAM Y<b>016</b> as First In First Out (FIFO) to chronologically accumulate new pieces of use history information into the RAM Y<b>016</b>. Moreover, when use history information is used to examine how a failure has occurred, it is desirable that several pieces of use history information up to a timing detected by the failure sensor unit Y<b>012</b> are stored as priorities into the RAM. Therefore, if when five minor failures are detected in using the terminal device Y<b>01</b>, several pieces of operation (use) history information up to the five failures are stored as priorities.</p>
<p id="p-0790" num="0789">The memory Y<b>014</b> includes a ROM Y<b>015</b> and the RAM Y<b>016</b>.</p>

The product serial number is desirably information by which a manufacturer, a manufacturing lot number, and a manufacturing date of the terminal device Y<b>01</b> can be determined. It is also desirable that the ROM Y<b>015</b> is embedded in a semiconductor chip of the CPU Y<b>011</b>. This structure prevents information during memory access to be easily inspected.

<p id="p-0796" num="0795">Next, the communication device Y<b>02</b> according to the eleventh embodiment is described. It should be noted that the subject of the eleventh embodiment is the communication device Y<b>02</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0798" num="0797">The antenna Y<b>021</b> performs polling for calling any terminal devices in order to search for a terminal device communicable with the communication device Y<b>02</b> by proximity wireless communication. In receiving a response to the polling, the antenna Y<b>021</b> establishes proximity wireless communication with the responding terminal device Y<b>01</b> to receive modulated terminal device information from the terminal device Y<b>01</b>, and provides the modulated terminal device information to the demodulation unit Y<b>023</b>. In general, the polling processing is always necessary even if there is no terminal device communicable with the communication device Y<b>02</b> by proximity wireless communication. This consumes power. Therefore, the communication device Y<b>02</b> is provided with a switch (not shown) for controlling a timing of start of polling, so that polling processing is performed when the switch is turned ON. This structure can significantly shorten a time period of the polling. As a result, the power consumption amount can be considerably reduced.

The product serial number is desirably information by which a manufacturer, a manufacturing lot number, and a manufacturing date of the communication device Y<b>02</b> can be determined. It is also desirable that the ROM Y<b>025</b> is embedded in a semiconductor chip of the CPU Y<b>022</b>. This structure prevents information during memory access from being easily inspected. Therefore, secret key information for authentication and encrypted communication in proximity wireless communication with the terminal device Y<b>01</b> can be recorded on the ROM Y<b>025</b> when shipping.</p>

<p id="p-0804" num="0803">The position information determination unit Y<b>027</b> is a group of sensors for determining a location of the communication device Y<b>02</b>. The position information determination unit Y<b>027</b> includes a latitude/longitude positioning unit (GPS) Y<b>028</b>, an altitude positioning unit Y<b>029</b>, and a position correction unit Y<b>030</b>. The position information determination unit Y<b>027</b> does not need to always determine a location of the communication device Y<b>02</b> (location information) if the location information is generated at a timing where the communication device Y<b>02</b> becomes communicable with the terminal device Y<b>01</b> using the antenna Y<b>021</b>. As a result, power consumption of the communication device Y<b>02</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0805" num="0804">The latitude/longitude positioning unit Y<b>028</b> is a general Global Positioning System (GPS) that receives radio waves from satellites to perform 3-dimensional positioning of the earth.</p>

The altitude positioning unit Y<b>029</b> may be any various altimeters, such as an altimeter receiving radio waves to extract an altitude, an altimeter detecting an air pressure to measure an altitude, and the like. The altitude positioning unit Y<b>029</b> is provide to the communication device Y<b>02</b> so that an altitude can be detected even in a building where GPS cannot receive radio waves.</p>
<p id="p-0807" num="0806">The position correction unit Y<b>030</b> is a unit that corrects a value measured by the GPS to generate more accurate position information. In general, when radio waves from satellites cannot be received in a room or the like, the GPS cannot generate correct position information. Therefore, the position correction unit Y<b>030</b> includes an electronic compass and a 6-axis acceleration sensor. The electronic compass is used to detect a direction in which the communication device Y<b>02</b> moves and the acceleration sensor is used to detect a speed of the movement. Thereby, it is possible to correct position information generated by the GPS in a location where the GPS is difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0808" num="0807">Regarding the information adding unit Y<b>035</b>, when the terminal device information that has been provided from the terminal device Y<b>01</b> and stored into the memory Y<b>024</b> is to be transmitted to the server Y<b>04</b>, the information adding unit Y<b>035</b> adds (a) the product serial number of the communication device Y<b>02</b> that is stored in the ROM Y<b>025</b> in the memory Y<b>024</b> and (b) the position information measured by the position information determination unit Y<b>027</b>, to the terminal device information. This enables the server Y<b>04</b> to determine which communication device transmits the terminal device information, where the transmitting terminal device is located, for example, and then manage the results of the determination. For example, if a manufacturer of the terminal device finds that the terminal device has a possibility of causing serious accidents, the information in the database of the server Y<b>04</b> allows the manufacturer to determine where the terminal device is. Thereby, the possibility of causing serious accidents can be reduced. As a result, it is possible to increase sense of safety and security of the user using the terminal device. Furthermore, when the communication device Y<b>02</b> has a display function as mobile phone terminals have, the above-described terminal device information generated by the information adding unit Y<b>035</b> makes it possible to determine with which communication device the terminal device having a possibility of accidents can perform proximity wireless communication, and thereby display a notification of the possibility of accidents in the terminal device on the communication device Y<b>02</b>. Thereby, even if such a terminal device generally does not have any display function and is not connected to a general-purpose network, it is possible to transmit a notification of the accident possibility of the terminal device to the communication device Y<b>02</b> in order to warn the user using the terminal device. As a result, it is also possible to provide a terminal device that can increase sense of safety and security of the user using the terminal device.</p>
<p id="p-0809" num="0808">The communication unit Y<b>036</b> is a unit that communicates with the server Y<b>04</b> via the Internet by using general LAN, wireless LAN, or mobile phone network.

In the device management DB Y<b>041</b> according to the eleventh embodiment, the communication device information is managed as parent device information, and the terminal device information is managed as child device information in association with the parent device information. The child device information is added with the position information generated by the communication device in order to manage further information indicating where the terminal device is.</p>
<p id="p-0812" num="0811">As described above, in the system according to the eleventh embodiment, the terminal device information is read from the terminal device by the communication device using proximity wireless communication. The communication device is touched to the terminal device to communicate with the terminal device to obtain the terminal device information. The communication device adds a product serial number and position information of the communication device to the obtained terminal device information, and transmits the generated information to the server. Thereby, the server can manage the communication device information as parent device information in association with the terminal device information as child device information. Therefore, if a manufacturer of the terminal device finds that the terminal device would cause serious accidents, the manufacture can easily recall the terminal device or display a notification of a possibility of the serious accident on a display unit of the communication device. As a result, it is possible to achieve traceability of the products and to provide the users of the products with safety and security.</p>

The generation of the position information is not limited to be performed only in completion of the polling. The position information may be generated any time while the proximity wireless communication is established after the response to the polling. It is important to determine the position of the terminal device at a high accuracy, by generating position information of the position where proximity wireless communication, which can be performed when a distance between communicating devices is only several centimeters, is established.</p>

Here, the communication device information includes, for example, a product serial number of the communication device Y<b>02</b>, position information of the communication device Y<b>02</b> when proximity wireless communication with the terminal device Y<b>01</b> is established, an e-mail address of the user registered in the communication device Y<b>02</b> (if any), a connection account to the server Y<b>04</b> registered in the communication device Y<b>02</b> (if any), and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0822" num="0821">After adding the communication device information to the terminal device information at SY<b>08</b>, then the communication device Y<b>02</b> transmits the terminal device information added with the communication device information to the server Y<b>04</b> (SY<b>09</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0823" num="0822">The server Y<b>04</b> registers the terminal device information added with the communication device information received from the communication device Y<b>02</b>, into the device management DB Y<b>041</b>. Thereby, the processing is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0824" num="0823">Thereby, the server Y<b>04</b> can manage pieces of information regarding devices for each house, by managing information of each terminal device Y<b>01</b>, which establishes proximity wireless communication with the communication device Y<b>02</b> touching the terminal device Y<b>01</b>, in association with identification information (product serial number or the like) of the communication device Y<b>02</b>. In addition, for the position information registered as information of a position at which the terminal device is equipped, position information indicating a position where proximity wireless communication is established between the communication device Y<b>02</b> and the terminal device Y<b>01</b> is used. Since the proximity wireless communication according to the eleventh embodiment is performed at common High Frequency (HF) of 13.56 MHz, the communication is possible when a distance between communicating devices is within several centimeters. Therefore, if the position information detected in establishing proximity wireless communication is set to be position information of the terminal device, a maximum error is several centimeters which results in assuring an enough accuracy to achieve traceability of the products.</p>
<p id="p-0825" num="0824"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 106</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a group of pieces of information of terminal devices managed in association with information of the communication device Y<b>02</b> in the device management DB Y<b>041</b> of the server Y<b>04</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0826" num="0825">When the user intends to perform user registration or the like for a terminal device using the communication device Y<b>02</b> in purchasing the terminal device, the following processing is performed. The user equips the terminal device and touches the terminal device by the communication device Y<b>02</b>. Thereby, terminal device information of the terminal information is provided to the communication device Y<b>02</b> using proximity wireless communication. The communication device Y<b>02</b> adds the communication device information of the communication device Y<b>02</b> to the terminal device information in order to be transmitted to the server Y<b>04</b>. In receiving the terminal device information added with the communication device information, the server Y<b>04</b> manages the terminal device information as child device information and the communication device information as parent device information in association with each other in the device management DB. For example, in the device management DB, terminal device information of a terminal device <b>1</b> (for example, a microwave Y<b>052</b>), terminal device information of a terminal device <b>2</b> (for example, a washing machine Y<b>053</b>), and terminal device information of a terminal device <b>3</b> (for example, a TV Y<b>054</b>), all of which are touched by a communication device Y<b>051</b>, are managed in association with a product serial number of the communication device Y<b>051</b>. Each of the terminal device information includes whereabout information (longitude, latitude, altitude, and the like) and use status information (use histories, error codes, use time periods, and the like). Thereby, the server Y<b>04</b> can manage pieces of information of devices for each house, because the communication device Y<b>051</b> touches these terminal devices. As a result, traceability of the terminal devices can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0827" num="0826">Furthermore, the communication device generates position information when proximity wireless communication with the terminal device is established and uses the generated position information as position information of the terminal device. Therefore, it is possible to register a position of the terminal device with an error of several centimeters which is a distance capable for proximity wireless communication between devices. Since the GPS in the communication device is used to generate the position information of the terminal device, each terminal device does not have a GPS, thereby reducing a cost.</p>

<p id="p-0830" num="0829">When the user operates the communication device Y<b>02</b> to start up a reader/writer application of the communication device Y<b>02</b>, the communication device Y<b>02</b> displays, on a display screen, a message persuading the user to touch the terminal device Y<b>01</b> for proximity wireless communication (Y<b>060</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0831" num="0830">When the communication device Y<b>02</b> touches the terminal device Y<b>01</b>, proximity wireless communication is established between the devices. The communication device Y<b>02</b> reads terminal device information of the terminal device Y<b>01</b> from the terminal device Y<b>01</b>, generates position information of a current position, and provides the pieces of information to the memory in which the pieces of information are temporarily stored. Then, the communication device Y<b>02</b> establishes communication with the server Y<b>04</b> and transmits the terminal device information added with communication device information of the communication device Y<b>02</b> to the server Y<b>04</b>. The server Y<b>04</b> determines whether or not the terminal device information has already been registered in the device management DB. If it is determined that the terminal device information has not yet been registered in the device management DB, then the server Y<b>04</b> causes the communication device Y<b>02</b> to display, on the display unit of the communication device Y<b>02</b>, a message asking the user whether or not to register information of the terminal device Y<b>01</b> (Y<b>061</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0832" num="0831">Next, when the user selects to register the information of the terminal device Y<b>01</b>, the server Y<b>04</b> causes the communication device Y<b>02</b> to display a message asking the user whether or not to register position information of the terminal device. When the user selects to register the position information, the server Y<b>04</b> registers the position information associated with the terminal device information transmitted from the communication device Y<b>02</b> to the server Y<b>04</b>, into the device management DB of the server Y<b>04</b> as position information of the terminal device Y<b>01</b> (Y<b>062</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0833" num="0832">Next, the description is given for the situation where the position information of the terminal device Y<b>01</b> is different from the position information registered in the device management DB of the server Y<b>04</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0835" num="0834">When the communication device Y<b>02</b> touches the terminal device Y<b>01</b>, proximity wireless communication is established between the devices. The communication device Y<b>02</b> reads terminal device information of the terminal device Y<b>01</b> from the terminal device Y<b>01</b>, generates position information, and transmits the terminal device information added with communication device information of the communication device Y<b>02</b> to the server Y<b>04</b>. The server Y<b>04</b> compares (a) a product serial number of the terminal device which is included in the received terminal device information to (b) a product serial number registered in the device management DB, in order to examine whether or not information of the touched terminal device is already registered in the server Y<b>04</b>. In addition, the server Y<b>04</b> extracts the position information from the received communication device information, and examines whether or not the extracted position information is identical to the position information registered in the device management DB. Since the position information has an error, of course, the determination is made to compare the position information to a threshold value that has the order of several centimeters (in other words, the threshold value is a value corresponding to a distance between devices capable for proximity wireless communication). If it is determined that the extracted position information is different from the registered position information, the server Y<b>04</b> causes the communication device Y<b>02</b> to display, on the display unit, a message notifying the user of the result of the determination (Y<b>064</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0836" num="0835">Then, the communication device Y<b>02</b> displays, on the display unit, a message asking the user whether or not to update the position information of the terminal device Y<b>01</b> to information of a current position of the terminal device Y<b>01</b> (Y<b>065</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0837" num="0836">If the user selects to update the position information, the communication device Y<b>02</b> registers the position information generated by touching the terminal device Y<b>01</b> by the communication device Y<b>02</b>, into the device management DB of the server Y<b>04</b> as new position information of the terminal device Y<b>01</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0838" num="0837">Therefore, according to the eleventh embodiment, even if the position information that has been registered is changed because the terminal device Y<b>01</b> is moved and equipped at a different location, it is possible to update the position information to new position information that is generated by touching the terminal device Y<b>01</b> by the communication device Y<b>02</b>.

For example, the mobile device N<b>20</b> may have only the 6-axis sensor N<b>32</b>. In this aspect, the product information management unit N<b>45</b> in the registration server N<b>40</b> stores pieces of relative position information of products which are relative to a reference point (position information) of the TV N<b>10</b>A which is first registered as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 122</figref>. Here, a product map generated by the position information generation unit N<b>48</b> has axes of an x-coordinate, a y-coordinate, and a z-coordinate as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 123</figref>.</p>

For example, if the registration server N<b>40</b> receives again server registration information regarding a product for which registration has already been completed, the registration server N<b>40</b> may perform processing as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 124</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0944" num="0943"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 124</figref> is a table illustrating examples of an accuracy identifier, part number ID, and processing.</p>
<p id="p-0945" num="0944">The following describes <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 124</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 124</figref>, the table includes: (a) accuracy identifiers for identifying an accuracy of position information; (b) part number ID in association with each accuracy identifier; and (c) processing to be performed when position information in re-received server registration information is different from position information registered in the product information management unit N<b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0946" num="0945">If the registration server N<b>40</b> determines, based on the part number ID and the UID included in the re-received server registration information, that the position information has already been registered in the product information management unit N<b>45</b>, then the registration server N<b>40</b> checks the part number ID. If the part number ID indicates a TV, a BD recorder, or an FF heater, the registration server N<b>40</b> updates the position information in the product information management unit N<b>45</b> to the position information in the re-received server registration information.</p>
<p id="p-0947" num="0946">If the part number ID indicates an air conditioner, a solar panel, or a fire alarm, then the registration server N<b>40</b> notifies the mobile device N<b>20</b> of the position information stored in the product information management unit N<b>45</b>. The mobile device N<b>20</b> thereby corrects current position information of the mobile device N<b>20</b> based on the position information received from the registration server N<b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0948" num="0947">It should also be noted that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 124</figref> shows the two kinds of accuracy identifiers, but the accuracy identifiers are not limited to the two kinds. It is possible to set more than two kinds of accuracy identifiers for respective different processing.</p>
<p id="p-0949" num="0948">It should also be noted that the product control unit N<b>49</b> in the twelfth embodiment is included in the registration server N<b>40</b>, but the present invention is not limited to the structure. For example, the product control unit N<b>49</b> may be included in the mobile device N<b>20</b> so that the product control unit N<b>49</b> obtains a product map from the registration server N<b>40</b> to control products. Besides in the mobile device N<b>20</b>, the product control unit N<b>49</b> may also be included in a home server (not illustrated) that is connected to the hone network N<b>100</b>. In this aspect, the mobile device N<b>20</b> transmits position information to the home server and obtains a product map from the home server.</p>
<p id="p-0950" num="0949">It should be noted that the mobile device N<b>20</b> according to the twelfth embodiment is connected to the registration server N<b>40</b> via the home network N<b>100</b> and the external network N<b>101</b> by using the communication I/F unit (general-purpose I/F unit) N<b>27</b>, but the present invention is not limited to the above. For example, the mobile device N<b>20</b> may have a function of serving as a mobile phone so that the mobile device N<b>20</b> can be connected to the registration server N<b>40</b> via at least a mobile phone network (for example, Long Term Evolution (LTE)) by using an interface connectable to the mobile phone network, in stead of the communication I/F unit N<b>27</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 125</figref>). Furthermore, the mobile device N<b>20</b> may have an interface connectable to a circuit network such as WiMAX so as to be connected to the registration server N<b>40</b> via at least the WiMAX network. Any other networks can be used to connect the mobile device N<b>20</b> to the registration server N<b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0951" num="0950">It should also be noted that, in the twelfth embodiment, the product map generated by the position information generation unit N<b>48</b> is used to determine how to control products, but the present invention is not limited to the structure. For example, image data of the product map generated by the position information generation unit N<b>48</b> is transmitted to the mobile device N<b>20</b> that displays the image data on the display unit N<b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0952" num="0951">It should also be noted that, in the twelfth embodiment, the position information generation unit N<b>48</b> generates the product map based on the information illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 115B</figref>, but the present invention is not limited to the above. For example, pieces product information of products located near the position information of the mobile device N<b>20</b> in the same house are detected from the product information management unit N<b>45</b>, and then used to generate a product map regarding nearby products in the house. In this aspect, the product control unit N<b>49</b> performs product control by combining the product map of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 121</figref> and the product map of nearby products. For instance, it is assumed in the twelfth embodiment that the TV N<b>10</b>A, which is the farthest from the mobile device N<b>20</b>, is turned OFF but there is a solar panel near the mobile device N<b>20</b> in the house. Under the assumption, the product control unit N<b>49</b> controls the TV N<b>10</b>A to be turned ON, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0953" num="0952">It should also be noted that, in the twelfth embodiment, the product information management unit N<b>45</b> in the registration server N<b>40</b> stores part number ID, UID, and position information of each product, but the present invention is not limited to the above. For example, it is also possible that a power state (ON or OFF) is obtained in real time from each product via the communication I/F unit N<b>18</b> of the product, and then managed in the product information management unit N<b>45</b>. The product control unit N<b>49</b> thereby controls power of the TV N<b>10</b>A located the farthest from the mobile device N<b>20</b> to be kept ON when the predetermined number of products are powered OFF, although it has been described n the above description that the product control unit N<b>49</b> turns OFF the TV N<b>10</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0954" num="0953">It should also be noted that, in the twelfth embodiment, the product control unit N<b>49</b> turns OFF a product located the farthest from the mobile device N<b>20</b> and turns ON a product closest to the mobile device N<b>20</b>. However, the present invention is not limited to the above. The product control unit N<b>49</b> may control power to be turned ON or OFF for a plurality of products based on the position information of the mobile device N<b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0955" num="0954">It should also be noted that, in the twelfth embodiment, the product control unit N<b>49</b> turns OFF a product located the farthest from the mobile device N<b>20</b> and turns ON a product closest to the mobile device N<b>20</b>. However, the present invention is not limited to the above. For example, it is also possible that the CPU N<b>34</b> in the mobile device N<b>20</b> stores position information as a movement history into a memory (not illustrated), and regularly provides the movement history to the registration server N<b>40</b>. In this aspect, the registration server N<b>40</b> estimates, from the movement histories of the mobile device N<b>20</b>, which product is located in which room or which floor, and manages results of the estimation. It is further possible that the product control unit N<b>49</b> controls power to be turned ON or OFF for each product in the same house based on the estimation results. For example, if it is estimated from the movement histories that the TV N<b>10</b>A and the air conditioner N<b>10</b>C are located in the same room, the product control unit N<b>49</b> turns OFF the air conditioner N<b>10</b>C when the TV N<b>10</b>A is turned OFF.</p>
<p id="p-0956" num="0955">In addition to the moving histories, it is also possible to obtain a time of switching ON or OFF each product, thereby estimating which product is in the same room or the same floor.</p>
<p id="p-0957" num="0956">It should also be noted that, in the twelfth embodiment, the product information management unit N<b>45</b> manages the product information illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 115A</figref>, <b>115</b>B, or <b>112</b>, and the position information generation unit N<b>48</b> generates the product map illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 121</figref> or <b>123</b>. However, the present invention is not limited to the above. For example, it is also possible that image data of a room arrangement created by the user is transmitted from the mobile device N<b>20</b> to the registration server N<b>40</b>, and therefore managed by the product information management unit N<b>45</b>.

In the situation, the step count detection calculation unit O<b>100</b><i>a </i>is used instead to estimate a direction of the walking travel, by detecting direction by the three-axis magnetic sensors and acceleration by the three-axis acceleration sensors. Additional use of the three-axis angular velocity sensors detecting an angular velocity can determine absolute coordinates of the position of the mobile device O<b>60</b>. The mobile device O<b>60</b> first obtains correct absolute coordinates from the GPS satellites. And then, when radio waves of the GPS satellites become weak, the mobile device O<b>60</b> switches the GPS to the positioning means using acceleration, geomagnetism, and angular velocity. Thereby, the absolute coordinates can be kept correct at least in a certain time period. Furthermore, it is also possible that correct absolute coordinates are recorded on a RF-ID reader or a RF-ID tag provided to a door opening/closing at an entrance of a house, a hospital room, and or the like. In this aspect, a portable device (the mobile device O<b>60</b>) can read the correct absolute coordinates when the portable device is used to unlock the door for authentication. As a result, the absolute coordinates can be regularly calibrated. As described above, it is possible, even in a house, to obtain correct absolute coordinates without receiving radio waves from GPS satellites. Therefore, in the house, when the portable device is brought into proximity of a RF-ID device of a product such as an air conditioner, a TV, or a DVD recorder in order to read data from the RF-ID device, the portable device operating at a frequency of 13.5 MHz is not far from the product more than 5 cm. If the portable device holds correct absolute coordinates, the portable device can transmit, to a server, a product name and a product serial number of the product and a MAC address, which are obtained from the RF-ID device when the portable device is in proximity of the product (namely touches the product), and the correct absolute coordinates in association with each other. Thereby, it is possible to offer significant advantages of recording, onto a server, absolute coordinates on the earth regarding each product with an accuracy having an error within 5 cm.</p>
<p id="p-1041" num="1040">Next, the absolute coordinate calculation unit O<b>107</b> provides the corrected direction information in the direction information unit O<b>87</b> and the corrected position information in the position information unit O<b>86</b> to the position information output unit O<b>85</b>.</p>

In this aspect, each product obtains the 3D map beforehand from the mobile device O<b>60</b> using the NFC function.</p>
<p id="p-1120" num="1119">It should also be noted that it has been described in the thirteenth embodiment that the RF-ID device O<b>50</b> is provided to TVs, BD recorders, air conditioners, and the like. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 134</figref> illustrates a system including products O<b>50</b>G to O<b>50</b>N each having the RF-ID device O<b>50</b>. Each of the products O<b>50</b>G to O<b>50</b>N also includes a specific small power wireless communication device (for example, Zigbee), which enables the products to directly communicate with each other within a range in which radio waves can be received. It is assumed that each of the products O<b>50</b>G to O<b>50</b>N has already obtained a 3D map from the mobile device O<b>60</b> via the RF-ID device O<b>50</b>. The 3D map shows an arrangement of the products O<b>50</b>G to O<b>50</b>N. It is also possible that the 3D map is held in a server. Or, for another method, each of the products O<b>50</b>G to O<b>50</b>N may have the communication antenna O<b>68</b> in order to obtain, via the internet, the 3D map showing the product arrangement. Conventionally, there is the following problem. Without position information of each product, products other than minimum requisite products in a path need to be operated. Therefore, unnecessary power consumption occurs. In the thirteenth embodiment, however, the position information makes it possible to select and operate only terminals on the shortest path between two products. Thereby, power can be saved.</p>
<p id="p-1121" num="1120">The following describes the situation where a product O<b>50</b>H transmits data to a product O<b>50</b>K by using the specific small power wireless communication device. The specific small power wireless communication device usually operates at a sleep mode in terms of power saving. At the sleep mode, a power source of the specific small power wireless communication device is switched ON or OFF at regular intervals. Here, timings of switching ON or OFF for the products are in synchronization with each other.</p>
<p id="p-1122" num="1121">When the product O<b>50</b>H needs to transmit data, the specific small power wireless communication device in the product O<b>50</b>H is switched to an awake mode. At the awake mode, the power source of the specific small power wireless communication device is always ON. The product O<b>50</b>H examines the 3D map showing the arrangement of the products O<b>50</b>G to O<b>50</b>N, which has previously been obtained. From the 3D map of the product arrangement, the product O<b>50</b>H determines products located between the product O<b>50</b>H and the product O<b>50</b>K. In this example, a product O<b>50</b>J is determined from the 3D map to be a relay product to relay data.</p>
<p id="p-1123" num="1122">The product O<b>50</b>H instructs the product O<b>50</b>J to switch to the awake mode.</p>
<p id="p-1124" num="1123">The product O<b>50</b>H transmits, to the product O<b>50</b>J, data addressed to the product O<b>50</b>H.</p>
<p id="p-1125" num="1124">When the product O<b>50</b>J receives the data addressed to the product O<b>50</b>H, the product O<b>50</b>J transfers the data to the O<b>50</b>H. Then, the product O<b>50</b>J is switched to the sleep mode.</p>
<p id="p-1126" num="1125">As described above, using the 3D map, the product O<b>50</b>H determines a relay product in order to transmit data, and causes only the determined relay product (product O<b>50</b>J) to be switched to the awake mode. Thereby, other products, which do not need to be at the awake mode, do not need to be switched to the awake mode. Without the 3D map, in order to establish a path to the product O<b>50</b>K, the product O<b>50</b>H needs to cause all products to be switched to search for the path. Here, it is also possible that each of products, which do not need to be at the awake mode, is previously assigned, by using the 3D map, with an awake prohibition identifier for identifying a product for which the awake mode is prohibited.</p>
<p id="p-1127" num="1126">It should also be noted that the units included in each of the above-described embodiments may be implemented into a Large Scale Integration (LSI) that is typically an integrated circuit. These units may be integrated separately, or a part or all of them may be integrated into a single chip. Here, the integrated circuit is referred to as a LSI, but the integrated circuit can be called an IC, a system LSI, a super LSI or an ultra LSI depending on their degrees of integration. The technique of integrated circuit is not limited to the LSI, and it may be implemented as a dedicated circuit or a general-purpose processor. It is also possible to use a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) that can be programmed after manufacturing the LSI, or a reconfigurable processor in which connection and setting of circuit cells inside the LSI can be reconfigured.</p>
<p id="p-1128" num="1127">Furthermore, if due to the progress of semiconductor technologies or their derivations, new technologies for integrated circuits appear to be replaced with the LSIs, it is, of course, possible to use such technologies to implement the functional blocks as an integrated circuit. For example, biotechnology and the like can be applied to the above implementation.</p>
<p id="p-1129" num="1128">It should also be noted that the embodiment of the present invention employs the 3D map that is a wireframe image of a house (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 111</figref>). However, such house data is private information, and 3D data is not generated for old buildings. Therefore, until such 3D data becomes available for each general house, it is necessary to obtain a room arrangement of a house without using 3D data of the house.</p>
<p id="p-1130" num="1129">When there is no 3D data of a house, an illustration is provided. In the illustration, several air conditioners are arranged in a space that corresponds to the house. Without 3D data, a room arrangement of a room having each of the air conditioners is not known.</p>
<p id="p-1131" num="1130">Here, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 127</figref>, each of the air conditioners, which has a RF-ID unit compliant to APE or a NFC IC and an antenna set O<b>50</b>C, is provided with a detection unit (such as an ultrasonic sensor or an infrared sensor) for detecting a distance or a position. Thereby, it is possible to determine a relative position of the air conditioner which is relative to walls and pieces of furniture in the room. Here, a mobile device <b>60</b> such as a mobile phone which has the 3D mapping function as described in the embodiment of the present invention is brought into proximity of 5 cm or less from of the RF-ID unit in the air conditioner. At this moment, if the air conditioner has a wireless communication function, the mobile device <b>60</b> transmits, to the air conditioner, an access number such as AAID for wireless LAN or the like, and a password and an authentication key for access. Thereby, the air conditioner is connected to a network in the house. In addition, in proximity of the RF-ID unit, the mobile device <b>60</b> reads a product name, a product serial number, a MAC address, and an authentication key from the RF-ID unit. Then, in transmitting these pieces of information to a server, the mobile device <b>60</b> also transmits, to the air conditioner or the server, 3D absolute coordinate information indicating the position of the mobile device <b>60</b>. The absolute coordinate information is calibrated using: (a) the previously-described coordinate information of the relative position relative to walls and the like in the room; and (b1) relative position information in the house where the mobile device <b>60</b> exists or (b2) absolute coordinate information on the earth. Thereby, it is possible to generate a 3D or 2D arrangement illustration of relative coordinates between the air conditioner and the room or absolute coordinates on the earth. Combination of pieces of 3D coordinate information of the several air conditioners can result in coordinate information showing a 3D or 2D arrangement of the rooms having the air conditioners in the house, in other words, a part of the wireframe image of the house as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 127</figref>. If the above-described technique is employed for the three air conditioners in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 127</figref>, pieces of 3D mapping data of three rooms can be generated.</p>
<p id="p-1132" num="1131">Since pieces of authentication data, such as the MAC address and the authentication key, which are used to be connected with other devices, are also obtained, it is possible to automatically perform connection authentication with the other devices, such as TVs, a DVD recorder, and a refrigerator, in the house via a network. This terminal is not necessary to be the air conditioner, but also to be any electric and electronic devices in the house. Air purification device may be provided with a distance measuring sensor to server as the terminal. However, the terminal is desirably a device, such as an air conditioner, which is equipped at a fixed location in a house, because position coordinate information of such a device is not changed. In this example, 3D coordinate information of only the rooms having the air conditioners can be generated. However, since a user of the mobile device moves around in the house, 3D trajectory information can be generated. The 3D trajectory information regarding position coordinates is analyzed and calculated by a server to estimate positions of entrances of the respective rooms, positions of corridors, and other positions. Thereby, the 3D data showing the arrangement of the house is further developed. The above method can generate the 3D wireframe image of the house as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 127</figref> by estimation calculation of the server, without 3D coordinate information of the house. Furthermore, in the method by which the RF-ID unit of the mobile device touches the RF-ID reader at an opening/closing entrance such as a front door of the house so as to unlock the key of the entrance, if the position of the RF-ID reader which is recorded onto the server or the RF-ID reader has a high accuracy, this means that an accuracy identifier of the position coordinates is high. The mobile device reads the position information from the RF-ID unit at the entrance and examines an accuracy of the readout information. Therefore, touching the RF-ID unit, the mobile device can calibrate absolute coordinates of the position of the mobile device. Thereby, single touching can result in (a) locking/unlocking of the key and (b) calibration of absolute or relative coordinates of the position of the mobile device.</p>
<p id="p-1133" num="1132">For example, the above technique is employed in each door of corridors in a hospital or RF-ID readers for security release when entering and leaving the rooms. Thereby, positions of doctors and nurses having the mobile devices can be managed with high accuracy in a server in the hospital, when opening and closing the doors.</p>
<p id="p-1134" num="1133">At present, when mobile phones, personal computers, and, in the further, microwaves and air conditioners intend to communicate with a server, it is desired to perform authentication for the devices or data entry in order to prevent malicious behaviors.</p>
<p id="p-1135" num="1134">In the embodiment of the present invention, each product in a house or a server associated with each product stores 3D coordinate information. The mobile device is brought into proximity of a product such as a microwave to read information from the product. Then, when the mobile device communicates with the server, the server causes the mobile device to transmit, to the server, position information of an actual current position of the mobile device, while authenticating the mobile device. The server compares the position information received from the mobile device with position information registered in the microwave or another server linked to the server. Thereby, the server determines whether or not a difference between the received position information and the registered position information is within a predetermined range. If the difference is within the predetermined range, then the server determines that the received position information is correct and therefore downloads the position information. On the other hand, if the difference is beyond the predetermined range, then the server determines that the received position information does not match the registered position information and therefore stops data transmission or firmware downloading. Thereby, it is possible to prevent unauthorized behaviors such that a malicious third person downloads a fire firmware to the microwave without authorization.</p>
<p id="p-1136" num="1135">As described in the embodiment of the present invention, position authorization that is authorization having a new concept can be added to conventional personal authentication using a password, a finger print, and the like. For example, it can be implemented that authentication is not successful unless the mobile device performs transmission from a specific room such as an accounting department in a company. Since an unauthorized person performing transmission from other locations cannot be authenticated, unauthorized behaviors can be prevented with high degree.</p>
<p id="p-1137" num="1136">Moreover, in the embodiment of the present invention, authentication among the product such as a microwave, the mobile device, and the server has possible four modes.</p>
<p id="p-1138" num="1137">The first mode is when a power plug of the microwave is not set in a power outlet. In this situation, the mobile device is brought to proximity of or touch the NFC unit without a power source, such as a RF-ID unit of the microwave. Thereby, the mobile device supplies power to the NFC unit and reads a product serial number, a server address, and the like from a memory in the NFC unit. Then, the mobile device transmits the readout information to the server.</p>
<p id="p-1139" num="1138">The second mode is when firmware is downloaded. In the situation, there is a possibility that fire firmware is downloaded by a malicious third person without authorization. When the power plug is set in the outlet, poser is supplied from the outlet to a CPU of the microwave to operate the microwave. Thereby, the CPU with high performance encrypts and decrypts authentication information, such as a random number, which is provided from the server. Then, the microwave transmits the authenticated information to the server via the NFC unit and the mobile device so that the server can perform authentication for the microwave. After establishment of the authentication, the microwave downloads authorized firmware from the server. As a result, it is possible to prevent unauthorized downloading of the firmware and impersonation. If the above authentication is added with the previously-described authentication using coordinate information, security is more improved.</p>
<p id="p-1140" num="1139">In this case, the CPU is operated only when authentication or the like needs to be performed. Therefore, cryptography calculation can be performed with high security while reducing power consumption. As a result, security of the authentication is improved.</p>
<p id="p-1141" num="1140">The third mode is when a power plug of a home appliance (product) such as a microwave is set to a power outlet. In this situation, when the mobile device is brought into proximity of the microwave, the microwave supplies power and clock to the NFC unit. Once the mobile device is in proximity of the microwave, a power source of the microwave is activated to supply power to the NFC unit. If the NFC unit has a CPU with a small load to perform cryptography calculation, calculation of cryptography or the like takes a long time. If the mobile device moves away from the microwave, the power supply is stopped and the calculation of the CPU is not completed. Therefore, if power is supplied from the microwave, the stable power supply prevents stop of the calculation. If the mobile device is in proximity of the microwave once, the calculation is completed. It is not necessary to hold the mobile device in proximity of the microwave for a long time or a plurality of times. As a result, responsiveness is dramatically increased.</p>
<p id="p-1142" num="1141">The fourth mode is when the mobile device is never in proximity of the product (microwave). In this situation, when information such as accumulated &#x201c;use time periods&#x201d;, &#x201c;failure mode information&#x201d;, and the like of the microwave is to be recorded from the CPU of the microwave onto a memory in the NFC unit or a memory shared between the NFC unit and the microwave, if the CPU is operating, the microwave supplies power to at least the NFC unit and the shared memory for the recording. It is not necessary to supply power to the entire NFC unit. In order to prevent simultaneous writing from the NFC unit, the clock supply to the shared memory is blocked during a period of the recording. The use time periods may be recorded so that the NFC unit can read a part of the information recorded in the shared memory in the microwave. Thereby, even if, for example, the power plug of the microwave is not set to the power outlet in recycling, the mobile device can read, from the CPU of the microwave, the &#x201c;use time periods&#x201d;, &#x201c;failure mode information&#x201d;, and the like. Of course, the RF-ID unit in the embodiments may be a ROM chip of NFC technology, a NFC circuit, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-1143" num="1142">There is another application of mobility service, in which a Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) technology is used to transfer video data from a TV on the first floor to a TV in a bed room on the second floor, for example. In this case, the fact that an operator of a terminal (mobile device) goes to the bed room on the second floor is managed by using position information in a server. The server can expect that the operator entering the bed room on the second floor will bring a terminal into proximity of the TV in the bed room. Therefore, connection procedure using the DLNA technology or the like has previously been completed so that video data is switched to be displayed on the TV in the bed room as soon as the terminal is moved to proximity of the TV, in order to improve a speed of the switching process. It is also possible that an eye direction sensor is equipped in the bed room on the second floor. In this aspect, when the operator enters the bed room and looks at the TV, video data is switched to be displayed on the TV using the DLNA connection or the like. Therefore, as soon as the operator enters the bed room and looks at the TV, the TV is powered ON and the video data displayed in the room on the first floor or the mobile device (the terminal) is switched to be displayed on the TV in the bed room on the second floor. Only eye direction can switch where to display the video data. As described above, if registration of the position information of the TV is performed as described in the embodiments of the present invention, applications of home appliances can be significantly enlarged.</p>
<heading id="h-0025" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>

The communication device according to an aspect of the present invention may be implemented as various devices having a RF-ID unit in which identification information and a virtual machine program are stored. For example, the communication device may be electronic devices such as a camera, home appliances such as a rice cooker and a refrigerator, and daily commodities such as a toothbrush.</p>
