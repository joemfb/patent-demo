<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a block diagram of an electronic system example <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the disclosure. The electronic system <b>100</b> includes a circuit <b>101</b> and an asymmetrically deskewed complementary signal generator <b>110</b>. These elements are coupled together as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The asymmetrically deskewed complementary signal generator <b>110</b> receives an input signal IN and outputs a pair of asymmetrically deskewed complementary signals in response to the input signal IN. The pair of asymmetrically deskewed complementary signals includes a positive signal OUTP and a negative signal OUTN. Specifically, the positive signal OUTP has rising edge transitions in response to rising edge transitions of the input signal IN, and has falling edge transitions in response to falling edge transitions of the input signal IN; while the negative signal OUTN has falling edge transitions in response to the rising edge transitions of the input signal IN, and has rising edge transitions in response to the falling edge transitions of the input signal IN. Thus, the rising edge transitions of the positive signal OUTP correspond to the falling edge transitions of the negative signal OUTN, and the falling edge transitions of the positive signal OUTP correspond to the rising edge transitions of the negative signal OUTN.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In addition, the positive signal OUTP and the negative signal OUTN are asymmetrically deskewed complementary signals. In an example, the rising edge transitions of the positive signal OUTP and the corresponding falling edge transitions of the negative signal OUTN are deskewed. In other words, the delay between the rising edge transitions of the positive signal OUTP and the corresponding falling edge transitions of the negative signal OUTN is substantially equal to zero. But the falling edge transitions of the positive signal OUTP and the corresponding rising edge transitions of the negative signal OUTN are skewed. For example, the falling edge transitions of the positive signal OUTP are later than the corresponding rising edge transitions of the negative signal OUTN.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In another example, the falling edge transitions of the positive signal OUTP and the corresponding rising edge transitions of the negative signal OUTN are deskewed. In other words, the delay between the falling edge transitions of the positive signal OUTP and the corresponding rising edge transitions of the negative signal OUTN is substantially equal to zero. But the rising edge transitions of the positive signal OUTP and the corresponding falling edge transitions of the negative signal OUTN are skewed. For example, the rising edge transitions of the positive signal OUTP are later than the corresponding falling edge transitions of the negative signal OUTN.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to an aspect of the disclosure, the circuit <b>101</b> is configured to operate in response to the deskewed edges of the positive signal OUTP and the negative signal OUTN. In an example, the circuit <b>101</b> is configured to operate based on a pair of complementary clock signals. In an example, the circuit <b>101</b> includes a first portion that includes a first flip-flop (FF) <b>102</b> and a first logic circuit <b>103</b>, and a second portion that includes a second flip-flop (FF) <b>104</b> and a second logic circuit <b>105</b>. The first flip-flop <b>102</b> is configured to operate in response to rising edge transitions of a first clock signal CLOCK_A. The second flip-flop <b>104</b> is configured to operate in response to falling edge transitions of a second clock signal CLOCK_B. The second clock signal CLOCK_B is a complementary clock signal of the first clock signal CLOCK_A. In an embodiment, the circuit <b>101</b> has optimum performance when the rising edge transitions of the first clock signal CLOCK_A and the falling edge transitions of the second clock signal CLOCK_B are deskewed.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an example, the input signal IN is a clock signal. The asymmetrically deskewed complementary signal generator <b>110</b> generates a pair of asymmetrically deskewed complementary clock signals based on the input clock signal IN. The pair of asymmetrically deskewed complementary clock signals includes the positive clock signal OUTP and the negative clock signal OUTN. The positive clock signal OUTP is provided to the circuit <b>101</b> as the first clock signal CLOCK_A and the negative clock signal OUTN is provided to the circuit <b>101</b> as the second clock signal CLOCK_B. Because the rising edge transitions of the positive clock signal OUTP and the corresponding falling edge transitions of the negative clock signal OUTN are deskewed, the circuit <b>101</b> has optimum performance.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a circuit diagram of an asymmetrical deskewed complementary signal generator example <b>210</b> according to an embodiment of the disclosure. The asymmetrically deskewed complementary signal generator <b>210</b> receives an input signal IN and outputs a pair of asymmetrically deskewed complementary signals including a positive signal OUTP and a negative signal OUTN. The rising edge transitions of the positive signal QUIP and the corresponding falling edge transitions of the negative signal OUTN are deskewed. In other words, the delay between the rising edge transitions of the positive signal OUTP and the corresponding falling edge transitions of the negative signal OUTN is substantially equal to zero.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> example, the asymmetrically deskewed complementary signal generator <b>210</b> is implemented using complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. The asymmetrically deskewed complementary signal generator <b>210</b> includes N-type MOS transistors MN<b>1</b>, MN<b>2</b> and MN<b>3</b>, P-type MOS transistors MP<b>1</b>, MP<b>2</b> and MP<b>3</b>, and an inverter INV. These elements are coupled together as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Specifically, the asymmetrically deskewed complementary signal generator <b>210</b> has an input node <b>211</b>, a first output node <b>212</b> and a second output node <b>213</b>. The input node <b>211</b> receives the input signal IN. Further, the input node <b>211</b> is coupled to the gate terminal of the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>1</b>, the gate terminal of the N-type MOS transistor MN<b>1</b>, and the input of the inverter INV. The output of the inverter INV is coupled to the gate terminal of the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>2</b> and the gate terminal of the N-type MOS transistor MN<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an example, the circuit <b>210</b> includes a first power supply rail of a high voltage VDD (e.g., positive voltage) and a second power supply rail of a low voltage VSS (e.g., ground) to provide power supply to the circuit components. The first power supply rail of VDD is coupled to the source terminal of the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>1</b> and the source terminal of the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>2</b>. The second power supply rail of VSS is coupled to the source terminal of the N-type transistor MN<b>1</b> and the source terminal of N-type transistor MN<b>2</b>. The drain terminal of the P-type transistor MP<b>1</b> is coupled to the drain terminal of the N-type transistor MN<b>3</b>. It is noted that the drain terminal of the P-type transistor MP<b>1</b> is also coupled to the second output node <b>213</b>. The source terminal of the N-type transistor MN<b>3</b> is coupled to both the gate terminal of the P-type transistor MP<b>3</b> and the drain terminal of the N-type transistor MN<b>1</b>. The drain terminal of the N-type transistor MN<b>2</b> is coupled to the drain terminal of the P-type transistor MP<b>3</b>. It is noted that the drain terminal of the N-type transistor MN<b>2</b> is also coupled to the first output node <b>212</b>. The source terminal of the P-type transistor MP<b>3</b> is coupled to the gate terminal of the N-type transistor MN<b>3</b> and the drain terminal of the P-type transistor MP<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The asymmetrically deskewed complementary signal generator <b>210</b> generates the positive signal OUTP at the first output node <b>212</b> and generates the negative signal OUTN at the second output node <b>213</b>. The positive signal OUTP has rising edge transitions in response to rising edge transitions of the input signal IN, and has falling edge transitions in response to falling edge transitions of the input signal IN; while the negative signal OUTN has falling edge transitions in response to the rising edge transitions of the input signal IN, and has rising edge transitions in response to the falling edge transitions of the input signal IN. Thus, the rising edge transitions of the positive signal OUTP correspond to the falling edge transitions of the negative signal OUTN, and the falling edge transitions of the positive signal OUTP correspond to the rising edge transitions of the negative signal OUTN.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In addition, the rising edge transitions of the positive signal OUTP and the falling edge transitions of the negative signal OUTN are deskewed. In other words, the delay between the rising edge transitions of the positive signal OUTP and the corresponding falling edge transitions of the negative signal OUTN is substantially equal to zero.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Specifically, when the input signal IN is at low voltage level, the output of the inverter INV is at high voltage level. The P-type MOS transistor MP<b>1</b> is turned on due to low voltage level of the input signal IN and the N-type MOS transistor MN<b>2</b> is turned on due to high voltage level of the output of the inverter INV. The other transistors MN<b>1</b>, MN<b>3</b>, MP<b>2</b> and MP<b>3</b> are all turned off. Because the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>1</b> is turned on, the negative signal OUTN is at high voltage level. Because the N-type MOS transistor MN<b>2</b> is turned on, the positive signal OUTP is at low voltage level.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">When the input signal IN switches from low voltage level to high voltage level (a rising edge transition), the output of the inverter INV switches from high voltage level to low voltage level (a falling edge transition) after a time duration due to the delay of the inverter INV. According to an aspect of the disclosure, the time duration is short, however, non-negligible. Within this short time duration, the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>1</b> turns off and the N-type MOS transistor MN<b>1</b> is turned on due to the high voltage level of the input signal IN. The N-type MOS transistor MN<b>1</b> pulls down the voltage at the source terminal of the N-type MOS transistor MN<b>3</b> and the gate terminal of the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>3</b> to VSS.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">After the short time duration, the output of the inverter INV switches from high voltage level to low voltage level.

When the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>2</b> turns on, the N-type MOS transistor MN<b>3</b> and the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>3</b> are turned on. Because the source terminal of the N-type MOS transistor MN<b>3</b> and the gate terminal of the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>3</b> are previously pulled down to VSS by the N-type MOS transistor MN<b>1</b>, the N-type MOS transistor MN<b>3</b> and the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>3</b> are turned on at substantially the same time. The N-type MOS transistors MN<b>3</b> and MN<b>1</b> pull down the voltage of the negative signal OUTN, and the P-type MOS transistors MP<b>2</b> and MP<b>3</b> pull up the voltage of the positive signal OUTP. Thus, the positive signal OUTP has a rising edge transition and the negative signal OUTN has a falling edge transition substantially at the same time.

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> example, the asymmetrically deskewed complementary signal generator <b>410</b> is implemented using complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology.

The output of the inverter INV is coupled to the gate terminal of the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>2</b> and the gate terminal of the N-type MOS transistor MN<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In an example, the circuit <b>410</b> includes a first power supply rail of a high voltage VDD (e.g., positive voltage) and a second power supply rail of a low voltage VSS (e.g., ground) to provide power supply to the circuit components. The first power supply rail of VDD is coupled to the source terminal of the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>1</b> and the source terminal of the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>2</b>. The second power supply rail of VSS is coupled to the source terminal of the N-type MOS transistor MN<b>1</b> and the source terminal of N-type MOS transistor MN<b>2</b>.

Thus, the rising edge transitions of the positive signal OUTP correspond to the falling edge transitions of the negative signal OUTN, and the falling edge transitions of the positive signal OUTP correspond to the rising edge transitions of the negative signal OUTN.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In addition, the falling edge transitions of the positive signal OUTP and the rising edge transitions of the negative signal OUTN are deskewed.

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Specifically, when the input signal IN is at low voltage level, the output of the inverter INV is at high voltage level. The P-type MOS transistor MP<b>1</b> is turned on due to low voltage level of the input signal IN.
