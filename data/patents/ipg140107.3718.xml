<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based on and claims the benefit of priority from earlier Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-1557 filed Jan. 7, 2009, the description of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a microstrip array antenna using a dielectric substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A microstrip array antenna, which comprises a strip conductor formed on a dielectric substrate, has advantages in thinness, low cost of manufacturing, and productivity. Due to these features, microstrip array antennas have been widely used as transmitting and receiving antennas for various radio wave sensors such as a vehicle-mounted radar used in, for example, anticollision systems and adaptive cruise controls (ACC).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One example of the above microstrip array antenna is known in which a plurality of radiation antenna elements are connected with and arranged at a predetermined interval along the two sides of the linearly disposed feeding strip line.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When the microstrip array antenna configured as described above is installed in a vehicle as, for example, an automotive radar, the feeding strip line is commonly disposed so as to be perpendicular to the ground so that the antenna can totally obtain a desired radiation pattern (especially, radiation pattern in the vertical direction). Meanwhile, plane polarization inclined at a predetermined angle (for example, 45&#xb0; with respect to the ground is preferably used as a radio wave transmitted/received by the microstrip array antenna to prevent interference with a radiated wave from an oncoming vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, a microstrip array antenna is proposed in, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2001-44752. In this microstrip array antenna, while the whole antenna is disposed in the vertical direction, radiation antenna elements are connected with and arranged along the sides of the feeding strip line so as to incline with respect to the longitudinal direction of the feeding strip line to realize plane polarization inclining with respect to the ground.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention has been made in consideration of the foregoing conventional situation, and an object of the present invention is to provide a microstrip array antenna in which plane polarization is realized whose direction is inclined at a predetermined angle with respect to a feeding strip line, and directivities of radiation antenna elements of both sides of the feeding strip line have an approximately symmetry characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to achieve the object, the present invention provides, as one aspect, a microstrip array antenna including a dielectric substrate, on a back face of which a conductive grounding plate is formed, and a strip conductor formed on the dielectric substrate, wherein the strip conductor comprises a feeding strip line which is linear and extends in a predetermined extension direction, and at least two radiation antenna elements which have a predetermined length, at least one of the radiation antenna elements being connected with one side of the feeding strip line, and at least one of the radiation antenna elements being connected with the other side of the feeding strip line, the longitudinal directions of the radiation antenna elements are parallel to each other and are at an angle of other than 90&#xb0; with respect to the extension direction, and the feeding strip line has a partially or totally bent shape and fully extends in the extension direction so that the radiation antenna elements are connected with the feeding strip line at the same angle.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows one example of a microstrip array antenna in which radiation antenna elements are connected with and arranged along a feeding strip line in a state where the radiation antenna elements incline with respect to the longitudinal direction of the feeding strip line. A microstrip array antenna <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is configured by forming a strip conductor <b>103</b> on a dielectric substrate <b>102</b>. On the back face of the dielectric substrate <b>102</b>, a conductive grounding plate <b>101</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The strip conductor <b>103</b> comprises a feeding strip line <b>105</b> which is is linearly disposed, a plurality of radiation antenna elements <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>111</b><i>b</i>, <b>111</b><i>c</i>, <b>111</b><i>d</i>, <b>111</b><i>e</i>, . . . , which are connected with one side of the feeding strip line <b>105</b>, and a plurality of radiation antenna elements <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b</i>, <b>112</b><i>c</i>, <b>112</b><i>d</i>, <b>112</b><i>e</i>, . . . , which are connected with the other side of the feeding strip line <b>105</b>, which are main parts.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The radiation antenna elements <b>111</b><i>a </i>to <b>111</b><i>e</i>, . . . , <b>112</b><i>a </i>to <b>112</b><i>e</i>, . . . are connected with the two sides of the feeding strip line <b>105</b> so as to be parallel to one another. In this case, the longitudinal directions of the radiation antenna elements are at an angle of 45&#xb0; with respect to the longitudinal direction of the feeding strip line <b>105</b>. According to the above configuration, the microstrip array antenna can transmit/receive plane polarization whose direction inclines at an angle of 45&#xb0; with respect to the longitudinal direction of the feeding strip line <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">However, when a plurality of the microstrip array antennas <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are arranged in the horizontal direction to configure an automotive radar (which may be referred to as &#x201c;automotive radar configuration&#x201d;) which produces the desired radiation, sidelobes in the radiation pattern characteristic of the automotive radar configuration rises.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows one example of a radiation pattern characteristic (horizontal-plane radiation pattern characteristic) when the microstrip array antenna <b>100</b> has the automotive radar configuration. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in the radiation pattern characteristic of the microstrip array antenna <b>100</b> having the automotive radar configuration, symmetry of sidelobes with respect to a main lobe is broken. One of the sidelobes exceeds a specification value (upper limit) for the sidelobes required for a microstrip array antenna configuring an automotive radar.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As described above, when the microstrip array antenna <b>100</b> is used as an automotive radar, and the level of the unnecessary sidelobe rises and exceeds the specification value, various problems, such as appearance of a ghost, can arise.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">To solve the problems, the inventors of the present application have variously analyzed and examined the cause of the rise of the sidelobe in the horizontal-plane radiation pattern characteristic when the conventional microstrip array antenna <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has an automotive radar configuration. In consequence, the main reason has been found that connection angles of the radiation antenna elements with respect to the feeding strip line <b>105</b> (in other words, power supply branch angles between the feeding strip line <b>105</b> and the radiation antenna elements) differ between the two sides of the feeding strip line <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">That is, in the conventional microstrip array antenna <b>100</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the radiation antenna elements <b>111</b><i>a </i>and the like (which may be, hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;right-side radiation antenna element&#x201d;) are connected with one side of the feeding strip line <b>105</b> at an angle of 45&#xb0; with respect to the longitudinal direction of the feeding strip line <b>105</b> (that is, power supply direction).

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When the connection angles of the radiation antenna elements with respect to the feeding strip line <b>105</b> (power supply branch angles) differ between the right-side radiation antenna element and the left-side radiation antenna element, directivities of the single right-side radiation antenna element and the single left-side radiation antenna element have an asymmetry characteristic as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>.

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In consequence, the radiation antenna elements are alternately connected with and arranged along two sides of the feeding strip line <b>3</b> at regular intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the microstrip array antenna <b>1</b> configured as described above, as electric power supplied from the input terminal (the upper side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) propagates toward the termination (the lower side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), parts of the electric power are sequentially coupled with the radiation antenna elements connected with the sides <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the feeding strip line <b>3</b> and are radiated from the radiation antenna elements.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In addition, since the longitudinal directions of the radiation antenna elements are parallel to one another, all the field emission directions of the radiated radio waves are the same (parallel to one another).

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Meanwhile, widths W of the radiation antenna elements <b>5</b><i>a</i>, <b>5</b><i>b</i>, <b>5</b><i>c</i>, <b>5</b><i>d</i>, . . . , <b>6</b><i>a</i>, <b>6</b><i>b</i>, <b>6</b><i>c</i>, <b>6</b><i>d</i>, . . . gradually become larger from the input terminal (the upper side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) for electric power.

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As described above, the width W of the radiation antenna element varies depending on the connecting position of the feeding strip line <b>3</b> to equalize radiant quantities from the radiation antenna elements, which is one example of the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">To equalize the radiant quantities from the radiation antenna elements, for the radiation antenna element closer to the input terminal side, where large electric power propagates through the feeding strip line <b>3</b>, it is required to decrease the width W thereof and the bonding amount with respect to the feeding strip line <b>3</b>.

Specifically, the feeding strip line fully extends in the extension direction and has a smoothly meandering shape, such as an S-shape. Consequently, connections are realized between the feeding strip line and each of the radiation antenna elements at the same angle.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As described above, since all the radiation antenna elements disposed on both the sides of the feeding strip line (right-side radiation antenna elements and left-side radiation antenna elements) are connected with the feeding strip line at the same angle (or a substantially equivalent angle), radiation pattern characteristics of the single right-side radiation antenna element and the single left-side radiation antenna element can be realized which have a mirror symmetry characteristic as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Consequently, according to the microstrip array antenna of the embodiment, plane polarization can be realized whose direction is inclined at a predetermined angle (45&#xb0; in the embodiment) with respect to the extension direction of the feeding strip line. In addition, an excellent radiation pattern characteristic can be realized in which unnecessary sidelobes are suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In addition, the feeding strip line has an S-shape. The radiation antenna elements are connected with the feeding strip line at an angle of 90&#xb0; (right angle). Therefore, compared with a case where the radiation antenna elements are connected at an angle of other than 90&#xb0;, the shape of the feeding strip line can be simplified. That is, the shape in which the radiation antenna elements are connected at an angle of 90&#xb0; can be easily realized.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In addition, the feeding strip line does not have bent corners and has a totally smooth shape. Therefore, the feeding strip line can be prevented from radiating useless electric power, thereby providing a more efficient microstrip array antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Furthermore, a plurality of the radiation antenna elements are connected with the sides of the feeding strip line at a predetermined interval d (in-line wavelength &#x3bb;g in the embodiment). Thereby, a so-called series-feed microstrip array antenna is realized. Therefore, a higher efficiency microstrip array antenna can be provided which can restrict loss of fed electric power and easily obtain a desired radiation pattern characteristic (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">(Modifications)</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">It will be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to the configurations described above, but any and all modifications, variations or equivalents, which may occur to those who are skilled in the art, should be considered to fall within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the microstrip array antenna <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the feeding strip line <b>3</b> has a totally smooth and continuous S-shape, which is one example. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, a microstrip array antenna <b>40</b> may be configured which comprises a feeding strip line <b>43</b> having a sawtooth shape.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The microstrip array antenna <b>40</b> comprises the feeding strip line <b>43</b>, which has a sawtooth shape and extends along the extension direction, and radiation antenna elements <b>41</b><i>a</i>, <b>41</b><i>b</i>, <b>41</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b><i>b</i>, <b>42</b><i>c</i>, . . . , which are connected with and arranged along two sides of the feeding strip line <b>43</b> at a predetermined angle (for example, 90&#xb0;).</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The microstrip array antenna <b>40</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> and described above can also realize plane polarization whose direction is inclined at a predetermined angle (for example, 45&#xb0;) with respect to the extension direction of the feeding strip line <b>43</b> as in the cases of the microstrip array antennas shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6A</figref>. In addition, an excellent radiation pattern characteristic can be realized in which unnecessary sidelobes are suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Note that the feeding strip line <b>43</b> of the microstrip array antenna <b>40</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> has bent portions including angular corners. Therefore, a leakage of electric power from the angular corners increases, which can decrease the efficiency of the whole antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">To solve the problem, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, it is more preferable that a feeding strip line <b>51</b> of a microstrip array antenna <b>50</b> has a smooth shape having rounded bent portions. Consequently, since the bent portions do not have angular corners, electric power can be prevented from radiating unnecessarily from the bent portions.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The above embodiments (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6A</figref>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> show microstrip array antennas whose feeding strip line has a continuous S-shape or a sawtooth shape. However, the feeding strip lines may not always have shapes which continuously and regularly vary but have irregularly bending shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">That is, as long as the feeding strip line extends in a predetermined extension direction overall, and all the radiation antenna elements are connected at the same angle when locally seen, the bending shape of the feeding strip line is not specially limited.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In addition, in the above embodiment, the interval between the respective radiation antenna elements which are connected with the two sides is approximately &#x3bb;g/2, which is one example. The interval between the radiation antenna elements can be properly determined. For example, on the basis of &#x3bb;g, the interval may be determined so as to be shorter (or longer) than &#x3bb;g depending on connecting positions of the feeding strip line <b>3</b> or a relation between the radiation antenna elements.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In the above embodiment, the radiation antenna elements <b>6</b><i>a</i>, <b>6</b><i>b</i>, <b>6</b><i>c</i>, <b>6</b><i>d</i>, . . . , arranged along the second side <b>3</b><i>b </i>are connected with portions corresponding to middle portions between adjacent two of the radiation antenna elements <b>5</b><i>a</i>, <b>5</b><i>b</i>, <b>5</b><i>c</i>, <b>5</b><i>d</i>, . . . , arranged along the first side <b>3</b><i>a</i>. That is, the radiation antenna elements arranged along one side are connected with portions corresponding to middle portions between adjacent two radiation antenna elements arranged along the other side, which is one example. The positional relationship between the radiation antenna elements arranged along one side and the radiation antenna elements arranged along the other side can be properly determined.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In addition, one radiation antenna element may be connected with each of the two sides of the feeding strip line. That is, the number of the radiation antenna elements is not limited.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the above embodiment, the longitudinal directions of the radiation antenna elements are at an angle of 45&#xb0; with respect to the extension direction of the feeding strip line, which is one example. The angle at which the radiation antenna elements are disposed with respect to the extension direction can be properly determined, except for a case where the longitudinal directions are parallel to or perpendicular to the extension direction.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In addition, the radiation antenna elements are connected with the feeding strip line an angle of 90&#xb0;, which is one example. The radiation antenna elements may be connected at an angle of other than 90&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In the above embodiments, the extension direction of the feeding strip line is defined as a specified direction (longitudinal direction of the imaginary straight line <b>8</b>). However, the extension direction is not necessarily the specified (one) direction. That is, the imaginary line <b>8</b> may not be a straight line but may be a line having a partially or totally bending shape. Even in this case, the feeding strip line fully extends along the bending imaginary line (in the extension direction) and totally or partially bends. Due to the shape, all the radiation antenna elements can be connected at the same angle as in the above case.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Aspects of the above-described embodiments will then be summarized.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">To solve the above-described problems, the inventors of the present application have taken into consideration that connection angles of the radiation antenna elements of both the sides with respect to the feeding strip line (power supply branch angles) are the same. That is, the present invention is achieved by taking into consideration that electric power is supplied to the radiation antenna elements of both the sides at the same angle with respect to the power supply direction.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">To solve the above-described problems, the present invention provides, as one aspect, a microstrip array antenna including a dielectric substrate, on a back face of which a conductive grounding plate is formed, and a strip conductor formed on the dielectric substrate, wherein the strip conductor comprises a feeding strip line which is linear and extends in a predetermined extension direction, and at least two radiation antenna elements which have a predetermined length, at least one of the radiation antenna elements being connected with one side of the feeding strip line, and at least one of the radiation antenna elements being connected with the other side of the feeding strip line, the longitudinal directions of the radiation antenna elements are parallel to each other and are at an angle of other than 90&#xb0; with respect to the extension direction, and the feeding strip line has a partially or totally bending shape and fully extends in the extension direction so that the radiation antenna elements are connected with the power supply strip at the same angle.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In the microstrip array antenna configured as described above, the feeding strip line does not have a straight shape such as the conventional microstrip array antenna <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> but have a partially or totally bending shape. Note that although the microstrip array antenna has a bending shape when partially viewed, the microstrip array antenna fully extends in the predetermined extension direction.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The feeding strip line is bent as described above so that all the radiation antenna elements arranged along the two sides of the feeding strip line are connected with the feeding strip line at an equivalent angle.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">That is, as long as the feeding strip line is totally straight, the right-side radiation antenna element differs from the left-side radiation antenna element in connecting angles (power supply branch angles) by 180&#xb0; as in the case of the conventional microstrip array antenna <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">To solve the above problem, while the feeding strip line totally extends in the predetermined extension direction, the feeding strip line partially or totally bends. Consequently, the radiation antenna elements are connected with the feeding strip line at the same angle.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">According to the microstrip array antenna configured as described above, the longitudinal directions of the radiation antenna elements are parallel to each other and are at an angle of other than 90&#xb0; with respect to the extension direction of the feeding strip line. In addition, the radiation antenna elements are connected with both the sides of the feeding strip line at the same angle. Therefore, while plane polarization is realized whose direction is inclined at a predetermined angle with respect to the feeding strip line, radiation patterns of the single right-side radiation antenna element and the single left-side radiation antenna element can be realized which have an approximate mirror symmetry characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In the microstrip array antenna, the radiation antenna elements are connected with the feeding strip line at an angle of 90&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">When the radiation antenna elements are connected with the feeding strip line at the same angle, the angle can be properly determined. However, depending on the angle, the feeding strip line may be required to be largely or intricately bent, whereby the shape of the feeding strip line is required to be complicated.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">However, when the radiation antenna elements are connected at an angle of 90&#xb0;, the shape of the feeding strip line can be simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In the microstrip array antenna, the bending shape of the feeding strip line includes a smooth curve.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The feeding strip line can be bent so as to have a corner having a predetermined angle as in saw teeth. The microstrip array antenna may be formed by using the feeding strip line having such a bent corner.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">However, when the feeding strip line has such a bent corner, part of electric power propagating the feeding strip line is radiated from the bent portion, which causes loss of electric power.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">To solve the above problem, the feeding strip line is formed so that the bent portion thereof includes a smooth curve. Consequently, the feeding strip line can be prevented from radiating useless electric power from the bent portion, which can provide a more efficient microstrip array antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In the microstrip array antenna, the feeding strip line has a continuously meandering substantial S-shape.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Since the feeding strip line has an S-shape, the shape of the feeding strip line can be simplified, and the configuration can be easily realized in which the radiation antenna elements are connected with the feeding strip line at an angle of 90&#xb0;. In addition, due to the S-shape, the feeding strip line totally and smoothly bends, thereby improving radiation efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In the microstrip array antenna, each of the sides of the feeding strip line connects with a plurality of the radiation antenna element.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">According to the microstrip array antenna configured as described above, a so-called series-feed microstrip array antenna is realized in which the radiation antenna elements are connected with the sides of the feeding strip line. Therefore, a higher efficiency microstrip array antenna can be provided which can reduce loss of fed electric power and easily obtain a desired radiation pattern characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">According to the microstrip array antenna, the radiation antenna elements connected with the one side of the feeding strip line are connected with portions corresponding to middle portions between each adjacent two of the radiation antenna elements connected with the other side of the feeding strip line.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">According to the microstrip array antenna configured as described above, the radiation antenna elements connected with two sides of the feeding strip line are alternately arranged along the feeding strip line. Therefore, radio waves can be efficiently radiated and received.</p>
