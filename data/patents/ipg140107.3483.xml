Another object is to provide a moving object structure capable of reducing the strength of a radio wave radiated to the surroundings. Before power is supplied to a moving object, a radio wave for alignment of antennas is output from a power feeding device. That is, radio waves are output from a power feeding device in two stages. In a first stage, a radio wave is output to align positions of antennas of the power feeding device and the moving object.

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a moving object which is driven by an electric motor and includes a secondary battery chargeable by wireless communication. The present invention also relates to a wireless power feeding system including a moving object and a power feeding device which supplies power to the moving object through wireless communication. The present invention further relates to a wireless communication method for use in the wireless power feeding system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, energy saving, creation and storage technologies are attracting more attention because environmental problems such as global warming are becoming more severe. In the case of a moving object with a secondary battery, i.e., a moving object which is driven by an electric motor using power provided from a secondary battery, including but not limited to a two-wheeled vehicle or a four-wheeled vehicle such as a bicycle having a motor and an electric car, energy storage techniques are used and in addition, an amount of carbon dioxide emissions can be reduced. Therefore, techniques used for such a moving object are being developed actively.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">At present, the secondary battery of the moving object can be charged by using a general home AC power source as a power feeding device or by using a public power feeding facility having a power feeding device such as a high-speed battery charger. In either case, a connector which makes electric connection by insertion of a plug into a socket is commonly used.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For charging of a secondary battery using such connection with the use of a connector, an electric connection between a moving object and a power feeding device is made by bringing a conductor of a plug into contact with a conductor of a socket. This requires plugging-in/out operations for every charging, which may deteriorate the connector due to repeated charging operations. In addition, a large-sized moving object such as an electric car requires high power for charging. This may raise safety issues since damage from an electric shock or a short circuit due to moisture or the like may be significant. Accordingly, special care is needed for handling the connector in the moving object.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to avoid the above problems associated with a connector, research and development are being conducted to propose a wireless power feeding system for supplying power from a power feeding device to a moving object by wireless communication (for example, see Patent Document 1). Use of such a wireless power feeding system allows a secondary battery to be charged without using any connector.</p>

</ul>
</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the above-described wireless power feeding system, a radio wave transmitted from an antenna of the power feeding device is received by an antenna of the moving object. The received radio wave is converted into electric energy, which is then stored in the secondary battery. The efficiency of converting energy of the radio wave into electric energy depends on a positional relationship between the antenna of the power feeding device and the antenna of the moving feeding device. That is, misaligmnent between the positions of the power feeding device and the antenna of the moving object leads to a low conversion efficiency, which results in inefficient charging of the secondary battery. However, it is difficult in most instances for a driver of the moving object to recognize the positional relationship between the antennas of the moving object and the power feeding device while driving the moving object, although it depends on where the antennas are installed.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, in many cases, the antenna of the power feeding device outputs a substantially constant high power radio wave. Thus, if the conversion efficiency for charging is low due to misalignment between the antennas, power may be dissipated and a high power radio wave which has not been converted into electric energy may be radiated to the surroundings. Although it is known that irradiation of the radiated radio wave on a living body such as a human body causes no problem since most of the radiated radio wave is absorbed into the body and is changed into heat, an effect of a radio wave on a living body has not yet been completely explained. Therefore, it is desirable to reduce the strength of the radio wave radiated to the surroundings.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In consideration of the above problems, an object of the present invention is to provide a structure of a moving body which enables reduction of power loss caused when power is supplied from a power feeding device to a moving object by wireless communication. Another object of the present invention is to provide a structure of a moving body which enables reduction of the strength of a radio wave radiated to the surroundings.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another object of the present invention is to provide a wireless power feeding system and a wireless power feeding method which enable reduction of power loss when power is supplied from a power feeding device to a moving object by wireless communication. Another object of the present invention is to provide a wireless power feeding system and a wireless power feeding method which enable reduction in strength of a radio wave, which is radiated from a power feeding device to the surroundings during a charging operation.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In order to solve the above problems, according to one embodiment of the present invention, before power is supplied to a moving object, a radio wave for alignment of antennas is output from a power feeding device. That is, a radio wave is output from a power feeding device in two stages. In a first stage, a radio wave is output to align the positions of the antennas of the power feeding device and the moving object. In a second stage, a radio wave is output to supply power from the power feeding device to the moving object.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">When the radio wave in the first stage is output from the power feeding device, the moving object receives the radio wave and converts it into an electric signal. Strength of the electric signal includes data on a positional relationship in distance, direction, or the like between the antenna of the power feeding device and the antenna of the moving object. Thus, the electric signal is used to detect the positional relationship between the antennas. Accordingly, the position or direction of the moving object or the power feeding device can be modified to provide the optimal positional relationship for the supply of power.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition, the strength of the radio wave which is output in the first stage may be sufficient as long as the positional relationship between the antenna of the power feeding device and the antenna of the moving object can be detected. Accordingly, the strength of the radio wave which is output in the first stage can be lower than strength of the radio wave for supply of power into the moving object, which is output in the second stage.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As used herein, the term &#x201c;moving object&#x201d; means something driven by an electric motor using power stored in a secondary battery and includes, for example, automobiles (automatic two-wheeled cars, three or more-wheeled automobiles), motorized bicycles including a motor-assisted bicycle, aircrafts, boats, and railroad cars.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Specifically, according to one embodiment of the present invention, a moving object includes an antenna circuit which generates a first electric signal and a second electric signal from a first radio wave and a second radio wave sequentially transmitted from a power feeding device, respectively; a signal processing circuit which extracts data on a positional relationship between the power feeding device and the moving object, using the first electric signal; a secondary battery which stores electric energy using the second electric signal; and an electric motor into which electric energy from the secondary battery is supplied.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In addition, according to one embodiment of the present invention, a wireless power feeding system includes a power feeding device including a first antenna circuit; and a moving object. The moving object includes a second antenna circuit which generates a first electric signal and a second electric signal from a first radio wave and a second radio wave sequentially transmitted from the first antenna circuit, respectively; a signal processing circuit which extracts data on a positional relationship between the moving object and the power feeding device, using the first electric signal; a secondary battery which stores electric energy using the second electric signal; and an electric motor into which electric energy from the secondary battery is supplied.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In addition, according to one embodiment of the present invention, a wireless power feeding method includes transmitting a first radio wave from a first antenna circuit of a power feeding device; generating a first electric signal from the first radio wave in a second antenna circuit of a moving object; extracting data on a positional relationship between the power feeding device and the moving object, using the first electric signal in a signal processing circuit of the moving object, in order to determine whether or not a second radio wave is transmitted from the first antenna circuit based on the positional relationship; generating a second electric signal from the second radio wave in the second antenna circuit if the second radio wave is transmitted from the first antenna circuit; storing electric energy in a secondary battery of the moving object, using the second electric signal; and supplying the electric energy from the secondary battery to an electric motor of the moving object.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In addition, a driver of the moving object or a controller of operation of the power feeding device may manually determine whether to start charging the secondary battery based on data on the positional relationship between the power feeding device and the moving object, which is extracted by the signal processing circuit. Alternatively, the signal processing circuit of the moving object may determine whether to start charging of the secondary battery and transmit a result of the determination, as a radio wave signal, to the power feeding device. Alternatively, the data on the positional relationship between the power feeding device and the moving object may be, as it is, transmitted, as a radio wave signal, from the moving object to the power feeding device in which it may be then determined whether to start the charging of the secondary battery.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to one embodiment of the present invention, the positional relationship between the antenna of the power feeding device and the antenna of the moving object can be easily optimized, which may result in reduction of power loss which may be caused when the battery is charged. In addition, it is possible to reduce the strength of a radio wave radiated to the surroundings from the power feeding device without being used for charging.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. However, it should be understood to those skilled in the art that the present invention is not limited to the following description and various modifications and changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Therefore, the present invention should not be construed as being limited to the disclosed embodiments.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A configuration of a moving object and a wireless power feeding system using the moving object and a power feeding device according to one embodiment of the present invention are shown in a block diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> by way of an example. Although the block diagram shows separate elements within the moving object or the power feeding device according to their functions, as independent blocks, it may be practically difficult to completely separate the elements according to their functions and, in some cases, one element may involve a plurality of functions.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a moving object <b>100</b> includes a power receiving device portion <b>101</b> and a power load portion <b>110</b>. The power receiving device portion <b>101</b> includes at least a moving object antenna circuit <b>102</b>, a signal processing circuit <b>103</b>, and a secondary battery <b>104</b>. In addition, the power load portion <b>110</b> includes at least an electric motor <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In addition, the secondary battery <b>104</b> is a charge storage means. Examples of the charge storage means include a lead-acid battery, a nickel-cadmium battery, a nickel-hydride battery, and a lithium-ion battery.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In addition, a power feeding device <b>200</b> includes a power feeding device antenna circuit <b>201</b> and a signal processing circuit <b>202</b>. The signal processing circuit <b>202</b> controls operation of the power feeding device antenna circuit <b>201</b>. That is, the signal processing circuit <b>202</b> can control the strength, the frequency, and the like of radio waves transmitted from the power feeding device antenna circuit <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The power feeding device <b>200</b> transmits an alignment radio wave as a test signal from the power feeding device antenna circuit <b>201</b> in order to align the moving object <b>100</b> and the power feeding device <b>200</b> before supplying power to the moving object <b>100</b>. The moving object <b>100</b> receives the test signal in the moving object antenna circuit <b>102</b>, converts it into an electric signal, and then transmits the electric signal to the signal processing circuit <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The strength of the received test signal depends on a positional relationship in distance, direction, or the like between the moving object antenna circuit <b>102</b> and the power feeding device antenna circuit <b>201</b>. The signal processing circuit <b>103</b> extracts data on the positional relationship between the moving object antenna circuit <b>102</b> and the power feeding device antenna circuit <b>201</b> from the strength of the received test signal.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">If the strength of the received test signal is sufficiently high, it means that an efficiency of energy conversion in converting the radio wave into the electric signal is sufficiently high. Accordingly, the positional relationship between the moving object antenna circuit <b>102</b> and the power feeding device antenna circuit <b>201</b> is determined to be in a state adapted to start of charging.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">On the contrary, if the strength of the received test signal is insufficient, it means that an efficiency of energy conversion in converting the radio wave into the electric signal is low. Accordingly, the positional relationship between the moving object antenna circuit <b>102</b> and the power feeding device antenna circuit <b>201</b> is determined to be not in a state adapted to start of charging.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The criterion for determining whether or not the positional relationship between the moving object antenna circuit <b>102</b> and the power feeding device antenna circuit <b>201</b> is in a state adapted to start of charging may be properly set by a designer.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In addition, a driver of the moving object <b>100</b> or a controller of operation of the power feeding device <b>200</b> may manually determine whether to start charging of the secondary battery <b>104</b> based on data on the positional relationship extracted by the signal processing circuit <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The charging of the secondary battery <b>104</b> is performed by transmitting a charging radio wave from the power feeding device antenna circuit <b>201</b> of the power feeding device <b>200</b>. In the moving object <b>100</b>, the charging radio wave is received in the moving object antenna circuit <b>102</b> and converted into an electric signal, and then the electric signal is transmitted to the signal processing circuit <b>103</b>. Then, the electric signal is transmitted from the signal processing circuit <b>103</b> to the secondary battery <b>104</b> in which the electric signal is stored as electric energy.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The electric motor <b>111</b> drives the moving object <b>100</b> by converting the electric energy stored in the secondary battery <b>104</b> into mechanical energy.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">If the strength of the test signal is insufficient so that the charging cannot be started, the positional relationship between the moving object antenna circuit <b>102</b> and the power feeding device antenna circuit <b>201</b> is modified by changing the position or direction of the moving object <b>100</b> or the power feeding device <b>200</b>. Alternatively, the positional relationship may be modified by directly changing the position or direction of the moving object antenna circuit <b>102</b> or the power feeding device antenna circuit <b>201</b> without moving the moving object <b>100</b> or the power feeding device <b>200</b>. After modifying the positional relationship, a test signal is used to redetermine whether or not the positional relationship between the moving object antenna circuit <b>102</b> and the power feeding device antenna circuit <b>201</b> is in a state adapted to start of the charging.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The strength of the radio wave transmitted as the test signal may be sufficient as long as the positional relationship between the moving object antenna circuit <b>102</b> and the power feeding device antenna circuit <b>201</b> can be detected. Thus, the strength of the radio wave can be sufficiently lower than that of the charging radio wave.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">If test signals are transmitted plural times for the alignment, the strengths of the test signals to be transmitted may not be necessarily equal to each other. For example, the strength of a test signal transmitted for alignment may be lowered for each alignment. Alternatively, if the positional relationship between the power feeding device antenna circuit <b>201</b> and the moving object antenna circuit <b>102</b> is unsuitable so that a test signal transmitted first cannot be received, a test signal with a strength higher than that of the first test signal may be transmitted next.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In one embodiment of the present invention, the charging radio wave has no limitation on its frequency and may have any band of frequency as long as power can be transmitted. For example, the charging radio wave may have any of an LF band of 135 kHz (long wave), a HF band of 13.56 MHz, a UHF band of 900 MHz to 1 GHz, and a microwave band of 2.45 GHz.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In addition, the radio wave used as the test signal may have the same frequency band as the charging radio wave or a frequency band different from that of the charging radio wave.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A radio wave transmission method may be properly selected from various methods including an electromagnetic coupling method, an electromagnetic induction method, a resonance method, and a microwave method. In one embodiment of the present invention, in order to prevent energy loss due to foreign substances containing moisture, such as rain and mud, the electromagnetic induction method or the resonance method using a low frequency band, more specifically, frequencies of a short wave of 3 MHz to 30 MHz, a medium wave of 300 kHz to 3 MHz, a long wave of 30 kHz to 300 kHz, or a very-low frequency wave of 3 kHz to 30 kHz, may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In one embodiment of the present invention, the data on the positional relationship between the moving object antenna circuit <b>102</b> and the power feeding device antenna circuit <b>201</b> may be extracted from the strength of the test signal. The data on the positional relationship helps the driver of the moving object <b>100</b> to align the moving object <b>100</b> and the power feeding device <b>200</b> while driving the moving object <b>100</b>. Alternatively, this data helps the controller of operation of the power feeding device <b>200</b> to align the moving object <b>100</b> and the power feeding device <b>200</b> while operating the power feeding device <b>200</b>. Accordingly, the moving object <b>100</b> and the power feeding device <b>200</b> can be easily aligned to prevent power loss which may be caused when the battery is charged. In addition, the strength of a radio wave radiated to the surroundings from the power feeding device <b>200</b> without being used for charging can be low.</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Subsequently, operations of the moving object <b>100</b> and the power feeding device <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> will be described with reference to a flow chart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The operations of the moving object <b>100</b> and the power feeding device <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may include a first stage of aligning the moving object <b>100</b> and the power feeding device <b>200</b> and a second stage of performing a charging operation, as will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">First, in the first stage, an alignment radio wave as a test signal is transmitted from the power feeding device antenna circuit <b>201</b> (A<b>01</b>: transmission of a test signal). Specifically, the signal processing circuit <b>202</b> generates a signal required for alignment. This signal contains data on the strength, the frequency, and the like of the radio wave. In accordance with this signal and a signal having a certain frequency generated in the oscillator circuit <b>206</b>, the modulation circuit <b>204</b> applies a voltage to the power feeding device antenna circuit <b>201</b>, whereby the alignment radio wave is transmitted, as the test signal, from the power feeding device antenna circuit <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The test signal transmitted from the power feeding device antenna circuit <b>201</b> is received by the moving object antenna circuit <b>102</b> of the moving object <b>100</b> (B<b>01</b>: reception of the test signal).

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The strength of the received test signal depends on the positional relationship in distance, direction, or the like between the moving object antenna circuit <b>102</b> and the power feeding device antenna circuit <b>201</b>.

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Then, the signal processing circuit <b>103</b> determines based on the strength of the received test signal whether or not the positional relationship between the moving object antenna circuit <b>102</b> and the power feeding device antenna circuit <b>201</b> is in a state adapted to start of charging (B<b>02</b>: determination of whether a state is adapted to start of charging).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">If the strength of the received test signal is insufficient, it means that the efficiency of energy conversion in converting the radio wave into the electric signal is low. Accordingly, the positional relationship between the moving object antenna circuit <b>102</b> and the power feeding device antenna circuit <b>201</b> is determined to be not in a state adapted to start of the charging. When such determination is made, the positional relationship between the moving object antenna circuit <b>102</b> and the power feeding device antenna circuit <b>201</b> is modified by changing the position or direction of the moving object <b>100</b> or the power feeding device <b>200</b> (B<b>03</b>: modification of the positional relationship between antenna circuits).

After modifying the positional relationship, the steps from the step A<b>01</b> (transmission of a test signal) to the step B<b>02</b> (determination of whether a state is adapted to start of charging) are repeated for the alignment.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">If the strength of the received test signal is sufficiently high, it means that an efficiency of energy conversion in converting the radio wave into the electric signal is sufficiently high.

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">If the positional relationship is determined to be in a state adapted to start of charging, it means that the alignment has been finished and preparation for charging has been completed.

When the modulation circuit <b>106</b> applies a voltage to the moving object antenna circuit <b>102</b> in accordance with the generated signal, the signal for notification of completed preparation is transmitted from the moving object antenna circuit <b>102</b> by a radio wave (B<b>04</b>: transmission of a signal for notification of completed preparation).</p>

When the signal processing circuit <b>202</b> receives the signal for notification of the completed preparation (the demodulated signal), the operations of the moving object <b>100</b> and the power feeding device <b>200</b> proceed from the first stage to the second stage.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the second stage, a charging radio wave is transmitted from the power feeding device antenna circuit <b>201</b> (A<b>03</b>: transmission of a charging radio wave).

<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The rectifier circuit of the moving object is not limited to the configurations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref>. For example, instead of the half-wave voltage-doubler rectifier circuit, any of the other half-wave rectifier circuits such as a half-wave voltage-quadrupler rectifier circuit or a half-wave voltage-sixtupler rectifier circuit, and a full-wave rectifier circuit may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">In addition, although it is illustrated that separate elements are connected to each other in the circuit diagrams, in reality, one conductive film may have functions of a plurality of elements, such as a portion of a wiring functioning as an electrode. As used herein, the term &#x201c;connection&#x201d; includes the case where one conductive film has functions of a plurality of elements.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In addition, a source electrode and a drain electrode of a transistor may be interchangeably referred to depending on polarity of the transistor and a difference between potentials given to electrodes. In general, in an n-channel transistor, an electrode with a low potential is called a source electrode, whereas an electrode with a high potential is called a drain electrode. In a p-channel transistor, an electrode with a low potential is called a drain electrode, whereas an electrode with a high potential is called a source electrode. In this specification, although the connection relationship of the transistor is sometimes described under the assumption that a source electrode and a drain electrode are fixed for the sake of convenience, in reality, the source electrode and the drain electrode may be interchangeably referred to depending on the potential relationship.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Next, a configuration of a transistor used in a rectifier circuit, a power supply circuit, a signal processing circuit, a modulation circuit, a demodulation circuit, a selection circuit, and the like will be described. In one embodiment of the present invention, a configuration of a transistor used in any of the above-mentioned circuits is not particularly limited, but a transistor which can control a high withstanding voltage and a high current is desirably used. In addition, if a range of temperatures under environments where the moving object is used is wide, a transistor whose characteristics change very little depending on temperature is desirably used.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">An example of a transistor which meets the requirement described above may include a transistor which uses, as semiconductor material, a compound semiconductor such as silicon carbide (SiC) or gallium nitride (GaN), or an oxide semiconductor formed of metal oxide such as zinc oxide (ZnO), both of which have a wider band gap than a silicon semiconductor and a lower intrinsic carrier density than silicon. Among them, the oxide semiconductor has the advantage that it can be fabricated using a sputtering method or a wet method (a printing method or the like) and has good mass productivity. While silicon carbide and gallium nitride can not have sufficient characteristics unless they are monocrystalline and process temperatures for monocrystallization of silicon carbide and gallium nitride are about 1500&#xb0; C. and about 1100&#xb0; C., respectively, a film forming temperature of the oxide semiconductor is low, for example, 300&#xb0; C. to 500&#xb0; C. (about 700&#xb0; C. at a maximum) and a semiconductor element including the oxide semiconductor can be stacked on an integrated circuit including a semiconductor material such as single crystal silicon. In addition, larger substrates can be used. Accordingly, among the above-mentioned wide gap semiconductors, the oxide semiconductor has the advantage of being able to be mass produced. In addition, a crystalline oxide semiconductor having better performance (for example, field effect mobility) can be easily obtained by thermal treatment at 450&#xb0; C. to 800&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">A highly purified oxide semiconductor (OS) with reduced impurities such as moisture and hydrogen as electron donors (donors) is an i-type semiconductor (an intrinsic semiconductor) or a substantially i-type semiconductor. Thus, a transistor including the oxide semiconductor has a characteristic of very low off-state current or leak current. Specifically, the highly purified oxide semiconductor has hydrogen concentration of 5&#xd7;10<sup>19</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less, preferably 5&#xd7;10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less, more preferably 5&#xd7;10<sup>17</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less, still more preferably 1&#xd7;10<sup>16</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less, when measurement of the hydrogen concentration is performed using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). In addition, the carrier density of the oxide semiconductor which can be measured by Hall effect measurement is less than 1&#xd7;10<sup>14</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably less than 1&#xd7;10<sup>12</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, more preferably less than 1&#xd7;10<sup>11</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>. In addition, the band gap of the oxide semiconductor is 2 eV or more, preferably 2.5 eV or more, more preferably 3 eV or more. By using a highly purified oxide semiconductor film with sufficiently reduced concentration of impurities such as moisture and hydrogen, off-state current or leak current of the transistor can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Here, an analysis on the hydrogen concentration of the oxide semiconductor film will be mentioned. Measurements of the hydrogen concentration of the oxide semiconductor film and the hydrogen concentration of the conductive film are performed by SIMS. In principle, it is known that it is hard to obtain precise data on the vicinity of a sample surface or the vicinity of an interface with a film including a different material by SIMS. Therefore, when a distribution of hydrogen concentrations of the film in its thickness direction is analyzed by SIMS, an average value in a region in which values do not extremely vary and are substantially the same in a range where the target film exists is employed as the hydrogen concentration. In addition, if the thickness of the film is small, a region in which substantially the same values are obtained cannot be found in some cases because the film is influenced by the hydrogen concentration of an adjacent film. In this case, the maximum or minimum of the concentration of hydrogen in the region in which the film exists is employed as the hydrogen concentration of the film. In addition, if there is no mountain-like peak having a maximum value and no valley-like peak having a minimum value in the region in which the film exists, a value at an inflection point is employed as the hydrogen concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Specifically, it can be proved by various experiments that a transistor including a highly purified oxide semiconductor film as an active layer has low off-state current. For example, even an element having a channel width of 1&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>&#x3bc;m and a channel length of 10 &#x3bc;M can have the characteristic of having an off-state current (a drain current in the case where a voltage between a gate electrode and a source electrode is 0 V or less) of the measurement limit or less of a semiconductor parameter analyzer, i.e., 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;13 </sup>A or less, in a range of 1 V to 10 V of a voltage between the source electrode and the drain electrode (a drain voltage). In this case, it can be seen that the off-state current density corresponding to a value obtained by dividing the off-state current by the channel width of the transistor is 100 zA/&#x3bc;m or less. In addition, in an experiment using a circuit where a capacitor is connected to a transistor (the thickness of a gate insulating film is 100 nm) and charges flowing in or out of the capacitor are controlled by the transistor, when a highly purified oxide semiconductor film is used for a channel formation region of the transistor, a measurement of the off-state current density of the transistor from variation of charges of the capacitor per unit time is 10 zA/&#x3bc;m to 100 zA/&#x3bc;m, which is further low, in the case where the voltage between the source electrode and the drain electrode of the transistor is 3 V. Accordingly, the off-state current density of the transistor including the highly purified oxide semiconductor film as an active layer can be 100 zA/&#x3bc;m or less, preferably 10 zA/&#x3bc;m or less, more preferably 1 zA/&#x3bc;m or less depending on the voltage between the source electrode and the drain electrode. Accordingly, a transistor including the highly purified oxide semiconductor film as an active layer has even lower off-state current than a transistor including crystalline silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">A transistor including the above-described oxide semiconductor for a channel formation region is desirably used for an element required to have the characteristic of low off-state current, such as a switching element of a modulation circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">The off-state current of a transistor including a highly purified oxide semiconductor hardly depends on temperature. This is because the oxide semiconductor is made to be as close to intrinsic as possible by removing impurities as electron donors (donors) in the oxide semiconductor to highly purify the oxide semiconductor, so that the Fermi level is located in a center of the forbidden band. In addition, this is because an energy gap of the oxide semiconductor is 3 eV or more and there are very few thermally-excited carriers. In addition, degeneration of the source electrode and the drain electrode is also a cause of no temperature dependence. The transistor is mostly operated by carriers injected into the oxide semiconductor from the degenerated source electrode and the carrier density has no dependence on temperature; therefore, the of state current has no dependence on temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Examples of the oxide semiconductor include a quaternary metal oxide such as an In&#x2014;Sn&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor; ternary metal oxides such as an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor, an In&#x2014;Sn&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor, an In&#x2014;Al&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor, an Sn&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor, an Al&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor, and an Sn&#x2014;Al&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor; binary metal oxides such as an In&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor, an Sn&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor, an Al&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor, a Zn&#x2014;Mg&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor, an Sn&#x2014;Mg&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor, an In&#x2014;Mg&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor, and an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor; an In&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor; an Sn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor; and a Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor. In this specification, the term &#x201c;In&#x2014;Sn&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor&#x201d; means metal oxide containing Indium (In), tin (Sn), gallium (Ga), and zinc (Zn) and may have any stoichiometric composition. In addition, the oxide semiconductor may contain silicon.</p>

<p id="p-0163" num="0162">By using an oxygen-containing inorganic material for the channel protective film <b>634</b>, even if oxygen vacancy in the oxide semiconductor film <b>633</b> occurs due to heat treatment for reduction of moisture and hydrogen, oxygen can be supplied to a region of the oxide semiconductor film <b>633</b>, which is in contact with at least the channel protective film <b>634</b>, thereby reducing the oxygen vacancy as a donor to obtain a structure which satisfies the stoichiometric composition. Thus, the channel formation region can be made to be i-type or substantially i-type and variation of electric characteristics of the transistor due to oxygen vacancy can be reduced, which result in improvement of the electric characteristics.</p>
