<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a continuation-in-part of pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/361,263, filed Jan. 28, 2009, entitled &#x201c;Down-the-Hole Drill Reverse Exhaust System,&#x201d; the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a down-the-hole drill (&#x201c;DHD&#x201d;) hammer. In particular, the present invention relates to a DHD hammer having a sliding exhaust check valve assembly and more particularly, a sliding exhaust check valve assembly that combines supply and exhaust check valves into a single unit operation.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typical DHD hammers utilize what is known as &#x201c;reactive&#x201d; seals for sealing the DHD hammer's interior from its exterior environment, such as water and debris. The seals are known as &#x201c;reactive&#x201d; seals because they require the movement of exhaust flow to displace or open flow passageways within the DHD hammer. However, such DHD hammers also require that exhaust pressures be minimized for proper functioning of the DHD hammer. As such, the level of reactive forces/pressures for the &#x201c;reactive&#x201d; seals were also minimized, thereby potentially negatively impacting the &#x201c;reactive&#x201d; seal's effectiveness.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A DHD hammer, such as the present invention, having a sliding exhaust check valve addresses the foregoing limitations of reactive seals.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a down-the-hole drill hammer comprising a housing, a backhead and a tubular sliding check valve assembly. The backhead is positioned at a proximal end of the housing and includes a distal end, a threaded male proximal end, a supply inlet and an exhaust port. The supply inlet receives a supply of working fluid to an interior of the backhead. The exhaust port provides for communication between the interior of the backhead and an exterior of the backhead. The tubular sliding check valve assembly is within the housing proximate to the backhead. The sliding check valve assembly includes a distributor, a sliding valve, and a biasing member. The distributor has a central opening, an aperture extending through the distributor and offset from the central opening for allowing the passage of working fluid through the distributor, and an exhaust gallery for communicating between the central opening and the exhaust port. The sliding valve is slidable along the central opening and movable between a closed position and an open position. The sliding valve has a closed proximal end, an open distal end, and an opening about a midsection of the sliding valve. In the closed position, a proximal end of the sliding valve sealingly engages the supply inlet and a distal end of the sliding valve sealingly engages an inlet opening of the exhaust gallery. In the open position, the sliding valve is offset from the supply inlet, the openings of the sliding valve are in communication with the exhaust gallery, and the supply inlet is in communication with the aperture extending through the distributor. The biasing member biases the sliding valve.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with another preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a down-the-hole drill hammer comprising a housing, a backhead, and a tubular sliding check valve assembly. The backhead is positioned at a proximal end of the housing and includes a distal end, a threaded male proximal end, a supply inlet for receiving a supply of working fluid to an interior of the backhead, an exhaust port for communicating between the interior of the backhead and an exterior of the backhead, a tubular distal end, and a tapered midsection interior in communication with the supply inlet. The tapered mid section interior includes a frustroconical section adjacent the supply inlet, and a tubular section adjacent the frustroconical section. The tubular sliding check valve assembly is housed within the housing proximate to the backhead. The sliding check valve assembly includes a distributor, a sliding valve, and a biasing member. The distributor has a central opening, an aperture extending through the distributor in an axial direction and offset from the central opening for allowing the passage of working fluid through the distributor, and an exhaust gallery for communicating between the central opening and the exhaust port.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Certain terminology is used in the following description for convenience only and is not limiting. The words &#x201c;right,&#x201d; &#x201c;left,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; and &#x201c;lower&#x201d; designate directions in the drawings to which reference is made.

Additionally, the term &#x201c;a,&#x201d; as used in the specification, means &#x201c;at least one.&#x201d; The terminology includes the words above specifically mentioned, derivatives thereof, and words of similar import.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is shown a DHD hammer that includes a housing <b>12</b>, a backhead <b>14</b> and a tubular sliding check valve assembly <b>46</b>, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The housing <b>12</b> is generally cylindrical and configured to receive a portion of the backhead <b>14</b> and a portion of a drill bit <b>15</b>, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The structure and operation of the housing <b>12</b> is known in the art and therefore a detail description of the housing <b>12</b> is not necessary for complete understanding of the present invention. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the housing <b>12</b> includes internal threads <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b </i>about its proximal end and distal end, respectively. The threads <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b </i>provide for a threaded connection of the backhead <b>14</b> and the assembly of the drill bit <b>15</b> to the housing <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The backhead <b>14</b> is generally configured, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the backhead <b>14</b> includes a proximal end <b>22</b>, a mid portion <b>35</b> and a distal end <b>20</b>. The proximal end <b>22</b> is generally configured as a tool-joint connection for assembly to a drill string or other tool (not shown) as known in the art. The proximal end <b>22</b> also includes male threads <b>24</b> for securing the proximal end <b>22</b> to the drill string (not shown). The distal end <b>20</b> includes threads <b>20</b> on the exterior surface for connecting with the housing <b>12</b> via the housing threads <b>12</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The tubular sliding check valve assembly <b>46</b>, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. The tubular sliding check valve assembly <b>46</b> includes a distributor <b>48</b>, a sliding valve <b>62</b> and a biasing member <b>108</b>. The tubular sliding check valve assembly <b>46</b> is housed within the housing <b>12</b> proximate the backhead <b>14</b>. When fully assembled within the DHD hammer <b>10</b>, the tubular sliding check valve assembly <b>46</b> is housed partially within the backhead <b>14</b> and partially within the proximal end of the housing <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the backhead <b>14</b> also includes a supply inlet <b>26</b> that extends from the proximal end <b>22</b> to an interior region <b>28</b> of the backhead <b>14</b>. Supply pressures of about 150 to 450 pounds per square inch (p.s.i.) are typically supplied to the DHD hammer <b>10</b> through the supply inlet <b>26</b>. The interior region <b>28</b> of the backhead <b>14</b> is configured, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and includes a tapered midsection <b>33</b> and a tubular distal end <b>44</b>. The interior of the tapered midsection <b>33</b> tapers inwardly in the proximal direction. The tapered midsection <b>33</b> includes a first frustroconical shaped wall section <b>34</b> that is adjacent the supply inlet <b>26</b>. Adjacent the first frustroconical wall section <b>34</b> is a first tubular wall section <b>36</b>. A second frustroconical shaped wall section <b>38</b> is adjacent the first tubular wall section <b>36</b>. Adjacent the second frustroconical wall section <b>38</b> is a second tubular wall section <b>40</b>. Adjacent the second tubular wall section <b>40</b> is a third frustroconical shaped wall section <b>42</b>. Preferably, the first frustroconical wall section <b>34</b> is distal to the supply inlet <b>26</b>. Furthermore, the first tubular wall section <b>36</b> is distal to the first frustroconical wall section <b>34</b>, the second frustroconical wall section <b>38</b> is distal to the first tubular wall section <b>36</b>, the second tubular wall section <b>40</b> is distal to the second frustroconical wall section <b>38</b>, and the third frustroconical wall section <b>42</b> is distal to the second tubular wall section <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The configuration of the tapered midsection <b>33</b> in combination with the sliding valve <b>62</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> and described below) advantageously provides for an expandable inlet passageway <b>41</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>) between the backhead <b>14</b> and the sliding valve <b>62</b> for communicating between the supply inlet <b>26</b> and a plurality of apertures <b>52</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) extending through the distributor <b>48</b>, as further described below. That is, as the applied supply pressure of working fluids supplied by the drill string pressurizes the sliding valve <b>62</b>, the sliding valve <b>62</b> moves distally within the tapered midsection <b>33</b>. As the sliding valve <b>62</b> travels or slides distally, the inlet passageway <b>41</b> expands due to the distally expanding interior wall surface profile defined by the progression of frustroconical and tubular wall sections <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The overall diameter of the sliding valve <b>62</b> is sized to provide a relatively small clearance of flow around the sliding valve <b>62</b> until an upper portion <b>62</b><i>a </i>(i.e., a frustroconical portion) of the sliding valve <b>62</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) moves distally past the second frustroconical wall section <b>38</b>. Preferably, the clearance between the outside surface of the upper portion <b>62</b><i>a </i>and the interior wall surface of the interior <b>28</b> is about 0.02 to 0.05 inches, and more preferably about 0.03 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In general, the inlet passageway <b>41</b> is in communication between the supply inlet <b>26</b> and the apertures <b>52</b> of the distributor <b>48</b> when the sliding valve <b>62</b> is in the open position. The inlet passageway <b>41</b> is formed between the surfaces of the chamfered proximal end of the sliding valve <b>62</b> and at least the frustroconical wall <b>34</b> and tubular wall <b>36</b> of the interior <b>28</b> of the backhead <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The expandable inlet passageway <b>41</b> advantageously ensures that the supply of working fluid volumes into the backhead <b>14</b> adequately compresses or forces the biasing member <b>108</b> to move the sliding valve <b>62</b> to the fully open position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>). This is a key feature of the tubular sliding check valve assembly <b>46</b>, because without the expandable inlet passageway <b>41</b>, the sliding valve <b>62</b> can become stuck in mid-stroke or in only a partially opened position due to the pressure forces above and below the sliding valve <b>62</b> equalizing during the movement of the sliding valve <b>62</b> to the fully open position.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The tubular distal end <b>44</b> of the backhead <b>14</b> is configured, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and is distal to the tapered midsection <b>33</b>. The tubular distal end <b>44</b> is configured to receive the distributor <b>48</b>. About a proximal end of the tubular distal end <b>44</b> is an exhaust port <b>30</b> that extends radially from the interior <b>28</b> through the wall of the tubular distal end <b>44</b>. As such, the exhaust port <b>30</b> provides for fluid communication between the interior <b>28</b> and an exterior of the backhead <b>14</b> (FIG. <b>3</b>). Preferably, the backhead <b>14</b> includes a plurality of exhaust ports <b>30</b>, and more preferably, six exhaust ports <b>30</b>. The plurality of exhaust ports <b>30</b> are circumferentially and equally spaced apart. The exhaust ports <b>30</b> also include a groove or galley <b>30</b><i>a </i>that extends from an external surface of the backhead <b>14</b> towards the proximal end, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The galley <b>30</b><i>a </i>is configured with a substantially rectangular or oblong shape that is inset within the wall of the backhead <b>14</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a proximal end of the galley <b>30</b><i>a </i>extends or tapers radially and outwardly in the proximal direction and terminates at an outlet end <b>30</b><i>b </i>that is proximate the housing <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The backhead <b>14</b> also includes a flange <b>45</b> that extends radially inwardly from an outside surface of the mid portion <b>35</b> to the distal end <b>20</b> of the backhead <b>14</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the flange <b>45</b> is positioned above the exhaust ports <b>30</b>. The flange <b>45</b> provides a distal surface that engages a proximal end of the housing <b>12</b>, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The distributor <b>48</b>, is best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-10</figref>. The distributor <b>48</b> includes a main body portion <b>48</b><i>a </i>and an exhaust stem <b>48</b><i>b </i>that is configured to extend into the drive chamber <b>18</b> of the DHD hammer <b>10</b>. The distributor <b>48</b> also includes a central opening <b>50</b> that extends axially through the distributor <b>48</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and opens up to form an interior <b>51</b> of the main body portion <b>48</b><i>a</i>. As such, the central opening <b>50</b> provides for fluid communication between the proximal end and the distal end of the distributor <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The distributor <b>48</b> further includes an aperture <b>52</b> that extends through the distributor <b>48</b> in an axial direction. The aperture <b>52</b> is radially offset from the central opening <b>50</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The aperture <b>52</b> provides for fluid communication through the distributor <b>48</b>, as further discussed below. Preferably, the distributor <b>48</b> includes a plurality of apertures <b>52</b>, and more preferably the distributor <b>48</b> includes six apertures <b>52</b> that are circumferentially and equally spaced apart, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The distributor <b>48</b> also includes an exhaust gallery <b>54</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 9</figref>. The exhaust gallery <b>54</b> is configured with a first opening <b>54</b><i>a</i>, an enlarged opening <b>54</b><i>b </i>adjacent the opening <b>54</b><i>a </i>and an inlet opening <b>54</b><i>c </i>adjacent the first opening <b>54</b><i>a </i>at an end of the first opening <b>54</b><i>a </i>opposite the enlarged opening <b>54</b><i>b</i>. The first opening <b>54</b><i>a </i>is in communication with the interior <b>51</b> of the distributor <b>48</b> and the enlarged opening <b>54</b><i>b</i>. The exhaust gallery <b>54</b> also provides for fluid communication between the central opening <b>50</b> and the exhaust port <b>30</b> of the backhead, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The distributor <b>48</b> preferably includes glands <b>57</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>that each receives a respective seal, as further described below. Gland <b>57</b><i>a </i>receives a seal <b>94</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) and is positioned about an interior wall surface of the interior <b>51</b> and below or distal to the inlet opening <b>54</b><i>c </i>while the gland <b>57</b><i>b </i>receives a seal <b>92</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) and is positioned about the interior wall surface of the interior <b>51</b> and above or proximal to the inlet opening <b>54</b><i>c</i>. The glands <b>57</b><i>a </i>and <b>57</b><i>b </i>and their respective seals sealingly engage an outer surface of the sliding valve <b>62</b>. The gland <b>57</b><i>c </i>is positioned along an outer wall surface of the distributor <b>48</b> and above the enlarged opening <b>54</b><i>b </i>while the gland <b>57</b><i>d </i>is positioned along the outer wall surface of the distributor <b>48</b> and positioned below the enlarged opening <b>54</b><i>b</i>. Furthermore, the distributor <b>48</b> includes a gland <b>56</b> about a distal end of the interior <b>51</b> and a radially inwardly extending flange <b>59</b> about a proximal end of the main body portion <b>48</b><i>a </i>above the first openings <b>54</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The sliding valve <b>62</b>, is best shown in FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>11</b>-<b>14</b>. The sliding valve <b>62</b> is assembled within the interior <b>51</b> of the distributor <b>48</b>, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. When fully assembled within the DHD hammer <b>10</b>, the sliding valve <b>62</b> is slidable along the interior <b>51</b> of the distributor <b>48</b> and movable between a closed position and an open position, as further discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The sliding valve <b>62</b> includes a closed proximal end <b>64</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>), an open distal end <b>66</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) and an opening <b>68</b> about a midsection of the sliding valve <b>62</b>.

The upper portion <b>62</b><i>a </i>is generally configured as a frustroconical portion or as a chamfered proximal end. The main body portion <b>62</b><i>b </i>is generally configured as a tubular portion extending distally from the upper portion <b>62</b><i>a</i>. The sliding valve <b>62</b> is configured with a hollow interior <b>62</b><i>c </i>and a through hole <b>70</b> that extends through a proximal end of the main body portion <b>62</b><i>b</i>. The through hole <b>70</b> is configured to receive a dowel <b>76</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). The dowel <b>76</b> serves as a bypass plug or a choke plug for the sliding valve <b>62</b>, as known in the art. The sliding valve <b>62</b> can optionally be configured with a gland <b>74</b> recessed about an outer surface of the frustroconical upper portion <b>62</b><i>a</i>. The upper portion <b>62</b><i>a </i>also includes a distal surface <b>72</b> that extends radially inwardly to the exterior wall of the main body portion <b>62</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The assembly of the sliding valve <b>62</b> within the DHD hammer <b>10</b>, owing to the openings <b>68</b> of the sliding valve <b>62</b> being in communication with the exhaust ports <b>30</b>, advantageously ensures that the interior <b>62</b><i>c </i>is substantially at exhaust pressure or the pressure external to DHD hammer <b>10</b>, which is significantly less (e.g., at about atmospheric pressure or about 0-50 p.s.i.) than the supply pressure (e.g., about 300-350 p.s.i. or about 150 to 450 p.s.i.) being fed to the DHD hammer <b>10</b> via the supply inlet <b>26</b>. Thus, because the pressure within the sliding valve <b>62</b> is maintained at lower pressures, relative to the supply pressure of working fluid volumes fed to the DHD hammer <b>10</b>, the tubular sliding check valve assembly <b>46</b> advantageously ensures that the supply pressure functions as a bias pressure to urge the tubular sliding check valve assembly <b>46</b> to the open position.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The biasing member <b>108</b> is assembled to the tubular sliding check valve assembly <b>46</b> so as to be positioned between the sliding valve <b>62</b> and the distributor <b>48</b>, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The biasing member <b>108</b> can be any biasing member know in the art and preferably a coil spring biasing member <b>108</b>. A proximal end of the biasing member <b>108</b> engages the distal end <b>72</b> of the sliding valve <b>62</b> while the distal end of the biasing member <b>108</b> engages the flange <b>59</b> extending radially inwardly from the upper portion of the distributor's interior <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Preferably, the biasing member <b>108</b> is configured to provide an overall restoring force to the sliding valve <b>62</b> sufficient to retain an elevated pressure of at least 35 p.s.i. within the DHD hammer <b>10</b>. This can be accomplished with a biasing member <b>108</b> the provides a net restoring force in lbs. that is about 90% to 125% of the numerical valve of the DHD hammer's internal diameter squared. The term &#x201c;net restoring force&#x201d; means the overall force applied to the sliding valve <b>62</b> by the biasing member <b>108</b> minus any counterforces acting on the sliding valve <b>62</b>, such as frictional forces generated by seals on the sliding valve <b>62</b>. Configuring the biasing member <b>108</b> to have a net restoring force of about 90% to 125% of the numerical valve of the DHD hammer's internal diameter squared advantageously allows the biasing member <b>108</b> to move the sliding valve <b>62</b> to the closed position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) when a flow of supply pressure fed through the supply inlet <b>26</b> is discontinued, thereby sealing off the supply inlet <b>26</b>, while the internal pressure within the DHD hammer <b>10</b> is maintained at elevated pressures e.g., at or above 35 p.s.i. Elevated pressures are maintained within the DHD hammer <b>10</b> in combination with a seal <b>17</b> and a solid-core piston <b>16</b>, as further described below.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Thus, for example, Table 1 illustrates the preferred net restoring force ranges for the biasing member <b>108</b> over a range of DHD hammer <b>10</b> bore sizes.</p>

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">During operation of the DHD hammer <b>10</b>, the flow of working fluid or supply pressure pressurizes the internal areas of the DHD hammer <b>10</b> to elevated pressures above 35 p.s.i., and typically operates the DHD hammer <b>10</b> at pressures from about 150 p.s.i. to 450 p.s.i. Thus, with a biasing member <b>108</b> having a sufficient net restoring force, the biasing member <b>108</b> allows the DHD hammer <b>10</b> to partially retain the elevated pressures within the DHD hammer's internal areas, such as the drive chamber <b>18</b> at elevated pressures. Preferably, the internal areas of the DHD hammer <b>10</b> are maintained at a pressure of at least 35 p.s.i. by the proper balancing of the net restoring force of the biasing member <b>108</b> on the sliding valve <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The internal areas of the DHD hammer <b>10</b>, such as the drive chamber <b>18</b>, are sealed off, and preferably hermetically sealed, owing to the combination of the solid-core piston <b>16</b> and the seal <b>17</b>, when the DHD hammer <b>10</b> is in a drop-down position. The DHD hammer <b>10</b> is sealed off and moved to the drop-down position upon the flow of supply pressure feed to the DHD hammer <b>10</b> being discontinued i.e., stopped or reduced to a non-actuating level, such as 35 p.s.i. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> illustrates the DHD hammer <b>10</b> in the drop-down position. Maintaining the internal areas of the DHD hammer <b>10</b> at elevated pressures advantageously prevents the ingress of water and debris into the DHD hammer's interior, which can negatively impact the overall operation and startup of the DHD hammer <b>10</b> after an intermittent stop. Typically, well bores can generate a water column to heights of up to 80 feet of water, or about 35 p.s.i. Thus, maintaining the internal areas of a DHD hammer <b>10</b> at or above 35 p.s.i. upon an intermitted stop advantageously prevents the ingress of water and debris into the DHD hammer <b>10</b> when situated at a well bore bottom.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The seal <b>17</b> is best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24-26</figref>. The seal <b>17</b> is housed within a gland <b>17</b><i>a </i>of the housing <b>12</b> located about a distal end of the housing <b>12</b> and above the threads <b>12</b><i>b</i>. The seal <b>17</b> is preferably positioned so as to be engaged with a cylindrical bearing <b>19</b> located about the distal end of the housing <b>12</b> and configured to receive a distal end of the piston <b>16</b>. The cylindrical bearing <b>19</b> is seated on a chuck assembly <b>21</b> that threadedly engages the housing <b>12</b> and retains the drill bit <b>15</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, when the DHD hammer <b>10</b> is in the drop down position, the solid-core piston <b>16</b> engages the seal <b>17</b>, thereby preventing the ingress of external fluid and debris into the internal areas of the DHD hammer <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A</figref>, <b>19</b>A and <b>22</b>A illustrate an alternative sliding valve <b>62</b>&#x2032; embodiment that is similar to the sliding valve <b>62</b>, except for the inclusion of a reduced diameter lower body portion <b>63</b><i>b</i>&#x2032;. That is, the main body portion <b>62</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; includes an upper body portion <b>63</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; and the lower body portion <b>63</b><i>b</i>&#x2032;. The lower body portion <b>63</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; has an overall diameter that is smaller then the upper body portion <b>63</b><i>a</i>&#x2032;.

The stepped flange is positioned distal to the openings <b>68</b>&#x2032;. The distally facing surface <b>63</b><i>c</i>&#x2032; advantageously provides for a distally facing surface area i.e., a bias area <b>63</b><i>c</i>&#x2032;, which is exposed to exhaust pressure (which is less the supply pressure) to ensure that the sliding valve <b>62</b>&#x2032; moves distally to the open position upon exposure to supply pressure (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The distally facing surface area <b>63</b><i>c</i>&#x2032; is preferably about 2-4% of the numerical valve of the DHD hammer's internal diameter squared.

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The combination of the distally facing surface area <b>63</b><i>c</i>&#x2032; of the sliding valve <b>62</b>&#x2032; and the net restoring force of the biasing member <b>108</b> advantageously allows the DHD hammer <b>10</b> to retain elevated pressures within its internal areas at or above 35 p.s.i. upon an intermittent stop of the DHD hammer <b>10</b>.

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>16</b>, the DHD hammer <b>10</b> can optionally include a screen <b>78</b>.

As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the screen <b>78</b> is sized and configured to circumscribe the exhaust gallery's enlarged opening <b>54</b><i>b</i>. The screen <b>78</b> advantageously provides a means to screen out and prevent debris from entering the DHD hammer's interior through the exhaust ports <b>30</b> of the backhead <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The DHD hammer <b>10</b> also includes a belleville washer <b>80</b> for facilitating the mounting of the tubular sliding check valve assembly <b>46</b> within the housing <b>12</b> and the backhead <b>14</b>. The belleville washer <b>80</b> is configured, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>17</b> and <b>18</b>. The belleville washer <b>80</b> includes a central through hole <b>82</b> and glands <b>86</b> and <b>88</b>. The gland <b>88</b> is configured about a surface of the central through hole <b>82</b> for receiving a seal <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>). The belleville washer <b>80</b> also includes a distally facing flange <b>84</b> about a mid portion along its axial length, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. The gland <b>86</b> is positioned below the flange <b>84</b> and configured to receive a seal <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 22</figref>, the belleville washer <b>80</b> is assembled within the housing <b>12</b> such that the flange <b>84</b> engages a proximal end of an inner housing <b>12</b><i>c </i>or sliding cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The inner housing <b>12</b><i>c </i>is preferably a separate component from the rest of the housing <b>12</b>. The structure, operation and assembly of the inner housing <b>12</b><i>c </i>is known in the art and therefore a detailed description of the inner housing <b>12</b><i>c </i>is not necessary for complete understanding of the present invention. However, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the inner housing <b>12</b><i>c </i>is generally configured as a cylindrical housing having a plurality of spaced apart through holes <b>13</b> about the wall of the inner housing <b>12</b><i>c</i>. The plurality of through holes <b>13</b> are arranged, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, with a first row <b>13</b><i>a </i>of through holes <b>13</b> circumferentially and generally evenly spaced apart about a proximal end of the inner housing <b>12</b><i>c </i>and a second row <b>13</b><i>b </i>of through holes <b>13</b> circumferentially and generally evenly spaced apart about a distal end of the inner housing <b>12</b><i>c</i>. The position of the through holes <b>13</b> of the first row <b>13</b><i>a </i>are circumferentially offset from the position of the through holes <b>13</b> of the second row <b>13</b><i>b</i>.

Each spline <b>15</b><i>a </i>provides fluid communication for the flow of fluid between the through holes <b>13</b> of the first and second rows <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b</i>. A plurality of splines <b>15</b><i>b </i>are also formed about the outer surface of the inner housing <b>12</b><i>c </i>that are each in fluid communication with the through holes <b>13</b> of the third row <b>13</b><i>c</i>. Each spline <b>15</b><i>b </i>allows for fluid to flow around the exterior of the inner housing <b>12</b><i>c</i>. As such, the splines <b>15</b><i>b </i>allow for the flow of working fluid volumes to flow from the drive chamber <b>18</b> though the through holes <b>13</b> of either the first, second or third row <b>13</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>to a reservoir chamber <b>18</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Working fluid volumes then flow past the distal end of the piston <b>16</b> into and out of the return chamber <b>18</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Owing to the circumferential offset of the through holes <b>13</b> of the first and third rows <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>c </i>from the second row <b>13</b><i>b</i>, the plurality of splines <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b </i>are formed as helical splines.</p>

In other words, the flow of working fluid volumes from the supply inlet <b>26</b>, check valve assembly <b>46</b>, drive chamber <b>18</b>, reservoir chamber <b>18</b><i>b </i>and return chamber <b>18</b><i>b</i>, all function to drive the operation of the DHD hammer <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> illustrates the assembly of the DHD hammer <b>10</b> without housing <b>12</b>, showing the porting features of the instant invention.</p>

<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The biasing member <b>108</b> biases the sliding valve <b>62</b> to the closed position in the absence of a supply of working fluid volumes being fed through the supply inlet <b>26</b>. The closed position is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 21</figref>. In the closed position, the proximal end of the sliding valve <b>62</b>, i.e., the chamfered end of the upper portion <b>62</b><i>a </i>sealingly engages the supply inlet <b>26</b>. Preferably, the upper portion <b>62</b><i>a </i>of the sliding valve <b>62</b> sealingly engages the first frustroconical wall section <b>34</b> of the backhead <b>14</b>. Furthermore, a distal portion of the sliding valve <b>62</b>, below the openings <b>68</b>, sealingly engages an inlet opening <b>54</b><i>c </i>of the exhaust gallery <b>54</b>. The sealing engagement between the distal end of the sliding valve <b>62</b> and the exhaust gallery <b>54</b> is facilitated by seals <b>92</b> and <b>94</b>. In this position, the tubular sliding check valve assembly <b>46</b> seals off the supply inlet <b>26</b> and any fluid communication between an exterior of the DHD hammer <b>10</b> and an interior of the DHD hammer <b>10</b> through the exhaust ports <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The open position of the tubular sliding check valve assembly <b>46</b>, is best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 22</figref>.

Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the supply inlet <b>26</b> is in communication with the apertures <b>52</b> extending through the distributor <b>48</b> to supply working fluid volumes to the DHD hammer's drive chamber <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the drill bit <b>15</b> is operatively connected to a distal end of the housing <b>12</b>. The drill bit <b>15</b> can be operatively connected in a conventional manner known in the art and therefore a detailed description of such a connection is not necessary for a complete understanding of the present invention. However, an example of how the drill bit <b>15</b> can be operatively connected to the housing <b>12</b> is described in U.S. patent application Ser.

<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The DHD hammer <b>10</b>, as discussed above has been described and shown as including a solid-core piston <b>16</b>.
