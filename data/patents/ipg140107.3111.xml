<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 10/960,654, filed Oct. 7, 2004, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,339,137, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to cooking appliances and more particularly pertains to a new electric grilling appliance for cooking food cleanly and effectively with a minimum of smoke generation that permits the use of the appliance in enclosed spaces.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Grilling is a highly desirable way of cooking food as grilling imparts a unique taste and health benefits to the food that are difficult to achieve with other methods of food preparation. However, grilling has traditionally been performed with fire to achieve the desired grilled food flavor, but the use of fire has a number of fairly evident drawbacks, including, but not limited to, the presence of an open flame, the large amount of heat that is generated and creates high temperatures (that is dissipated into the immediate environment), and the smoke that results when juices from the food come into contact with the flame or the heated surfaces of the grill apparatus. These factors can also apply to known electric grilling apparatus, and have made grilling a decidedly warm weather, out-of-doors activity that is limited by the presence of cold weather or precipitation, and for apartment or dormitory dwellers, the lack of an out-of-doors space where a grilling apparatus may be set up.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">While some indoor grilling apparatus, such as those sold under the GEORGE FOREMAN trademark, have become popular, these types of grilling apparatus generally have an open character that releases a large amount of heat into the immediate environment of the grilling apparatus and exposes hot surfaces to the user and those around the user during the cooking process. Further, the direct contact between the grilling surfaces and the food being grilled can require a significant amount of clean up. Further, if a number of different food items are being grilled on the grilling apparatus at the same time, the flavors of the food can transfer between the foods, which sometimes is desirable but in many cases is to be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In these respects, the electric grilling appliance according to the present invention substantially departs from the conventional concepts and designs of the prior art, and in so doing provides an apparatus primarily developed for the purpose of cooking food cleanly and effectively with a minimum of smoke generation that permits the use of the appliance in enclosed spaces.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of known cooking appliances in the prior art, the present invention provides a new electric grilling appliance wherein the same can be utilized for cooking food cleanly and effectively with a minimum of smoke generation that permits the use of the appliance in enclosed spaces.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">With reference now to the drawings, and in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 12</figref> thereof, a new electric grilling appliance embodying the principles and concepts of the present invention and generally designated by the reference numeral <b>10</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As illustratively shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</figref>, the food heating and grilling appliance <b>10</b> of the invention generally includes a chamber portion <b>12</b> and a lid portion <b>14</b> that define a heating chamber <b>16</b> for receiving an item of food to be heated, in which a heating apparatus <b>18</b> is positioned.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The chamber portion <b>12</b> defines a lower section of the heating chamber <b>16</b>, and has an upper opening <b>20</b> that opens into the heating chamber <b>16</b>. In the illustrative embodiment of the invention, the chamber portion <b>12</b> may comprise a perimeter wall <b>22</b> that defines the upper opening <b>20</b> and extends about the heating chamber <b>16</b>. The perimeter wall <b>22</b> comprises a pair of side walls <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, and a pair of end walls <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>. The walls <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>28</b> of the chamber portion <b>12</b> may be configured into a substantially rectangular cross sectional shape, although other configurations may be employed. The side walls <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and end walls <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> may be comprised of a thermally insulating material positioned between panels of a more durable material, such as a metal. The use of the insulating material in the walls provides the benefits of keeping much of the exterior surface of the chamber portion and the lid portion relatively cool, and also permits a common household power level (for example approximately 120 volts and approximately 15 amps) to create sufficient heat in the heating chamber to cook the food in the heating chamber. Further, the use of the insulating material is believed to permit a larger cooking area to be heated using the preferred heating apparatus <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The chamber portion <b>12</b> may also comprise a bottom wall <b>30</b> that extends below the heating chamber <b>16</b>, and may extend between the sections of the perimeter wall <b>22</b>. The bottom wall <b>30</b> may have an aperture <b>32</b> for permitting air to flow into the heating chamber <b>16</b> from below the chamber portion <b>12</b>. The aperture <b>32</b> may be substantially centrally located on the bottom wall <b>30</b> of the chamber portion <b>12</b>. Optionally, the bottom wall <b>30</b> may lack the insulation of the other walls of the chamber portion <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The lid portion <b>14</b> of the appliance <b>10</b> functions to selectively open and close the upper opening <b>20</b> of the chamber portion <b>12</b>. The lid portion <b>14</b> may be pivotally mounted on the chamber portion <b>12</b> for movement between an open position in which the upper opening is open, and a closed position in which the upper opening is closed. The lid portion <b>14</b> may define an upper portion of the heating chamber <b>16</b>. The lid portion <b>14</b> may comprise a top wall <b>38</b>, a pair of end walls <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, and a pair of side walls <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, and preferably these walls are insulated similar to the walls of the chamber portion <b>12</b>. Optionally, a gasket (not shown) may be positioned between the respective walls of the chamber portion <b>12</b> and the lid portion <b>14</b> when the lid portion <b>14</b> is closed on the chamber portion.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">At least one vent <b>34</b>, and illustratively two vents <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>, are provided to permit a limited quantity of air to pass through the lid portion <b>14</b> to the exterior of the appliance <b>10</b>. The escaping air is replaced by air coming through the aperture <b>32</b> in the bottom wall <b>30</b> of the chamber portion <b>12</b>. The vents <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> extend through the lid portion <b>14</b> between the heating chamber <b>16</b> and an exterior surface of the lid portion <b>14</b>. Preferably, but not critically, the vents <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> are located in the ends walls <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> of the lid portion <b>14</b>, and the interior entrances to the vents are located toward the center of the side walls <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> of the lid portion to promote a more central air flow through the heating chamber <b>16</b>. The vents <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> may be formed of a tube that extends through the wall of the lid portion <b>14</b> and extends into the interior of the heating chamber <b>16</b>. Optionally, a shield may be positioned adjacent to the inner entrances of the vents to further reduce or constrict the opening and minimize air flow through the vent. As a further preferred structure, the area of the opening of the vents <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> is relatively small in comparison to the cross sectional area of the heating chamber in a plane in which the food is supported (e.g., a plane in which the grill extends). For example, each of the vents <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> may have a combined area of approximately one square inch (approximately 6.5 square cm) or less.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The heating apparatus <b>18</b> is positioned in the heating chamber <b>16</b> for the function of heating air in the heating chamber. In the illustrative embodiment of the invention, the heating apparatus <b>18</b> includes a heating element <b>48</b> that is positioned in the heating chamber, and most preferably is positioned adjacent to the perimeter wall <b>22</b> of the chamber portion <b>12</b>. The heating element <b>18</b> may be mounted on the perimeter wall <b>22</b> of the chamber portion <b>12</b>, and may be mounted on one of the side walls <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> of the perimeter wall. In the most preferred embodiments of the invention, the heating element <b>48</b> comprises an electrical heating element, although it is possible that heating elements utilizing other fuel sources, such as a flammable gas or even wood, might be used.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The heating apparatus <b>18</b> may also comprise a shield <b>50</b> that is positioned above the heating element <b>48</b> to block debris from falling on the heating element to avoid the creation of smoke when the debris strikes the hot surface of the heating element <b>18</b>. The shield <b>50</b> may be mounted on the perimeter wall <b>22</b> of the chamber portion <b>12</b>, such as on one of the side walls <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> of the perimeter wall <b>22</b>. The shield <b>50</b> may be sloped downwardly from the perimeter wall <b>22</b> toward a center of the heating chamber <b>16</b>. In the most preferred embodiments of the invention, the heating apparatus <b>18</b> includes a pair of heating elements <b>48</b>, <b>49</b> and a pair of shields <b>50</b>, <b>51</b>, with a first one <b>48</b> of the heating elements and a first one <b>50</b> of the shields being located on a side wall <b>24</b> of the chamber portion <b>12</b> that is opposite of a second one <b>49</b> of the heating elements and a second one <b>51</b> of the shields.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The appliance <b>10</b> may also include a drip collection tray <b>54</b> that is positioned in the heating chamber <b>16</b>, and may be removable from the heating chamber for ease of cleaning, if needed. Preferably the tray <b>54</b> is positioned low in the heating chamber <b>16</b> and below the heating apparatus <b>18</b>, which facilitates keeping the temperature of the drip collection tray <b>54</b> relatively lower than if the tray were positioned higher up in the heating chamber <b>16</b> and thus reduces the possibility of smoke being generated if drippings from the food being cooked strikes the tray <b>54</b>. The smoke may carry irritants that are annoying and carcinogens that are dangerous. In at least some embodiments of the invention the drip collection tray <b>54</b> is positioned above and adjacent to the bottom wall <b>30</b>, and may rest on the bottom wall. The drip collection tray <b>54</b> may have a central hole <b>56</b> that is positioned above the aperture <b>32</b> in the bottom wall <b>30</b>. The drip collection tray <b>54</b> may have a perimeter region <b>58</b> that surrounds a central region <b>60</b> of the tray <b>54</b>. The central region <b>60</b> may be at a relatively lower vertical level than the perimeter region <b>58</b> to cause debris to move toward the central hole <b>56</b> in the central region <b>60</b>. The drip collection tray <b>54</b> may have a perimeter edge <b>62</b>, and the perimeter edge <b>62</b> may be positioned adjacent to the perimeter wall <b>22</b> of the chamber portion <b>12</b>. The perimeter edge <b>62</b> may be spaced from the perimeter wall <b>22</b> a small distance (e.g., less than approximately 0.5 inches (approximately 1.25 cm)) to permit air to move between the perimeter edge <b>62</b> and the perimeter wall <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The combination of the aperture <b>32</b> in the bottom wall <b>30</b> and the spacing between the perimeter edge <b>62</b> of the tray <b>54</b> and the interior walls of the heating chamber <b>16</b> permits a flow of make up air (for the air leaving the vents <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>) to enter the heating chamber <b>16</b>. As the make up air flows about the drip collection tray <b>54</b>, heat from the tray <b>54</b> is absorbed by the entering air, which functions to cool the tray <b>54</b> and preheat the incoming air. The relatively small size of the vents <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> controls the volume of air that can move into the heating chamber <b>16</b>, which minimize the flow of air into the chamber and minimizes the drying effect of the air movement on the food being cooked.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A grill assembly <b>64</b> may be included in the appliance <b>10</b> of the invention for supporting items of food in the heating chamber <b>16</b>. The grill assembly <b>64</b> may comprise a grill <b>66</b> having an outer perimeter frame <b>68</b> defining a central opening and a plurality of bars <b>70</b> that extend across the central opening of the perimeter frame. The grill assembly may also include means for removably mounting the grill in the heating chamber, which may be located on the chamber portion <b>12</b> of the appliance <b>10</b>. Preferably, the grill mounting means is configured to support the grill at two different vertical levels in the heating chamber. In one embodiment of the invention, the grill mounting means comprises an upper support assembly which includes a plurality of pegs <b>72</b>. Each of the pegs <b>72</b> may be mounted on the perimeter wall <b>22</b> of the chamber portion <b>12</b> and may extend inwardly into the heating chamber <b>16</b>. Significantly, the shield <b>50</b> of the heating apparatus <b>18</b> may form a lower support for supporting the grill in a relatively lower vertical position than the pegs <b>72</b> of the upper support assembly. Thus, the upper support assembly is located at a greater distance from the heating element <b>18</b> than the lower support formed by the shield. The adjustment in the vertical height of the grill <b>66</b> permits the accommodation of relatively larger food items in the heating chamber <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The appliance may also include a handle assembly <b>74</b>. The handle assembly <b>74</b> may include at least two segments. The handle assembly may include a lid handle segment <b>76</b> that is mounted on the lid portion <b>14</b>, and may extend in a forward direction from the lid portion <b>14</b>. The handle assembly <b>74</b> may also include a pair of chamber handle segments <b>78</b>, <b>80</b> that are each mounted on the chamber portion <b>12</b>. The pair of chamber handle segments <b>78</b>, <b>80</b> may each be mounted on one of the end walls <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> of the chamber portion <b>12</b>. In the illustrative embodiment of the invention, the lid handle segment <b>76</b> is positioned between the pair of chamber handle segments <b>78</b>, <b>80</b> when the lid portion <b>14</b> is in the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A leg assembly <b>82</b> may be removably mounted on the chamber portion <b>12</b> of the appliance <b>10</b> for supporting the chamber portion <b>12</b> above a surface, such as the ground or a floor. The leg assembly <b>82</b> may include a pair of leg sets <b>84</b>, <b>86</b>. Each of the leg sets <b>84</b>, <b>86</b> may be mounted on one of the end walls <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> of the chamber portion <b>12</b>. Each of the legs sets <b>84</b>, <b>86</b> may comprise a pair of legs <b>88</b>, <b>90</b>, and the pair of legs may be mounted on one of the chamber handle segments <b>78</b>, <b>80</b>. Optionally, the leg assembly <b>82</b> may removable from the chamber portion <b>12</b> to facilitate transport and storage, or placement of the chamber portion <b>12</b> on a raised support surface such as a countertop.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As an option, the food grilling appliance <b>10</b> may include a smoking material holding tray <b>91</b> that may be removable from the heating chamber <b>16</b>. The smoking material holding tray <b>91</b> may be positioned adjacent to at least one of the heating elements <b>48</b>, <b>49</b> for holding a suitable smoking material, such as wood chips, in a manner so that the smoking material can be heated by the heating elements. In one preferred embodiment, the holding tray <b>91</b> is positioned below at least a portion of the heating element <b>48</b>, and may be positioned between two sections of the heating element <b>48</b>, although other positions proximate to the heating elements may also be used. The holding tray <b>91</b> preferably does not touch the heating element <b>48</b>. The smoking material holding tray <b>91</b> of the invention creates smoke for imparting a smoked flavor to the food being cooked. The restricted air flow through the heating chamber <b>16</b> is believed to suppress any burning of the smoking material without having to soak the smoking material prior to placing the material in the holding tray <b>91</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As illustratively shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 through 10</figref>, the invention includes means for controlling the supply of power to the heating apparatus <b>18</b> that may be responsive to the temperature of the air in the heating chamber <b>16</b>, but also to the internal temperature of the food being cooked, so that the food may be heated to the desired temperature without greatly exceeding that desired temperature since the internal temperature of the food item is different from the air temperature in the heating chamber <b>16</b>. The means for controlling the supply of power to the heating apparatus may thus include a user interface assembly that includes a display screen <b>92</b> and a plurality of control switches or buttons <b>94</b>, <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>, and <b>100</b>. Illustratively, the control assembly is integrated into the handle assembly <b>74</b> for convenient access. The control means may also include means for detecting temperature within the heating chamber <b>16</b>, including a temperature transducer or probe <b>102</b> that is removably insertable into an item of food located in the heating chamber in order to contact the interior of the food item and be able to sense and detect that temperature. Optionally, the temperature detection means may also include an air temperature sensor <b>104</b> for additionally detecting the temperature of the air inside the heating chamber <b>16</b>. The signals from the sensors <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> are processed as needed and directed to a microprocessor <b>106</b>. The microprocessor <b>106</b> receives input from the user control switches <b>94</b>-<b>100</b> and outputs data to the display <b>92</b>, and also communicates through suitable circuitry to a relay <b>108</b> that controls the supply of electrical power to the heating elements <b>48</b>, <b>49</b> from a power supply or source <b>110</b>. Optionally, thermal cutoff circuitry <b>112</b> may be included to directly shutoff the supply of power to the heating elements <b>48</b>, <b>49</b> if a predetermined temperature is exceeded in the heating chamber <b>16</b> (should, for example, the power control circuitry fail) as a safety measure.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The means for controlling the heating of the heating elements of the invention permits the heating apparatus to not only cook the food, but also to warm (or maintain an intermediate temperature of) the food after it has been cooked. The cooking of the food can also be conducted in a predictive manner, through the use of the probe <b>102</b> and the processor <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> of the drawings shows an illustrative initializing process for the invention that may be executed at initial power up of the electric grilling apparatus <b>10</b> of the invention, and which may initiate the operation of various control threads by the microprocessor.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> of the drawings shows an illustrative control process of the invention that may be executed after an initializing process has been executed at initial power up, and which monitors the target or desired temperature of the food and the current temperature of the food (or the air in the heating chamber) and adjusts the supply of power to the heating elements <b>48</b>, <b>49</b> on a periodic basis to achieve the target temperature of the heating chamber or in the food being cooked.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> of the drawings shows an illustrative process for monitoring and administering the user controls, such as switches <b>94</b> through <b>100</b>, and user commands entered by the user through the controls.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> of the drawings shows an illustrative process for controlling an output means, such as display screen <b>92</b>, for conveying information to the user. An optional audible signaling means my also be controlled for signaling the user in an audible, and non-visual manner.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The microprocessor <b>106</b> may execute a software control program that executes the processes disclosed above and in the drawings, and may also execute several additional optional processes that provide additional operational features. These additional operational features include, but are not necessarily limited to, heating the food item only until a target temperature is reached by an internal portion of the food item. Another operational feature that the invention may include is requiring a constant actuation of the on power button (and optionally the off power button) for a predetermined period of time in order to either turn the power on or off (and otherwise ignoring the power on or off command). Still another operational feature that the invention may include is shutting off the power to the heating elements after a predetermined maximum period of time (such as, for example, five hours). The invention may include an operational feature that requires that the user make certain selections from a user menu before power is supplied to the heating elements (and not automatically supplying power to the heating elements at power on). Further, an operational feature that the invention may include the ability to resume a previous, interrupted cooking process or program that is interrupted, for example, by a loss of power to the grilling appliance <b>10</b>, when the power is again supplied to the appliance or when the user initiates the resumption of power. In some implementations of this optional operational feature, the previous cooking process may not be resumed if a predetermined maximum period of time is exceeded (such as, for example, after 30 minutes or an hour). Also, when provided a desired time period for cooking the food item, the invention may heat the food item at a rate calculated to reach the desired or target temperature at the end of the time period. The invention may be suitably programmed to indicate the time for reaching the target temperature by the food item based upon the initial portion of the heating process and the heating rate observed in that initial heating of the food item. The invention may also be configured to sense if the food temperature probe is currently connected or disconnected. The invention may further include means for detecting a short circuit, and may be implemented through the detection of a non-zero potential between the housing and the neutral power lead.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In actuating the buttons of the control, a protocol may be established, such as for the &#x201c;power on&#x201d; and &#x201c;power off&#x201d; commands that requires the buttons to be actuated for a minimum amount of time for the command to be effective. For example, the user may be required to hold the &#x201c;on power&#x201d; button down for a minimum amount of time of 3 seconds for the command to be executed and the power actually supplied to the components of the control apparatus. Further, the &#x201c;on power&#x201d; command may not automatically cause power to be supplied to the heating apparatus <b>18</b>, but the user may be required to take certain additional steps to cause the heating apparatus to be supplied with power, such as negotiating through a menu.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Optionally, the temperature transducer sensors <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> may communicate with the power controlling circuitry through means other than wires, e.g., wirelessly. As a further option, a rotisserie (not shown) may also be employed in the appliance <b>10</b> of the invention, and a transparent window may be incorporated into the lid portion <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some more preferred embodiments of the invention, the size of the aperture <b>32</b> in the bottom wall <b>30</b> is greater than the size of the central hole <b>56</b> in the drip collection tray <b>54</b> to facilitate air flow through the aperture <b>32</b> and below the drip collection tray <b>54</b> and around the perimeter edge <b>62</b> of the drip collection tray <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">It should be recognized that the application of the control system is not limited to apparatus employing the chamber portion and lid portion, and may comprise a food monitoring device that includes the food temperature sensor that is configured to sense an internal temperature of a food item located in the heating chamber. The food monitoring device may include a user interface that is configured to receive designation of a desired internal temperature and/or time of completion of heating of the food item from the user. The user interface may be further configured to display the calculated time for the internal temperature at any given location in the food item to reach a predetermined temperature designated by the user. The food monitoring device may further include a control circuit being in communication with the food temperature sensor to receive a signal from the food temperature sensor representing the temperature of the food item. The control circuit, which is described in greater detail elsewhere herein, is in communication with the user interface to receive a signal from the user interface representing the desired internal temperature and/or time of completion of heating of the food item, and may cause the user interface to display certain information.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The user interface may be further configured to display additional information about the cooking process, such as, for example, the maximum temperature the food item has reached, the length of time since the food item finished cooking, and the length of time in which the food item was cooked.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments, the temperature probe may include two (or more) sensors, with a first sensor being located at the tip of the probe for sensing an internal temperature of the food item when the probe is inserted into the food item, and a second sensor at a location on the probe separated from the first sensor that is configured to sense an ambient temperature or the temperature of the air in the heating chamber. Both sensors may be in communication with the control circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The appliance may include a control system that permits adaptive cooking (by heating) or even cooling (if the appliance is suitably equipped) that heats or cools the food item at a rate that is suitable to bring the food item temperature to a suitable level at the end of a desired period, such as at a set time chosen by a user through, for example, a user interface. The control system may also permit ambient cooking that heats or cools the food item at a rate that is suitable to bring the food item temperature to a desired level at the end of a period, such as at a set time, based upon a current temperature of the food item.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The control system also supports predictive cooking (by heating) or even cooling (again if the appliance is suitably equipped) that is able to predict or provide an estimate of the time that it will take for the food item to reach the desired temperature based upon the current temperature of the air in the heating chamber, and display that temperature to the user through the display of the user interface.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">An exemplary process for calculating the heat-equation parameters used for predictive or adaptive cooking using the appliance is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref> of the drawings. Initially, the process may include recording temperature data of the food item which is being heated or cooled, as well as recording the time that the measurement is taken. The instantaneous ambient temperature of the chamber of the appliance may also be recorded. The thermostat temperature of the chamber may also be recorded.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The heat equation utilized describes or predicts the internal temperature of the food item based upon the time, relative position (location of the temperature sensor in the food item), and the heat properties of the food item. The internal temperature sensor records the internal temperature of the food item, but neither the relative position of the sensor in the food item nor the heat-transfer characteristics (heat properties) of the food item, are known. Therefore, both the sensor position and the heat-transfer characteristics of the food item must be computed to best fit the heat-equation curve to the actual data being measured, for example, by the heat sensor. To simplify calculations, both the relative sensor position (mathematically represented as x) and the heat properties of the food item (mathematically represented as k) can be combined with other unknown parameters, specifically the relative size of the food item (mathematically represented as L). These aggregate mathematical variables are henceforth represented as x&#x2032; and k&#x2032;, respectively. By using the aggregate x&#x2032; and k&#x2032; values for all calculations, knowledge of L becomes completely unnecessary.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">After recording the temperature and time measurements, the following procedure may optionally be utilized to provide initial x&#x2032; and k&#x2032; values to be used in the heat equation H(x&#x2032;,k&#x2032;,t). For each x&#x2032; ranging from near zero to 50%*pi, in increments of approximately 1% or 2%, k&#x2032; is calculated to minimize the squared-error (SE) of the heat-equation, H(x&#x2032;,k&#x2032;,t). Each corresponding x&#x2032;, k&#x2032; and SE value is recorded, as well as the 1st partial derivatives of the heat equation H(x&#x2032;,k&#x2032;,t) in x&#x2032; and k&#x2032;. The values of the local minimas (x&#x2032; and k&#x2032;) are outputted to use as initial values or starting points.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In cases where no initial values for x&#x2032; and k&#x2032; are available (such as from the procedure described above), initial x&#x2032; and k&#x2032; values may be calculated or chosen using one of the following methods techniques. In one optional technique, a simple exponential curve approximation is used to determine a reasonable k&#x2032; value. Then, a moderate x&#x2032; value may be chosen or, for the given k&#x2032;, a value for x&#x2032; may be determined that minimizes the SE of H(x&#x2032;,k&#x2032;,t). In another optional technique, typical x&#x2032; and k&#x2032; values are chosen based on &#x201c;average&#x201d; cooking data that has been stored in the memory for different food items. If the type of food item is known (e.g., input by the user via an interface), an &#x201c;average&#x201d; x&#x2032; and k&#x2032; value for that type of food item may be chosen.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">When initial sets of values for x&#x2032; and k&#x2032; are obtained, then, for each set of initial x&#x2032; and k&#x2032; values, the data is curve-fit by varying both x&#x2032; and k&#x2032; to minimize the SE of the difference between H(x&#x2032;,k&#x2032;,t) and the recorded data. Each corresponding x&#x2032;, k&#x2032;, and SE value is recorded. The x&#x2032; and k&#x2032; values that result in the lowest SE value are output. If the algorithm provides a suitable convergence of the time expected to be necessary to cook the food item, and the time set by the user as the desired end time, then the process may proceed. If there is no suitable convergence with the values being considered, such as when the expected time to cook the food item is unrealistically less than or unrealistically greater than the time set by the user as the desired end time, the control system may wait until another periodic temperature is measured and recorded, and the process is repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">When a suitable convergence is detected, the expected cooking time is computed using the given x&#x2032; and k&#x2032; values, as well as the desired (final) temperature of the food item. The result may be displayed on the display. Optionally, the computed accuracy of expected cooking time may also be displayed. As another option, the expected cooking time(s) for other food item(s) also present in the chamber (each with its own temperature sensor) may be calculated and displayed, as well as the temperature of the air in the interior of the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Optionally, if the accuracy of the calculation is sufficient, then the new temperature (T_new) may be computed that is required to complete the cooking of the food item at the time set by the user. The new temperature may be displayed. The heating apparatus may be periodically adjusted so that the chamber temperature is the new temperature (T_new).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">An illustrative algorithm to curve-fit the heat-equation is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> of the drawings. Using the starting values x&#x2032; and k&#x2032;, such as was described previously, Newton's Method is applied to both the k&#x2032; variable and the x&#x2032; variable or vector (in one or more dimensions) to generate new values for x&#x2032; and k&#x2032;. The change-vector may be recorded. If the new x&#x2032; and k&#x2032; values do not result in a smaller SE (Squared-Error) value, then the bisection method may be applied. The change-vector may be decreased, recorded, and added to the starting or initial x&#x2032; and k&#x2032; values. These steps may be repeated until the SE has a value that is smaller than the value that SE had to begin with. If the number of iterations performed becomes too great, then the algorithm may be stopped and an error flag may be indicated.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">If the new x&#x2032; and k&#x2032; values result in a smaller SE (Squared-Error) value, then the new values of x&#x2032; and k&#x2032; may be recorded in place of the earlier x&#x2032; and k&#x2032; values, and these new values become the new starting values. If the results are determined to be sufficiently accurate, the results are recorded and returned to the control system.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Optionally, an attempt may be made to accelerate convergence using any one or more of suitable methods. These methods may include, for example, Steffensen's method, Mueller's method, the Steepest Descent method, or any other suitable method known to one of ordinary skill in the art. The application of these methods may be employed to generate new values for x&#x2032; and k&#x2032;, and the change vector may be ignored. Again, if the new values for x&#x2032; and k&#x2032; give a smaller SE than the previous values for x&#x2032; and k&#x2032;, then the new x&#x2032; and k&#x2032; values are recorded in place of the original initial values and these values become the new initial values. (Note: x&#x2032; can be one-dimensional or a multi-dimensional vector, depending on the desired accuracy. For most applications, the simpler, one-dimensional x&#x2032; should suffice.)</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">By adjusting the mathematical equations (i.e., the mathematical model), the above algorithms can be generalized to work in other situations. Example situations are described below:</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">1) The ambient temperature is not known. Assuming the ambient temperature remains substantially constant and uniform over time, the ambient temperature can be solved for, along with x&#x2032; and k&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">2) The ambient temperature is not adjustable by the algorithm employed by the control system (such as, for example, when there is no feedback loop). The algorithm of the control system can rely on the user to adjust the ambient temperature. For example, the control system can display the recommended ambient temperature and/or display the time at which the heat must be removed to avoid overshoot (overcooking), or may provide an indication (e.g., beep) when heat should be removed by turning off the heating apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">3) Accuracy can be improved by using a 3-dimensional model of the heat equation instead of the simpler 1-dimensional version. This allows accurate predictions with any size or shape object (as long as the heat-transfer rate is fairly homogeneous).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">4) As meats cook, they lose (or possibly gain) moisture. The model can be adjusted to account for this and to calculate the amount of moisture loss/gain.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In various implementations of the invention, the basic heat equation (in one dimension) utilized is:</p>
