<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority under 35 U.S.C 119(a) to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2011-0131651, filed on Dec. 9, 2011, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety as set forth in full.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Example embodiments relate to a fuse circuit, and more particularly a fuse circuit configured to correct errors that occur when programming the fuse circuit and normally generate a fuse signal.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Integrated circuits typically include a fuse circuit which includes a fuse capable of being programmed to change an internal setting without changing a design. Electrical connection characteristics of the fuse used in the fuse circuit is changed when a laser beam or an electrical stress is applied to the fuse, and information regarding internal settings of the integrated circuit is programmed using such a change in the electrical connection state of the fuse.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Fuse programming methods are divided into a method of disconnecting the connection state of a fuse using a laser beam, and a method of changing the electrical connection state of a fuse by applying an electrical stress. Fuses programmed using electrical stress (an electrical way) are divided into an anti-type fuse in which electrical connection state is changed from an open state to a short state, and a blowing type fuse in which an electrical connection state is changed from a short state to an open state.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing a configuration of a conventional fuse circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the conventional fuse circuit includes a programming pulse generation unit <b>8</b> configured to receive a programming enable signal PGMEN and first to seventh addresses ADD&#x3c;1:7&#x3e; and generate first to eighth pulses P&#x3c;1:8&#x3e;, and a fuse unit <b>9</b> including first to eighth fuse sections <b>9</b>(1:8) configured to be programmed in response to the first to eighth pulses P&#x3c;1:8&#x3e; and generate first to eighth fuse signals FUSE&#x3c;1:8&#x3e;. The first to eighth fuse sections <b>9</b>(<b>1</b>:<b>8</b>) are realized as fuses which are programmed in an electrical way in response to the first to eighth pulses P&#x3c;1:8&#x3e;.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the fuse circuit configured in this way, the first to eighth fuse sections <b>9</b>(1:8) are programmed according to the programming enable signal PGMEN and the first to seventh addresses ADD&#x3c;1:7&#x3e; and generate the first to eighth fuse signals FUSE&#x3c;1:8&#x3e;. For example, assuming that the first to third addresses ADD&#x3c;1:3&#x3e; are inputted at a logic high level and the fourth to seventh addresses ADD&#x3c;4:7&#x3e; are inputted at a logic low level in a state in which the programming enable signal PGMEN is enabled to a logic high level, the programming pulse generation unit <b>8</b> generates the first to fourth pulses P&#x3c;1:4&#x3e; of a logic high level and the fifth to eighth pulses P&#x3c;5:8&#x3e; of a logic low level. The first to fourth fuse sections <b>9</b>(1:4) are changed in their electrical connection states according to the programming enable signal PGMEN of the logic high level and the first to third addresses ADD&#x3c;1:3&#x3e; of the logic high level and generate the first to fourth fuse signals FUSE&#x3c;1:4&#x3e; of a logic high level, and the fifth to eighth fuse sections <b>9</b>(5:8) generate the fifth to eighth fuse signals FUSE&#x3c;5:8&#x3e; of a logic low level.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, when a fail occurs, for example in the gate dielectric layer in the fifth fuse section <b>9</b>(<b>5</b>) included in the fuse unit <b>9</b>, the fifth fuse section <b>9</b>(<b>5</b>) erroneously generates the fifth fuse signal FUSE&#x3c;<b>5</b>&#x3e; at a logic high level instead of the logic low level. As a consequence, an error may occur in the operation of the integrated circuit.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">An embodiment of the present invention relates to a fuse circuit which can perform corrections even when an error occurs in a fuse and can generate a normally programmed fuse signal, thereby preventing the occurrence of an operation error in an integrated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment, a fuse circuit includes: a programming fuse signal generation block configured to generate parity signals, logic levels of which are determined according to addresses selected among a plurality of addresses with a programming enable signal enabled, and generate programming fuse signals which are programmed in response to the programming enable signal, the plurality of addresses and the parity signals; a corrected pulse generation block configured to correct an error included in the programming fuse signals and generate corrected pulses; and a fuse unit configured to generate fuse signals which are reprogrammed according to the corrected pulses.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another embodiment, a fuse circuit includes: a parity signal generation unit configured to generate parity signals in response to a programming enable signal and a plurality of addresses; a pulse generation unit configured to generate pulses in response to the programming enable signal, the plurality of addresses and the parity signals; a preliminary fuse unit including fuses of which electrical connection states are changed in response to the pulses, and configured to generate programming fuse signals; a corrected pulse generation block configured to correct an error included in the programming fuse signals and generate corrected pulses; and a fuse unit configured to generate fuse signals which are reprogrammed in response to the corrected pulses.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram showing a configuration of a fuse circuit in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the fuse circuit in accordance with an embodiment includes a programming fuse signal generation block <b>1</b>, a corrected pulse generation block <b>2</b>, and a fuse unit <b>3</b>.

The corrected pulse generation block <b>2</b> includes an information signal generation unit <b>21</b>, a correction signal generation unit <b>22</b> and a correction unit <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The parity signal generation unit <b>11</b> is configured to generate first to fourth parity signals PA&#x3c;1:4&#x3e; logic levels of which are determined by addresses selected among first to seventh addresses ADD&#x3c;1:7&#x3e; when a programming enable signal PGMEN is enabled to a logic high level.

A configuration and operation of the pulse generation unit <b>12</b> will be described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The preliminary fuse unit <b>13</b> includes first to twelfth preliminary fuse sections <b>13</b>(1:12) having fuses which are respectively changed in their electrical connection states when electrical stresses are inputted.
