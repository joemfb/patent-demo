<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">With reference now to the drawings, and in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</figref> thereof, a new clamping device embodying the principles and concepts of an embodiment of the disclosure and generally designated by the reference numeral <b>10</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</figref>, the alignment clamp assembly <b>10</b> generally comprises an upper jaw <b>12</b> which has a planar end portion <b>14</b>. A lower jaw <b>16</b> is pivotally coupled to the upper jaw <b>12</b>. The lower jaw <b>16</b> has a planar end surface <b>18</b>. The lower jaw <b>16</b> is pivotable to position the end portion <b>14</b> of the upper jaw <b>12</b> against the end surface <b>18</b> of the lower jaw <b>16</b>. A hole <b>20</b> extends into the upper jaw <b>12</b>, the hole has threading <b>22</b> that may be in an inset portion <b>24</b> of the hole <b>20</b>. A pin <b>26</b> is coupled to the upper jaw <b>12</b>. The pin <b>26</b> has a threaded connection portion <b>30</b> and a main portion <b>32</b>. The connection portion <b>30</b> of the pin <b>26</b> extends from the main portion <b>32</b> of the pin <b>26</b>. The connection portion <b>32</b> is positioned in and engages the hole <b>20</b> extending into the upper jaw <b>12</b>. The pin <b>26</b> is one of a plurality of interchangeable pins <b>26</b>, each having a main portion <b>32</b>. The main portion <b>32</b> of each pin <b>26</b> has a circular cross-section <b>34</b>. The outer diameter <b>36</b> of each main portion <b>32</b> varies from other the main portions <b>32</b> of the pins <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A cavity <b>28</b> is positioned in the lower jaw <b>16</b> opposite the pin <b>26</b> whereby the pin <b>26</b> extends into the cavity <b>28</b> when the end portion <b>14</b> of the upper jaw <b>12</b> is positioned against the end surface <b>18</b> of the lower jaw <b>16</b>. Thus, the pin <b>26</b> extends between the end portion <b>14</b> of the upper jaw <b>12</b> and the end surface <b>18</b> of the lower jaw <b>16</b> and may be used to align two pieces of material <b>42</b> clamped between the upper jaw <b>12</b> and the lower jaw <b>16</b> by insertion of the pin <b>26</b> through holes <b>40</b> in the materials <b>42</b>. Alternatively, the clamping assembly <b>10</b> may be effective reversing the coupling of the pin <b>26</b> to the lower jaw <b>16</b> and positioning the cavity <b>28</b> in the upper jaw <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A locking mechanism <b>44</b> may be operationally coupled to the upper jaw <b>12</b> and the lower jaw <b>16</b> whereby the end portion <b>14</b> of the upper jaw <b>12</b> is held in a static position relative to the end surface <b>18</b> of the lower jaw <b>16</b> by the locking mechanism <b>44</b>. The locking mechanism <b>44</b> includes a handle arm <b>46</b> and a bracing arm <b>48</b>. The handle arm <b>46</b> is pivotally coupled to the lower jaw <b>16</b>. The bracing arm <b>48</b> has a first end <b>50</b> pivotally coupled to the handle arm <b>46</b> and a second end <b>52</b> pivotally coupled to the upper jaw <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">An adjustment mechanism <b>54</b> is coupled to the upper jaw <b>12</b> and the second end <b>52</b> of the bracing arm <b>48</b>. The adjustment mechanism <b>54</b> adjusts a position of the second end <b>52</b> of the bracing arm <b>48</b> along a length of a handle portion <b>56</b> the upper jaw <b>12</b>. The adjustment mechanism <b>54</b> adjusts spacing between the end portion <b>14</b> of the upper jaw <b>12</b> and the end surface <b>18</b> of the lower jaw <b>16</b> when the upper jaw <b>12</b> is fully pivoted towards the lower jaw <b>16</b>. The spacing is selectable by adjustment of the adjustment mechanism <b>54</b> as in conventional vice grip pliers.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A biasing member <b>58</b> has a first end <b>60</b> coupled to the lower jaw <b>16</b> and a second end <b>62</b> coupled to the upper jaw <b>12</b> along the handle portion <b>56</b>. The biasing member <b>58</b> urges the end portion <b>14</b> of the upper jaw <b>12</b> away from the end surface <b>18</b> of the lower jaw <b>16</b> when the locking mechanism <b>44</b> is disengaged.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In use, the assembly <b>10</b> clamps and holds materials <b>42</b> together and in alignment by insertion of the pin <b>26</b> through the holes <b>40</b> in the materials <b>42</b>. The materials <b>42</b> may be flanged ductwork, framed ductwork, or sheet metal. The proper pin <b>26</b> is selected depending on the hole size of the materials <b>42</b>. The materials <b>42</b> are then aligned and clamped together. The materials <b>42</b> may then be otherwise coupled to each other as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of an embodiment enabled by the disclosure, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by an embodiment of the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the disclosure. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the disclosure to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the disclosure.</p>
