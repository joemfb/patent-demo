<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a semiconductor memory device. The present invention particularly relates to a method of manufacturing a non-volatile semiconductor memory element having a limit on the number of times of rewriting information and a volatile semiconductor memory element such as DRAM having no upper limit on the number of times of rewriting information with high integration on the same semiconductor substrate and at low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, resistance RAM (RRAM) having a variable resistance memory element as memory that is used in information equipment such as computers and mobile telephones and the like has been receiving attention. A variable resistance memory element is a memory element that is basically constituted by a thin film resistor such as a binary metal oxide, a transition metal oxide, an aluminum oxide, a silicon oxide or germanium oxide being sandwiched between two electrodes, and makes use of the phenomenon in which the resistance of the thin film resistor changes by impressing an electrical field or flowing an electrical current across the electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Since the resistance value of the thin-film resistor is stored even when the impression of the electrical field or current is removed, it is possible to realize non-volatile memory. The information that is stored in the variable resistance memory element can be read out by comparing the resistance value with a reference value. This kind of memory element is generally called RRAM as mentioned above. It is possible to constitute a variable resistance memory element in an array such as DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) by combining with a selection transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> shows a non-volatile semiconductor memory element disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication, No. 2004-342843 as an example of a variable resistance memory element that can readily store and read out information, and can be readily manufactured with a comparatively easy manufacturing method. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> shows a non-volatile semiconductor memory element disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication, No. 2006-173267 as an example of another example of a variable resistance memory element that can stably perform operations such as recording information with a constitution that is stable even with respect to heat.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The non-volatile semiconductor memory element shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> has a substrate <b>401</b>, a lower electrode <b>402</b>, an insulation film <b>403</b>, an amorphous thin film <b>404</b>, an upper electrode <b>405</b>, an electrode layer <b>406</b>, and a conduction layer <b>407</b>. Also, non-volatile semiconductor memory element shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> has a substrate <b>501</b>, a lower electrode <b>502</b>, an ion source layer <b>503</b>, a memory layer <b>504</b>, an insulating layer <b>505</b> denoted by reference numeral <b>505</b>, and an upper electrode <b>506</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The conventional memory elements shown above utilize the oxidation-reduction action of metal, such as silver, copper, or zinc. Specifically, when an electrical field is impressed on a thin-film resistor (the amorphous thin film <b>404</b> and the memory layer <b>504</b>) consisting of a transition metal oxide, an aluminum oxide, a silicon oxide or germanium oxide sandwiched between two electrodes (the upper electrodes <b>405</b> and <b>506</b> and the lower electrodes <b>402</b> and <b>502</b>), the aforementioned metal that exists in one electrode is oxidized (ionized), moves through the thin-film electrode to be reduced and deposited at the other electrode, whereby the resistance value of the thin-film electrode falls. Also, when an electrical field is impressed in the reverse direction, the deposited metal is once again ionized and returns to the original electrode, and so the resistance value of the thin-film electrode rises. Thereafter, even if the electrical field between the electrodes is removed, the resistance value of the thin-film resistor is maintained, and information is stored in a non-volatile manner using this phenomenon. In addition, these memory elements are capable of reading and writing at high speeds on par with DRAM, and so their use as non-volatile RAM has been expected.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, it is has been reported that the abovementioned memory elements have a limit to the number of changes of the resistance value of the thin-film resistor, that is, the number of times of rewriting information. Accordingly, the abovementioned memory element is not suitable for uses in which information is frequently rewritten as work memory, such as DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) Therefore, there is a problem that it cannot be used as non-volatile RAM for realizing computer systems, mobile phones, information appliance products, etc. with an instant-on function.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">On the other hand, while DRAM is suited to uses such as information being frequently rewritten as work memory, due to its being volatile memory, it has the characteristic of the information being lost when the power is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In this way, since RRAM and DRAM have a relationship of complementing each other, it has been desired for them to be used in combination. Therefore, if it were possible to form these two types of memory elements with the same manufacturing process and on the same chip, it would be possible to provide a memory system that is easy to use at a low cost, and so its realization has been sought.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention has been achieved in view of the above circumstances, and has as its object to provide a method of manufacturing a non-volatile semiconductor memory having a limit on the number of times of rewriting information and a volatile semiconductor memory element such as DRAM having no upper limit on the number of times of rewriting information with high integration on the same semiconductor substrate and at low cost.</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Hereinbelow, a method of manufacturing a semiconductor memory device of the present invention shall be described with reference to the drawings. Note that the drawings referred to in the description below are for describing a method of manufacturing a semiconductor memory device of the present embodiments, and size, thickness and dimensions of each portion illustrated may differ from the dimensional relationship of each portion in the actual semiconductor device and the manufacturing method thereof.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">[First Embodiment]</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">First, a semiconductor memory device and the manufacturing method thereof of a first embodiment shall be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. FIG <b>1</b>A and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> are circuit diagrams that show the circuit composition of the semiconductor memory device of this embodiment, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> are partial sectional drawings showing the main portions of the semiconductor memory device of the present embodiment. Also, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> are process drawings for describing the method of manufacturing the semiconductor memory device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">(Semiconductor Memory Device)</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is an equivalent circuit drawing of a group of non-volatile semiconductor memory elements, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is an equivalent circuit drawing of a group of volatile semiconductor memory elements that are provided in the semiconductor memory device of the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the group of non-volatile semiconductor memory elements is basically constituted from n&#xd7;m non-volatile semiconductor memory elements MCN<b>11</b> to MCNnm, n word lines WL<b>11</b> to WL<b>1</b><i>n</i>, m bit lines BL<b>11</b> to BL<b>1</b><i>m</i>, and m common plate lines PL<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The non-volatile semiconductor memory elements MCN<b>11</b> to MCNnm are basically constituted from a selection transistor QM<b>1</b> and a variable resistance element RM that is connected to the selection transistor QM<b>1</b>. Then, for example in the semiconductor memory element MCN<b>11</b>, the gate electrode of the section transistor QM<b>1</b> is connected to the world line WL<b>11</b>, and the source electrode is connected to the bit line BL<b>11</b>, and the drain electrode is connected to one electrode (first electrode) of the variable resistance element RM. Also, the other electrode (second electrode) of the variable resistance element RM is connected to the common plate line PL<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The variable resistance element RM is an element whose resistance value changes depending on the direction of electrical current therethrough, and even in the state of a current not being impressed, that resistance value is maintained. Therefore, it is possible to make it operate as a non-volatile memory element by reading out this resistance value.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">On the other hand, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the volatile semiconductor memory element group is so-called DRAM, so it is basically constituted from n&#xd7;m volatile semiconductor memory elements MCD<b>11</b> to MCDnm, n word lines WL<b>21</b> to WL<b>2</b><i>n</i>, m bit lines BL<b>21</b> to BL<b>2</b><i>m</i>, and m common plate lines PL<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The volatile semiconductor memory elements MCD<b>11</b> to MCDnm are basically constituted from a selection transistor QM<b>2</b> (a separate selection transistor) and a capacitance element CM that is connected to the selection transistor QM<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">For example, in the semiconductor memory element MCD<b>11</b>, the gate electrode of the selection transistor QM<b>2</b> is connected to the word line WL<b>21</b>, the source electrode is connected to the bit line BL<b>21</b>, and the drain electrode is connected to one electrode (the third electrode) of the capacitance element CM. Also, the other electrode (the fourth electrode) of the capacitance element CM is connected to the common plate line PL<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The capacitance element CM is an element that is capable of retaining any electric charge, and so it is possible to make it operate as a volatile memory element by reading out the existence of an electrical charge.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Next, specific structures of the respective memory elements shall be described using the semiconductor memory element MCN<b>1</b><i>m </i>and the semiconductor memory element MCD<b>1</b><i>m </i>as examples and referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows a sectional frame format of the non-volatile semiconductor memory element MCN<b>1</b><i>m</i>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a sectional schematic view of the volatile semiconductor memory element MCD<b>1</b><i>m. </i></p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, gate electrodes <b>3</b> that consist of polysilicon or the like are formed on a semiconductor substrate <b>1</b> that consists of, for example, single crystal silicon via a gate insulating film <b>2</b> that consists of silicon oxide. The gate electrodes <b>3</b> are formed by extending a portion of the word lines WL<b>11</b> to WL<b>1</b><i>n</i>. A sidewall <b>4</b> consisting of silicon nitride or the like is formed on both sides of each gate electrode <b>3</b>. A source region S and a drain region D in which an impurity element is diffused are formed in the semiconductor substrate <b>1</b> to be positioned on both sides of each gate electrode <b>3</b>. The source region S is connected to the bit line BL<b>1</b><i>m </i>through a bit line contact plug <b>5</b>, and, on the other hand, the drain region D is connected to the variable resistance element RM via a resistance contact plug <b>6</b>. The bit line contact plug <b>5</b> and the resistance contact plug <b>6</b> are for example made of a metal, such as tungsten. In this way, the section transistor QM<b>1</b> is constituted.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Moreover, a first interlayer insulation film <b>11</b> that consists of silicon oxide or the like is formed on the semiconductor substrate <b>1</b>, so that the gate electrode <b>3</b> is covered with the first interlayer insulation film <b>11</b>. Also, the bit line BL consisting of Al, Cu or the like is formed on the first interlayer insulating film <b>11</b>. And the bit line contact plug <b>5</b> that connects the bit line BL<b>1</b><i>m </i>and the source region S is formed so as to penetrate the first interlayer insulating film <b>11</b>. Furthermore, a second interlayer insulating film <b>12</b> is laminated on the first interlayer insulating film <b>11</b> and the bit line BL<b>1</b><i>m. </i></p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Next, the variable resistance element RM is constituted by a first electrode <b>21</b> that is connected to the selection transistor QM<b>1</b> via a resistance contact plug <b>6</b>, a variable resistance layer <b>22</b> that connects to the first electrode <b>21</b>, and a second electrode <b>23</b> that connects to the variable resistance layer <b>22</b> that are laminated one by one. The first electrode <b>21</b> is formed on the second interlayer insulation film <b>12</b>, and the resistance contact plug <b>6</b> is connected to this first electrode <b>21</b>. The resistance contact plug <b>6</b> penetrates the first interlayer insulating film <b>11</b> and the second interlayer insulating film <b>12</b> to be connected to the drain region D. Thus, the drain region D of selection transistor QM<b>1</b> is connected to the first electrode <b>21</b>. Moreover, the third interlayer insulation film <b>13</b> is laminated on the second interlayer insulating film <b>12</b>, and so the upper surface of the first electrode and the upper surface of the third interlayer insulation film <b>13</b> form a continuous flat surface. Then, a variable resistance layer <b>22</b> and a second electrode <b>23</b> are laminated on this flat surface. Furthermore, a fourth interlayer insulating film <b>14</b> that consists of silicon oxide or the like, a wiring layer <b>31</b>, and a fifth interlayer insulating film <b>15</b> are laminated one by one on the second electrode <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The first electrode <b>21</b> is formed with silver, copper, zinc, or the like, and is preferably formed with copper.

Specifically, for example after protecting the third electrode <b>41</b> by laminating a mask layer M<b>4</b> on the formation region of the third electrode <b>41</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>, the first electrode dummy electrode <b>321</b>A is selectively etched by a means such as wet etching as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>, and the etching process is continued until for example the first electrode dummy electrode <b>321</b>A becomes a thickness of half. Thus, the lower electrode <b>32</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref>, a metal film <b>321</b>B which consists for example of a metal film such as silver, copper, zinc and the like is formed so that to cover the lower electrode <b>320</b> and the third interlayer insulating film <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref>, by performing a CMP process on the metal film <b>321</b>B, it is flattened until the upper surface of the third interlayer insulating film <b>13</b> is exposed. Thereby, a state arises of the remainder of the metal film <b>321</b>B being exposed at the upper surface of the third interlayer insulating film <b>13</b>. Thus, the first electrode <b>321</b> consisting of a metal film such as silver, copper, zinc and the like is formed. Thereafter, the mask M<b>3</b> that had protected the third electrode <b>41</b> is removed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref>, a compound layer consisting of a transition metal oxide or the like is laminated on the first electrode <b>321</b> and the third electrode <b>41</b>. The compound layer laminated on the first electrode <b>321</b> becomes the variable resistance layer <b>22</b>, and the compound layer laminated on the third electrode <b>41</b> becomes the dielectric layer <b>42</b>. Thus, the variable resistance layer <b>22</b> and the dielectric layer <b>42</b> are formed simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref>, for example a tungsten film is formed on the variable resistance layer <b>22</b> and the dielectric layer <b>42</b> by the sputtering method, and by patterning the tungsten film with photolithography, the second electrode <b>323</b> and the fourth electrode <b>43</b> are formed simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">Thus, the variable resistance element RM and the capacitance element CM are formed simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Finally, by laminating the fourth interlayer insulation film <b>14</b>, a wiring layer <b>31</b>, and a fifth interlayer insulation film <b>15</b> one by one, the semiconductor memory device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref> is manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">The manufacturing method for the above-mentioned semiconductor memory device is a method of forming the first electrode dummy electrode <b>321</b>A simultaneously with the third electrode <b>41</b> and with the same material, and forming the first electrode <b>321</b> with a material that differs from the third electrode <b>41</b> after removing a portion of the first electrode dummy electrode <b>321</b>A to make the lower electrode <b>320</b>. Just by adding the series of steps of formation of the first electrode dummy electrode <b>321</b>A, removal of a portion thereof, and formation of the first electrode <b>321</b>, it is possible to readily and with a high integration form the non-volatile semiconductor memory elements MCN<b>11</b> to MCNnm and the volatile semiconductor memory elements MCD<b>11</b> to MCDnm on the same semiconductor substrate <b>1</b>.</p>
