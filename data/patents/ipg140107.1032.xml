<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Containers and components thereof for use in the medical industry and methods to manufacture the same are described. An example tab for use with a medical container includes opposing sheets sealed to define an open ended chamber into which a port is to be at least partially positioned. The port is to enable access to the medical container. The tab includes a tear seal defined by each of the opposing sheets and a first guide positioned on a first side of each of the tear seals. The tab includes a second guide positioned on a second side of each of the tear seals, wherein the first and second guides are to enable a tear to propagate substantially between the guides and adjacent the tear seals.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Certain examples are shown in the above-identified figures and described in detail below. In describing these examples, like or identical reference numbers are used to identify the same or similar elements. The figures are not necessarily to scale and certain features and certain views of the figures may be shown exaggerated in scale or in schematic for clarity and/or conciseness. Additionally, several examples have been described throughout this specification. Any features from any example may be included with, a replacement for, or otherwise combined with other features from other examples.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The examples described herein relate to containers that may be used as medical solution or storage containers, blood pack units or in other transfer pack applications, for example. In some examples, the example containers described herein define a plurality of openings from which a membrane port or a frangible assembly may extend and a plurality of apertures from which the container may be suspended. Providing the example containers described herein with the plurality of apertures, enables the containers described herein to be suspended at different angles relative to the floor, thereby decreasing the likelihood that particulate or clots will disrupt and/or affect fluid flow to and from the container.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The frangible assemblies described herein may include a frangible housing, a frangible positioned in the frangible housing and a bushing to be engaged by a portion of the frangible once separated. In some examples, the frangible housing may have a substantially consistent inner diameter to enable a length of the frangible housing and/or an area provided within the frangible housing to be relatively easily tailored to a particular application.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">To maintain the sterility of the membrane ports, a tab having a tear seal may encase a portion of the membrane port that extends from the container. To access the membrane port positioned in the example tabs described herein, a person may grasp the first grip tab with one hand and the second grip tab with the other hand and then move the tabs in opposite directions, thereby initiating a tear proximate the tear initiation area. Once the tear has been initiated, the person may continue to move the tabs in opposite directions to propagate the tear along, for example, the tear seal and/or between guides positioned on either side of the tear seal. Such an approach enables relatively easy access to the membrane port with a reduced opening force and provides a relatively reliable tear seal as compared to the prior art. Additionally, such tabs may be functional over a broad temperature range such as, for example, between about one degree Celsius and forty degrees Celsius. While the examples described herein describe example tabs including the example tear seals, the example tear seals described herein may be advantageously formed on other structures. For example, the tear seals may be formed on a container bag panel, etc. The example tabs including tear seals may be used with containers in the medical industry such as, for example, medical solution or storage containers, blood pack units or other transfer pack applications. In some examples, the tabs include sheets of material coupled together along some edges to form an open ended chamber into which, for example, a membrane port may be positioned. Additionally, the tabs described herein may include a first grip tab and a second grip tab between which a tear initiation area or point may be positioned. In some examples, the example tabs described herein may be coupled between sheets of a medical container. Alternatively, in some examples, the example tabs described herein may be an integral extension of and/or integrally coupled to the respective sheets of the medical container.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The examples described herein relate to methods and apparatus to enable typically non-solvent bondable materials (e.g., polypropylene, a low molecular weight polypropylene, a high melt flow polypropylene, polyethylene, polymethylpentene) to be solvent bonded to, for example, polyvinyl chloride. As used herein solvent bonding refers to solvent sealed bonding of two dissimilar materials by solvation of one or more materials, thereby enabling the formation of an adhesive bond between the two dissimilar materials. Such an approach of enabling non-solvent bondable materials to be solvent bondable enables ports used with medical apparatus to be made of a material(s) that is substantially less expensive as well as less dense as compared to materials that are currently being used such as, for example, polycarbonate. Additionally, enabling ports or other apparatus to be made of, for example, polypropylene, enables the examples described herein to be relatively more resistant to environmental stress cracking while still being able to be sterilized by different methods such as, for example, radiation sterilization, steam sterilization, ethylene oxide sterilization, etc. Further, enabling ports or other apparatus to be made of, for example, polypropylene, enables non-treated or uncoated portions of the examples described herein to substantially not bond (e.g., thermally bond) to, for example, polyvinyl chloride, during autoclaving.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts an example container <b>100</b> having a compartment <b>102</b> for storage of a substance(s) and/or solution(s). In some examples, the container <b>100</b> may be used as a medical solution or storage container, a blood pack unit or for some other transfer pack application. A width <b>103</b> of the container <b>100</b> may be relatively wide as compared to some known containers (not shown). Increasing the width <b>103</b> of the container <b>100</b> may enable the container <b>100</b> to be more fully supported within a centrifugation cup (not shown) in which the container <b>100</b> may be positioned. The container <b>100</b> may be formed using a first sheet <b>104</b> and a second sheet <b>106</b> opposite the first sheet <b>104</b>. The sheets <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> may be relatively flexible and may be made of any suitable material such as, for example, a Polyvinyl chloride material, a non-Polyvinyl chloride, an olefin material, a poly-olefin material and/or a bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate material free material. To contain and prevent the leakage of the substance(s) and/or solution(s) stored within the compartment <b>102</b>, the sheets <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> may be sealed (e.g., heat sealed, adhesive bonding, etc.) along a peripheral edge <b>108</b> to form a substantially permanent seal between the sheets <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>. The compartment <b>102</b> may be any suitable size depending on the particular application and, in some instances, may be between about 150 ml and 2000 ml.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">To enable access to the compartment <b>102</b>, as shown most clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the container <b>100</b> is provided with a first opening or aperture <b>110</b>, a second opening or aperture <b>112</b>, a third opening or aperture <b>114</b> and a fourth opening or aperture <b>116</b>; however, any number of apertures (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.) may be provided instead. In this example, a first membrane port or tube <b>118</b> is positioned within the first opening <b>110</b> and, to maintain the sterility of the first membrane port <b>118</b> during handling, a portion of the first membrane port <b>118</b> extending from the peripheral edge <b>108</b> is positioned in a chamber <b>120</b> defined by an example first tab <b>122</b>. In some examples, the first tab <b>122</b> may be positioned between the sheets <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>. Alternatively, in some examples, the first tab <b>122</b> may be formed from and/or an integral extension of the sheets <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>. When a person wants to access the first membrane port <b>118</b>, the first tab <b>122</b> may be torn along a tear seal <b>124</b> by moving grip tabs <b>126</b> and <b>128</b> in opposite directions, thereby propagating the tear along the tear seal <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Similarly, a second membrane port or tube <b>130</b> is positioned within the second opening <b>112</b> and, to maintain the sterility of the second membrane port <b>130</b> during handling, a portion of the second membrane port <b>130</b> extending from the peripheral edge <b>108</b> is positioned within a chamber <b>132</b> of an example second tab <b>134</b>. When a person wants to access the second membrane port <b>130</b>, the second tab <b>134</b> may be torn along a tear seal <b>136</b> by moving grip tabs <b>138</b> and <b>140</b> in opposite directions, thereby propagating the tear along the tear seal <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">To prevent fluid flow through the third opening <b>114</b>, a frangible assembly <b>142</b> is partially positioned in and extends from the third opening <b>114</b>. The frangible assembly <b>142</b> includes a frangible <b>144</b> positioned within a frangible housing <b>146</b> and has an outer surface <b>148</b> that is coupled to an inner surface <b>150</b> of the frangible housing <b>146</b> to prevent fluid flow between the surfaces <b>148</b> and <b>150</b>. The frangible <b>144</b> may be broken along a frangible joint <b>152</b> to separate a port <b>154</b> of the frangible <b>144</b> from an elongated member <b>156</b> of the frangible <b>144</b>. Once the frangible <b>144</b> is separated, the elongated member <b>156</b> may move away from the port <b>154</b>, thereby enabling fluid flow through the frangible assembly <b>142</b>. The fourth opening <b>116</b> is provided with a third membrane tube or port <b>158</b> and, in this example, is not provided with one of the example tabs; however, a tab similar to the first tab <b>122</b> or the second tab <b>134</b> may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Opposite the openings <b>110</b>-<b>116</b>, and most clearly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the peripheral edge <b>108</b> defines a first aperture <b>160</b>, a second aperture <b>162</b> and a third aperture <b>164</b> each of which may be utilized to suspend or hang the container <b>100</b> at different angles relative to a floor (not shown) and/or to store a tube segment(s) or a donor sample tube(s), for example. The apertures <b>160</b>-<b>164</b> may be generally positioned in the middle of the peripheral edge <b>108</b> to decrease the likelihood that an unwanted tear will develop adjacent the aperture <b>160</b>-<b>164</b> from which the container <b>100</b> is suspended. If a tear would develop adjacent the aperture <b>160</b>-<b>164</b> from which the container <b>100</b> is suspended, the tear may result in the container <b>100</b> falling to the floor, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Additionally or alternatively, to further decrease the likelihood that an unwanted tear will develop adjacent the apertures <b>160</b>-<b>164</b> from which the container <b>100</b> is suspended, each of the apertures <b>160</b>-<b>164</b> includes radii or curved portions <b>166</b>-<b>176</b>. These curved portions <b>166</b>-<b>176</b> substantially decrease stress points on ends <b>178</b>-<b>188</b> of the apertures <b>160</b>-<b>164</b> adjacent the curved portions <b>166</b>-<b>176</b>, which may otherwise be caused by the weight of the container <b>100</b> and any other apparatus (not shown) supported by the container <b>100</b>. The apertures <b>160</b>-<b>164</b> may be similarly or differently sized and may, in some examples, have a length of between about &#xbc; inch to 1.0 inch.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In practice, if the container <b>100</b> is suspended from the first aperture <b>160</b>, an axis <b>190</b> of the container <b>100</b> may be substantially perpendicular to the floor. Thus, if particulate and/or solids form within the substance(s) and/or solution(s) contained within the compartment <b>102</b>, the particulate(s) and/or solid(s) may accumulate toward a corner <b>192</b> of the compartment <b>102</b> instead of flowing toward and impacting and/or obstructing fluid flow through one of the openings <b>110</b>-<b>116</b>. If the substance or solution is blood, these particulate and/or solids may form in the blood if anti-coagulant is added to the blood and is not sufficiently mixed. Similarly, if the container <b>100</b> is suspended from the third aperture <b>164</b>, an axis <b>194</b> of the container <b>100</b> may be substantially perpendicular to the floor, thereby enabling the particulate(s) and/or solid(s) to accumulate toward a corner <b>196</b> of the compartment <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts a container <b>400</b> coupled to an example tab <b>402</b> via, for example, radio frequency (RF) sealing or any other suitable method. The container <b>400</b> and/or the example tab <b>402</b> may be used to implement at least a portion of any of the examples described herein. The example tab <b>402</b> may include an opening <b>404</b> positioned within the container <b>400</b> and a perimeter seal <b>406</b> (e.g., a hermetic seal) that surrounds a chamber <b>408</b> of the tab <b>402</b> into which a membrane port or tube <b>410</b> is positioned. Generally, the perimeter seal <b>406</b> prevents contaminants from coming into contact with the membrane port <b>410</b>. Additionally, the example tab <b>402</b> includes a first grip tab <b>412</b> opposite a second grip tab <b>414</b> that each include a plurality of projections <b>416</b> produced via, for example, an RF sealing process. The plurality of projections <b>416</b> may further enable a person to grip the respective first and/or second grip tabs <b>412</b> and/or <b>414</b>. Additionally, the location of the projections <b>416</b> and/or the grip tabs <b>412</b> and <b>414</b> relative to the example tab <b>402</b> may indicate to a person the proper and/or intended usage of the tab <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A notch <b>418</b> is positioned between the grip tabs <b>412</b> and <b>414</b> to focus a force (e.g., a shear force), applied by a person, as discussed below, to a tear initiation area or point <b>420</b>. The notch <b>418</b> is positioned adjacent to the tear initiation area <b>420</b>. Additionally, the example tab <b>402</b> may include a tear seal <b>422</b> (e.g., a hermetic seal) having a lateral portion <b>424</b> and first and second tapered portions <b>426</b> and <b>428</b> positioned between a plurality of guides, reinforcing features, ribs or extrusions <b>430</b>. The lateral portion <b>424</b> may have a first end proximate the tear initiation area <b>420</b> and a second end proximate the first and second tapered portions <b>426</b> and <b>428</b>. In some examples, one or more of the plurality of guides <b>430</b> may have a height of approximately 0.016 inches, which may prevent the tear from wondering from between the plurality of guides <b>430</b> as the tab <b>402</b> is separated, as discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In operation, a person may grasp the first grip tab <b>412</b> with one hand and the second grip tab <b>414</b> with the other hand and then apply a first force in a first direction to the first grip tab <b>412</b> and a second force in a second direction, opposite the first direction, to the second grip tab <b>414</b>, such that a shear movement initiates a tear (not shown) adjacent or proximate the tear initiation area <b>420</b>. Once the tear is initiated, the person may continue to apply the first force in the first direction to the first grip tab <b>412</b> and the second force in the second direction to the second grip tab <b>414</b>, thereby propagating the tear along, for example, the lateral portion <b>424</b> of the tear seal <b>422</b> and/or between the guides <b>430</b> and toward the first and second tapered portions <b>426</b> and <b>428</b>. As the tear reaches a junction <b>432</b> between the portions <b>424</b>, <b>426</b> and/or <b>428</b>, the tear may split such that a tear follows the first tapered portion <b>426</b> and another tear follows the second tapered portion <b>428</b> or the tear follows one of the first tapered portion <b>426</b> or the second tapered portion <b>428</b>. Enabling the tear to follow the first tapered portion <b>426</b> and/or the second tapered portion <b>428</b> further separates a first portion <b>434</b> and a second portion <b>436</b> of the example tab <b>402</b>, thereby enabling the membrane port <b>410</b> to be more easily accessed and/or substantially prevents the portions <b>434</b> and <b>436</b> from again coming together once separated. Additionally or alternatively, the ease of use may be enhanced because the first and second portions <b>434</b> and <b>436</b> remain attached to the tab <b>402</b> and, thus, a separated component is not created to be handled while or prior to attempting to access the membrane port <b>410</b>.</p>

Additionally or alternatively, if the frangible <b>2100</b> is made of a polypropylene material, the frangible <b>2100</b> may be treated to substantially prevent the formation of a living hinge that may have a tendency to form when breaking the frangible <b>2100</b> along the frangible joint <b>2006</b>. In some examples, the treatment may include exposing the frangible <b>2100</b> to gamma irradiation, ultraviolet light, electron beam, etc., or adding an additive to the polypropylene such as, for example, polyethylene, polyester elastomer, styrene, ethylene vinyl acetate, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some examples, the first portion <b>2104</b> may be a polypropylene material and the second portion <b>2106</b> may be a Hytrel&#xae; material, the material(s) described in U.S. Pat.

In examples in which the first and second portions <b>2104</b> and <b>2106</b> are made of different materials, the port <b>2102</b> may be made using a molding process (e.g., an over molding process or a multi-component molding process) that may include two-steps in which the first material is allowed to at least partially cool prior to the second material being injected, for example.</p>

However, the second portion <b>2106</b> may have been altered by exposure to a chemical (e.g., a strong acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid) while the first portion <b>2104</b> may have not been exposed to the chemical. Generally, exposing the second portion <b>2106</b> to the chemical causes reactions on the surface <b>2108</b> of the second portion <b>2106</b>, thereby enabling the second portion <b>2106</b> to be solvent bondable to polyvinyl chloride even though the port <b>2102</b> is made of the polypropylene material.</p>

The plasma surface treatment may include exposing the second portion <b>2106</b> to ionized gasses, which causes reactions on the surface <b>2108</b> of the second portion <b>2106</b>. In other examples, the plasma surface treatment may include exposing the second portion <b>2106</b> to ionized air that at least partially oxidizes the surface <b>2108</b> and causes the surface <b>2108</b> to become more hydrophilic and, thus, compatible (e.g., solvent bondable) with polyvinyl chloride.

These hydroxyl groups or other functional groups may be reactable with other materials (e.g., coupling agents, silanes, titanates, UV adhesives) to further modify the surface <b>2108</b>, enabling the second portion <b>2106</b> to be solvent bondable to polyvinyl chloride. The coupling agents may have organic groups that are compatible with polyvinyl chloride. In examples in which the coupling agent is a UV adhesive, exposing the coupling agent to ultraviolet light may crosslink a UV bond between the polypropylene material and the adjacent polyvinyl chloride material.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some examples, the first portion <b>2104</b> may be a polypropylene material and the second portion <b>2106</b> may be an additive (e.g., waxes, copolyester, acrylic, styrene, styrene copolymers, ethylene vinyl acetate, etc.) added to the polypropylene material which, during processing, moves toward (e.g., blooms to) the surface <b>2108</b> and, thus, modifies the surface <b>2108</b>. The additive enables the polypropylene to be solvent bondable to polyvinyl chloride. Additionally, the additive may have a relatively low molecular weight, thereby enabling migration of the additive in relatively high shear conditions.</p>

The polypropylene may be any suitable type of polypropylene such as, for example, a normal molecular weight polypropylene or a relatively low molecular weight polypropylene. In examples in which the polypropylene has a relatively low molecular weight, the part may be formed using a material width melt flow rate of greater than 10 g/min (American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D1238, condition L) and a notched Izod of less than 0.5 (ASTM D256A). In practice, the lower molecular weight polypropylene may decrease the likelihood that a living hinge will form when breaking, for example, the frangible.

When the tube <b>3500</b> is at an expansion temperature, the tube <b>3500</b> will expand impressing itself into the spikes <b>3404</b> of the frangible <b>3400</b>.
