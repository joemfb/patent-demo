<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a national stage filing under section 371 of International Application No. PCT/FR2009/050456, filed on Mar. 18, 2009, and published in French on Jun. 3, 2010, as WO 2010/061082 and claims priority of French application No. 0858037 filed on Nov. 27, 2008, the entire disclosure of these applications being hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to an improved process for preparing cationic or amphoteric acrylamide (co)polymers. More specifically, the invention relates to preparing cationic or amphoteric acrylamide (co)polymers by a degradation reaction called a Hofmann degradation in aqueous solution on a base (co)polymer and is characterized in that the reaction medium contains a high proportion of polyvalent cationic ions before reagents, i.e. hypohalide and hydroxide, are added.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The examples of cationic acrylamide polymers known in the prior art are of various kinds: most often they are copolymers based upon acrylamide and cationic monomers, which can also be polymers called Mannich polymers (the acrylamide polymer reacts with formaldehyde and a secondary amine then is quaternized), glyoxal polymers or acrylamide polymers on which a Hofmann degradation has been done.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Among all these polymers, only those obtained by a Hofmann degradation reaction have specific properties not shared in terms of cationic charge density.</p>
<p id="h-0003" num="0000">Hofmann Degradation</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This reaction, discovered by Hofmann at the end of the nineteenth century, can change an amide function into a primary amine function with elimination of a carbon atom. The reaction mechanism is given below.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the presence of a base (e.g.: NaOH), a proton is removed from the amide.</p>

The amidate ion formed then reacts with the active chlorine (Cl<sub>2</sub>) in hypochlorite (e.g.: NaClO, which is in equilibrium: 2NaOH+Cl<sub>2</sub><img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00001" he="1.78mm" wi="4.57mm" file="US08623966-20140107-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>NaOCl+NaCl+H<sub>2</sub>O) to give an N-chloramide. The base (NaOH) removes a proton from the chloramide to form an anion. The anion loses a chloride ion to form a nitrene, which rearranges into an isocyanate.

<p id="p-0013" num="0012">To convert all or part of the amide functions of an acrylamide (co)polymer into amine functions, two main factors are involved (expressed in molar ratios). These are: &#x2014;Alpha=(alkali and/or alkaline earth metal hypohalide/acrylamide) and&#x2014;Beta=(alkali and/or alkaline earth metal hydroxide/alkali and/or alkaline earth metal hypohalide).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The polymers obtained by Hofmann degradation reaction are in particular used in paper-making processes. Generally, it is known that to be effective as a strength agent, the (co)polymers used must be in the most cationic form possible and therefore have a high degree of degradation. Indeed, as a function of the Alpha degree of degradation, it is possible to generate variations in cationicity related to the number of amine functions produced on the carbon backbone of the (co)polymer. Moreover, it is known that when the product obtained by Hofmann degradation reaction is amphoteric, it can also be used to improve the charge retention when the paper or cardboard is manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Until recently, only very expensive processes using, in situ, a Hofmann degradation product manufacturing unit (EP 377313) or processes using another polymer (base of the N-vinylformamide (co)polymer type followed by hydrolysis) itself relatively costly (US 2004/118540), had been implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It was not until early 2005 and patent WO2006075115 by the applicant that a viable industrial solution was proposed. The invention there is characterized, in part, by the fact that the Hofmann degradation product claimed is an organic polymer produced at a concentration greater than 3.5% by weight and preferably greater than 4.5%. Even though the dry strength performance is greatly improved, the polymers produced remain unstable over time and have very low molecular weight, giving the (co)polymer very limited utility for applications such as draining or flocculation.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Patent WO2008/107620 by the applicant had resolved this problem of stability and poor performance during dewatering by changing the nature of the hypochlorite (using calcium hypochlorite). However, the inventor then had to handle low calcium hypochlorite availability, with high impurity content in the final product (the purest grade of calcium hypochlorite has a minimum level of impurities of 20%), and storage, transport and handling problems for a powder classed as dangerous.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The problem that the invention proposes solving is therefore to propose an improved process for preparing cationic or amphoteric acrylamide (co)polymers while retaining in said polymers their characteristics of stability and high molecular weight.</p>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="tail"?>
<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The Applicant has observed in a surprising manner that the advantages obtained according to patent WO2008/107620 can also be obtained by adding to the reaction medium, before adding the reagents, i.e. the hypohalide and the hydroxide, a significant quantity of polyvalent cationic ions. Further, this process presents the possibility of using a conventional hypochlorite, i.e. bleach, easily available on the market, containing fewer impurities and requiring simpler handling because it does not require direct contact with personnel (piping) and removing the constraining stage of pre-dissolving the solid calcium hypochlorite.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The applicant has found and developed a process for preparing cationic or amphoteric (co)polymers derived from acrylamide by a Hofmann degradation reaction in aqueous solution in the presence of an alkali and/or alkaline-earth metal hydroxide and an alkali metal hypohalide on a base copolymer, characterized in that the solution of base copolymer onto which the reaction is performed contains a polyvalent cationic salt representing at least 0.5% by weight, preferably from 2 to 10% by weight of the base copolymer.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Since these products are known in the prior art for their instability at Alpha coefficients less than 1, it could not therefore be presumed that simply adding a polyvalent cationic ion salt could give the cationic (co)polymer derived from acrylamide obtained according to the invention:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0021">not only very high stability over time,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0022">but also high viscosity greater than 30 cps (at a concentration of 9%, at 25&#xb0; C., Brookfield LV1, 60 rpm), preferably greater than 40 cps.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0023">As already stated, the copolymer obtained by a Hofmann degradation reaction must be obtained in whole or in part in the presence, as hypohalide, of an alkali metal hypohalide.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0024">In a preferred embodiment, the copolymer is obtained by a Hofmann degradation reaction in the exclusive presence, as hypohalide, of an alkali metal hypohalide, advantageously sodium hypochlorite.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0025">Without attempting to establish any theory, it seems that the mere presence of salts of polyvalent cationic ions in the solution of base (co)polymer during the Hofmann degradation reaction might limit the sensitivity of the polymer chain inherent to the conditions of the Hofmann degradation reaction, thereby preserving its molecular weight and stability.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0026">According to another characteristic, the hypohalide/non-ionic monomer Alpha coefficient used to prepare the polymers of the invention is greater than 0.1, preferably than 0.3, advantageously greater than 0.5 and preferably less than 1.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0027">The copolymer obtained according to the invention can be used successfully to manufacture packaging paper and cardboard, coating papers, all types of paper, cardboard or analogues needing the use of a polymer cationic and as coagulation agent.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0028">According to another characteristic, the product of the Hofmann degradation is produced at a concentration greater than 4% by weight, preferably greater than 8%, advantageously greater than 9%.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0029">In the same way, the copolymer of the invention has a cationic charge density preferably greater than 2 meq/g and advantageously greater than 5 meq/g.</p>

    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0040">It is important to note that, in combination with these monomers, it is also possible to use monomers that are insoluble in water such as acrylic, allyl or vinyl monomers containing a hydrophobic substituent. When they are used, these monomers will be used in very low quantities, less than 20 mol %, preferably less than 10 mol %, and they will be selected preferably from the group comprising derivatives of acrylamide such as N-alkylacrylamide, for example N-tert-butylacrylamide, octylacrylamide and N,N-dialkylacrylamides such as N,N-dihexylacrylamide, etc. and derivatives of acrylic acid such as alkyl acrylates and methacrylates, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0041">According to a preferred feature of the invention, the base copolymer is branched.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0042">The branching can be done preferably during (or optionally after) the polymerization of the &#x201c;base&#x201d; copolymer, in the presence of a polyfunctional branching agent and optionally a transfer agent.

Advantageously, the branching agent is methylene bis acrylamide (MBA).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0044">Below is found a non-limiting list of transfer agents: isopropyl alcohol, sodium hypophosphite, mercaptoethanol, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0045">The skilled person will know how to select the best combination as a function of his own understanding and the present description, along with the examples that follow.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0046">The copolymer serving as base for the Hofmann degradation reaction does not need any specific polymerization process development. The main polymerization techniques, well known to the skilled person and that can be used are: polymerization by precipitation, polymerization in emulsion (aqueous or inverse) with or without a subsequent distillation and/or spray drying step, and polymerization in suspension or polymerization in solution, these two techniques being preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0047">This base is characterized in that it has a molecular weight greater than 5,000 g/mol and without a maximum limit.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0048">It is also possible to add to the base copolymer solution, before or during the Hofmann degradation reaction, a number of additives that can react on the isocyanate functions of the polymer generated during the degradation. Generally, this is molecules carrying nucleophilic chemical functions such as hydroxyl, amine, etc. functions. As examples, the additives in question can therefore be from the family of alcohols, polyols (e.g.: starch), polyamines, polyethylene imines, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0049">Before being degraded, according to the invention one (or more) salts of polyvalent cationic ions (i.e. with cationic charge greater than or equal to 2) are incorporated into the base copolymer solution, at a minimum concentration of 0.5% by mass, preferably from 2-10% by mass, compared with the base (co)polymer. Among the salts of polyvalent cationic ions that can be used divalent ions are preferred, preferably Ca++, Mg++, Zn++, Cu++, and/or Ba++ and/or Al+++ ions. It has also been found that trivalent salts such as aluminium could be of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0050">These salts are preferably in the form of halide, sulfate, carbonate, nitrate, phosphate, nitrite, citrate or even acetate. Advantageously, the salts of polyvalent cationic ions are added to the solution of base (co)polymer after polymerization. In a non-preferred variant of the invention, these salts can also be incorporated before or during the polymerization of the base (co)polymer.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Hofmann Degradation Reaction on the &#x201c;Base&#x201d; Copolymer</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0051">The Hofmann reaction requires conversion of amide functions into amine functions using two main factors (expressed as molar ratios):
<ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0052">Alpha=(alkali metal hypohalide/(meth)acrylamide)</li>
        <li id="ul0009-0002" num="0053">Beta=(alkali and/or alkaline-earth metal hydroxide/alkali metal hypohalide)</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0054">From a solution of &#x201c;base&#x201d; copolymer previously described having concentration from 10 to 40% by weight, preferably between 20 and 40%, the molar quantity of total (meth)acrylamide functions is determined. The level of Alpha degradation desired is selected (this corresponds to the desired degree of amine functions), which determines the dry quantity of alkali metal hypohalide and then the beta coefficient, which determines the dry quantity of alkali and/or alkaline earth metal hydroxide.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0055">Next a solution of alkali and/or alkaline earth metal hypohalide and hydroxide is prepared from the alpha and beta ratios. According to the invention, the reagents preferably used are sodium hypochlorite (bleach) and caustic soda (sodium hydroxide).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0056">To stabilize the amine functions that will be produced, one (or optionally more) quaternary ammonium derivatives can optionally be added to the reactor containing the base polymer, as is described in patent JP 57077398 and well known to the skilled person, which is to prevent reaction between the amine functions and the residual amide functions.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0057">It should also be noted that these agents can be added separately, simultaneously, in mixtures or not, in any order of addition and at one or more injection points.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0058">The increase in cationicity in the base copolymer occurs during the Hofmann degradation, through the use, completely or partially, of an alkali metal hypohalide.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0059">Furthermore, it is also possible to propose cationic or amphoteric copolymers of acrylamide of the invention obtained by Hofmann degradation reaction in the form of a mixture with one or more other synthetic polymer(s) with higher molecular weights and preferably non-ionic or cationic charge.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0060">In the same way, although prepared in solution, the polymers of the invention can also be proposed in solid form. Under these conditions, the solid form contains not only the copolymer, but also a small proportion of salt obtained from the Hofmann degradation reaction. In practice, they are obtained among others, by processes consisting in isolating the active matter from the previously cited solution. The main isolation techniques used are those of drying by atomization or spraying (which consists in creating a cloud of fine droplets in a hot gaseous current for a controlled period), drying in a drum, fluid bed dryers, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0061">As already stated, the copolymers obtained according to the process of the invention find more specific application in processes for manufacturing paper for their properties of dewatering, charge retention and/or to improve dry strength performance.</p>
