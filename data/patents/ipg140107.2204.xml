<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Anti-ICAM-1 V<sub>H</sub>H single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) are generated by immunizing a llama with recombinant ICAM-1. These antibodies are linked to an imaging moiety for in vivo or ex vivo imaging of ICAM-1-related pathological conditions including atherosclerotic plaques. The antibodies may also be linked to a therapeutic agent to specifically target and treat ICAM-1-related pathological conditions.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to anti-ICAM-1 single-domain antibodies and uses thereof. More specifically, the invention relates to anti-ICAM-1 single-domain antibodies and their use as diagnostic tools.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Cardiovascular diseases are currently the leading cause of death in developed countries, and represent a growing financial burden on health care. Atherosclerosis, the narrowing of major arteries by fatty plaques, constitutes the single most important contributor to this group of diseases. However, in over half of affected individuals, the condition is left undetected and the earliest clinical manifestations are myocardial infarction, stroke, or sudden death. In particular, carotid artery stenosis (carotid artery disease&#x2014;CAD), is responsible for approximately half of ischemic strokes, and is mostly caused by carotid atherosclerosis.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Landmark clinical trials over the past two decades have demonstrated that surgical intervention in cases of symptomatic high-grade stenosis can reduce the risk of subsequent stroke (Barnett et al, 1998; Ferguson et al 1999; Gillard, 2003). However, it has also been shown that the degree of stenosis is not predictive of risk for stroke; it is rather the presence of unstable, inflamed atherosclerotic plaques that is a more accurate predictor of impending stroke. Therefore, screening patients diagnosed with CAD for carotid atherosclerosis is recommended; however, such screening (MRI or X-ray angiography) might be costly.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Surgical treatment for CAD is performed via a procedure called endarterectomy, which typically comprises surgical removal of plaques from the artery, but unfortunately carries a high mortality risk of 2-10%. To justify such a high mortality risk and qualify patients for high-risk endarcterectomy, it is necessary to more accurately diagnose CAD caused by unstable atherosclerotic plaques, which are predictive of stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Most patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack are screened for internal carotid artery stenosis. The current standard of care for detecting carotid stenosis is based on conventional imaging techniques such as ultrasound and angiography. These methods provide information about the structural consequences of CAD, such as luminal stenosis, but yield little to no information about plaque development and plaque characteristics within the vessel wall. None of these imaging techniques is able to provide information on the molecular or cellular events within the plaque that predispose it to rupture (i.e., an unstable plaque), and hence predict the real risk for stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">X-ray angiography remains the current gold standard imaging technique; however, it has many limitations. Angiography simply images the lumen of the vessel, and fails to detect atherosclerotic lesions that do not protrude into the lumen and provides little information on atherosclerotic plaque composition. Thus, it cannot differentiate between unstable and stable plaques and, therefore, is unable to predict the risk of plaque rupture. Consequently, because it is mostly symptom-driven, its main value is in delineating the causative lesion in a symptomatic patient. However, because of positive remodelling, a &#x2018;normal&#x2019; angiogram cannot be interpreted as indicating an absence of atherosclerosis. Moreover, MRI and x-ray angiography screenings are costly.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, there remains a need in the art for a cost-effective method of screening atherosclerotic plaques to identify unstable plaques and more accurately predict the risk of rupture for heart attack and stroke.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0033">Anti-ICAM-1 single-domain antibodies were obtained by immunization of a llama with ICAM-1; three clones in particular were shown to specifically bind ICAM-1. The anti-ICAM-1 sdAb were coupled with the near infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging dye for application, which was advantageous in optical imaging due to the conjugate's high sensitivity and avoidance of ionizing radiation. Using this formulation, it was shown that the NIRF-labelled anti-ICAM-1 sdAb specifically recognized early and developed atherosclerotic plaques in large vessels in high-fat diet fed ApoE KO mice; it was additionally shown that this can be monitored non-invasively by prospective optical imaging in vivo. The distribution of the ICAM-1 sdAb in the plaques was confirmed using microscopic techniques and immunohistochemistry.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0034">The use of sdAb is advantageous as they may be produced easily and inexpensively in large quantities, as opposed to antibodies produced from hybridoma cell lines. Additionally, hybridoma lines may be unstable and decrease antibody expression levels over time. sdAb are also advantageous for molecular imaging applications due to their short plasma half-life, which achieves fast contrast-to-noise ratio needed for imaging.</p>

<p id="p-0059" num="0068">The present invention relates to anti-ICAM-1 single-domain antibodies and uses thereof. More specifically, the invention relates to anti-ICAM-1 single-domain antibodies and their use as diagnostic tools.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0069">The present invention is directed to anti-intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) antibodies and molecular imaging agents based on the antibodies.

</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0074">The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d;, also referred to in the art as &#x201c;immunoglobulin&#x201d; (Ig), used herein refers to a protein constructed from paired heavy and light polypeptide chains; various Ig isotypes exist, including IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM. When an antibody is correctly folded, each chain folds into a number of distinct globular domains joined by more linear polypeptide sequences. For example, the immunoglobulin light chain folds into a variable (V<sub>L</sub>) and a constant (C<sub>L</sub>) domain, while the heavy chain folds into a variable (V<sub>H</sub>) and three constant (C<sub>H</sub>, C<sub>H2</sub>, C<sub>H3</sub>) domains. Interaction of the heavy and light chain variable domains (V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L</sub>) results in the formation of an antigen binding region (Fv). Each domain has a well-established structure familiar to those of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0075">The light and heavy chain variable regions are responsible for binding the target antigen and can therefore show significant sequence diversity between antibodies. The constant regions show less sequence diversity, and are responsible for binding a number of natural proteins to elicit important biochemical events. The variable region of an antibody contains the antigen binding determinants of the molecule, and thus determines the specificity of an antibody for its target antigen. The majority of sequence variability occurs in six hypervariable regions, three each per variable heavy and light chain; the hypervariable regions combine to form the antigen-binding site, and contribute to binding and recognition of an antigenic determinant. The specificity and affinity of an antibody for its antigen is determined by the structure of the hypervariable regions, as well as their size, shape and chemistry of the surface they present to the antigen. Various schemes exist for identification of the regions of hypervariability, the two most common being those of Kabat and of Chothia and Lesk. Kabat et al (1991) define the &#x201c;complementarity-determining regions&#x201d; (CDR) based on sequence variability at the antigen-binding regions of the VH and VL domains. Chothia and Lesk (1987) define the &#x201c;hypervariable loops&#x201d; (H or L) based on the location of the structural loop regions in the VH and VL domains; the numbering for the hypervariable loops is defined as H1: 27-35; H2: 52-56; and H3: 95-102 (equivalent to CDR3 of Kabat numbering) for VHNHH domains (Chothia and Lesk, 1987). As these individual schemes define CDR and hypervariable loop regions that are adjacent or overlapping, those of skill in the antibody art often utilize the terms &#x201c;CDR&#x201d; and &#x201c;hypervariable loop&#x201d; interchangeably, and they may be so used herein. The CDR amino acids in VH and VL regions are defined herein according to the Kabat numbering system (Kabat et al. 1991).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0076">The region outside of the CDR is referred to as the framework region (FR). The FR provides structural integrity to the variable domain and ensure retention of the immunoglobulin fold. This characteristic structure of antibodies provides a stable scaffold upon which substantial antigen-binding diversity can be explored by the immune system to obtain specificity for a broad array of antigens (Padlan et al, 1994).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0077">An &#x201c;antibody fragment&#x201d; as referred to herein may include any suitable antigen-binding antibody fragment known in the art. The antibody fragment may be obtained by manipulation of a naturally-occurring antibody, or may be obtained using recombinant methods. For example, an antibody fragment may include, but is not limited to Fv, single-chain Fv (scFV; a molecule consisting V<sub>L </sub>and V<sub>H </sub>connected with a peptide linker), Fab, Fab&#x2032;, F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2</sub>, single domain antibody (sdAb), and multivalent presentations of these.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0078">In a non-limiting example, the antibody fragment may be a single domain antibody (sdAb) derived from naturally-occurring sources. Heavy chain antibodies of camelid origin (Hamers-Casterman et al, 1993) lack light chains and thus their antigen binding sites consist of one domain, termed V<sub>H</sub>H. sdAb have also been observed in shark and are termed VNARs (Nuttall et al, 2003); other sdAb may be engineered based on human heavy or light chain sequences (Jespers et al, 2004; To et al, 2005). As used herein, &#x201c;sdAb&#x201d; includes those directly isolated from V<sub>L</sub>, V<sub>H</sub>, V<sub>H</sub>H or V<sub>NAR </sub>reservoir of any origin through phage display or other display technologies and those generated through further modification of such sdAb by humanization, affinity maturation, stabilization, solubilisation (e.g., camelization), or other methods of antibody engineering. Also encompassed by the present invention are homologues, derivatives, or fragments that retain the antigen-binding function and specificity of the sdAb.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0079">A person of skill in the art would be well-acquainted with the structure of a single-domain antibody (see, for example, 3DWT, 2P42 in Protein Data Bank). A sdAb comprises a single immunoglobulin domain that retains the immuglobulin fold; most notably, only three CDR form the antigen-binding site. However, not all CDR may be required for binding the antigen. For example, and without wishing to be limiting, one, two, or three of the CDR may contribute to binding and recognition of the antigen by the sdAb of the present invention. The CDR of the sdAb are referred to herein as CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3, and are based on Kabat numbering (Kabat et al. 1991).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0080">The terms &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; and &#x201c;antibody fragment&#x201d; (&#x201c;fragment thereof&#x201d;) are as defined above. As previously stated, the antibody or fragment thereof may be a sdAb. The sdAb may be of camelid origin, and thus may be based on camelid framework regions; alternatively, the CDR may be grafted onto the framework regions of other antibody domains, for example but not limited to VNAR, human V<sub>H </sub>or human V<sub>I </sub>framework regions. In yet another alternative, the CDR described above may be grafted onto the framework regions of other types of antibody fragments (Fv, scFv, Fab). The present embodiment further encompasses an antibody fragment that is &#x201c;humanized&#x201d; using any suitable method know in the art, for example, but not limited to CDR grafting and veneering. Humanization of an antibody or antibody fragment comprises replacing an amino acid in the sequence with its human counterpart, as found in the human consensus sequence, without loss of antigen-binding ability or specificity; this approach reduces immunogenicity of the antibody or fragment thereof when introduced into human subjects. In the process of CDR grafting, one or more than one of the heavy chain CDR defined herein may be fused or grafted to a human variable region (V<sub>H</sub>, or V<sub>L</sub>), or to other human antibody fragment framework regions (Fv, scFv, Fab). In such a case, the conformation of said one or more than one hypervariable loop is preserved, and the affinity and specificity of the sdAb for its target (i.e., ICAM-1) is also preserved. CDR grafting is known in the art and is described in at least the following: U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,180,370, 5,693,761, 6,054,297, 5,859,205, and European Patent No. 626390. Veneering, also referred to in the art as &#x201c;variable region resurfacing&#x201d;, involves humanizing solvent-exposed positions of the antibody or fragment; thus, buried non-humanized residues, which may be important for CDR conformation, are preserved while the potential for immunological reaction against solvent-exposed regions is minimized. Veneering is known in the art and is described in at least the following: U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,869,619, 5,766,886, 5,821,123, and European Patent No. 519596. Persons of skill in the art would be amply familiar with methods of preparing such humanized antibody fragments.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0081">By &#x201c;specific to ICAM-1&#x201d;, it is meant that the antibody or fragment thereof of the present invention recognizes and binds to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), also referred to in the art as CD54. ICAM-1 is a cell adhesion molecule in the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed on the surface of endothelial cells. ICAM-1 is normally expressed in low levels in endothelial cells. However, in inflammatory conditions (e.g., the presence of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x3b1;, interferon-&#x3b3;, interleukin-4 and interleukin-1&#x3b2;), the level of expression is rapidly increased on the surface of endothelial cells; ICAM-1 plays a role in inflammatory cell (leukocytes) adhesion to endothelial cells and their recruitment into inflamed tissues. ICAM-1 also mediates the firm adhesion of lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils to the sites of endothelial lesion development. Therefore, the expression of ICAM-1 plays an important rote in the amplification of inflammation. ICAM-1 may be an early sign of endothelial activation and damage present before the onset of plaque formation (liyama et al, 1999).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0082">The antibody or fragment thereof may have a CDR1 of sequence LYVMG (SEQ ID NO:1), AFRMG (SEQ ID NO:2), and INDMG (SEQ ID NO:3); a CDR2 of sequence DITSSGSIYYVDSLKG (SEQ ID NO:4), VITAGGTTSYIDSVKG (SEQ ID NO:5), and RITRDGSAAYEDSVKG (SEQ ID NO:6); and a CDR3 of sequence HVRQDSGSEYLTY (SEQ ID NO:7), IDYDS (SEQ ID NO:8), and EIITTQTLGRMLGEY (SEQ ID NO:9). The antibody or fragment thereof may be a sdAb. The sdAb may be of camelid origin, and thus may be based on camelid framework regions; alternatively, the CDR may be grafted onto other antibody domains, for example but not limited to VNAR or human V<sub>H</sub>H framework regions.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0083">In a non-limiting example, the antibody or fragment thereof may have a CDR1 of sequence LYVMG (SEQ ID NO:1), a CDR2 of sequence DITSSGSIYYVDSLKG (SEQ ID NO:4), and a CDR3 of sequence HVRQDSGSEYLTY (SEQ ID NO:7). Alternatively, the antibody or fragment thereof may have a CDR1 of sequence AFRMG (SEQ ID NO:2), a CDR2 of sequence VITAGGTTSYIDSVKG (SEQ ID NO:5), and a CDR3 of sequence IDYDS (SEQ ID NO:8). In yet another alternative, the antibody or fragment thereof may have a CDR1 of sequence INDMG (SEQ ID NO:3), a CDR2 of sequence RITRDGSAAYEDSVKG (SEQ ID NO:6), and a CDR3 of sequence EIITTQTLGRMLGEY (SEQ ID NO:9).</p>

or a sequence substantially identical thereto. In a specific, non-limiting example, the isolated or purified antibody or fragment thereof may also comprise the sequence of clone 11-4, 5-5, or 34-1 as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 4</figref>, or a sequence substantially identical thereto.
</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0086">A substantially identical sequence may comprise one or more conservative amino acid mutations. It is known in the art that one or more conservative amino acid mutations to a reference sequence may yield a mutant peptide with no substantial change in physiological, chemical, or functional properties compared to the reference sequence; in such a case, the reference and mutant sequences would be considered &#x201c;substantially identical&#x201d; polypeptides.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0087">Conservative amino acid mutation may include addition, deletion, or substitution of an amino acid; in one non-limiting example, the conservative amino acid mutation is a conservative amino acid substitution. A conservative amino acid substitution is defined herein as the substitution of an amino acid residue for another amino acid residue with similar chemical properties (e.g. size, charge, or polarity).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0088">A conservative amino acid substitution may substitute a basic, neutral, hydrophobic, or acidic amino acid for another of the same group. By the term &#x201c;basic amino acid&#x201d; it is meant hydrophilic amino acids having a side chain pK value of greater than 7, which are typically positively charged at physiological pH. Basic amino acids include histidine (H is or H), arginine (Arg or R), and lysine (Lys or K). By the term &#x201c;neutral amino acid&#x201d; (also &#x201c;polar amino acid&#x201d;), it is meant hydrophilic amino acids having a side chain that is uncharged at physiological pH, but which has at least one bond in which the pair of electrons shared in common by two atoms is held more closely by one of the atoms. Polar amino acids include serine (Ser or S), threonine (Thr or T), cysteine (Cys or C), tyrosine (Tyr or Y), asparagine (Asn or N), and glutamine (Gln or Q). The term &#x201c;hydrophobic amino acid&#x201d; (also &#x201c;non-polar amino acid&#x201d;) is meant to include amino acids exhibiting a hydrophobicity of greater than zero according to the normalized consensus hydrophobicity scale of Eisenberg (1984). Hydrophobic amino acids include proline (Pro or P), isoleucine (Ile or I), phenylalanine (Phe or F), valine (Val or V), leucine (Leu or L), tryptophan (Trp or W), methionine (Met or M), alanine (Ala or A), and glycine (Gly or G).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0089">&#x201c;Acidic amino acid&#x201d; refers to hydrophilic amino acids having a side chain pK value of less than 7, which are typically negatively charged at physiological pH. Acidic amino acids include glutamate (Glu or E), and aspartate (Asp or D).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0090">Sequence identity is used to evaluate the similarity of two sequences; it is determined by calculating the percent of residues that are the same when the two sequences are aligned for maximum correspondence between residue positions. Any known method may be used to calculate sequence identity; for example, computer software is available to calculate sequence identity. Without wishing to be limiting, sequence identity can be calculated by software such as NCBI BLAST2 service maintained by the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (and as found at ca.expasy.org/tools/blast/), BLAST-P, Blast-N, or FASTA-N, or any other appropriate software that is known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0091">The substantially identical sequences of the present invention may be at least 70% identical; in another example, the substantially identical sequences may be at least 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 80, 85, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or 100% identical at the amino acid level to sequences described herein. Importantly, the substantially identical sequences retain the activity and specificity of the reference sequence. For example, and without wishing to be limiting, the degree of identity between clones 11-4 and 5-5, clones 5-5 and 34-1 is 70%; the degree of identity between clones 11-4 and 34-1 is 75%. As would be know to one of skill in the art, amino acid residues of an antibody, particularly within the framework regions may be mutated (substituted or deleted) without affecting the functional properties of the antibody (antigen recognition and binding).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0092">The antibody or fragment thereof of the present invention may also comprise additional sequences to aid in expression, detection, or purification of a recombinant antibody or fragment thereof. For example, and without wishing to be limiting, the antibody or fragment thereof may comprise a targeting or signal sequence (for example, but not limited to ompA), a detection tag (for example, but not limited to c-Myc, EQKLISEEDL, SEQ ID NO:19), a purification tag (for example, but not limited to a histidine purification tag, HHHHHH, SEQ ID NO:20), or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0093">The antibody or fragment thereof of the present invention may also be in a multivalent display. Multimerization may be achieved by any suitable method of know in the art. For example, and without wishing to be limiting in any manner, multimerization may be achieved using self-assembly molecules (Zhang et al, 2004; Merritt &#x26; Hol, 1995), as described in WO2003/046560. The described method produces pentabodies by expressing a fusion protein comprising the antibody or fragment thereof of the present invention and the pentamerization domain of the B-subunit of an AB<sub>5 </sub>toxin family (Nielson et al, 2000); the pentamerization domain assembles into a pentamer, through which a multivalent display of the antibody or fragment thereof is formed. Each subunit of the pentamer may be the same or different. Additionally, the pentamerization domain may be linked to the antibody or antibody fragment using a linker; such a linker should be of sufficient length and appropriate composition to provide flexible attachment of the two molecules, but should not hamper the antigen-binding properties of the antibody. In one non-limiting example, the linker may be the linker GPGGGSGGGGS (SEQ ID NO:21)</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0094">Other forms of multivalent display are also encompassed by the present invention. For example, and without wishing to be limiting, the antibody or fragment thereof may be presented as a dimer, a trimer, or any other suitable oligomer. This may be achieved by methods known in the art, for example direct linking connection (Nielsen et al, 1996), c-jun/Fos interaction (de Kruif et al, 1996), &#x201c;Knob into holes&#x201d; interaction (Ridgway et al, 1996).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0095">Another method known in the art for multimerization is to dimerize the antibody or fragment thereof using a Fc domain. In this approach, a Fc gene in inserted into an expression vector; the nucleotide sequence of the antibody or fragment thereof can be amplified and inserted into the vector such that the C-terminus of the antibody or fragment thereof is linked to the hinge region of the Fc without addition of extra residues. The resulting vector can be transfected to cells and the fusion protein may be recombinantly expressed, then purified by affinity chromatography (for example, on a protein A column). One non-limiting example of such a method of multimerization is described by Bell et al (2010) and Iqbal et al (in press). Techniques for implementing such dimerization would be known to those of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0096">The present invention also encompasses nucleic acid sequences encoding the molecules as described herein. The nucleic acid sequence may be codon-optimized. The present invention also encompasses vectors comprising the nucleic acids as just described.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0097">The present invention further provides a targeted therapeutic agent comprising an anti-ICAM-1 antibody or fragment thereof of the present invention linked to a suitable therapeutic. The antibody or fragment thereof may serve to target therapeutic agents to the site of atherosclerotic plaques, or may have use as a therapeutic agent itself. For example, and without wishing to be limiting, the antibody or fragment thereof may be used for therapeutically modifying the inflammatory component of atherosclerotic disease (e.g., stroke prevention therapy). Additionally, the antibody or fragment thereof or the targeted therapeutic agent may be used to treat conditions associated with increased ICAM-1 expression; these may include, but are not limited to carotid artery disease, stroke, myocardial infarction, inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune diseases, multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, and neovascularization associated with tumour angiogenesis. For example, and without wishing to be limiting in any manner, the therapeutic agent may be an anti-inflammatory drug, a cholesterol-lowering drug, or a plaque-stabilizing drug.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0098">The present invention also encompasses a molecular imaging agent comprising an anti-ICAM-1 antibody or fragment thereof in accordance with the present invention linked to a detectable agent. For example, the anti-ICAM-1 or fragment thereof may be linked to a radioisotope, a paramagnetic label such as gadolinium or iron oxide, a fluorophore, Near Infra-Red (NIR) fluorochrome or dye, an echogenic microbubble, an affinity label (for example biotin, avidin, etc), enzymes, or any other suitable agent that may be detected by diagnostic imaging methods. In a specific, non-limiting example, the anti-ICAM-1 or fragment thereof may be linked to a near infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging dye, for example and not wishing to be limiting Cy5.5, Alexa680, Dylight680, or Dylight800.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0099">An ideal molecular imaging agent for imaging atherosclerotic plaque diseases, such as carotid atherosclerosis, should have a high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of plaques, and provide information about the probability of adverse outcome in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Because baseline constitutive ICAM-1 expression is low, it is expressed on the luminal surface of endothelial cells, and the expression levels correlate with the severity of disease (Kitagawa et al, 2002), ICAM-1 is an excellent target for non-invasive molecular imaging applications to diagnose pre-symptomatic and/or unstable carotid artery disease and other atherosclerotic plaque diseases. To obtain clear images, it is imperative that molecular imaging agent has rapid clearance from the circulation and high target (atherosclerotic plaque)-to-background (blood pool) ratio. Because of the fast clearance of antibody fragments, and single domain antibodies in particular, and their short half life, they are superior to whole IgG molecules in achieving a successful image. Additionally, the coupling of single domain antibodies against ICAM-1 to a Near Infrared Fluorescence (NIRF) imaging dye for optical imaging is advantageous due to high sensitivity and avoidance of ionizing radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0100">The therapeutic agent or detectable agent may be linked to the anti-ICAM-1 antibody or fragment thereof by any method know in the art. By the term &#x201c;linked&#x201d;, also referred to herein as &#x201c;conjugated&#x201d;, it is meant that the antibody or fragment thereof is linked directly or indirectly (e.g., via a linker), covalently or non-covalently (e.g., adsorption, ionic interaction) to the therapeutic or detectable agent. A covalent linkage may be achieved through a chemical cross-linking reaction, or through fusion using recombinant DNA methodology combined with any peptide expression system, such as bacteria, yeast or mammalian cell-based systems. Methods for linking an antibody or fragment thereof to a therapeutic agent or detectable agent would be well-known to a person of skill in the art.</p>

<p id="p-0098" num="0122">Anti-ICAM-1 single-domain antibodies were obtained by immunization of a llama with ICAM-1; three clones in particular were shown to specifically bind ICAM-1. The anti-ICAM-1 sdAb were coupled with the near infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging dye for application, which was advantageous in optical imaging due to the conjugate's high sensitivity and avoidance of ionizing radiation. Using this formulation, it was shown that the NIRF-labelled anti-ICAM-1 sdAb specifically recognized early and developed atherosclerotic plaques in large vessels in high-fat diet fed ApoE KO mice; it was additionally shown that this can be monitored non-invasively by prospective optical imaging in vivo. The distribution of the anti-ICAM-1 sdAb in the plaques was confirmed using microscopic techniques and immunohistochemistry. Optical imaging as a means of imaging atherosclerosis in vivo provides a high sensitivity, allowing for detection at an earlier stage of the disease, which may potentially lead to better therapeutic outcomes.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0123">The use of sdAb is advantageous as they may be produced easily and inexpensively in large quantities, as opposed to antibodies produced from hybridoma cell lines. Additionally, hybridoma lines may be unstable and decrease antibody expression levels over time. sdAb are also advantageous for molecular imaging applications due to their short plasma half-life, which achieves fast contrast-to-noise ratio needed for imaging.</p>

<p id="p-0102" num="0126">A llama was immunized with recombinant antigen. For each injection, 100 &#x3bc;g of recombinant human ICAM-1 (R&#x26;D systems, reconstituted with sterile water according to manufacturer's recommendation to prepare a stock solution of 1 mg/ml), in a total volume of 0.5 ml was mixed with an equal volume of incomplete Freund's adjuvant and 0.5 ml was injected, subcutaneously. Seven injections were performed at approximately two week intervals and blood was collected at each injection.</p>

About 5 &#x3bc;g of total RNA was used as template for first strand cDNA synthesis with an oligo dT primer using a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences, USA). Based on the camelidae and llama immunoglobulin databases, three variable domain sense primers (MJ1-3) and two CH2 domain antisense primers (CH2 and CH2b3) were designed (Doyle et al. 2008). The first PCR was performed with the cDNA as template and the variable regions of both conventional (IgG1) and heavy chain antibodies (IgG2 and IgG3) were amplified with combinations of MJ1-3/CH2 and MJ1-3/CH2b3 primers in two separate PCR reactions. The PCR reaction mixtures contained the following components: 2 &#x3bc;l cDNA, 5 pmol of MJ1-3 primer mixture, 5 pmol of either CH2 or CH2b3 primer, 5 &#x3bc;l of 10&#xd7; reaction buffer, 3 &#x3bc;l of 2.5 mM dNTP, 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, Ind.) and water to a final volume of 50 &#x3bc;l.

Approximately 10<sup>11 </sup>library phage were added to the blocked wells, including control wells with no antigen and incubated for 2 hours at 37&#xb0; C. After 7&#xd7; washing with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, bound phage were eluted with 0.1 M triethylamine, then neutralized and added to exponentially growing TG1 cells. The eluted phage were titered and the infected bacterial cells were super-infected with M13KO7 and grown overnight at 37&#xb0; C. Panning was continued for three more rounds following the same procedure except that the amount of coated ICAM-1 antigen was reduced to 40, 30, and 20 &#x3bc;g for the second, third and fourth rounds, respectively. Colony-PCR was performed on twenty-four individual colonies randomly picked after the last round of panning and the sequences of amplified VHH genes were determined.</p>

The cultures were grown at 37&#xb0; C. overnight. Phage supernatants were then collected by centrifugation and their reactivity was measured by phage ELISA. Briefly, ELISA wells were coated overnight at 4&#xb0; C. with 5 &#x3bc;g/ml of the recombinant ICAM-1 and blocked with 3% BSA for additional 2 hours at 37&#xb0; C. Phage supernatants were added to the wells and incubated for 2 hours at 37&#xb0; C. The presence of phage binding was detected by an anti-M13/HRP conjugate (GE Healthcare, Mississauga, ON).

<p id="p-0121" num="0145">Rat brain endothelial cells (SV-RBEC) were cultured on coverslips for 3 days in DMEM and 10% FBS. ICAM-1 expression was induced by adding 5 &#x3bc;g (1 mg/ml) of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Sigma) overnight. Cells were then washed 3&#xd7; with cold PBS, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min, washed again 3&#xd7; in PBS at RT, and then blocked with 5% of normal goat serum/PBS for 1 h at RT. 25 &#x3bc;g anti-ICAM-1 IgG or 50 &#x3bc;g anti-ICAM-1 single domain antibodies (34-1, 11-4, 5-5) labelled with Cy5.5 (red) were incubated for 1 h at RT then washed 3&#xd7; in PBS.

<heading id="h-0016" level="1">EXAMPLE 6</heading>
<heading id="h-0017" level="1">Mouse Model of Atherosclerosis</heading>
<p id="p-0123" num="0147">Rodents do not develop atherosclerosis spontaneously. For this reason the apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE KO) mouse model was used to study ability of anti-ICAM-1 sdAb to detect atherosclerotic plaques. Apolipoprotein E is a ligand for receptors that clear remnants of chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins. ApoE KO mice develop atheromas in large arteries, including aorta and carotid arteries; these histologically resemble those found in humans (Weinreb et al 2007). Although these mice develop atheromas spontaneously, the rate of plaque formation is enhanced when they are fed a high fat diet for a period of 3 to 9 months. For the present experiments, mice were fed a high fat diet for a period of 4 months, starting at 2 months of age.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0148">To confirm that ApoE knockout animals develop atherosclerotic plaques on high-fat diet and that these plaques exhibit up-regulated expression of ICAM-1, the animals were sacrificed after four moths of high-fat diet and their aortas were dissected, sectioned and evaluated by immunofluorescence staining against ICAM-1 using a commercial anti-ICAM monoclonal antibody.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0149">Briefly, sample slides of 12 &#x3bc;m saline-perfused, not fixed, frozen aortic sections of ApoE KO mice and C57B control (Ctrl) mice were prepared. Samples were fixed with 100% MeOH 10 min at RT, washed with 3&#xd7;1&#xd7;PBS, then rinsed with MiIIiQ H<sub>2</sub>O (to wash off any OCT tissue tek embedding medium from the slides) followed with 3&#xd7;1&#xd7;PBS. Slides were then blocked with 10% Normal Goat Serum (NGS) (Cat# G6767, Sigma)+0.01% TritonX-100 in 1&#xd7;PBS for 1 h at RT. To stain endothelial cells, rat anti-mouse CD31 (Cat#557355, BD Pharmingen) was incubated at a dilution of 1:300 in 5% NGS in 1&#xd7;PBS for 1 h at RT, then rinsed with 3&#xd7;1&#xd7;PBS. Secondary antibody Goat anti-rat Alexa568 (Cat# A-11077, Invitrogen) was then incubated at 1:500 in 1&#xd7;PBS for 1 h at RT, and rinsed with 3&#xd7;1&#xd7;PBS. Armenian hamster anti-ICAM-1 1 mg/mL (Cat#553249, BD Pharmingen) 1:250 in 5% NGS in 1&#xd7;PBS was incubated for 1 h at RT to detect ICAM-1 expression and then rinsed with 3&#xd7;1&#xd7;PBS. Secondary antibody goat-anti-armenian hamster Alexa488 (Cat# sc-2446 Santa Cruz) 1:300 in 1&#xd7;PBS-1 h at RT was used afterward. Cover slipped in Dako fluorescent mounting medium (Cat# S3023, Dako) spiked with Hoechst (1 &#x3bc;g/mL) (Cat# H3570, Invitrogen). Images were acquired using Olympus IX81 Fluorescent Microscope and InVivo program. Images were corrected for background noise using ImagePro v6.2 and AxioVision LE rel4.4 software.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0150">Results show up-regulated expression of ICAM-1 in endothelial layer of aortas from ApoE knockout animals fed high-fat diet for 4 months compared to control animals (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>).

C57BI/6 mice on a high fat diet were used as wild type (WT) controls.</p>

<heading id="h-0019" level="1">In Vivo Near-Infrared Fluorescence Imaging of APO E Knockout Mice</heading>
<p id="p-0127" num="0151">The antibodies of Example 4 were labelled with fluorescent agent and were used for non-invasive optical imaging of ApoKO and control mice (of Example 6).</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0152">Anti-ICAM-1 antibodies were labelled with Cy5.5 succimidyl ester using methods recommended by the manufacturer (GE Healthcare). Labelling was optimized such that each sdAb had a dye/antibody ratio of two. The presence of plaques in the aorta of atherosclerotic mice (Example 6) was visualized monthly via tail vein injection of 50 &#x3bc;g of anti-ICAM-1 sdAb using non-invasive in vivo optical imaging. In vivo imaging studies were performed using a small-animal time-domain eXplore Optix MX2 pre-clinical imager (Advanced Research Technologies, Montreal, QC) at 4, 24, 48, and 72 h after injection. For imaging, mice were first anesthetized with isofluorane, and then positioned on an animal stage in a chamber that allows for maintenance of gaseous anesthesia. A pre-injection scan was routinely performed to determine baseline fluorescence level. At the end of the study, animals were euthanized and perfused, organs were removed and imaged. In all imaging experiments, a 670-nm pulsed laser diode with a repetition frequency of 80 MHz and a time resolution of 12 ps light pulse was used for excitation. The fluorescence emission at 700 nm was collected by a highly sensitive time-correlated single photon counting system and detected through a fast photomultiplier tube. The data were recorded as temporal point-spread functions (TPSF) and the images were reconstructed as fluorescence concentration maps using ART Optix Optiview analysis software 2.0 (Advanced Research Technologies, Montreal, QC).</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0153">Results are presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 to 25</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the longitudinal near-infrared optical imaging of atherosclerotic plaques in the aortic artery, shows that the fluorescent signal is more intense in the aortic region of the ApoE KO mice compared to control mice. These findings were quantified and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, supporting higher levels and faster progression of the ICAM-1 signal in aortic region of interest (ROI) in ApoE-knockout animals compared to control animals fed high-fat diet. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows a high optical signal in the heart/aortic region of ApoE KO mice and confirms that the fluorescent signal originated from the heart and aortic tissues using three-dimensional reconstruction of images. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows that the fluorescent signal after injecting anti-ICAM-1 sdAb-Cy5.5 was detected in the liver, heart, and bladder region of the ApoE &#x2212;/&#x2212; mice, compared to control mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>), where the signal was lacking in the heart region.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0154">Lifetime gating analyses were performed to analyse differences in Cy5.5 signal observed in the heart, liver and bladder. This method selectively displays only the specific lifetime values. Briefly, the fluorescence decay was estimated using eXplore Optix OptiView software. The software deconvoluted the measured fluorescent intensity-time decay curve using Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm, which applies a nonlinear least-squares minimization algorithm to compute the coefficients of a multi-exponential expansion of the fluorescence decay. Unbound deactivated Cy5.5 dye has a lifetime value of 1.0 to 1.3 ns, while the conjugated anti-ICAM-1 sdAb-Cy5.5 shows a value of approximately 1.9 ns. Using the fluorescence lifetime analyses and gating for specific fluorescence lifetime spans, the lifetime value of the signal in each region of interest was determined. Lifetime gating of 1.05-1.65 ns resulted in a signal predominantly in the bladder (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref>); 1.05-1.85 ns showed a signal predominantly in the liver region (data not shown), which can be attributed to a mixture of anti-ICAM-1 sdAb-Cy5.5 and free Cy5.5 fluorophore due to metabolism; and 1.85 ns-1.95 ns predominantly showed anti-ICAM-1 sdAb bound to plaques in the heart/aortic region (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</figref>). Thus, gating for fluorescent lifetime (1.85-1.95 ns) showed that the bound anti-ICAM-1 sdAb-Cy5.5 is found only in the heart/aortic region in ApoE knockout animals, while the specific anti-ICAM-1sdAb-Cy5.5 signal was not detected the same region of control animals (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0155">Overall, the results confirm the ability of anti-ICAM-1 sdAb to selectively bind to ICAM-1 receptor in vivo after intravenous injection; they also demonstrate the ability of anti-ICAM-1 sdAb to differentiate between inflamed plaques in ApoE KO mice and control mice.</p>

<heading id="h-0025" level="1">Molecular Imaging of Brain Vascular/Endothelial Pro-Inflammatory Activation in Stroke Using ICAM-1 sdAb</heading>
<p id="p-0138" num="0162">The endothelial adhesion molecule, ICAM-1, is expressed on luminal surface of brain vessels and is robustly up-regulated in different brain diseases, including stroke and multiple sclerosis. ICAM-1 is associated with leukocyte infiltration into the brain after ischemia. The clinical need for assessing and eventually therapeutically modulating endothelial inflammatory activation following stroke is still unmet. Developing a molecular imaging agent which can detect ICAM-1 expression in the brain vessels after stroke can aid in selecting approaches to manage stroke (e.g., anti-inflammatory agents to treat brain inflammation).</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0163">All procedures using animals were approved by the institutional Animal Care Committee and comply with the guidelines established by the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Male CD-1 mice (23-25 g) were obtained from Charles River and bred locally. Anesthesia was induced with 1.5% isoflurane and maintained with 1.0% isoflurane in 69% N<sub>2</sub>O and 30% O<sub>2 </sub>using a vaporizer. Mice were subjected to occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) using an intraluminal filament. Briefly, an 11-mm silicone-coated nylon thread was introduced into the left common carotid artery of an anesthetized mouse and directed into the internal carotid artery until it obstructed blood flow to the MCA for 1 hour. Sham-operated mice, which were subjected to the same brain surgery but no MCAO, were used as controls.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0164">The up-regulation of ICAM-1 expression in brain vessels after stroke was evaluated using immunofluorescence approaches. Vessels were detected in brain sections using fluorescently-labeled Tomato lectin (green), and ICAM-1 expression was detected using monoclonal anti-ICAM-1 antibody followed with secondary antibody. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> shows ICAM-1 expression in virtually all brain vessels after stroke compared to occasional vessel expressing ICAM-1 in sham-operated animals.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0165">Mice subjected to permanent MCAO for 1 hour or sham-operated animals were injected in the tail vein with 50 microgram of anti-ICAM-1 sdAb labeled with Cy5.5 fluorophore and then imaged at 3 h, 5 h, and 6 h post-injection with time-domain optical imager MX2.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0166">After imaging, animals were perfused with heparinized saline and 10% formalin, and sectioned using vibrotome into 25 micron thick sections. Sections were histochemically stained with the Tomato Lectin-FITC (1:100; 30 min) to identify brain vessels. The anti-ICAM-1 sdAb signal was assessed by visualizing Cy5.5 in brain using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 fluorescent microscope (Carl Zeiss, Maple Groove, Minn., USA) in a near-infrared mode (a 660- to 680-nm excitation filter and a 700-nm longpass emission filter).</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0167"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> shows high and persistent fluorescence signal in the right side of the head ROI in animals subjected to permanent MCAO and injected with anti-ICAM-1 sdAb-Cy5.5. This indicates a) that the fluorescent probe does not reach left side of the brain where circulation was blocked by MCAO, and that it produces high signal in the rest of the brain indicative of high ICAM-1 expression in brain vessels after stroke shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> confirms the in vivo imaging observations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, in that in the brains imaged ex-vivo fluorescent signal from anti-ICAM-1sdAb-Cy5.5 probe is localized in the brain regions not affected by infarct (induced on the left side)).</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0168">To confirm the results and provide anatomical information on the ICAM-1 signal observed by optical fluorescence imaging, co-registration of optical imaging and microcomputed tomography of brain vessels was performed. To visualize the brain vessels and obtain anatomical information of the location of the signal originating from anti-ICAM-1 sdAb injection after MCAO, Microfil-enhanced X-ray micro-computed tomography was performed. Briefly, Micro-CT images were obtained by sacrificing mice with permanent MCAO and injected with anti-ICAM-1 sdAb for 6 hours, by intra cardiac perfusion of the blood with heparinized saline, followed by infusing a radiopaque silicone polymer as a blood pool contrast agent (Microfil MV-122, Flow Tech, Carver, Mass.), which was left to polymerize over-night, followed by fixing in 10% formalin. In preparation for scanning with micro-CT, the brains were removed from the skulls and mounted in 1% agar. Each image was acquired over 900 projection views through 360&#xb0; rotation and three-dimensional CT images were reconstructed with 27&#xd7;27&#xd7;27-&#x3bc;m<sup>3 </sup>voxels using a GE eXplore Locus Scanner (GE Healthcare Biosciences, London, ON) at 27 &#x3bc;m isotropic resolution. To co-Register injected ICAM-1-cy5.5 (optical imaging) and microfil perfused brain (microCT imaging), CT-Fusion volume was generated with the OptiView&#x2122; CT-Fusion software module (ART, Advanced Research Technologies Inc.) and exported in DICOM format for co-registration using AMIRA&#xae;, a 3D biomedical visualization software analysis tool from Visage Imaging&#x2122; (San Diego, Calif.). The co-registration technique employed by OptiView&#x2122; matches the X-ray fiducial markers that appear on microCT images with software markers that are inserted at pre-determined positions into the optical image volume slices. AMIRA&#xae; software was then used to co-register and visualize the optical and CT images.</p>
