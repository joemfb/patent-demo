<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The following description relates to a mobile terminal, and more particularly, to a mobile terminal and a method for securing applications and services that are executed in a mobile terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A software platform may refer to a system environment in which application programs can be executed. Open platforms have been introduced to provide users with various beneficial services. The open platforms have provided a popular technology platform for various mobile communication terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, software developers may develop applications that may be provided or uploaded to a software vendor site, such as an application store, according to an open platform specification. Accordingly, various users may access the web site to download and install applications of choice at a low cost or for free, to receive the corresponding services.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, while such an open service environment may provide users with various services, the open service environment may provide a possibility of leakage of personal information, virus infection, and fatal system errors by malicious applications or applications with malware (e.g., spyware, virus, add-on applications, and the like).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">That is, since an application, whether valid or malicious, can call an open platform Application Programming Interface (API), leakage of user's personal information and abnormal charges may be incurred. For example, if a user installs an application, which the user knows to provide only an alarm operation, the application may call, when it is used or after it is installed, a platform API that can access the user's phonebook, acquire the user's phonebook through the platform API, and then call a platform API that allows use of a network so that the user's phonebook may be hacked.</p>

Accordingly, the determining module B may determine whether the call command has to be executed.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Additional information may be transferred by transmitting/receiving parameters or files.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">A method for transferring additional information by transmitting/receiving parameters has been described above, and a method for transmitting additional information by transmitting/receiving files is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Intent intent=new Intent(Intent.ACTION_CALL, Uri.fromParts(&#x201c;tel&#x201d;, phoneNumber, null));</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">If a command Intent.ACTION_CALL is called, a corresponding value is recorded in a corresponding file, and then execution of the command Intent.ACTION_CALL may be requested.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">For example, if parameter value 0x50505050 is a corresponding parameter value to a VoiceCallExtra command, which may be transferred to a CommandExtraInfo.text file, an application may record the parameter value of 0x50505050 in the respective file in response to the corresponding command being called. Further, the determining module B may determine whether the extracted parameter value of 0x50505050 corresponds to the parameter value of the VoiceCallExtra command of the promised file CommandExtraInfo.text before the called command is executed, and determine whether the command has to be executed. Thereafter, the determining module B may initialize the parameter value of the VoiceCallExtra command for later use.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">As such, in the case where execution of a command is determined based on additional information, a command from an application that does not include corresponding additional information may not be executed. Accordingly, security based on additional information may be provided. In this case, since the additional information may be information corresponding between an internal application installed by a manufacturing company and a determining module, the additional information may be used to increase reliability of applications installed by the manufacturing company and to provide a service blocking operation against unauthorized applications or unauthorized operation of the applications.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an operation of a determining module C according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention.</p>

If the corresponding command is an internal command, the determining module C transfers the command execution request to the service unit <b>220</b> so that the service unit <b>220</b> executes the command (<b>530</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">If the corresponding command is an external command, the determining module C transfers the command execution request to the blocking unit <b>260</b> so that the blocking unit <b>260</b> blocks the command execution request (<b>540</b>).

<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The process described above will be described in more detail, below.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">A call command on an Android platform may be Intent.ACTION_CALL. If the call command Intent.ACTION_CALL is an open command, the call command Intent.ACTION_CALL can be used in various applications. Accordingly, an internal command Intent.ACTION_CALL_INTERNAL may be promised or arranged between applications provided by a system, a framework, and the determining module C, and the internal command Intent.ACTION_CALL_INTERNAL may not be accessible from the outside. If an arbitrary application requests execution of a command using Intent.ACTION_CALL, instead of Intent.ACTION_CALL_INTERNAL, the command execution request may be blocked.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">If an application makes an access request using an Intent.ACTION_CALL_INTERNAL command, access may be granted since the Intent.ACTION_CALL_INTERNAL command may be a promised or arranged command.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Since the internal command may refer to information promised or arranged is between applications installed by a manufacturing company, a framework, and determining modules, the internal command may be used to ensure reliability of applications installed by the manufacturing company and to provide a service blocking operation against third party or unauthorized applications.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an operation of the determining module D according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, if the determining module D receives a command execution request, the determining module D requests an activity manager to send an ActivityManager.RunningServiceInfo command (<b>610</b>). The determining module D determines whether an application called through the command execution request is displayed on the foreground or foregrounded on a screen (<b>620</b>). If execution of a command calling an application is requested and the application called through the command request is not foregrounded on a screen, it may be determined that the corresponding command has not been requested by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">If the application is foregrounded on the screen, the determining module D determines that the execution of the corresponding command calling that application is allowed, and transfers the command execution request to the service unit <b>220</b> so that the service unit <b>220</b> executes the command (<b>630</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">If the application is not foregrounded on the screen, the determining module D determines that the command is a command that tries to make an abnormal access, and transfers the command execution request to the blocking unit <b>260</b>. Since a command execution request from an application that is not foregrounded on the screen has a possibility that the command execution request has not been intended by a user, security against such a request may be provided through the process described above.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an operation of the determining module E according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">A command execution request may generally be issued or initiated through an input (e.g., a touch, a pressure on a specific key, an input through an ear-jack, an input through Bluetooth&#xae;, and the like) from an input device. However, such a command execution request may be manipulated by a hacking attack or unauthorized actions by a malicious program. Accordingly, a method for determining and executing commands generated from an authorized input device. In the case of the Android&#xae; platform, information inputted through an input device is transferred to InputDispatcher.cpp, and the InputDispatcher.cpp transfers the information to a system framework. If the input information is transferred from InputDispatcher.cpp to the system framework, information about the input device may be transferred to the determining module E. The information about the input device may be transferred to the determining module E using a file or queue. A command execution request may be received in a reference time period after an input is generated from an input device. The determining module E may determine a command execution request received through a virtual input and not through a real input device, as an abnormal command execution request, and block the command execution request. A time of a final input received through an input device may be stored in the corresponding module.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the determining module E (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) detects, if the determining module E receives a command execution request (<b>710</b>), a time of a final input or an input through an input device (<b>720</b>). Then, the determining module E determines whether a difference between the final input time and a time at which the corresponding command is actually inputted exceeds a reference threshold value (<b>730</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">If the difference is smaller than or equal to the reference threshold value, the determining module E transfers the command execution request to the service unit <b>220</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">If the difference exceeds the reference threshold value, the determining module E transfers the command execution request to the blocking unit <b>260</b> to limit the command execution request.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In this way, the determining module E may distinguish inputs received through physical input devices from virtually manipulated input information.</p>

The determining module F determines whether a service corresponding to the command execution request is a service determined to be blocked based on the blocking management information (<b>830</b>). In an example, blocking management information may refer to a list of various commands, applications, services, and/or APIs that are set to be authorized or unauthorized. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, services related to voice call, multimedia, GPS, Email, and WIFI are authorized to be executed, whereas SMS and 3G DATA services are not.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">If the corresponding service is a service that is determined to be blocked, the determining module F transfers the command execution request to the blocking unit <b>260</b> (<b>840</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">If the corresponding service is not a service determined to be blocked, the is determining module F transfers the command execution request to the service unit <b>220</b> (<b>850</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">For example, if a voice call operation is set to an operation to be blocked by the setting application, the determining module A, the determining module B, the determining module C, the determining module D, and the determining module E of the determining unit operate as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The determining module A may disable API and the remaining commands with the exception of an ACTION_CALL command in the execution command management table, and manages the ACTION_CALL command. In this case, normal operations of the mobile communication terminal (e.g., SMS, GPS, 3G data, and the like) may operate regardless of the blocking operation. The determining module B may process no additional information with respect to the API and the remaining commands except for the ACTION_CALL command as described above. The determining module C may process internal and external commands without distinguishing them, with respect to the API and the remaining commands except for the ACTION_CALL. The determining module C may block the ACTION_CALL command and normally processes ACTION_CALL_INTERNAL command.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In the case of the determining module D, the remaining commands except for the ACTION_CALL command and an API execution request operate regardless of whether a requested application is currently foregrounded on a screen. The determining module D processes the ACTION_CALL command so that no external command operates and the ACTION_CALL_INTERNAL command, which is an internal command, operates normally. The determining module E may operate regardless of a setting application of the determining module F.</p>
