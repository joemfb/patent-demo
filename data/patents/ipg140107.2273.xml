<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to traditional Chinese medicinal compositions for treating depression, formulation thereof, method for preparing the same and application thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Depression disorder is one of the most common mental disorders in the human beings. The research by World Health Organization (WHO) indicates that the incidence of depression in the world is about 3.1%. In western developed countries, the incidence of lifelong depression ranged from 6% to 8%. Along with the gradual aging of the population, the incidence of depression in the population of more than 60 years old would be as high as 20%-50%. It was predicted that the incidence of depression in these countries would rise to about 8%-10% in 2005. It was indicated in <i>World Health Report, </i>2002 issued by WHO that depression had been the fourth severest disease in the world, and would become the second severest disease next to heart attack in 2020 (ZHU Ziqing et al, Key of Diagnosis and Treatment for Depressive Disorder, Phoenix Science Press, 2003, p 2-3).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The pathogenesis of depression is very complex, and the occurrence of depression may relate to nerve functional unbalance of monoamine-type neurotransmitters in brain. The hypotheses of noradrenalin and 5-hydroxytryptamine are widely applied to the biological pathogenesis of depression (J I Jianlin et al, Analysis of Somatic Symptoms of Depression and Relative Factors, Chinese Mental Health Journal, 2002, 16(9):605-608).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">At present, depression is treated with medication, psychotherapy, electroshock therapy and the like, and medication is still the primary means. The long-term administration of the western medicine&#x2014;antidepressant may result in adverse reactions in nerve system, anticholinergic, cardiovascular aspects. Although novel antidepressants (e.g. SSRI, NaSSA, SNRI and the like) have better safety and tolerance, many patients cannot afford the treatment, especially the long-term treatment due to their higher price, so that the patients' compliance is decreased and the treatment is affected.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The treatment of emotional diseases with traditional Chinese medicine has a history of about 2000 years. The clinical manifestations of depression indicate that the disease may be categorized into Syndrome of Melancholia (Yu zheng), Hysteria (Zangzao), Lily Disease (Baihebing), Insomnia and the like in traditional Chinese medicine. The diagnosis and treatment of this disease should follow the same for &#x201c;Syndrome of Melancholia (Yuzheng)&#x201d; in traditional Chinese medicine. In recent years, some traditional Chinese medical formulae are applied in the treatment of depression and proved to have good therapeutic effects. Moreover, many studies demonstrate that the traditional Chinese medicinal formulation may improve the behaviors of animal models for depression and be favorable to the central nerve transmitters. Under the concept of wholism, treatment of depression with traditional Chinese medicine is based on overall analysis of symptoms and signs, the cause, nature and location of the illness and the patient's physical condition according to the basic theories of traditional Chinese medicine, which has definite and sustainable therapeutic effects, safety, and better patient's compliance, especially is adaptable to patients suffering from minor or moderate depression with the adjustment of life styles. The traditional Chinese medicine is safe, effective and economical, which also satisfies the requirements for therapeutic effect on patients suffering from depression. (YANG Shiyou et al, Effects of Jie Bai You Oral liquor on Behaviours of Rat Models for Depression and the Central Nerve Transmitters, Chinese Journal of Basic Medicine in Traditional Chinese Medicine, 2000, 6(11):56-59).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine and Zhang Zhong-jing's (a famous doctor in Eastern Han Dynasty of China) academic ideology on the treatment of emotional diseases, the inventor profoundly studies how emotions lead to depression, and emphasizes the fact that such emotional factors as depression, gloominess, sadness or over-worry will lead to liver failing to maintain the normal flow of Qi, dysfunction of the spleen in transport and heart-spirit support loss, so as to render multi-entrails functional disorder. The inventor also points out that stagnation of liver-Qi leads to stagnant-fire, which influences to the body fluid and further leads to sputum, thus results in the pathogenesis of Qi stagnation, sputum accumulation, and fire disturbance. With clinical experiences of medication for the treatment of mental and neurological diseases, the inventor contrives a traditional Chinese medicinal composition to effectively alleviate of mental depression and relieve restlessness, and provides a novel traditional Chinese medicine formulation of the present invention, which has excellent therapeutic effects and is safe for patients suffering from depression. Up to now, there is no report relevant to the traditional Chinese medicinal composition of the present invention and the formulation thereof.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As seen from the clinical manifestations, depression may be categorized Syndrome of Melancholia (Yuzheng), Hysteria (Zangzao), Lily Disease (Baihebing), Insomnia and the like in traditional Chinese medicine. It is characterized as Syndrome of Stagnation of Qi and Accumulation of Phlegm, Internal Disturbance of Stagnated Fire, and has one or more mental symptoms selected from low spirits, sentimental, annoyed, restlessness, insomnia and trance, etc., and somatic symptoms selected from oppressed feeling in chest, pharyngeal trouble, liable to sighing, anorexia, abdominal distention and constipation, etc. According to &#x201c;Syndrome of Stagnation of Qi (Yuzheng)&#x201d; in traditional Chinese medicine, this syndrome should be determined and treated based on pathogenesis obtained through differentiation of symptoms and signs. Severe life events and environment-stressful events are the depression-inducing factors. Due to a hurt to emotions, such as depression, gloominess, sadness or over-worry, etc., liver fails to maintain the normal flow of Qi, and dysfunction of the spleen in transport and heart-spirit support loss are rendered, so as to render a disorder of entrails, Yin and Yang, Qi and blood, which has close relations with liver, heart and spleen.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Liver has the function of smoothing and regulating flow of Qi and Blood, and prefers free activity in nature. If the function of liver is normal, Qi and blood will be mild and the spirit will be cheerful. If emotional disorder occurs, liver fails to maintain the normal flow of Qi, and the functional activity of Qi is not smooth, so as to render stagnation of liver-Qi, which appears to be mental depression, oppressed feeling in chest and liable to sighing. Spleen has the function of transporting and transforming nutrients, and thinking and ideas are related to the spleen. If liver may not sufficiently smooth and regulate flow of Qi and Blood, it fails to dredge the spleen; if transverse invasion of hyperactiver liver-Qi occurs, liver has hyperfunction, which may affect the functioning of spleen, so as to result in dysfunction of the spleen in transport, anorexia, abdominal distention and constipation. If there lacks source of generating Qi and blood, or there is over-worry, heart-spirit losses support, which appears to be loss of spirit, low spirits, palpitation and insomnia and susceptible to fright and fear. If Qi flows freely, then the body fluid is promoted to circulation; if Qi flows freely then emotional depression may be relieved. Stagnation of Qi renders the body fluid to accumulate to phlegm; if phlegm and Qi are accumulated in the throat, globus hystericus will be caused. If phlegm confuses the mind, mental activity is inhibited so as to result in trance, hypomnesia and attention deficit disorder. Fire-syndrome resulting from stasis and heat trouble will render upsetting. The heart takes charge of mental activities. Dysfunction of mental activities will result in sentimental, annoyed and restlessness.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The primary task of the traditional Chinese medicinal composition of the present invention is to relieve restlessness and alleviate depression. On the basis of bitter, acrid, cool, moist, and unobstructed conditions, the therapeutic principles of clearing hot, removing restlessness, promoting Qi and eliminating sputum are applied. Lysis of accumulative heat in chest and diaphragm will relieve restlessness; and the regulation of Qi and the dredging of stasis will relieve the sensation of fullness, so as to achieve peaceful mind and normal mental activities.

<p id="h-0031" num="0000">(I) Effects of Capsules of the Present Invention on Behaviour and Body Temperature of Mice of Reserpine Depression Model</p>
<p id="h-0032" num="0000">(1) Capsules of the present invention notably antagonize ptosis and akinesia of mice of reserpine depression model.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0091">1. Method: ICR male mice (SPF-grade, having a body weight of 17-20 g) were stochastically divided into seven groups according to the body weight, and the administration dosages can be found in Table 1. The animals in the groups of administration with a drug were administered by gavage for 22 consecutive days. The normal control group and the reserpine control group were administered by gavage with isovolumetric distilled water (0.2 ml/10 g body weight). 2 mg/kg body weight of reserpine was administered by intraperitoneal injection on the 22<sup>nd </sup>day. After 1 h, 2 h and 6 h of injection of reserpine, animals were placed on a bracket and under observation for 15 s to record the number of animals that closed the eyelids (wherein &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; represents open eyelids; &#x201c;&#xb1;&#x201d; represents semi-open eyelids; and &#x201c;+&#x201d; represents close eyelids). Rank sum test was used to compare the difference in eyelids closing between reserpine control group and other groups, and the results can be found in Tables 1, 2 and 3. At 2 h, 4 h, and 6 h after the administration of reserpine, animals were placed at the center of a piece of circular white paper with a diameter of 7.5 cm and under observation for 15 s to record the number of animals that still remained within the circle in 15 s. Then &#x3c7;<sup>2 </sup>(Fisher's Exact Test) was used for the statistical comparison (XU Shuyun, Pharmacology Research Methodology, 3rd Edition, Beijing, p 807 and p 809). The results are shown in Tables 4, 5 and 6.</p>

<p id="p-0076" num="0095">From Tables 1, 2 and 3, in the 5.0 g/kg body weight dosage group, the administration of capsules of the present invention for consecutive 22 days can notably antagonize ptosis caused at 1-6 h after the intraperitoneal (ip) administration of 2 mg/kg body weight of reserpine (as compared with the reserpine model group, p&#x3c;0.05 or p&#x3c;0.01). The minimum effective dosage of capsules of the present invention for antagonizing reserpine-induced ptosis is 2.50 g/kg body weight, and the effect is positively related to the dosage. Both positive control drugs, i.e. fluose fine hydrochloride in a dosage of 14 mg/kg body weight and amitriptyline in a dosage of 50 mg/kg body weight, are antagonistic against reserpine-induced ptosis (P&#x3c;0.01).</p>

<p id="p-0080" num="0099">From Tables 4, 5 and 6, for the 2.5-5.0 g/kg body weight dosage groups, the administration of capsule soup of the present invention for 22 consecutive days can notably antagonize akinesia caused at 4 h after intraperitoneal injection of 2 mg/kg body weight of reserpine, and remarkably increase the number of excircle animals (P&#x3c;0.05). The positive control drugs, i.e. fluose fine hydrochloride in a dosage of 14 mg/kg body weight and amitriptyline in a dosage of 50 mg/kg body weight, can notably increase the &#x201c;excircle&#x201d; rate of reserpine mice (P&#x3c;0.05 or P&#x3c;0.01).</p>

<p id="p-0081" num="0100">1. Method: ICR male mice (SPF-grade, having a body weight of 18-22 g) were stochastically divided into seven groups according to the body weight, and the dosages administrated are shown in Table 7. The animals in the groups of administration with a drug were administered for 22 consecutive days, and the basal body temperature (rectal temperature) of the animals was measured before administration on the 22<sup>nd </sup>day. During the administration, 2 mg/kg body weight of reserpine was administered by intraperitoneal injection. The rectal temperatures were measured at 6 h and 24 h after the administration of reserpine. The difference values of body temperature before and after administration and the difference values of their own body temperatures were calculated so as to conduct the statistical comparison by single factor analysis of variance (H. G Vogel &#x26; W. H. Vogel, Drug Discovery and Evaluation &#x25a1;Guidance for Pharmacological Assays, translated by D U Guanhua et al, [M] Beijing: Science Press, 2001.409,412).

<p id="p-0084" num="0103">Tables 7 and 8 indicate that for the 2.5-5.0 g/kg body weight group, the administration of the soup of the capsule of the present invention for 22 consecutive days can notably antagonize the fall in body temperature caused at 6 h and 24 h after intraperitoneal injection of 2 mg/kg body weight of reserpine (as compared with reserpine model group, P&#x3c;0.05 and P&#x3c;0.001). The minimum effective dose is 2.5 g/kg body weight. Both positive control drugs, i.e. fluose fine hydrochloride in a dosage of 14 mg/kg body weight and amitriptyline in a dosage of 50 mg/kg body weight, can notably antagonize the fall in body temperature of mice caused by reserpine (as compared with reserpine model group, P&#x3c;0.01)</p>

The animals in the groups of administration with a drug were administered by gavage for 25 consecutive days. The normal control group and reserpine control group were administered with isovolumetric distilled water. On the 23<sup>rd </sup>day of the test, 1 mg/kg body weight of reserpine was ip administered for each group except the normal control group, and each group receiving reserpine was administered once more. At 1 hour after the last administration of reserpine, the heads of mice were cut off and the brain tissues were taken out, frozen with dry ice and preserved at &#x2212;20&#x25a1;. The content of noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the cerebellar tissue homogenate was measured respectively by means of fluorophotometry.

(1) Treatment of Brain Tissue of Mice and Homogenization
</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0108">At the end of the test, the heads of mice were rapidly cut off and the brain tissues were immediately taken out, promptly frozen with dry ice and moved into a refrigerator having a temperature of &#x2212;20&#x25a1;. The tissue was defreezed before homogenization. The cerebellum, medulla oblongata and olfactory bulb were removed, and then 300 mg brain tissue was weighed with a analytical balance. Then 10 times amount by volume of acidic n-butanol (prepared by saturating 100 ml re-steamed n-butanol with NaCl, and mixing with 0.85 ml strong hydrochloric acid) were added into the brain tissue for homogenization.</p>
<p id="h-0036" num="0000">(2) Extraction of NA, DA and 5-HT</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0109">The brain tissue homogenate was centrifugated (2,000 rpm) for 5 min. Then 2.5 ml supernatant was taken out and placed in centrifuge tube with a plug containing 1 ml 0.1N HC1 and 5 ml n-heptane. The centrifuge tube was placed on the KS vibrator, oscillated for 5 min and centrifugated (2,500 rpm) for 5 min. 6 to ml upper organic phase was placed into the tube having a plug and containing 0.6 ml 0.033 M NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>so as to extract 5-HIAA. Then 0.5 ml and 0.4 ml were respectively taken out from the lower aqueous phase, wherein the former was used to measure NA and DA, and the latter was used to measure 5-HT.</p>

<p id="p-0094" num="0113">Table 10 above indicates that for 1.25-5.0 g/kg body weight dosage group, the administration of capsules of the present invention via gavage for 25 consecutive days can notably increase the level of 5-HT in the brain tissue of mice. (as compared with the normal control group, P&#x3c;0.05, or P&#x3c;0.01), and the effect is positively related to the dosage. The positive control drugs, i.e. amitriptyline and fluose fine hydrochloride, can also notably increase the level of 5-HT in the brain tissue (as compared with the normal control group, P&#x3c;0.01). For the 1.25 g/kg body weight dosage group of administration of capsules of the present invention, the level of NA and DA was notably increased in the brain tissue. The positive control drugs, i.e. amitriptyline and fluose fine hydrochloride, can also increase the level of NA and DA in the brain tissue (as compared with the normal control group, P&#x3c;0.01).</p>
<p id="h-0037" num="0000">(IV) Effects of Capsules of the Present Invention on Shaking-Head Behavior Induced by 5-hydroxytryptophane (5-HTP)</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0114">1. Principle: according to the monoamine hypothesis on the occurrence of depression, the function of antidepressant lies in that it can enhance the functions of the noradrenergic and/or serotonergic nerve. A great variety of antidepressant may enhance the effect of 5-HT by blocking the reuptake of 5-HT. 5-HTP may be used as a precursor of 5-HT, and monoamine oxidase inhibitor&#x2014;pargyline hydrochloride may inhibit the enzymatic degradation thereof. The characteristic symptom&#x2014;shaking-head behavior is obvious on mice. The enhancement of shaking-head behavior of mice after administration of the test drug may be used as an evidence to the fact that the inhibition of 5-HT uptaking function is the anti-depression mechanism.
<br/>
2. Method: ICR male mice (20&#xb1;1 g) were stochastically divided into seven groups according to the body weight, and each group comprises 12 animals. The groups and administration doses are shown in Table 14. The animals in the groups of administration with a drug were consecutively administered by gavage for 21 days. On the 21<sup>St </sup>day of the test, each group were administered with 75 mg/kg body weight of pargyline hydrochloride by subcutaneous injection, and timing was started. Except the normal control group, other groups were administered with 20 mg/kg body weight of 5-HTP by intraperitoneal injection 90 min after injection of pargyline; and the times of shaking-head behavior were recorded in the following 10 minutes. The data were then statistically compared by single factor analysis of variance, and the results are shown in Table 11.

<p id="h-0040" num="0000">1. Method:</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0117">ICR female mice having a body weight of 18-22 g were stochastically divided into six groups according to the body weight. Before test, the temperature of the aqueous thermostat was controlled at 56&#xb1;0.5&#x25a1;. One mouse was placed on the hot plate each time, and the time of licking postpedes was defined as the pain threshold of said mouse. The mice which licked postpedes for less than 5 s or more than 30 s or jumped were abandoned. The normal pain thresholds were measured again. The average value of two normal pain thresholds was used as the pain threshold of the mouse before administration. The selected mice were used for the test and stochastically divided into six groups, including the group of 10 g/kg body weight capsules of the present invention, the group of 5 g/kg body weight capsules of the present invention, the group of 2.5 g/kg body weight capsules of the present invention, the group of 1.25 g/kg body weight capsules of the present invention, the aspirin group (0.33 g/kg body weigh), and the normal control group (administered with isovolumetric normal saline). There were 22 mice in the normal control group, and there were 11 mice in each of other groups. Six groups of mice were consecutively administered by gavage for 3 days, and postpedes licking was timed at 1 h, 3 h and 5 h after the last administration by gavage. The data were verified between the groups by single factor analysis of variance, and the results are shown in Table 12.</p>

Method: ICR mice having a body weight of 18-22 g, half male and half female, were randomly divided into five groups according to the body weight, including the group of 5 g/kg body weight capsules of the present invention, the group of 2.5 g/kg body weight capsules of the present invention, the group of 1.25 g/kg body weight capsules of the present invention, the aspirin group (0.33 g/kg body weigh), and the normal control group (administered with isovolumetric normal saline). There were 19 mice in the normal control group, and there were 10-11 mice in each of other groups. The animals in the groups of administration with a drug were consecutively administered for 3 days by gavage. Except the normal control group, each mouse in other groups was administered by intraperitoneal injection with 0.1 ml/10 g body weight 0.6% glacial acetic acid at 1 h after the final administration. Then the times of stretching caused by glacial acetic acid during 15 minutes after injection were recorded. The test data were statistically processed according to the T verification between the groups, and the results are shown in Table 13.</p>

<p id="p-0106" num="0125">Table 14 above indicates that the dosages of 1.25-5.0 g/kg body weight capsules of the present invention have no synergistic effects with sodium pentobarbital (P&#x3e;0.05).</p>
<p id="h-0043" num="0000">Research Conclusion</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0126">Currently, reserpine depression model is not only the most widely selected and classical animal model in China, but also the simplest and practicable method for selecting drugs against depression. Reserpine results in insufficient content of the neurotransmitter&#x2014;5-HT or disfunction thereof, so that the function of NA is weakened and the cholinergic nerve system takes advantage. Animals show the behavious such as ptosis, the fall of body temperature, stiffness and the like, and physiological changes. The aforesaid research results show that the capsules of the present invention can not only alleviate said symptoms, but can also notably adjust the function of monoamine neurotransmitters of central nerves system. The groups of administration with 1.25 g/kg body weight, 2.5 g/kg body weight and 5.0 g/kg body weight capsules of the present invention can all notably antagonize the decrease of NA content in the brain tissue of mice of reserpine depression model, and increase DA level. 2.5 g/kg body weight group can also notably antagonize the decrease of 5-HT content in the brain tissue of mice of reserpine depression model. In the measurement of monoamine neurotransmitters in the brain of the normal mice, the capsules of the present invention at 1.25 g/kg body weight, 2.5 g/kg body weight and 5.0 g/kg body weight dosages can all increase the 5-HT level in the brain tissue of mice, and the effect is positively related to the dosage. In addition, the dosage of 1.25 g/kg body weight capsules of the present invention can also notably increase the NA and DA level in the brain tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0127">The aforesaid results provide a pharmacological basis for the treatment of depression with the traditional Chinese medicinal composition according to the invention. Not to be bound by theories, the capsules of the present invention can bring out the anti-depression effect by adjusting the level of monoamine neurotransmitters (NA, DA, 5-HT) in the central nerves.</p>
