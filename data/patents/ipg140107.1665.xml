<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates to a method for reducing the effects of drag force when using a driver.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The prior art discloses various designs to reduce the drag force to improve driver performance.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The prior art fails to provide a driver with designs that efficiently reduce drag forces and consequentially enable the driver to be swung faster along its path and contribute to an improved impact event with the golf ball.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The United States Golf Association (USGA) has increasingly limited the performance innovations of golf clubs, particularly drivers. Recently, the USGA has limited the volume, dimensions of the head, such as length, width, and height, face compliance, inertia of driver heads and overall club length. Current methods previously used to improve the performance of a driver have been curtailed by limitations on design parameters set by the USGA. An area of driver performance improvement that exists, as of this date, is the potential to reduce the drag force that opposes the driver's travel through the air during its path to the golf ball on the tee. A reduction in drag force would allow the driver club head to travel faster along its path and contribute to an improved impact event with the golf ball, resulting in higher golf ball velocities and consequentially, in longer golf shots.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The purpose of this invention is to effectively incorporate several design features in the river club head that will enable lower drag coefficients as the driver is swung by a golfer. The design features will reduce drag forces and consequently allow the driver to be swung faster than conventional driver designs that currently exist. By improving the drag coefficients of the crown and sole surfaces and lowering the overall drag forces that impede the driver club head from moving faster through the air, the head speed of the driver is increased by approximately 1 to 3 mph.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The recent past has shown that driver designs have trended to include characteristics to increase the driver's inertia values to help off-center hits go farther and straighter. Driver designs have also recently included larger faces, which may help the driver deliver better feeling shots as well as shots that have higher ball speeds if hit away from the face center. However, these recent trends may also be detrimental to the driver's performance due to the head speed reductions that these design features introduce due to the larger geometries. The design of the present invention allows for higher inertias and robust face design of current drivers in addition to a driver design that will lower the drag forces on the club head and improve drag coefficients on the face, sole, and crown surfaces.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The main objective of the present invention is to improve the aspect ratio of the driver club head and to improve driver club head crown surface design. To improve the aspect ration of the driver club head, a driver is created which has an increased depth, distance from the face to the most rearward point, while reducing the overall height. This design will improve air flow over the face and crown of the driver and minimize the overall projected area of the club head in the direction of the air flow. Improvements the driver club head crown surface design include creating a driver having a crown surface that is flatter, less curvature, while combining it with an apex point location that is further away from the face to promote a more preferred air flow over the club head.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">One aspect of the golf club head of the present invention is a driver type golf club head comprising a body having a face, a crown and a sole, wherein the highest point of the crown surface is located within a crown apex zone, and a portion of the crown contour existing above a radius arc of approximately 5.25 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Having briefly described the present invention, the above and further objects, features and advantages thereof will be recognized by those skilled in the pertinent art from the following detailed description of the invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present invention relates to the design relationships and methods of measurement comprising the improved aspect ratio of the driver golf club head <b>20</b> and the improved driver golf club head <b>20</b> crown <b>26</b> surface design. To verify the existence of conforming or non-conforming geometries of a driver club head <b>20</b>, a method of measurement has been developed called the, &#x201c;Largest Tangent Circle Method (LTCM)&#x201d; <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A driver type golf club head <b>20</b> of the present invention comprises a body <b>22</b> having a face <b>30</b>, a crown <b>26</b> and a sole <b>28</b>, wherein the highest point, or apex point <b>46</b>, of the crown <b>26</b> surface is located within a crown apex zone <b>42</b>, and a portion of the crown <b>26</b> contour exists above a radius arc of approximately 5.25 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Preferably, the driver type golf club head <b>20</b> has a volume of less than 400 cubic centimeters. In one embodiment, the sole <b>28</b> is composed of a metal material and the crown <b>26</b> is composed of a non-metal material. Preferably, the body <b>22</b> is composed of a stainless steel material. Alternatively, the body <b>22</b> is composed of a titanium alloy material.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The LTCM <b>50</b> orientation is achieved by bringing the golf dub head <b>20</b> into a Cartesian Coordinate System (CCS) space where three perpendicular planes exist. The point at which all three planes intersect each other is called the origin point. The resulting lines of intersection of the three planes with each other are perpendicular lines representing the CCS, with each line or axis being labeled appropriately X, Y, and Z and pass through the origin point. The values on either side of the origin of the X, Y, and Z axis are labeled either positive or negative, as defined and understood in the CCS.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The driver golf club head <b>20</b> is oriented in such a manner such that the hosel axis line <b>32</b> lies in the YZ plane and passes through the origin point of the CCS.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The driver golf club head <b>20</b> is further oriented such that the hosel axis line <b>32</b> of the golf club head <b>20</b> lies at an angle equal to its designed lie angle from the &#x2212;Y axis rotating around the origin point towards the +Z axis, using the right-hand rule with the thumb pointing in the &#x2212;X direction.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the golf club head <b>20</b> is further oriented by pivoting it around the hosel axis line <b>32</b> until a point or edge on the sole <b>28</b> is tangent to a plane parallel with the XY plane that has the greatest intersection point value on the Z axis.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In this embodiment, when the golf club head <b>20</b> is viewed along the X axis, the crown silhouette curve <b>34</b> and the sole silhouette curve <b>36</b> are projected onto a measurement plane parallel to the YZ plane. A circle <b>38</b> is placed on the measurement plane between the projected crown silhouette curve <b>34</b> and the projected sole silhouette curve <b>36</b> and is enlarged until the circle <b>38</b> has the maximum diameter possible, preferably to the nearest 0.001 inch, and is tangent to both the projected crown silhouette curve <b>34</b> and the projected sole silhouette curve <b>36</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a tangent line <b>40</b> is created from the tangent point where the circle touches the projected crown silhouette curve <b>34</b> to the tangent point where the circle touches the projected sole silhouette curve <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a cross sectional curve <b>44</b>, of the golf club head <b>20</b> is obtained by orienting a plane though the tangent line <b>40</b> connecting the tangent points and rotating the plane through the tangent line <b>40</b> so the cross section curve <b>44</b> is created with the XY plane that is parallel with the X axis of the CCS.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the created and oriented plane is used to intersect the golf club head <b>20</b> to obtain 2D cross-sectional views showing the crown <b>26</b> contour of the driver type golf club head <b>20</b>. An area encompassed by a rectangle having a preferred height of 0.25 inch and a preferred length of 1.00 inch, is positioned approximately 0.030 inch above, in the +Z direction, and 0.800 inch to the right, in the +X direction, of the uppermost intersection curve with the face <b>30</b> of the golf club head <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The rectangular area is an important zone for the crown <b>26</b> surface of the golf club head <b>20</b> to have its highest point, apex. It is further away from the face <b>30</b> of the golf club head <b>20</b>, in the +X direction, and relatively not too high above the upper edge of the face <b>30</b>, in the +Y direction. When the apex of the crown <b>26</b> surface falls within this zone, the airflow moving across the crown <b>26</b> surface of the golf club head <b>20</b> has been shown to remain laminar and reduce the drag of the driver type golf club head <b>20</b>. In addition to the design of the crown <b>26</b> surface with the apex point <b>46</b> in the rectangular zone, the flatness of the crown <b>26</b> contour and the depth of the golf club head <b>20</b> aid in reducing the drag of the club head <b>20</b>. It has been shown by Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) studies that the flatter the crown <b>26</b> portion of the club head <b>20</b>, the longer the airflow across the crown <b>26</b> stays attached to the crown <b>26</b> without separating and becoming turbulent. Also, the longer the air can travel along the crown <b>26</b> before separating, promotes lower drag forces are promoted.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The new methods used to improve aerodynamic properties of a driver golf club head <b>20</b> involve the relationship that the apex point <b>46</b> on the crown <b>26</b> surface of a dub head <b>20</b> has with other geometric features on the club head <b>20</b>, such as its depth, height and curvature of the crown <b>26</b> surface. The present invention comprises two methods of enhancing the swing characteristics of a driver club head <b>20</b> by reducing the drag force.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Method #1). Improved Aspect Ratio of Driver Club Head.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The method of the present invention involves creating a driver type golf club head <b>20</b> that has an increased depth, distance from the face <b>30</b> to the most rearward point, while reducing its height. This improves air flow over the face <b>30</b> and crown <b>26</b> of the driver type golf club head <b>20</b>, which minimizes the overall projected area of the dub head <b>20</b> in the direction of the airflow.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Method #2). Improved Driver Club Head Crown Surface Design.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">An alternative method of the present invention involves creating a driver type golf club head <b>20</b> having a crown <b>26</b> surface that is flatter, combined with an apex point <b>46</b> location that is further away from the face <b>30</b> to promote a more preferred air flow over the club head <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Driver type golf club heads <b>20</b> created using the methods discussed enable the golfer to benefit from an improved driver <b>20</b> design more suited to hitting shots with higher ball velocities due to the increased head speed produced by lower drag forces opposing the driver <b>20</b> as it travels through the air.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The feature of a flatter crown <b>26</b> surface reduces the drag of the air flow over the crown <b>26</b> in a more favorable manner if the of the crown <b>26</b> is within the crown apex zone <b>42</b> and the crown <b>26</b> surface does not drop off too rapidly. When the apex point <b>46</b> is positioned in the crown apex zone <b>42</b>, and a flatter crown <b>26</b> curvature continues rearward, in the +X direction, the drag coefficients over the crown <b>26</b> surface are reduced resulting in lower drag forces. In addition, the longer the air flow can stay attached to the surface of the crown <b>26</b>, without becoming separated, the lower the drag forces that are generated. Thus, club head <b>20</b> depths greater than 4.600 inches are preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In conjunction with reducing the drag coefficient of the crown <b>26</b> surface, the projected area of the golf club head <b>20</b> is also reduced. The projected area is a variable in the drag equation, and the lower the area, the better opportunity exists to lower the overall drag of the club head <b>20</b>. By using a club height, h, that is less than half the depth, d, of the club head <b>20</b>, a projected area shape that is lower overall area and shallower aspect ratio is achieved in comparison to projected area shapes of drivers with deeper club heights. This minimizes the displacement of air molecules as they pass over and around the club head <b>20</b>. For example if an air molecule hits the center of a driver club <b>20</b> face <b>20</b>, the distance it has to travel up the face <b>20</b> and around the club head <b>20</b> is less if the face <b>30</b> height is shallower versus the distance it must travel on deeper face <b>30</b> driver <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the apex of the crown <b>26</b> is located in the rectangular zone, or crown apex zone <b>42</b>, and the depth, d, of the club head <b>20</b> must be at least twice the length as the height, h, of the club head <b>20</b> as measured in the plane defined by the LTCM method <b>50</b>. The minimum depth, d, of the club head <b>20</b> must be equal or greater than 4.600 inch.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, using the cross-section of a driver club head <b>20</b> derived using the LTCM method with apex of the crow located within the crown apex zone <b>42</b>, the crown <b>26</b> curve is designed to have some portion exist above a 5.25 inch radius arc that begins at the apex point <b>46</b> of the crown <b>26</b> curve and runs towards the back end of the club head <b>20</b>, in the +X direction.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In a preferred embodiment, a driver type golf club head <b>20</b> formed using the method of the present invention comprises a body <b>22</b> having a face <b>30</b>, a crown <b>26</b> and a sole <b>28</b>, wherein the crown <b>26</b> is located in a crown apex zone <b>42</b>. The club head <b>20</b> has a depth, d, the depth being at least twice the length as a height of the club head, wherein the depth is at least 4.600 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The driver type golf club head <b>20</b> preferably has a volume of less than 400 cubic centimeters. The body <b>22</b> is preferably composed of a stainless steel material. The sole <b>28</b> is preferably composed of a metal material and the crown <b>26</b> is preferably composed of a non-metal material. The body <b>22</b> is alternatively composed of a titanium alloy material.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">For comparison purposes, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7-9</figref> show golf club heads in the prior art, wherein the design features do not comply with the parameters set forth in the method of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the apex of the crown is located within the desired crown apex zone <b>42</b>, the height is more than 50% of the depth. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a golf club head of the prior art wherein the apex point <b>46</b> of the crown does not lie within the crown apex zone <b>42</b>.
