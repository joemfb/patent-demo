<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to a navigation system, and more particularly to a system for a navigation system with traffic estimation mechanism.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Modern portable consumer and industrial electronics provide increasing levels of functionality to support modern life including location-based services. This is especially true for client devices such as navigation systems, cellular phones, portable digital assistants, and multifunction devices.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The navigation systems generally provide a recommended route from a starting point to a desired destination. Generally, the starting point and the desired destination are selected from a large database of roads stored in a mass media storage, such as a compact disc read-only memory (CD ROM) or a hard drive, which includes roads of an area to be traveled by a user. The navigation systems can also notify waypoints or times along the route.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As users adopt mobile location-based service devices, new and old usage begin to take advantage of this new device space. Navigation system and service providers are continually making improvement in the notification to enhance the user's experience in order to be competitive.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, a need still remains for a navigation system with traffic estimation mechanism for increasing levels of functionality. In view of ease of use, it is increasingly critical that answers be found to these problems. In view of the ever-increasing commercial competitive pressures, along with growing consumer expectations and the diminishing opportunities for meaningful product differentiation in the marketplace, it is critical that answers be found for these problems. Additionally, the need to reduce costs, improve efficiencies and performance, and meet competitive pressures adds an even greater urgency to the critical necessity for finding answers to these problems.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Solutions to these problems have been long sought but prior developments have not taught or suggested any solutions and, thus, solutions to these problems have long eluded those skilled in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention provides a method of operation of a navigation system including: calculating a travel segment of a navigation route, the travel segment having a travel feature; estimating a base time for the travel segment; estimating an incremental time for the travel feature; and calculating a travel time with the base time and the incremental time for displaying on a device.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides a navigation system, including: a location unit for calculating a travel segment of a navigation route, the travel segment having a travel feature; a first storage unit, coupled to the location unit, for estimating a base time for the travel segment, the base time stored and accessed in the first storage unit; a second storage unit, coupled to the location unit, for estimating an incremental time for the travel feature, the incremental time stored and accessed in the second storage unit; and a control unit, coupled to the location unit, for calculating a travel time with the base time and the incremental time for displaying on a device.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Certain embodiments of the invention have other steps or elements in addition to or in place of those mentioned above. The steps or elements will become apparent to those skilled in the art from a reading of the following detailed description when taken with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The following embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to make and use the invention. It is to be understood that other embodiments would be evident based on the present disclosure, and that system, process, or mechanical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the following description, numerous specific details are given to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be apparent that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In order to avoid obscuring the present invention, some well-known circuits, system configurations, and process steps are not disclosed in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The drawings showing embodiments of the system are semi-diagrammatic and not to scale and, particularly, some of the dimensions are for the clarity of presentation and are shown exaggerated in the drawing FIGs. Similarly, although the views in the drawings for ease of description generally show similar orientations, this depiction in the FIGs. is arbitrary for the most part. Generally, the invention can be operated in any orientation. The embodiments have been numbered first embodiment, second embodiment, etc. as a matter of descriptive convenience and are not intended to have any other significance or provide limitations for the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">One skilled in the art would appreciate that the format with which navigation information is expressed is not critical to some embodiments of the invention. For example, in some embodiments, navigation information is presented in the format of (X, Y), where X and Y are two ordinates that define the geographic location, i.e., a position of a user.</p>

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The navigation route <b>206</b> can include the travel segments <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The travel segments <b>210</b> can be identified by a change in direction, a change of street names, a difference in road surfaces, or a change in speed limits, as examples. The travel segments <b>210</b> can be calculated based on routing configurations such as a desired arrival time, types of routes including fastest routes or shortest routes, waypoints, or any relevant information that can be used for route planning purposes.</p>

<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The navigation system <b>100</b> can include a time estimation polisher module <b>408</b> to not only calculate but also refine or improve the accuracy of a time of travel. The time estimation polisher module <b>408</b> can be coupled to or communicated with the route module <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The time estimation polisher module <b>408</b> can generate a base time <b>410</b>, which is defined as an estimated time it takes to travel the travel segments <b>210</b>. The base time <b>410</b> can be estimated for each of the travel segments <b>210</b> of the navigation route <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The base time <b>410</b> can be estimated based on road levels, which refer to conditions of roads. The base time <b>410</b> can also be estimated based on traffic conditions, speed limits, or average speeds of the travel segments <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The road levels can include road conditions such as road surfaces or road grades. The road surfaces refer to materials that are used to build roads. For example, the materials can include asphalt, concrete, gravel, any other road building materials, or a combination thereof. The road grades refer to gradients or inclinations of roads.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The time estimation polisher module <b>408</b> can improve the accuracy of the estimated time of travel by calculating an incremental time <b>412</b>, which is defined as a buffer or additional time predicted to be needed for the navigation route <b>206</b>. The incremental time <b>412</b> can include a duration that accounts for an additional time that travelers take when traveling along the navigation route <b>206</b>, excluding a period for rest, idle, allocated times to perform a task at a specified location, overnight stays, or planned or unscheduled maintenance.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The incremental time <b>412</b> can be estimated for travel features <b>414</b> of the travel segments <b>210</b>. The travel features <b>414</b> are features that affect or factor in a numerical value of an additional time that a vehicle driver has to wait. For example, the additional time can be a time segment that the vehicle driver has to wait at the stop sign <b>214</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which can be at one of the travel segments <b>210</b> that is on First Street between B Street and C Street.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The travel features <b>414</b> can include a turn type <b>416</b>, which is defined as a change in planar direction from the current heading. The turn type <b>416</b> can be specified by the driving direction instruction that guides travelers to change heading along the navigation route <b>206</b>. A change in the heading can be made at a location where one of the travel segments <b>210</b> ends and another of the travel segments <b>210</b> begins.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The turn type <b>416</b> can include a left turn, a right turn, a u-turn, a curve, or any other change from the current heading along the navigation route <b>206</b>. As an example, the turn type <b>416</b> can be a right turn at the intersection of First Street and C Street in the navigation map <b>204</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">For example, a left turn from one of the travel segments <b>210</b> to another of the travel segments <b>210</b> can typically take more time or have more possibility to wait than other turns. Also for example, a preset amount of time can be required to wait when pedestrians are crossing a street before making a right turn.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The travel features <b>414</b> can include a road type <b>418</b>, which is defined as a characteristic or a category of each of the travel segments <b>210</b>. For example, the road type <b>418</b> can be categorized based on sizes according to a number of lanes, a speed limit, a number of stop lights, a school zone, or an amount of traffic for a given condition, such as a time of day, a day of week, or a calendar day.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The road type <b>418</b> can be based on a number of driving lanes of each of the travel segments <b>210</b>. The road type <b>418</b> can be based on types of roads, such as freeways, highways, streets, or any other ways for travel.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As an example, First Street and Second Street in the navigation map <b>204</b> can have two lanes in each direction and A Street, B Street, and C Street in the navigation map <b>204</b> can have 1 lane in each direction. Since numbers of driving lanes of First Street and Second Street can be larger than those of A Street, B Street, and C Street, the road type <b>418</b> of First Street and Second Street can be different from that of A Street, B Street, and C Street.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">A difference between the road type <b>418</b> and another of the road type <b>418</b> at an intersection can affect the calculation of the incremental time <b>412</b>. For example, less time is required to wait at the traffic light <b>212</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> at the intersection of First Street and B Street when traveling on First Street, compared to the time required to wait when traveling on B Street. The time difference can be based on First Street having the road type <b>418</b> larger than another of the road type <b>418</b> of B Street, resulting in the traffic light <b>212</b> controlling all four directions of the intersection with a preference for the larger street.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The travel features <b>414</b> can include a traffic control <b>420</b>, which is defined as a visual indicator that is used to control movement of vehicles. The traffic control <b>420</b> can include a structure that displays a driving direction, a driving rule, or a traffic message related to laws or regulations for travelers to comply to. The traffic control <b>420</b> can include the traffic light <b>212</b>, the stop sign <b>214</b>, the yield sign <b>216</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, or any other visual indicators for guiding vehicles to control the flow of traffic.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The travel features <b>414</b> can include a time of day <b>422</b>, which is defined as a time when the navigation route <b>206</b> is planned to be traveled. The time of day <b>422</b> can be associated with day, night, carpool hours, or any time segment. For example, the time of day <b>422</b> can affect the calculation of the incremental time <b>412</b> because the traffic control <b>420</b> can be associated with different rules depending on the time of day.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The travel features <b>414</b> can include a calendar day <b>424</b>, which is defined as a day of a week or a date of a year. The calendar day <b>424</b> can include a workday, a weekend day, or a holiday. The calendar day <b>424</b> can affect the calculation of the incremental time <b>412</b> because traffic conditions during workdays can be typically less congested than those during weekend days.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The incremental time <b>412</b> can be estimated based on the travel features <b>414</b> by assigning a numerical value to each of the travel features <b>414</b>. The numerical value of each of the travel features <b>414</b> can be updated or adjusted with a numerical value that depends on a weight, which is a relative importance of each of the travel features <b>414</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The relative importance means a criticality or an impact of one of the travel features <b>414</b> compared to another of the travel features <b>414</b> in the calculation of the incremental time <b>412</b> for a given condition, such as a time of day, a day of week, or a calendar day. For example, the numerical value of the yield sign <b>216</b> can be updated with a predetermined numerical value that is large on workdays or during traffic hours or with another predetermined numerical value that is small on weekend days.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The numerical value can be adjusted by statistics or probability. For example, a numerical value of one of the travel features <b>414</b> can be adjusted to a large predetermined numerical value if the probability of having to wait at the yield sign <b>216</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to yield to pedestrians is likely high on holidays in or near a populated area.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Also for example, if the driving direction instructions for the navigation route <b>206</b> include the travel segments <b>210</b> with highways, the effect of the traffic light <b>212</b> at one of the travel segments <b>210</b> on the calculation of the incremental time <b>412</b> is small. Thus, a numerical value of the traffic control <b>420</b> can be assigned to a small predetermined numerical value.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Further, for example, if the driving direction instructions for the navigation route <b>206</b> include the travel segments <b>210</b> having roads with a number of the traffic control <b>420</b>, there can be a significant impact (e.g. up to 50%) to the result of the estimation of the incremental time <b>412</b>. Thus, a numerical value of the traffic control <b>420</b> can be assigned to a large predetermined numerical value.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The time estimation polisher module <b>408</b> can generate a travel time <b>428</b>, which is defined as an estimated duration of travel when the navigation route <b>206</b> is taken. The travel time <b>428</b> can be calculated with a sum or an accumulation of the base time <b>410</b> and the incremental time <b>412</b>. The travel time <b>428</b> can be calculated by adding the base time <b>410</b> and the incremental time <b>412</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The time estimation polisher module <b>408</b> can be implemented with the navigation system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.

<p id="p-0118" num="0117">For example, the first control unit <b>312</b> and the first storage unit <b>314</b> can be used to estimate the base time <b>410</b> for the travel segments <b>210</b>, with the base time <b>410</b> stored and accessed in the first storage unit <b>314</b>. Also for example, the second control unit <b>334</b> and the second storage unit <b>346</b> can be used to estimate the incremental time <b>412</b> based on the travel features <b>414</b>, with the incremental time <b>412</b> stored and accessed in the second storage unit <b>346</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Further, for example, the first control unit <b>312</b> can be used to calculate the travel time <b>428</b> with the base time <b>410</b> and the incremental time <b>412</b> for displaying on the first device <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Yet further, for example, the first control unit <b>312</b> can be used to estimate the incremental time <b>412</b> based on the turn type <b>416</b>, the road type <b>418</b>, the traffic control <b>420</b>, the traffic light <b>212</b>, the stop sign <b>214</b>, the yield sign <b>216</b>, the time of day <b>422</b>, or the calendar day <b>424</b>, or to calculate the travel time <b>428</b> with the sum of the base time <b>410</b> and the incremental time <b>412</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The navigation system <b>100</b> can include a feature controller module <b>430</b>, which provides numerical values that are associated with the travel features <b>414</b>. The feature controller module <b>430</b> can be coupled to or communicated with the time estimation polisher module <b>408</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">For example, one of the numerical values associated with the travel features <b>414</b> can be a numerical value of the traffic control <b>420</b> that specifies how long a vehicle driver has to wait to yield to pedestrians at the yield sign <b>216</b>. Also for example, another of the numerical values associated with the travel features <b>414</b> can be a numerical value that is used as the weight by the time estimation polisher module <b>408</b> to adjust the numerical value of the traffic control <b>420</b> for the given condition.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The feature controller module <b>430</b> can generate the numerical values using offline data mining to help improve the accuracy of the results of the calculation of the incremental time <b>412</b>. The accuracy can be improved using the offline data mining to collect and extract patterns from navigation data related to the travel features <b>414</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The navigation data collected and extracted can be used to determine average time costs for calculating the numerical values of the travel features <b>414</b>. The navigation data can also be used to calculate average probability rates for adjusting the numerical values.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The navigation data can be historical data, which are results of previous time estimations. The historical data can include actual values that have been used for calculation of the base time <b>410</b>, the incremental time <b>412</b>, the travel time <b>428</b>, or the numerical values of the travel features <b>414</b>. The actual values can be stored or accessed in a storage unit for future time estimation purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The feature controller module <b>430</b> can control estimation rules <b>432</b> used by the time estimation polisher module <b>408</b>. The estimation rules <b>432</b> define conditions that are used by the time estimation polisher module <b>408</b> to calculate the incremental time <b>412</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The estimation rules <b>432</b> can be created by the feature controller module <b>430</b> according to a sample set of the user's historical real time traffic information. The sample set includes actual numerical values of past wait times of the travel segments <b>210</b>. For example, the sample set can include an actual numerical value of the incremental time <b>412</b> that the vehicle driver had to wait at the traffic light <b>212</b> the intersection of First Street and B Street when traveling along First Street.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Accuracy of the estimation rules <b>432</b> can be improved. The feature controller module <b>430</b> can increase a number of the estimation rules <b>432</b> with additional specified conditions to improve the accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The additional specified conditions can be compared to those of the travel segments <b>210</b> by the time estimation polisher module <b>408</b>. The additional specified conditions that have a high possibility of matching the travel segments <b>210</b> during the user's navigation session have similar scenarios as those of the sample set, resulting in an improved accuracy. For example, the additional specified conditions can include the time of day <b>422</b> or the calendar day <b>424</b> because traffic during peak or rush hours of a day can introduce longer wait times at intersections compared to traffic during non-peak hours at the intersections.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The feature controller module <b>430</b> can improve the accuracy by increasing a number of the sample set. The number of the sample set can be increased based on sampled navigation data from a number of users. For example, most of the time, an average numerical value of the incremental time <b>412</b> based on 100 users can be more meaningful and accurate compared to that of another of the incremental time <b>412</b> based on 10 users.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The feature controller module <b>430</b> can also improve the accuracy by updating the navigation data. The navigation data can be updated by replacing old numerical values of the navigation data with new numerical values of the navigation data. The navigation data can be updated according to a calendar year. For example, the navigation data sampled based on a year ago can be better and more accurate than another of the navigation data sampled based on 10 years ago.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The time estimation polisher module <b>408</b> can find a best matched rule among the estimation rules <b>432</b> according to conditions of each of the travel segments <b>210</b> to calculate and return the incremental time <b>412</b>. The time estimation polisher module <b>408</b> can use the estimation rules <b>432</b> to compare and calculate the incremental time <b>412</b> for each of the travel segments <b>210</b> in each direction. Each of the estimation rules <b>432</b> that are used to calculate an average numerical value of the incremental time <b>412</b> can be associated with the conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The conditions can be associated with the travel features <b>414</b>, which can include the turn type <b>416</b>, the road type <b>418</b>, the traffic control <b>420</b>, the time of day <b>422</b>, and the calendar day <b>424</b>. For example, less time is required to wait at the traffic light <b>212</b> at the intersection of First Street with a 50 miles-per-hour speed limit and B Street with a 35 miles-per-hour speed limit when traveling on First Street, compared to the time required to wait before turning left when traveling on B Street.</p>
