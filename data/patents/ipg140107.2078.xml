<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention pertains to a method for manufacturing components from composite fiber materials, a system for manufacturing components from composite fiber materials, a molding tool for the manufacture of components from composite fiber materials, a use, as well as an aircraft comprising components that were manufactured with the method according to the invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the manufacture of components from fiber-reinforced plastics by means of molding tools&#x2014;whether male or female molding tools&#x2014;it is unlikely for the component to separate from the molding tools by itself after the hardening process. It is therefore necessary to carry out a manual component removal. The term &#x201c;component removal&#x201d; refers to the removal of the hardened component from the mold. According to the current state of the art, this is realized by lifting the component on the component edge by means of wedge tools, wherein these wedge tools may consist, for example, of wood or a soft plastic such as, for example, polytetrafluoroethylene.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">With larger components, it is furthermore required to &#x201c;readjust&#x201d; the wedge tools before the component completely separates from the mold. Particularly with large-surface shell components, for example, in the form of wings, aircraft fuselage shells, solar panels and the like, the wedge tools needs to be driven very far in the direction of the component center before the component ultimately separates from the mold.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">If the molding tools are insufficiently or incorrectly coated with a releasing agent and the component has very large dimensions with inferior accessibility, it may be necessary to utilize other mechanical devices with a greater leverage effect for separating the component. The manual use of such mechanical devices may also be required if the component geometry sectionally comprises a slight undercut.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">DE 198 54 735 A shows a bushing made of thermally deformable as well as a method for producing the such. The bushing consists of a substantially pipe-shaped base body with a cylindrical outer circumference with a substantially constant radius and an inner cylindrical circumference that is tapered in axial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">DE 756 995 shows a pressing mold for processing curable compressed laminated material, from which mold the pressed component is removable by means of compressed air.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Molding tools with so-called &#x201c;sliding inserts&#x201d; cannot be used for components with high surface requirements such as, e.g., aerodynamic surfaces or functional surfaces of an aircraft that are subject to strict tolerances. The reasons for this are, for example, the facts that the wedge tools may be outlined on the component surface, that so-called &#x201c;lugs&#x201d; may be created in the matrix material and that it is difficult to produce a seal against resin during the component hardening.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, it may be the object of the invention to propose a method for manufacturing components from composite fiber materials that diminishes or entirely eliminates at least a few of the above-described disadvantages. An object may consist, in particular, of proposing a method of this type, in which large-surface components can also be carefully removed from a mold without damaging a component surface, creating projections or generally subjecting the component to excessive mechanical loads.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">This object may be met with a method for manufacturing components from composite fiber materials, a system for manufacturing components from composite fiber materials, a molding tool for manufacturing components from composite fiber materials, a use of such a tool, as well as an aircraft comprising a component according to the independent claims. Different exemplary embodiments of the present invention are described in the dependent claims.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to one important aspect of the method to the invention, a component molded by laying and laminating fiber material in a molding tool and subsequently hardening the component is not removed from the molding tool by means of wedge tools or other tools that significantly intervene mechanically, but rather with inflatable lifting pads. Accordingly, the invention is characterized in that a much more controllable removal method is used. Due to the use, for example, of pneumatically controlled lifting pads, the force or the path during the removal can be controlled such that a largely careful separation of the component from the molding tool is ensured.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a first concept of the method according to the invention, a molding tool is used that comprises a recess for a lifting pad on the future component edge. In order to preserve the surface, a placeholder is inserted into this recess before laying and laminating the component in the molding tool, wherein said placeholder completely fills out the recess and ends flush with the surface of the molding tool. In this case, the placeholder may consist of one part or be realized in the form of a multipart laminate.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Depending on the surface requirements of the component, the recess should lie in a region outside the actual component, namely in a so-called &#x201c;trimming region.&#x201d; The component to be manufactured extends into this trimming region that lies outside the desired final shape. After hardening and removing the component from the molding tool, the component can be trimmed to its final shape within the trimming region. This is particularly sensible because it cannot be guaranteed that the recess actually ends flush with the surface of the molding tool such that no edge, no bend and no slight undulation can be detected in the resulting component when the recess is filled with a placeholder. Since the trimming region does not remain on the component in any case, a slight shape deviation in this region is not critical.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The recess in the molding tool preferably extends outward from the trimming region such that an overlap exists between the trimming region and the recess. This makes it possible to remove the placeholder from the recess once the component has been laid, laminated and hardened.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As soon as the component is present in the molding tool in its unfinished state&#x2014;i.e., not yet trimmed to its final shape and also referred to as &#x201c;unfinished component&#x201d; below&#x2014;the placeholder can be removed such that a cavity with an outward opening is created underneath a section of the trimming region. A lifting pad that consists of an elastic material and is expanded by being filled with compressed air or another suitable medium can be inserted into this opening. In comparison with known wedge tools, this results in a very large-surface force application such that no punctiform, one-sided load application, local bending or other load peaks are created. The force application is well defined such that the limits with respect to the mechanical stability, e.g., a predetermined elastic line, are not exceeded due to the removal from the mold, particularly with thin-shell, large-surface components or component sections. This results in a reduction of visible or invisible damages to the composite fiber material such that elaborate additional inspection steps for ensuring the integrity of, in particular, safety-relevant components can also be reduced. In this way, the costs directly associated with the manufacture of the component are lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The final removal of a larger component can be ensured by subsequently inserting and inflating other lifting pads. Once the first lifting pad has been sufficiently inflated in the recess in order to slightly lift the component out of the molding tool, another lifting pad can be inserted into the additional hollow space or intermediate space created underneath the component.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A maximum permissible elastic line of the component can be calculated from the component dimensions. This elastic line is not exceeded due to corresponding dimensions of the lifting pad. A system for manufacturing components from composite fiber materials preferably may comprise an automatic control of several lifting pads with a correspondingly programmed computer unit or another electronic apparatus that controls and monitors the component removal process.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Depending on the component geometry and the respective requirements, it would be possible to use lifting pads with especially shaped geometries. This promotes the removal, in particular, of components with slight undercuts.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In component regions, in which an opening is produced or a geometric region is removed in another manufacturing step, lifting pads of temperature-resistant materials can already be used prior to the lamination of the component. In this case, it needs to be ensured that the molding tool is provided with a preinstalled connection for the medium to be supplied into the integrated lifting pad, and that the lifting pad is placed into the molding tool in such a way that no resin can pass between the molding tool and the lifting pad. Such preinstalled lifting pads that are distributed over the surface of the component to be manufactured would make it possible to implement a fully automated component removal in a series production process. A central control on the molding tool may control and inflate the lifting pads such that the component is removed as carefully as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In addition to open molding tool concepts with male or female molding tools, the method according to the invention may also be used in connection with closed tool concepts such as, e.g., in resin injection methods (&#x201c;Resin Transfer-Molding,&#x201d; RTM). In this case, the size of the lifting pads may be reduced such that they form knob-like lifting pads or lifting knobs. The component may be completely removed in a largely automated fashion, namely in the sense of a series production, by controlling several smaller integrated lifting knobs.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">All in all, the method according to the invention for manufacturing components from composite fiber materials provides a few advantages in comparison with known manufacturing methods, in which the components are conventionally removed in a manual fashion. For example, the path and the force during the removal process may be controlled such that unnecessary bending stress on the component may be prevented. Likewise, the risk of damaging the component during the removal is also reduced because a predefined maximum elastic line can be observed. In this way, the number of repairs required on components damaged during the removal process is reduced. Highly critical components such as, for example, solar cell panels of satellites can be carefully removed from the mold with the proposed method, in particular, because no punctiform load application occurs during the removal process. The surface load during the removal process can be adapted to special component geometries with the concrete design of the lifting pad. An automation is possible in order to save costs and time. If the component to be removed is very rigid or very stiff, the method according to the invention also makes it possible to apply significantly higher forces than currently known manual removal processes. If the lifting pads are connected in parallel, it is ultimately also possible to simultaneously lift several component regions such that the local bending stresses are reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The object of the invention is also met by a molding tool for manufacturing components from composite fiber materials that comprises at least one recess, into which a lifting pad can be inserted underneath the component to be manufactured, within a trimming region. The object is furthermore attained with a use of such a molding tool, as well as an aircraft that comprises at least one component manufactured with the method according to the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>shows a first concept of the manufacturing method according to the invention. In this exemplary embodiment, the method according to the invention begins with the step of inserting <b>2</b> placeholders into the corresponding recesses of the molding tool. Subsequently, the step of producing <b>4</b> the unfinished component is carried out. This step usually consists of the individual processes laying, laminating and hardening, however, without claiming completeness and correctness of the sequence in this respect. The state of the art contains numerous different procedures for the production of an unfinished component from composite fiber materials such as, for example, the manual laying of fibers, manual laminating and subsequent hardening, as well as mechanized laying and resin injection methods.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The placeholders are removed <b>6</b> after the unfinished component has been produced. As already mentioned in the introduction to the description, a recess is situated in the molding tool underneath a trimming region after removing <b>6</b> the space holders. A lifting pad may be inserted <b>8</b> into this recess and subsequently inflated <b>10</b>. The inflation <b>10</b> should preferably take place in a controlled fashion such that excessive bending loads on the component can be prevented. It is particularly preferred to inflate <b>10</b> the lifting pads incrementally and to subsequently insert <b>12</b> and likewise inflate <b>10</b> additional lifting pads in the thusly created intermediate spaces between the component and the molding tool. Due to this successive procedure, the component is carefully removed from the molding tool.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A second exemplary embodiment of the method according to the invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>. The method according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>may be carried out alternatively or additionally to the method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>. For example, larger components can be regionally manufactured by using the method according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>and in other regions by utilizing the method according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, e.g., if openings occur only in a region of the component.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In this case, lifting pads are already inserted <b>8</b> prior to the production of the unfinished component <b>4</b>, for example, into regions of the molding tool, in which opening geometries or other geometry interruptions are produced. This means that the lifting pad or the lifting pads lie in regions, in which no surface subsequently exists, such that possible bends, folds, undulations or the like are irrelevant. In this context, it is particularly important that the inserted lifting pads have a temperature resistance that makes it possible to introduce the lifting pad into a hardening device between the component and the molding tool. The hardening process may be carried out, for example, at a temperature that lies slightly below 200&#xb0; C. such that the lifting pads for the method according to the invention, according to the second exemplary embodiment need to have a correspondingly high temperature resistance. It furthermore needs to be observed that the molding tool comprises connections for a medium to be supplied to the lifting pad such as, for example, compressed air connections.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">After the production of the unfinished component <b>4</b>, the lifting pads are inflated <b>10</b>, wherein additional lifting pads are subsequently inserted <b>12</b> into the intermediate spaces or hollow spaces created between the component and the molding tool and subsequently also inflated <b>10</b>. In this way, the successive lifting process by means of inflated lifting pads described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>is also realized in this case.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows one potential system according to the invention for manufacturing a component from composite fiber materials <b>14</b>, wherein said system comprises a fluid source in the form of a compressor <b>16</b> that is connected to lifting pads <b>20</b> via valves <b>18</b>. Individual lifting pads or a combination of the lifting pads <b>20</b> shown can be selectively inflated by adjusting the flow resistance or the like of the individual valves <b>18</b>. The illustration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> should be interpreted in an exemplary fashion, wherein any number of lifting pads <b>20</b> or the lifting knobs mentioned in the introduction to the description may be utilized, namely in dependence on the size of the component to be manufactured, its complexity, undercuts or the like. In order to achieve the most effective component protection possible, it would be conceivable to utilize a computer unit <b>22</b> that monitors and controls the entire component removal process. For example, the computer unit <b>22</b> may control the inflation of the individual lifting pads <b>20</b> independently of one another in order to automatically prevent the predetermined maximum elastic line of the component from being exceeded.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an exemplary molding tool <b>24</b> that comprises, for example, a recess <b>26</b> for inserting a lifting pad <b>20</b>. It should be clear to a person skilled in the art that the molding tool <b>24</b> may comprise a significantly larger number of recesses <b>26</b>. The region <b>28</b> illustrated with broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> represents the so-called trimming region, into which the component being manufactured extends, wherein this trimming region is trimmed after the component has hardened in order to provide the component with its final shape. It is obvious that a lifting pad can be inserted into the recess <b>26</b> when a component still lies flush on the surface <b>30</b> of the molding tool <b>24</b>. Part of the component can separate from the surface <b>30</b> of the molding tool <b>24</b> in the region of the recess <b>26</b> when a lifting pad is inflated within the recess <b>26</b> such that other lifting pads can be inserted between the surface <b>30</b> of the molding tool <b>24</b> and the component.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an examplary aircraft <b>32</b> with several components <b>34</b> that were manufactured with the method according to the invention, on the molding tool <b>24</b> according to the invention and by the use of a system <b>14</b> according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It should be noted that &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; does not exclude other elements or steps, and that &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; does not exclude a plurality.</p>
