<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Descriptions will be hereinbelow provided for the embodiment while referring to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Descriptions will be hereinbelow provided for a nonvolatile semiconductor memory device according to the embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view showing a nonvolatile semiconductor memory device according to the embodiment. The descriptions will be provided by use of a XYZ-coordinate system. The X direction is a direction from the front to the back of the sheet on which the drawing is depicted. The Y direction is a direction from the right to the left of the sheet on which the drawing is depicted. The Z direction is a direction from the bottom to the top of the sheet on which the drawing is depicted. In the nonvolatile semiconductor memory device according to the embodiment, an impurity-diffused layer as a back gate is provided in an upper portion of a silicon substrate <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a back gate insulator <b>2</b> and a back gate conductor <b>3</b> are provided on the silicon substrate <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A stacked layer body <b>6</b> is provided on the back gate conductor <b>3</b>. The stacked layer body <b>6</b> is obtained by alternately stacking an insulator <b>4</b> and an electrode film <b>5</b> one on another. A silicon oxide film, for example, is used for each insulator <b>4</b>. A poly-crystalline silicon film, for example, is used for each electrode film <b>5</b>. Each electrode film <b>5</b> is used as a control gate electrode of a memory cell, which will be described later. Each insulator <b>4</b> has a function of insulating neighboring electrode films <b>5</b> across the insulator <b>4</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the stacked layer body <b>6</b> in which four insulators <b>4</b> and four electrode films <b>5</b> are stacked one on another alternately. However, the layered number is not limited to the above case. An isolation insulator <b>7</b> is provided on the stacked layer body <b>6</b>. A silicon oxide film, for example, is used for the isolation insulator <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A plurality of silicon pillars <b>81</b> extending virtually perpendicularly to the silicon substrate <b>1</b> are provided to be surrounded by the stacked layer body <b>6</b> and the isolation insulator <b>7</b>. In this respect, the silicon pillars <b>81</b> and a silicon connection portion <b>82</b>, which will be described later, jointly constitute a silicon film <b>8</b>. A poly-crystalline silicon film containing fluorine is used for the silicon film <b>8</b>. The silicon film <b>8</b> functions as a channel in the nonvolatile semiconductor memory device according to the embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Descriptions will be hereinbelow provided for a concentration of the fluorine contained in the poly-crystalline silicon. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram showing a resistivity of poly-crystalline silicon, in which a concentration of phosphorus is 4&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, against an atomic concentration of fluorine contained in the poly-crystalline silicon. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when the concentration of fluorine in the poly-crystalline silicon is equal to or greater than 2&#xd7;10<sup>19 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, the resistivity of the poly-crystalline silicon decreases because dangling bonds in grain boundaries of the poly-crystalline silicon are terminated by fluorine atoms. On the other hand, when the concentration of the fluorine in the poly-crystalline silicon is equal to or greater than 2&#xd7;10<sup>21 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, the resistivity increases because fluorine is present in the crystal grains of the poly-crystalline silicon. In this respect, when the concentration of fluorine in the silicon film <b>8</b> is converted to the atomic composition expressed in percentage, 2&#xd7;10<sup>19 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>is equivalent to 0.04%, and 2&#xd7;10<sup>21 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>is equivalent to 4%. In a case where the concentration of fluorine in the silicon film <b>8</b> is in a range of 2&#xd7;10<sup>19 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>to 2&#xd7;10<sup>21 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, namely 0.04% to 4%, the electron mobility increases in a channel, and the resistivity accordingly decreases. Incidentally, the concentration of fluorine in the embodiment is obtained by SIMS (Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry) using cesium ions.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the embodiment, the inclusion of fluorine with the above-mentioned concentration in the silicon film <b>8</b> reduces the trap density which is attributable to the dangling bonds in the grain boundaries in the poly-crystal of the silicon film <b>8</b> as the channel, and enhances the electron mobility in the channel. In a case where the cross-sectional area of the silicon pillars <b>81</b> becomes larger from a lower portion toward an upper portion, the number of fluorine atoms contained in the silicon pillars <b>81</b> may be larger in the uppermost portion of the silicon pillars <b>81</b> than in the lowermost portion of the silicon pillars <b>81</b>. Particularly, the number of fluorine atoms may become larger toward the upper portion of the silicon pillars <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The silicon pillars <b>81</b> are arrayed in a matrix at equal intervals on the XY plane. The shape of each silicon pillar <b>81</b> is a hollow conic shape, an elliptic conic shape, a hollow cylindrical shape or an elliptic cylindrical shape, for example. The cross-sectional shape of each silicon pillar viewed in the Z direction is a circular shape or an elliptic shape, for example. In a case where the cross-sectional shape of the silicon pillar <b>81</b> is a circular shape, the diameter of the hole is 70 nm, for example, while the height of the silicon pillar <b>81</b> is 2.1 &#x3bc;m, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The silicon connection portion <b>82</b> to connect lower end portions of the respective paired silicon pillars <b>81</b> together is provided in the back gate conductor <b>3</b>. The silicon connection portion <b>82</b> is made from poly-crystalline silicon containing fluorine, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A tunnel insulator <b>9</b> is provided on a surface of each silicon pillar <b>81</b> which faces to the stacked layer body <b>6</b>. A silicon oxide film, for example, is used for the tunnel insulator <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A charge storage layer <b>10</b> is provided on a surface of the tunnel insulator <b>9</b> which faces to the stacked layer body <b>6</b>. A silicon nitride film, for example, is used for the charge storage layer <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A block insulator <b>11</b> is provided on a surface of the charge storage layer <b>10</b> which faces to the stacked layer body <b>6</b>, and is in contact with the electrode films <b>5</b> and the insulators <b>4</b>. A silicon oxide film, for example, is used for the block insulator <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It should be noted that the films of the tunnel insulator <b>9</b>, the charge storage layer <b>10</b> and the block insulator <b>11</b> are provided to surround not only the silicon pillars <b>81</b> but also the silicon connection portion <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">An embedded portion <b>12</b> extending in the layered direction of the stacked layer body <b>6</b> is provided in each silicon pillar <b>81</b> of the silicon film <b>8</b>. It is desirable that the embedded portion <b>12</b> should be an insulating portion containing fluorine, for example. However, the embedded portion <b>12</b> does not necessarily have to contain fluorine. In the case where the embedded portion <b>12</b> is an insulating portion, the interface state density in the interface between the corresponding silicon pillar <b>81</b> and the embedded portion <b>12</b> can be reduced. For this reason, when no voltage is applied to the gate electrode, it is possible to inhibit the flow of an electric current into the channel. A silicon oxide film containing fluorine, for example, is used for the embedded portion <b>12</b>. Instead, the embedded portion <b>12</b> may be made of a film containing fluorine such as a silicon nitride film, a silicon oxynitride film, or a layered film of a silicon oxide film and a silicon nitride film.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Fluorine atoms are diffused from the embedded portions <b>12</b> into the poly-crystalline silicon in the silicon pillars <b>81</b> in contact with the embedded portions <b>12</b> and the silicon connection portion <b>82</b>, and terminate dangling bonds in the poly-crystalline silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a case where dangling bonds in the poly-crystal are present in the interface between the silicon film <b>8</b> and each embedded portion <b>12</b>, the electron mobility in the channel decreases. However, in the embodiment, the dangling bonds in the interface between the silicon film <b>8</b> and the embedded portion <b>12</b> are sufficiently terminated by using fluorine, because the embedded portion <b>12</b> contains fluorine during the film formation. This termination inhibits the decrease in the electron mobility in the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Each embedded portion <b>12</b> needs to contain fluorine during the film formation. On the other hand, the embedded portion <b>12</b> no longer has to contain fluorine after fluorine is diffused into the poly-crystalline silicon. The concentration of fluorine contained in the embedded portion <b>12</b> during the film formation is equal to or greater than 0.1%, for example, as the atomic composition expressed in percentage.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the BiCS structure shown in the embodiment, the area of the contact between the embedded portion <b>12</b> and the silicon pillar <b>81</b> is smaller than the area of the contact between the tunnel insulator <b>9</b> and the silicon pillar <b>81</b>. On the other hand, in a planar type nonvolatile semiconductor memory device formed on an SOI (silicon-on-insulator) substrate, an insulator is formed in the silicon substrate, while a tunnel insulator, a charge storage layer, a block insulator and an electrode film are formed on the silicon layer in the surface of the SOI substrate. Since the area of the contact between the tunnel insulator and the silicon substrate is almost equal to the area of the contact between the insulator in the SOI substrate and the silicon substrate, the BiCS structure can reduce the interface state in the interface between the embedded portion <b>12</b> and the silicon pillar <b>8</b> by using a smaller amount of fluorine than the conventional planar type nonvolatile semiconductor memory device. Thus, the BiCS structure is advantageous in that metal interconnections are less likely to corrode due to fluorine.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The shape of each embedded portion <b>12</b> is a conic shape, an elliptic conic shape, a cylindrical shape or an elliptic cylindrical shape, for example. The cross-sectional shape of the embedded portion <b>12</b> viewed in the Z direction is a circular shape or an elliptic shape, for example. The embedded portion <b>12</b> may be in a reverse tapered shape in which the cross-sectional area of the cross-sectional circle of the embedded portion <b>12</b> viewed in the Z direction becomes smaller toward the lowermost layer of the stacked layer body <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the case where the embedded portion <b>12</b> is in the reverse tapered shape, the embedded portion <b>12</b> has a larger cross-sectional area and accordingly contains a larger number of fluorine atoms toward the topmost layer of the stacked layer body <b>6</b>. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the poly-crystalline silicon film becomes more dominant toward the lowermost portion of the silicon pillar <b>81</b>. In the case where the volume of the silicon pillar <b>81</b> is larger in the upper portion than in the lower portion, the upper and lower portions of the silicon pillar <b>81</b> has a small difference in the number of fluorine atoms per unit volume. In other words, the electron mobility is equalized throughout the silicon pillar <b>81</b>, and the reliability of the nonvolatile semiconductor memory device can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Stacked films of memory protection insulators <b>13</b>, select gate electrodes <b>14</b> and insulation layers <b>15</b>, are sequentially provided on the isolation insulator <b>7</b>. Silicon films <b>16</b> are provided in the staked films to extend in a direction virtually perpendicular to the silicon substrate <b>1</b>, and are connected to the silicon film <b>8</b>. Gate insulators <b>17</b> are provided to surround the respective silicon films <b>16</b>. Incidentally, the silicon films <b>16</b> are made of a poly-crystalline silicon, and the poly-crystalline silicon may contain fluorine. The select gate electrodes <b>14</b> have plate-like shapes which extend in parallel to the X direction, and are formed to be electrically insulated and isolated from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The embodiment provides the nonvolatile semiconductor memory device having the three-dimensional structure with the silicon film <b>8</b> containing fluorine as the channel. Thereby, the embodiment can provide the nonvolatile semiconductor memory device which inhibits the decrease in the electron mobility.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Furthermore, the embodiment makes it possible to enhance the electron mobility in the channel, because the embodiment sufficiently terminates the dangling bonds in the interface between the silicon film <b>8</b> and the embedded portions <b>12</b> by use of fluorine.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Descriptions will be hereinbelow provided for a method of fabricating a nonvolatile semiconductor memory device according to the embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 6D</figref> are cross-sectional views showing the method of fabricating a nonvolatile semiconductor memory device according to the embodiment, which are taken along the YZ plane.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As the back gate, the impurity-diffused layer is formed in an upper portion of the silicon substrate <b>1</b> by ion-implantation. Subsequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the back gate insulator <b>2</b> and the back gate conductor <b>3</b> are formed on the silicon substrate <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, an opening portion <b>18</b> is formed by etching a part of the back gate conductor <b>3</b> using lithography and RIE (reactive ion etching). The opening portion <b>18</b> is provided for the purpose of forming the silicon connection portion <b>82</b>, to which the below-described paired silicon pillars <b>81</b> are connected. Incidentally the shape of the opening portion <b>18</b> viewed in the Z direction is a strip-like shape, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Afterward, as a sacrifice film, a SiN film is deposited and thereby embedded in the opening portion <b>18</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>. The SiN film above the back gate conductor <b>3</b> is removed by a CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing). Thereby, the sacrifice film <b>19</b> is formed in the opening portion <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, the stacked layer body <b>6</b> is formed by stacking the insulator <b>4</b> and the electrode film <b>5</b> alternately one after another on the back gate conductor <b>3</b> and the sacrifice film <b>19</b>. Subsequently, the isolation insulator <b>7</b> is formed on the stacked layer body <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">After that, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>, through holes <b>20</b> are formed to reach the two end portions of the sacrifice film <b>19</b>, by etching the isolation insulator <b>7</b> and the stacked layer body <b>6</b> by lithography and RIE until the etching reaches the sacrifice film <b>19</b>. Such through holes <b>20</b> are formed at equal intervals in a matrix in the XY plane.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Subsequently, as a sacrifice film, a SiN film is deposited and thereby embedded in each through hole <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4F</figref>. A sacrifice film <b>21</b> is formed in each through hole <b>20</b> by CMP.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the sacrifice film <b>19</b> and the sacrifice films <b>21</b> are removed by wet etching using a hot phosphoric acid solution, for example. Thereby, the two end portions of the now-defunct opening portion <b>18</b> respectively communicate with the paired through holes <b>20</b>, and an opening portion <b>22</b> shaped like the letter U is accordingly formed. The opening portion <b>22</b> is formed from the opening portion and the through holes <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the block insulator <b>11</b>, the charge storage layer <b>10</b> and the tunnel insulator <b>9</b> are sequentially formed in the entire inside of the opening portion <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Amorphous silicon <b>23</b> is formed on the tunnel insulator inside the opening portion <b>22</b>. In this process, the amorphous silicon <b>23</b> is not fully embedded in the opening portion <b>22</b>, and a space portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>is accordingly left.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Subsequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, the embedded portions <b>12</b> each extending in the layered direction of the stacked layer body <b>6</b>, to which fluorine is added, are formed on the inner surface of the amorphous silicon <b>23</b> in the stacked layer body <b>6</b>. Each embedded portion <b>12</b> is a silicon oxide film formed by plasma CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) in which a concentration of fluorine is 1%, for example. The silicon oxide film, to which fluorine is added, is formed by plasma CVD using a mixed gas of SiH<sub>4</sub>, SiF<sub>4 </sub>and N<sub>2</sub>O, for example. Incidentally, it is desirable that the concentration of fluorine needed to diffuse fluorine into the silicon film <b>8</b> should be not less than 0.1% but not greater than 10% as the atomic composition expressed in percentage. A silicon oxide film in which the concentration of fluorine is not less than 0.1% enhances the electron mobility in a transistor using poly-crystalline silicon. On the other hand, in a case where the concentration of fluorine is not less than 10%, it is difficult to form a silicon oxide film in which the electron mobility is equalized. In addition to the silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride film, a silicon oxynitride film, a layered film of a silicon oxide film and a silicon nitride film, or the like is used for the embedded portions <b>12</b>. Incidentally, the embedded portions may be formed as portions containing fluorine and embedded in through holes formed in the silicon pillars <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Subsequently, each embedded portion <b>12</b>, the amorphous silicon <b>23</b>, the block insulator <b>11</b>, the charge storage layer <b>10</b> and the tunnel insulator <b>9</b> protruding from the separation insulator <b>7</b> are removed by CMP, and thereby are flattened.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Thereafter, as the silicon film <b>8</b>, a poly-crystalline silicon film is formed by crystallizing the amorphous silicon <b>23</b> through a heat treatment at a temperature in a range of 600&#xb0; C. to 1250&#xb0;, for example, at a temperature of 900&#xb0; C. for one minute. During this step, the fluorine atoms in the embedded portions <b>12</b> are diffused into the poly-crystalline silicon film to form the silicon film <b>8</b> containing fluorine. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, portions of the silicon film <b>8</b>, which are formed in the respective through holes <b>20</b>, are termed as the silicon pillars <b>81</b>. A portion of the silicon film <b>8</b>, which is formed in the opening portion <b>18</b> so as to be connected to the silicon pillars <b>81</b>, is termed as the silicon connection portion <b>82</b>. The segregation of the diffused fluorine atoms in the grain boundaries in the poly-crystal causes fluorine to terminate the dangling bonds in the grain boundaries. Accordingly, the electron trap density can be reduced in the grain boundaries, and the electron mobility can be enhanced in the channel made of the poly-crystal, which is the silicon film <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Each embedded portion <b>12</b> extends in the Z direction, and the side surface of the embedded portion <b>12</b> is covered with the silicon film <b>8</b>. In other words, the entire side surface of the embedded portion <b>12</b> is in contact with the silicon film <b>8</b>. The structure mentioned above inhibits fluorine from diffusing into portions other than the silicon film <b>8</b>, and the fluorine efficiently diffuses from the embedded portion <b>12</b> into the silicon film <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Use of a silicon oxide film for the embedded portions facilitates the diffusion of fluorine atoms into the poly-crystalline silicon film serving as the silicon film <b>8</b>. For this reason, the heat treatment may be performed at a lower temperature. On the other hand, use of a silicon nitride film for the embedded portions <b>12</b> makes it more difficult to diffuse fluorine atoms. For this reason, the use of the silicon nitride film requires the heat treatment at a higher temperature than the use of the silicon oxide film. In this case, it is possible to make the electron mobility stable irrespective of the heat treatment step after the film formation of the embedded portions <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Afterward, as the memory protection insulator <b>13</b>, a silicon nitride film is formed above the stacked layer body <b>6</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>. After that, a memory isolation groove <b>24</b> extending in the X direction is formed between the silicon pillars <b>81</b>. Such memory isolation grooves <b>24</b> are provided at equal intervals in the XY plane. Subsequently, as the memory protection insulator <b>13</b>, a silicon nitride film is embedded in the memory isolation groove <b>24</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the select gate electrode <b>14</b> and the insulator layer <b>15</b> are formed. A poly-crystalline silicon film is used for the select gate electrode <b>14</b>, and a silicon oxide film, for example, is used for the insulator layer <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Afterward, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, through holes <b>25</b> are formed in portions of the stacked films above the silicon pillars <b>81</b> by lithography and RIE. The through holes <b>25</b> are formed to expose the respective silicon pillars <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Afterward, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>, the gate insulators <b>17</b> are formed on the inner surfaces of the through holes <b>25</b>, respectively. Furthermore, as the silicon films <b>16</b>, the poly-crystalline silicon film, for example, is embedded on the inner surfaces of the respective gate insulators <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Multiple mutually-isolated source lines SL extending in the X direction are formed, which are connected to the top portion of the silicon film <b>16</b> on one of the paired silicon pillars <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A plurality of mutually-isolated bit lines BL extending in the Y direction are formed, which are connected to the top portion of the silicon film <b>16</b> on the other one of the paired silicon pillars <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The nonvolatile semiconductor memory device according to the embodiment is formed through the foregoing steps.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As described above, fluorine is included in the silicon pillars <b>81</b> in the nonvolatile semiconductor memory device according to the embodiment. This structure reduces the electron trap density in the poly-crystal of the silicon film <b>8</b> serving as the channel, and accordingly enhances the electron mobility in the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In addition, in the case where fluorine is included in the silicon film <b>8</b> formed from the silicon pillars <b>81</b> and the silicon connection portion <b>82</b>, the electron trap density decreases in the poly-crystal of the silicon film <b>8</b> serving as the channel, and the electron mobility can be accordingly enhanced in the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Furthermore, in the method of fabricating a nonvolatile semiconductor memory device according to the embodiment, the fluorine-containing embedded portions <b>12</b> are formed in contact with the corresponding silicon pillars <b>81</b>, and fluorine atoms in the embedded portions <b>12</b> diffuse into the silicon pillars <b>81</b> or the silicon connection portion <b>82</b> through the heat treatment. Accordingly, it is possible to make fluorine atoms diffuse from the embedded portions <b>12</b> into the silicon pillars <b>81</b> or the silicon connection portion <b>82</b> not only in the front end but also continuously in the back end.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">It should be noted that, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> the fluorine-containing embedded portion <b>12</b> may be provided in the silicon connection portion <b>82</b> in the foregoing nonvolatile semiconductor memory device according to the embodiment. In this case, fluorine is supplied to the silicon connection portion <b>82</b> in the silicon film <b>8</b>. This further decreases the electron trap density in the silicon film <b>8</b>, and accordingly enhances the electron mobility in the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">It should be noted that, although the foregoing descriptions have been provided for the embodiment on the assumption that the lowermost ends of the silicon pillars <b>81</b> are connected together via the silicon connection portion <b>82</b>, the silicon pillars <b>81</b> may be instead provided independently of each other without being provided with the silicon connection portion <b>82</b>.</p>

Indeed, the novel embodiments described herein may be embodied in a variety of other forms; furthermore, various omissions, substitutions and changes in the form of the embodiments described herein may be made without departing from the spirit of the inventions.
