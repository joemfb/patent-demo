<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a switching power supply apparatus, such as a resonance-type power supply apparatus or a half-bridge-type power supply apparatus, for example, which outputs a predetermined voltage signal by causing a plurality of switching elements to be alternately turned on and off.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the past, various kinds of switching power supply apparatuses have been developed, each of which outputs a predetermined voltage signal by causing a plurality of switching elements to be alternately turned on and off. For example, in a switching power supply apparatus that utilizes a PWM method of a half-bridge-type converter, a time ratio is adjusted at a constant switching frequency, thereby obtaining a desired output voltage signal. However, in such a switching power supply apparatus in which a plurality of switching elements are alternately turned on and off, if there is a time period when a plurality of switching elements are simultaneously turned on, a large short-circuit current flows, and there is a possibility that the power supply apparatus will be destroyed. Therefore, a dead time is provided in which all of the plurality of switching elements are turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Since such a dead time is provided, a switching power supply apparatus disclosed in WO2005-076447 includes a first switching element and a second switching element that are alternately turned on and off, and the change of magnetic flux of a transformer due to the turning off of the first switching element is used as a trigger to turn on the second switching element. In addition, the change of magnetic flux of a transformer due to the turning off of the second switching element is used as a trigger to turn on the first switching element. By performing such switching control as described above, the first switching element and the second switching element are prevented from being simultaneously in an on state.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in the above-described switching power supply apparatus disclosed in WO2005-076447, since the on-time of the second switching element is determined by a time constant circuit including a resistor and a capacitor, a switching frequency varies and a switching noise occurs in a wide range in response to the variation of the switching frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, while the time constant circuit is designed to take into account the dead time, since a dead time having the same time length is set in a full load region, namely even in a transient state and a steady state, it is difficult to set an optimal dead time in the steady state in which a dead time as long as that in the transient state is not necessary. Accordingly, the above-described switching power supply apparatus is less than optimal in terms of efficiency but has a high degree of reliability.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To overcome the problems described above, preferred embodiments of the present invention provide a switching power supply apparatus that preferably includes a plurality of switching elements that are prevented from being simultaneously turned on while a switching frequency is maintained constant or substantially constant, and switching is performed with an optimal dead time.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a switching power supply apparatus preferably including a direct-current power-supply input unit to which a direct-current input voltage is input, a transformer being configured by one magnetic component and including at least a first primary winding and a first secondary winding that are magnetically coupled, an inductor connected in series to the first primary winding, a first switch circuit including a parallel circuit including a first switching element, a first capacitor, and a first diode, a second switch circuit including a parallel circuit including a second switching element, a second capacitor, and a second diode, a third capacitor, a first series circuit that is connected to both end portions of the direct-current power-supply input unit and in which the first primary winding and the first switch circuit are connected in series, and a second series circuit that is connected to both end portions of the first switch circuit or both end portions of the first primary winding and in which the second switch circuit and the third capacitor are connected in series, wherein the first switch circuit and the second switch circuit are configured to operate such that the first switch circuit and the second switch circuit complementarily repeat turn on and turn off with a time period in between, for which both of the first switch circuit and the second switch circuit are turned off, and the switching power supply apparatus preferably includes a power converter circuit arranged so that an output voltage is output to a secondary side through a first rectification smoothing circuit rectifying and smoothing an alternating-current voltage output from the first secondary winding. The switching power supply apparatus preferably includes a first monitor signal generator arranged to detect the change of a voltage or current in the power converter circuit, which occurs due to the turning off of a switch circuit in an on-state from among the first switch circuit and the second switch circuit, and to generate a monitor signal, an output voltage detector arranged to detect the output voltage, a feedback signal generator arranged to generate a feedback signal according to the output voltage detected by the output voltage detector, and a switching control circuit arranged to control the first switching element and the second switching element.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The switching control circuit preferably includes an oscillator arranged to generate a triangular wave whose frequency is settable and constant or substantially constant, a first comparator arranged to compare the triangular wave signal with the feedback signal, and a second comparator arranged to compare an output signal of the first monitor signal generator with a first threshold value, wherein a gate signal of the first switch circuit and a gate signal of the second switch circuit are generated based on outputs of the first comparator and the second comparator.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">With this configuration, the on times of the first and second switching elements are determined by the switching control circuit in an analog IC in an analog format. At this time, a timing to be a trigger for the turning on of each switching element is determined based on the comparison result between the monitor signal based on the transformer voltage and the threshold value and a timing to be a trigger for the turning off of each switching element is determined based on the comparison result between the feedback signal and the triangular wave signal. Therefore, since the turning on of the switching element to be turned on is performed from a start timing including a predetermined delay amount set with the timing of the change of magnetic flux as a reference point, the change of magnetic flux being due to the turning off of the switching element that has most recently been in an on state, individual switching elements are not simultaneously put into on states. Furthermore, the switching frequency becomes constant or substantially constant due to the periodicity of the triangular wave signal. In addition, using the feedback signal, the turn off timing according to the level of the output voltage is obtained, and thus, it is possible to obtain a stable output voltage as a switching power supply apparatus.</p>

This saw-tooth wave signal Vchp includes a waveform whose level is gradually increased from a minimum level for the corresponding one period and reset to the minimum level at a time when the level has reached a maximum level in one period. In addition, the detection voltage signal Vo is set so as to be at a level located between the maximum level and the minimum level of the saw-tooth wave signal Vchp.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The control analog IC <b>10</b> synchronizes the reset timing of the saw-tooth wave signal Vchp with a predetermined timing.

<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The comparator <b>112</b> inputs the monitor signal Vm and a signal (hereinafter, referred to as a threshold value signal V<b>2</b>) corresponding to a threshold value level V<b>2</b>.

<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The inverter <b>113</b> subjects the first determination criterion signal Vcmp to reverse processing, and outputs a second determination criterion signal Vcmp&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The AND circuit <b>114</b> inputs the first determination criterion signal Vcmp and the first switching judgment-use signal Vtr<b>1</b>, and outputs the first switching control signal Vgs<b>1</b> that is at a Hi level for a time period during which the first determination criterion signal Vcmp and the first switching judgment-use signal Vtr<b>1</b> are at Hi levels and is at a Low level for a time period other than that.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The AND circuit <b>115</b> inputs the second determination criterion signal Vcmp&#x2032; and the second switching judgment-use signal Vtr<b>2</b>, and outputs the second switching control signal Vgs<b>2</b> that is at a Hi level for a time period during which the second determination criterion signal Vcmp&#x2032; and the second switching judgment-use signal Vtr<b>2</b> are of Hi levels and is of a Low level for a time period other than that.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">According to such processing, individual signals have a temporal relationship between waveforms illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In addition, while control described later is repeatedly performed with the switching period Ts specified by the saw-tooth wave signal Vchp, for convenience of description, control processing for a specific time period (in the following description, one period of the switching period Ts from a timing t<b>0</b> at which the saw-tooth wave signal Vchp is reset) will be described.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">(1) State <b>1</b> [Time Period Tp<b>1</b>: Timing t<b>0</b> to t<b>1</b>]</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">As illustrated with respect to the timing t<b>0</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, when, with respect to the level of the detection voltage signal Vo, the level of the saw-tooth wave signal Vchp transitions from a minimum level side to a maximum level side with zero crossing, the first determination criterion signal Vcmp output from the comparator <b>110</b> transitions from the Low level to the Hi level. In addition, the second determination criterion signal Vcmp&#x2032; output through the comparator <b>110</b> and the inverter <b>113</b> transitions from the Hi level to the Low level. In response to this, the second switching control signal Vgs<b>2</b> output from the AND circuit <b>115</b> transitions to the Low level. In this manner, when the second switching control signal Vgs<b>2</b> is caused to transition to the Low level, the transformer voltage Vt increases and the monitor signal Vm decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In addition, when the transformer voltage Vt increases, the monitor signal Vm decreases, and the level of the monitor signal Vm becomes less than the threshold value V<b>2</b> as illustrated with respect to a timing t<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the second switching judgment-use signal Vtr<b>2</b> output from the comparator <b>112</b> also transitions to the Low level along with the former second switching control signal Vgs<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">(2) State <b>2</b> [Time Period Tp<b>2</b>: Timing t<b>2</b> to t<b>3</b>]</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Furthermore, when the transformer voltage Vt increases, the monitor signal Vm decreases, and the level of the monitor signal Vm becomes less than or equal to the threshold value V<b>1</b> after a predetermined delay time, the first switching judgment-use signal Vtr<b>1</b> output from the comparator <b>111</b> transitions to the Hi level as illustrated with respect to a timing t<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. In this manner, since both the first determination criterion signal Vcmp and the first switching judgment-use signal Vtr<b>1</b> become Hi levels at the timing t<b>2</b>, the first switching control signal Vgs<b>1</b> transitions from the Low level to the Hi level.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">(3) State <b>3</b> [Time Period Tp<b>3</b>: Timing t<b>3</b> to t<b>4</b>]</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">After a predetermined time has elapsed in a state in which the first switching control signal Vgs<b>1</b> is maintained at the Hi level, when, as illustrated with respect to a timing t<b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a timing arrives at which the saw-tooth wave signal Vchp is reset, the saw-tooth wave signal Vchp transitions from the maximum level to the minimum level. Therefore, the first determination criterion signal Vcmp output from the comparator <b>110</b> transitions from the Hi level to the Low level. In response to this, the first switching control signal Vgs<b>1</b> output from the AND circuit <b>114</b> transitions to the Low level. In this manner, when the first switching control signal Vgs<b>1</b> is caused to transition to the Low level, the transformer voltage Vt decreases and the monitor signal Vm increases. In addition, the second determination criterion signal Vcmp&#x2032; output through the comparator <b>110</b> and the inverter <b>113</b> transitions from the Low level to the Hi level.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Here, a time during which the first switching control signal Vgs<b>1</b> is maintained at the Hi level is determined based on the length of a time period during which the level of the saw-tooth wave signal Vchp is higher than the detection voltage signal Vo, using the above-described circuit configuration. Accordingly, it is possible to set the length of time during which the first switching control signal Vgs<b>1</b> is maintained at the Hi level, in response to the level of the detection voltage signal Vo, namely, an output voltage level.
