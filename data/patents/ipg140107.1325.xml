<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a printing device and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For a printing device that has a detecting circuit that detects the type of a printing material container (ink cartridge or the like) and detects whether or not the printing material container is attached to the printing device, a technique for preventing or suppressing failure, which is caused by a short circuit between the detecting circuit and another circuit included in the printing device, of the printing material container and the printing device is described in Japanese Patent No. 4539654, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A short circuit protection circuit that is included in a rechargeable secondary battery pack with a function of displaying a remaining capacity is described in JP-A-5-299123, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">These techniques, however, have problems that it is difficult to improve the accuracy of a determining circuit for determining whether or not a short circuit has occurred and there is a risk that a current due to a short circuit flows even for a short period from the time when the short circuit has been detected to the time when a protection circuit operates and breaks another circuit.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An advantage of some aspects of the invention is that it provides a printing device that is capable of reliably and safely detecting attachment of a printing material container.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an aspect of the invention, a printing device includes: a printing material container that includes a first short circuit detection terminal, a second short circuit detection terminal, a first attachment detection terminal and a second attachment detection terminal; a high voltage power supply that applies a high voltage to the first attachment detection terminal; a short circuit detector that detects a short circuit between at least one of the first and second short circuit detection terminals and at least one of the first and second attachment detection terminals on the basis of a comparison between a voltage of a detection node and a reference voltage; a high voltage application controller that blocks supply of the high voltage from the high voltage power supply when the short circuit detector detects a short circuit; a resistor element that is arranged between the high voltage power supply and the first attachment detection terminal; and an electrostatic capacitor element that is arranged between the detection node of the short circuit detector and a low-potential-side power supply node. When the short circuit detector detects the short circuit, a period from the time when the high voltage is applied to the first attachment detection terminal to the time when the voltage of the detection node reaches a predetermined voltage is set on the basis of a resistance of the resistor element and a capacitance of the electrostatic capacitor element.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the aspect of the invention, the short circuit detector can detect whether or not a short circuit has occurred between terminals in order for the printing device to detect attachment of the printing material container. When the short circuit detector detects the short circuit, the high voltage application controller can block the supply of the high voltage. Since the resistor element and the electrostatic capacitor element are arranged, the period to the time when the voltage of the detection node reaches the predetermined voltage can be set long. Thus, the high voltage application controller can block the supply of the high voltage before a high voltage that may cause another circuit such as a storage device to be broken is applied. As a result, the printing device that can reliably and safely detect the attachment of the printing material container and is highly reliable can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The printing device according to the aspect may further include an integrated circuit device. The short circuit detector and the high voltage application controller may be arranged in the integrated circuit device, and the resistor element may be arranged between the high voltage power supply and the integrated circuit device and may be an overcurrent protective resistor element for the high voltage power supply.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the above, when an excessive current flows in the integrated circuit device, the resistor element can function as an overcurrent protective resistor element for the high voltage power supply. Thus, it is possible to prevent the high voltage power supply from being broken due to the excessive current or prevent failure from occurring in the high voltage power supply.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to the aspect of the invention, the resistor element may be a short circuit detection resistor element that is used to detect a short circuit between a high voltage power supply node included in the integrated circuit device and the low-potential-side power supply node.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the above, when the short circuit has occurred between the high voltage power supply node and the low-potential-side power supply node in the integrated circuit device, the amount of current that flows in the resistor element rapidly increases and the high voltage drops. It is possible to detect the short circuit occurred in the integrated circuit device by detecting the voltage drop.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the aspect of the invention, the printing material container may include an attachment detection resistor element that is arranged between the first attachment detection terminal and the second attachment detection terminal, the integrated circuit device may include an attachment detector that detects attachment of the printing material container on the basis of a current flowing in the attachment detection resistor element and a standard voltage generated from the high voltage supplied from the high voltage power supply.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the above, values of a current that flows into the attachment detector correspond to attached and unattached states of the printing material container and are different from each other. The attachment detector determines the attached or unattached state by detecting the difference between the current values. The difference between the current values can be accurately detected using a standard voltage generated from the high voltage supplied from the high voltage power supply. Thus, the attachment detector can reliably detect the attachment of the printing material container.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to the aspect of the invention, the printing device may include a plurality of printing material containers The first and second short circuit detection terminals of the printing material containers may be connected to the detection node of the single short circuit detector through a plurality of diodes.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the above, forward currents flow from the first and second short circuit detection terminals toward the detection node through the diodes. In the printing device that includes the plurality of printing material containers, currents that flow due to short circuits occurred between terminals of the printing material containers can be led to the detection node of the short circuit detector through the diodes.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the aspect of the invention, the printing material container may include a storage device, and the reference voltage may be set to a voltage value that does not cause the storage device to be broken when the short circuit detector detects the short circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the above, when the voltage of the detection node reaches a voltage value that is lower than a voltage value that may cause the storage device to be broken, the short circuit detector detects the short circuit. As a result, it is possible to prevent another circuit such as the storage device from being broken due to the application of the high voltage.</p>

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">When one or more cartridges are not attached, the combined resistance Rc increases and the detected current IDET is reduced in accordance with the number of the cartridges that are not attached.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> illustrates relationships between the detected current IDET and attached or unattached states of the cartridges IC<b>1</b> to IC<b>4</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the abscissa indicates sixteen patterns of attached or unattached states of the cartridges IC<b>1</b> to IC<b>4</b>, while the ordinate indicates a value of the detected current IDET for each of the patterns of the states of the cartridges IC<b>1</b> to IC<b>4</b>. The sixteen patterns of the states of the cartridges IC<b>1</b> to IC<b>4</b> correspond to sixteen combinations obtained by selecting one to four cartridges from among the four cartridges IC<b>1</b> to IC<b>4</b>. Each of the combinations is also referred to as a &#x201c;subset&#x201d;. The values of the detected current IDET uniquely identify the sixteen patterns of the states of the cartridges IC<b>1</b> to IC<b>4</b>. In other words, the resistances of the four resistors <b>701</b> to <b>704</b> corresponding to the four cartridges IC<b>1</b> to IC<b>4</b> are set so that the sixteen patterns of the states of the four cartridges IC<b>1</b> to IC<b>4</b> lead to different combined resistances Rc.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">When all the four cartridges IC<b>1</b> to IC<b>4</b> are in the attached states, the detected current IDET has the maximum value Imax among the values of the detected current IDET. On the other hand, when only the cartridge IC<b>4</b> that corresponds to the resistor <b>704</b> with the largest resistance is unattached, the value of the detected current IDET is 0.93 times the maximum value Imax. Thus, by detecting whether or not the value of the detected current IDET is equal to or higher than a threshold Ithmax that is between the aforementioned two current values, it is possible to detect whether or not all the four cartridges IC<b>1</b> to IC<b>4</b> have been attached. Note that the voltage VHO that is higher than a power supply voltage of approximately 3.3 V of the normal logic circuit is used so as to increase a dynamic range of the detected current IDET and thereby improve the accuracy of detection of the attachment.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The attachment detector <b>330</b> converts the detected current IDET into a digital detection signal SIDET and transmits the digital detection signal SIDET to the CPU <b>410</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The CPU <b>410</b> can determine the current attachment state from among the sixteen patterns of the states of the cartridges on the basis of a value of the digital detection signal SIDET. When the CPU <b>410</b> determines that one or more cartridges are not attached, the CPU <b>410</b> causes the display unit <b>430</b> to display information (characters and/or an image) of the unattached state and informs the user of the unattached state.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the process of detecting the attachment of the cartridges, the combined resistance Rc is uniquely determined corresponding to the state among 2<sup>N </sup>patterns of attached or unattached states of the N cartridges and the detected current IDET is uniquely determined in accordance with the combined resistance Rc. It is assumed that acceptable errors of the combined resistance of the resistors <b>701</b> to <b>704</b> are &#xb1;&#x3b5;. It is assumed that a first combined resistance of the cartridges IC<b>1</b> to IC<b>4</b> when all the cartridges IC<b>1</b> to IC<b>4</b> are attached is Rc<b>1</b> and a second combined resistance of the cartridges IC<b>1</b> to IC<b>3</b> when only the cartridge IC<b>4</b> is unattached is Rc<b>2</b>. Based on this assumption, a relationship of Rc<b>1</b>&#x3c;Rc<b>2</b> is established (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>). It is preferable that the relationship of Rc<b>1</b>&#x3c;Rc<b>2</b> be satisfied when the combined resistance of the resistors <b>701</b> to <b>704</b> varies in the acceptable error range of &#xb1;&#x3b5;. In the worst-case condition, the first combined resistance Rc<b>1</b> is the maximum value Rc<b>1</b>max in the range of the first combined resistance Rc<b>1</b> and the second combined resistance Rc<b>2</b> is the minimum value Rc<b>2</b>min in the range of the second combined resistance Rc<b>2</b> in consideration of the acceptable errors &#xb1;&#x3b5;. In order to identify the combined resistances Rc<b>1</b>max and Rc<b>2</b>min, it is sufficient if the relationship of Rc<b>1</b>max&#x3c;Rc<b>2</b>min is satisfied.

The attachment detector <b>330</b> transmits the plurality of bits stored in the bit resister <b>734</b> as the digital detected signal SIDET (detected current signal) to the CPU <b>410</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) of the main controller <b>400</b>. The CPU <b>410</b> determines, on the basis of the bit values of the digital detected signal SIDET, whether or not the cartridges have been attached. As described above, the four bit values of the digital detected signal SIDET indicate whether or not the cartridges have been attached. Thus, the CPU <b>410</b> can immediately determine, on the basis of the bit values of the digital detected signal SIDET, whether or not the cartridges have been attached.</p>

<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The voltage AGND is used as a standard voltage AGND to be applied to a low-voltage-side part of the threshold voltage generator <b>722</b>. For example, when the voltage VREF is 2.4 V, the voltage VHO is 42 V, the resistor R<b>21</b> has a resistance of 20 k&#x3a9; and the resistor R<b>22</b> has a resistance of 400 k&#x3a9;, the voltage AGND is 0.42 V. As can be understood from the comparison of Equation (4) with Equation (5), the standard voltage AGND that is applied to the low-voltage-side part of the threshold voltage generator <b>722</b> varies in accordance with the voltage VHO (or the high voltage power supply VHV) output from the high voltage application controller <b>320</b> in a similar manner to the detected voltage VDET. The difference between the two voltages AGND and VDET results from the difference between the resistance ratio of R<b>21</b>/R<b>22</b> and the resistance ratio of R<b>11</b>/Rc. When the voltage corrector <b>740</b> is used and the power supply voltage VHV varies for some reason, the threshold voltages Vth(j) that are generated by the threshold voltage generator <b>722</b> vary in accordance with the variation in the power supply voltage VHV. As a result, the detected voltage VDET and the threshold voltages Vth(j) vary in accordance with the variation in the power supply voltage VHV. Thus, the voltage comparator <b>720</b> can output an accurate comparison result that indicates the attached or unattached states of the cartridges. When the resistance ratio of R<b>21</b>/R<b>22</b> and the resistance ratio of R<b>11</b>/Rc<b>1</b> (Rc<b>1</b> is the combined resistance when all the cartridges are in the attached states) are set to be equal to each other, the detected voltage VDET and the threshold voltages Vth(j) can vary in accordance with the variation in the power supply voltage VHV so that a change in the detected voltage VDET and changes in the threshold voltages Vth(j) are nearly equal to each other. The voltage corrector <b>740</b> may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">As described above, when a plurality of printing material containers (ink cartridges) are used in a printing device according to the embodiment, the printing device can detect that an ink cartridge is not attached to the printing device. If a short circuit has occurred between terminals of an ink cartridge during detection of the attachment, the printing device can detect the short circuit and block the supply of a high voltage to be used for the detection of the attachment. In addition, since a resistor element and an electrostatic capacitor element are arranged, the printing device can suppress a steep increase in the voltage to be applied to the terminals. As a result, the printing device can block the supply of the high voltage before the voltage that is applied to the terminals reaches a voltage value that may cause a circuit such as a storage device to be broken. Thus, the printing device that can reliably and safely detect the attachment of printing material containers and is highly reliable can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The embodiment is described above in detail. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made herein without materially departing from the new matters and effects of the invention. Thus, such changes and modifications are all included in the scope of the invention. For example, terms that are described together with broader or synonymous different terms at least once in this specification or the drawings can be replaced with those different terms in any section of the specification and the drawings. The configuration and operations of the printing device are not limited to those described in the embodiment, and can be variously modified.</p>
