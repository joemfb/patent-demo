<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Exemplary embodiments will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings in which some example embodiments are shown. The inventive concept may, however, be embodied in different forms and should not be construed as limited to the exemplary embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these exemplary embodiments are provided so that this disclosure is thorough and complete and fully conveys the scope of the inventive concept to one skilled in the art. Further, the inventive concept is defined by the scope of the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The drawings are not necessarily to scale, emphasis instead being placed upon providing clear illustrations. For example, in the drawings, the sizes and relative sizes of layers and regions may be exaggerated for clarity. When any element appears in more than one drawing, it is denoted by the same reference numeral in each drawing.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Exemplary embodiments may be described with reference to schematic plan views or cross-sectional views, which are schematic diagrams of idealized example embodiments. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations, as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, exemplary embodiments of the inventive concept should not be construed as being limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein, but are to include deviations in shapes that result from, e.g., a manufacturing process. Thus, the regions illustrated in the drawings are schematic in nature and are not intended to limit the scope of the inventive concept.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the specification, an electronic device may include a semiconductor device, a semiconductor package including the semiconductor device, a module including the semiconductor device or semiconductor package, and a circuit substrate including the module.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Herein, an optical-electrical converting device conceptually includes an electrical-optical converting device. The optical-electrical converting device receives light to convert the received light into an electrical signal and transmit the converted results, and may include a coupler, an optical guide and/or an optical-electrical generator. The electrical-optical converting device receives an electrical signal to convert the received results into an optical signal and transmit the converted results, and may include a light generating part and/or a shutting part.</p>

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, an end of the optical channel <b>160</b> may be partially embedded into the via structure <b>180</b>. Specifically, the core <b>161</b> and the cladding <b>163</b> of the optical channel <b>160</b> may be embedded into the via structure <b>180</b>, and the buffer coating <b>165</b> not embedded into the via structure <b>180</b>. The end of the optical channel <b>160</b> may be disposed at a lower half part of the via structure <b>180</b>. In other words, the end of the optical channel <b>160</b> may be spaced apart from the optical-electrical converting device <b>170</b>. The core <b>161</b> and the cladding <b>163</b>, i.e., components having a function of transmitting light, may be embedded into the via structure <b>180</b>. A component that does not have a function of transmitting light such as the buffer coating (or the jacket) <b>165</b>, etc. might not be embedded into the via structure <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The via structure <b>180</b> may include a via hole <b>180</b><i>h </i>and a via liner <b>180</b><i>l</i>. The via hole <b>180</b><i>h </i>may be formed by vertically penetrating the core layer <b>111</b> and the insulating layer <b>117</b>. The conductive via liner <b>180</b><i>l </i>may be formed on an inner wall of the via hole <b>180</b><i>h</i>. The via liner <b>180</b><i>l </i>may be formed in the shape of a cylinder or a pipe, the center of which is hollow. The via liner <b>180</b><i>l </i>may include a metal. For example, the via liner <b>180</b><i>l </i>may be formed using a copper plating method. The via liner <b>180</b><i>l </i>may be electrically connected to a metal layer <b>113</b> of the package substrate <b>110</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, only the core <b>161</b> is embedded into the via structure <b>180</b> since the via structure <b>180</b> may reflect light due to the metallic via liner <b>180</b><i>l</i>. The metallic liner <b>180</b><i>l </i>may surrounds the sides of the cladding <b>163</b> in the vial hole <b>180</b><i>h. </i></p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Further, the metallic via liner <b>180</b><i>l </i>may prevent the via structure <b>180</b> and the optical channel <b>160</b> from external physical/chemical attack. Specifically, when there is no metallic via liner <b>180</b><i>l</i>, since the via hole <b>180</b><i>h </i>is physically weak, the via hole <b>180</b><i>h </i>may become deformed, or the optical channel <b>160</b> may be physically/chemically damaged. The metallic via liner <b>180</b><i>l </i>may provide physical stability to the via structure <b>180</b>. Also, since the metallic via liner <b>180</b><i>l </i>surrounds the optical channel <b>160</b>, the metallic via liner <b>180</b><i>l </i>may prevent external pollution sources or radicals from passing through, and the via hole <b>180</b><i>h </i>and the optical channel <b>160</b> may be physically/chemically protected. Moreover, since the via structure <b>180</b> provides the via hole <b>180</b><i>h </i>as an optical connection path, and provides the via liner <b>180</b><i>l </i>as an electrical connection path, integration density of the electronic device may be enhanced. That is, since the optical connection path and the electrical connection path that have been formed at different positions are simultaneously provided at the same position, the package substrate <b>110</b> may be efficiently used, and the electronic device may be formed smaller.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The optical-electrical converting device <b>170</b> may be disposed at the other end of the via structure <b>180</b>.

The body <b>171</b> may include silicon and/or an insulating protecting material. As previously described, the optical-electrical converter <b>172</b> may have an optical-electrical converting function and/or an electrical-optical converting function. The conductive pad <b>174</b> may be electrically connected to the via liner <b>180</b><i>l </i>to transmit a power supply or electrical signal to the optical-electrical converter <b>172</b>. In this case, the optical-electrical converter <b>172</b> may receive an electrical signal to convert the electrical signal into an optical signal, and may transmit the converted results to the outside via the optical channel <b>160</b>. Alternatively, the optical-electrical converter <b>172</b> may receive an optical signal from the outside via the optical channel <b>160</b> to convert the optical signal into an electrical signal, and may transmit the converted results to the metal layer <b>113</b> via the conductive pad <b>174</b> and the via liner <b>180</b><i>l. </i></p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">According to the exemplary embodiments, the electrical connection of the optical-electrical converting device <b>170</b> is made through the via structure <b>180</b>, and thus separate electrical connection such as a solder ball, a wire bonding or a separate via may be omitted.

The sealing material <b>179</b> may include a curable material that may be provided in a paste form. The sealing material <b>179</b> may be formed of a material transparent to light of a wavelength band used for transmitting a signal. For example, when light used for transmitting a signal is in a visible ray or infrared ray band, the material may be formed of UV cement that passes light in the visible ray or infrared ray band, and is opaque to light of the UV band or absorbs light of the UV band.
