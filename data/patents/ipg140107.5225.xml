<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Disclosed are systems, methods, and non-transitory computer-readable storage media for altering pitch of a note played on a musical instrument keyboard of a touch-sensitive electronic display. An exemplary method includes playing a note of a key of the keyboard on the touch-sensitive display touched by a user. The method includes continuously altering the pitch of the played note as the user slides a point of contact on the touch-sensitive display horizontally from the key being played across adjacent keys to a second key, in accordance with the keys being contacted during the sliding of the point of contact. In a further aspect, the method includes detecting motion of user contact in a direction other than horizontally across keys of the keyboard, such as vertical, and activating a sound effect in addition to pitch alteration in response to the detection. Example sound effects include tremolo, vibrato, echo, and sound filter effects.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The following relates to altering sound output on a virtual keyboard on a touch screen device.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Some traditional electronic keyboards often have two wheels on their left hand side, generally known as a pitch bend and a modulation wheel. In a common implementation, the pitch bend wheel is spring-loaded to always return to its default center position, while the modulation wheel can be placed freely and will stay where it is placed. In this implementation, the pitch bend wheel controls a pitch of a played note in small values, allowing the simulation of continuous pitch adjustment. In this implementation, the modulation wheel is usually set to control a tremolo effect by default. However, on most electronic keyboards, a user can map any MIDI control to the modulation wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Other traditional electronic keyboards include a pitch bend/modulation joystick that combines the functionality of a separate pitch bend wheel and modulation wheel. Such a joystick allows a user to pitch bend a currently playing note up in pitch by moving the joystick to a right position, down in pitch by moving the joystick to a left position, and apply modulation by moving the joystick into an upward position. The user can end a pitch bend and/or modulation by returning the joystick to a central default position.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Users skilled with pitch bend and modulation controllers can create very expressive and unique sounds that are very difficult to create without such controllers. However traditional pitch bend and modulation controllers contain limitations. For example, many traditional pitch bend controllers can only adjust a pitch within +/&#x2212;2 half steps. Additionally, if a user wishes to use a pitch bend controller to adjust a pitch to a second known pitch, the user must rely on his or her own pitch detection skills to determine when the second pitch is reached.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Current touch screen devices, such as tablet computers, can execute programs to present a virtual music instrument keyboard that allows a user to play and create music and sounds. Users of such devices can benefit from a method and system for visually applying pitch bending to a note played on a virtual keyboard on a touch screen device. Users can benefit from a method and system for visually applying pitch bending that allows precise pitch bending from a displayed note on a virtual keyboard to any other displayed note. Users can further benefit from a method and system for applying modulation, or other sound effects, to the note played on the virtual keyboard on the touch screen device.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The method, system, and computer-readable medium for altering pitch of a note played on a musical instrument keyboard of a touch-sensitive electronic display can be implemented on a computer. The computer can be a data-processing system suitable for storing and/or executing program code. The computer can include at least one processor that is coupled directly or indirectly to memory elements through a system bus. The memory elements can include local memory employed during actual execution of the program code, bulk storage, and cache memories that provide temporary storage of at least some program code in order to reduce the number of times code must be retrieved from bulk storage during execution. Input/output or I/O devices (including but not limited to keyboards, displays, pointing devices, etc.) can be coupled to the system either directly or through intervening I/O controllers. Network adapters may also be coupled to the system to enable the data processing system to become coupled to other data-proces sing systems or remote printers or storage devices through intervening private or public networks. Modems, cable modems, and Ethernet cards are just a few of the currently available types of network adapters. In one or more embodiments, the computer can be a desktop computer, laptop computer, or dedicated device.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the basic hardware components associated with the system embodiment of the disclosed technology. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an exemplary system includes a general-purpose computing device <b>100</b>, including a processor, or processing unit (CPU) <b>120</b> and a system bus <b>110</b> that couples various system components including the system memory such as read only memory (ROM) <b>140</b> and random access memory (RAM) <b>150</b> to the processing unit <b>120</b>. Other system memory <b>130</b> may be available for use as well. It will be appreciated that the invention may operate on a computing device with more than one CPU <b>120</b> or on a group or cluster of computing devices networked together to provide greater processing capability. The system bus <b>110</b> may be any of several types of bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, and a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. A basic input/output (BIOS) stored in ROM <b>140</b> or the like, may provide the basic routine that helps to transfer information between elements within the computing device <b>100</b>, such as during start-up. The computing device <b>100</b> further includes storage devices such as a hard disk drive <b>160</b>, a magnetic disk drive, an optical disk drive, tape drive or the like. The storage device <b>160</b> is connected to the system bus <b>110</b> by a drive interface. The drives and the associated computer-readable media provide nonvolatile storage of computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the computing device <b>100</b>. The basic components are known to those of skill in the art and appropriate variations are contemplated depending on the type of device, such as whether the device is a small, handheld computing device, a desktop computer, or a computer server.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Although the exemplary environment described herein employs the hard disk, it should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of computer-readable media which can store data that are accessible by a computer, such as magnetic cassettes, flash memory cards, digital versatile disks, cartridges, random access memories (RAMs), read only memory (ROM), a cable or wireless signal containing a bit stream and the like, may also be used in the exemplary operating environment.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">To enable user interaction with the computing device <b>100</b>, an input device <b>190</b> represents any number of input mechanisms such as a touch-sensitive screen for gesture or graphical input, accelerometer, keyboard, mouse, motion input, speech and so forth. The device output <b>170</b> can also be one or more of a number of output mechanisms known to those of skill in the art, such as a display or speakers. In some instances, multimodal systems enable a user to provide multiple types of input to communicate with the computing device <b>100</b>. The communications interface <b>180</b> generally governs and manages the user input and system output. There is no restriction on the disclosed technology operating on any particular hardware arrangement and therefore the basic features here may easily be substituted for improved hardware or firmware arrangements as they are developed.</p>

Both processors and program code for implementing each as aspects of the technology can be centralized and/or distributed as known to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is an industry-standard protocol that enables electronic musical instruments, such as keyboard controllers, computers, and other electronic equipment, to communicate, control, and synchronize with each other. MIDI does not transmit an audio signal or media, but rather transmits &#x201c;event messages&#x201d; such as the pitch and intensity of musical notes to play, control signals for parameters such as volume, vibrato and panning, cues, and clock signals to set the tempo. As an electronic protocol, MIDI is notable for its widespread adoption throughout the industry.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a musical keyboard interface in which a user slides a point of contact to create a pitch bend up. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes a wireless touch screen device <b>202</b>. Wireless touch screen device <b>202</b> includes a touch sensitive display <b>204</b>. Display <b>204</b> is displaying a musical instrument keyboard interface <b>206</b>. Musical instrument keyboard interface <b>206</b> displays two octaves from C<b>3</b> to B<b>4</b> as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a user has input with a finger on the display <b>204</b> over the C<b>3</b> note on the musical instrument keyboard interface <b>206</b>. This causes a processor to output a note corresponding to C<b>3</b> on the musical instrument keyboard interface <b>206</b> to an audio output, such as speakers or headphones.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a user slides a point of contact on the touch-sensitive display horizontally from the key being played, C<b>3</b>, across adjacent keys to a second key, A<b>3</b>. A module, such as a processor, causes continuous pitch alteration of the played note as the user slides the point of contact on the touch-sensitive display horizontally from the key being played, C<b>3</b>, across adjacent keys to the second key, A<b>3</b>, in accordance with the keys contacting during the sliding of the point of contact. Advantageously, this horizontal swipe gesture along instrument keyboard interface <b>206</b> allows a user to pitch bend from the first key C<b>3</b> to the second key A<b>3</b>. In this implementation, a user can pitch bend from any visible key to any other visible key on instrument keyboard interface <b>206</b>. This implementation allows a user to pitch between notes that would not be possible using a conventional music keyboard or MIDI controller. A traditional pitch bend wheel or joystick is only typically capable of adjusting pitch of a note in the range of &#xb1;1 tone. This implementation allows pitch bends of an octave or more with precision as to a starting and ending point.</p>
