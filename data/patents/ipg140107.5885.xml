<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This document relates to systems and methods for improved communications in nonvolatile memory systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Various types of nonvolatile memory (&#x201c;NVM&#x201d;), such as flash memory (e.g., NAND flash memory and NOR flash memory), can be used for mass storage. For example, consumer electronics (e.g., portable media players) use flash memory to store data, including music, videos, images, and other media or types of information.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Memory controllers can be used to perform access requests (e.g., program, read, erase operations) and memory management functions on NVM. In typical nonvolatile memory systems, a single memory controller can access multiple units of NVM, such as multiple memory dies (e.g., NAND flash memory dies), over a shared bus. Memory controllers can also communicate with a host device through an interface and over a communications channel (e.g., a bus). Typical shared bus communication systems can suffer from signal integrity problems, especially as the number of elements connected by the bus increases.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Systems and methods for improved communications in a nonvolatile memory system are disclosed. A nonvolatile memory system may include a host device, one or more memory controllers, and one or more memory dies. A &#x201c;host device&#x201d; can be a board-level device that can include one or more host controllers (e.g., processor(s), microprocessor(s)) that are configured to manage operation of the host device. Memory packages can be self-contained physical entities that include nonvolatile memory (e.g., one or more memory dies) and memory controllers to perform memory operations on the nonvolatile memory (e.g., read, program, and erase operations). A memory package can include a substrate that is separate from and coupled to a board-level device.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Communication between different elements of a nonvolatile memory system can be effected using point-to-point communications channels. According to some embodiments, point-to-point communication between elements of an NVM system can utilize a number of external communications channels extending from a host device to each memory controller. External communications channels can communicate with memory controllers, for example, through external interfaces included in each memory package. An NVM system can also include internal communications channels extending from each memory controller to each memory die. Switches (e.g., a multiplexer (&#x201c;MUX&#x201d;)) located throughout an NVM system can toggle between the multiple external and internal communications channels to achieve point-to-point communication between a host and one or more memory dies.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, memory controllers may adjust the number of active external interfaces to optimize point-to-point communication between the host and the memory dies. The adjustment may be based on a number of factors, such as, for example, the speed of the host device, the speed of the memory controllers, the speed of the external interfaces, and/or the number of available external interfaces. An NVM system may also utilize power islands in the NVM packages to electrically isolate inactive system elements. Power islands can save power and help to simplify communication between the host and the one or more memory dies.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram depicting system <b>100</b>, including host <b>102</b>, which may be configured to communicate with NVM package <b>104</b>. NVM package <b>104</b> can include memory controller <b>106</b>, and memory dies <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>with corresponding NVMs <b>128</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>. As depicted in the illustrative system <b>100</b>, host <b>102</b> can communicate with NVM package <b>104</b> over communications path <b>116</b>, which may include one or more external communications channels. According to embodiments in which communications path <b>116</b> includes more than one external communications channel, host <b>102</b> can toggle between the available external communications channels to help achieve point-to-point communication with a particular portion of NVMs <b>128</b><i>a</i>-<i>n. </i></p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Systems having multiple external communications channels are described in more detail in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As used herein, a &#x201c;channel&#x201d; can refer to a single communications path between two system components (e.g., host <b>102</b> and NVM package <b>104</b>). A &#x201c;bus&#x201d; can refer to a communications path that branches one or more times to communicatively couple together multiple system components.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Host <b>102</b> can be any of a variety of host devices and/or systems, such as a portable media player, a cellular telephone, a pocket-sized personal computer, a personal digital assistant (&#x201c;PDA&#x201d;), a desktop computer, a laptop computer, and/or a tablet computing device. NVM package <b>104</b> can include NVMs <b>128</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>(e.g., in the memory dies <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>) and can be a ball grid array package or other suitable type of integrated circuit (&#x201c;IC&#x201d;) package. NVM package <b>104</b> may be part of and/or separate from host <b>102</b>. For example, host <b>102</b> can be a board-level device and NVM package <b>104</b> can be a memory package that is installed on the board-level device. In other embodiments, NVM package <b>104</b> can be coupled to host <b>102</b> with a wired (e.g., SATA) or wireless (e.g., Bluetooth&#x2122;) interface.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Host <b>102</b> can include host controller <b>114</b> that is configured to interact with NVM package <b>104</b>. For example, host <b>102</b> can transmit various access requests, such as read, program, and erase requests, to NVM package <b>104</b>. Host controller <b>114</b> can also include one or more processors and/or microprocessors that are configured to perform operations based on the execution of software and/or firmware instructions. Additionally and/or alternatively, host controller <b>114</b> can include hardware-based components, such as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), that are configured to perform various operations. Host controller <b>114</b> can format information (e.g., access requests and/or data) transmitted to NVM package <b>104</b> according to a communications protocol shared between host <b>102</b> and NVM package <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Host <b>102</b> may also include storage component <b>134</b>, including volatile memory <b>108</b>. Volatile memory <b>108</b> can be any of a variety of volatile memory types such as, for example, cache memory or RAM. Host device <b>102</b> can use volatile memory <b>108</b> to perform access requests and/or to temporarily store data that is being read from and/or programmed to NVM package <b>104</b>. For example, volatile memory <b>108</b> can temporarily store a queue of memory operations to be sent to, or to store data received from, NVM package <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Host <b>102</b> can communicate with NVM package <b>104</b> over communications path <b>116</b>, which may be fixed, detachable (e.g., universal serial bus (USB), serial advanced technology (SATA), etc.), or wireless (e.g., Bluetooth&#x2122;). Interactions with NVM package <b>104</b> can include transmitting access requests and data, such as data to be programmed to one or more of memory dies <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>, to NVM package <b>104</b>. Communication over communications path <b>116</b> can be received at external interface <b>110</b> of memory controller <b>106</b>. According to some embodiments, external interface <b>110</b> may be separate from, and communicatively connected to, memory controller <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to some embodiments, communications path <b>116</b> can include more than one external communications channel between host <b>102</b> and external interfaces (e.g., external interface <b>110</b>) of memory controller <b>106</b>. Each external communications channel may provide point-to-point communication between host <b>102</b> and one or more memory dies <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>through memory controller <b>106</b>. For example, host controller <b>114</b> may control a switch (e.g., a multiplexer (&#x201c;MUX&#x201d;)) that can toggle between a number of channels extending from host <b>102</b> to NVM package <b>104</b>. Each channel may, in turn, communicate with one or more memory dies <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<i>n. </i></p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Like host controller <b>114</b>, memory controller <b>106</b> can include one or more processors and/or microprocessors <b>120</b> that are configured to perform operations based on the execution of software and/or firmware instructions. Additionally and/or alternatively, memory controller <b>106</b> can include hardware-based components, such as ASICs, that are configured to perform various operations. Memory controller <b>106</b> can perform a variety of operations, such as executing access requests initiated by host <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Host controller <b>114</b> and memory controller <b>106</b>, alone or in combination, can perform various memory management functions, such as wear leveling and garbage collection. In implementations in which memory controller <b>106</b> is configured to perform at least some memory management functions, NVM package <b>104</b> can be termed &#x201c;managed NVM&#x201d; (or &#x201c;managed NAND&#x201d; for NAND flash memory). This can be in contrast to &#x201c;raw NVM&#x201d; (or &#x201c;raw NAND&#x201d; for NAND flash memory), in which host controller <b>114</b>, external to NVM package <b>104</b>, performs memory management functions for NVM package <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, as in the embodiments depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, memory controller <b>106</b> can be incorporated into the same package as memory dies <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<i>n. </i>However, memory controller <b>106</b> may be physically located in a separate package or in the same package as host <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, such as in the case of raw NVM, for example, memory controller <b>106</b> may be omitted, and all memory management functions normally performed by memory controller <b>106</b> (e.g., garbage collection and wear leveling) can be performed by a host controller (e.g., host controller <b>114</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Memory controller <b>106</b> may also include volatile memory <b>122</b> and NVM <b>124</b>. Volatile memory <b>122</b> can be any of a variety of volatile memory types, such as cache memory or RAM.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Memory controller <b>106</b> can use NVM <b>124</b> to persistently store a variety of information, such as debug logs, instructions, and firmware that NVM package <b>104</b> uses to operate. NVM <b>124</b> can be any of a variety of NVM (e.g., NAND flash memory or NOR flash memory). In some embodiments, NVM <b>124</b> locally and persistently stores firmware for NVM package <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Memory controller <b>106</b> can use communications path <b>126</b> to access one or more NVMs used for persistent data storage. In system <b>100</b>, the one or more NVMs are depicted as NVMs <b>128</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>, which are incorporated into memory dies <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>. Memory dies <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>can be, for example, IC dies. Analogous to communications path <b>116</b>, communications path <b>126</b> can include more than one internal communications channel. A controller (e.g., memory controller <b>106</b>) can toggle between available internal communications channels of communications path <b>126</b> using a switch (e.g., a multiplexer). Alternatively, according to some embodiments, internal communications channels of communications path <b>126</b> can be internal busses that couple each internal communications channel to one or more of memory dies <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>. Systems having multiple internal communications channels are described in more detail in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Memory dies <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>can be physically arranged in a variety of configurations, including a stacked configuration.

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Shared busses can typically suffer from signal integrity issues as the total number of system components increases. Accordingly, to improve signal integrity, the system can enable point-to-point communication between a host and one or more memory dies. Point-to-point communication can be achieved through the use of switches (e.g., multiplexers) included at various points throughout the system. For example, the host device may include a switch for toggling between a number of memory controller interfaces. Memory controllers included in the system may also include switches for accessing a number of memory dies. In general, point-to-point communication, as described herein, can increase bandwidth and decrease latency in a nonvolatile memory system.</p>

Host <b>202</b> can include host controller <b>214</b> and external channel MUX <b>240</b>. External channel MUX <b>240</b> can be any suitable mechanism for toggling between a number of channels (e.g., external communications channels <b>216</b>-<i>m</i>) extending from host <b>202</b> to NVM packages <b>204</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>. For example, external channel MUX <b>240</b> can be a multiplexer/de-multiplexer that can send outgoing signals over a selected one of external communications channels <b>216</b><i>a</i>-<i>m</i>. In addition, external channel MUX <b>240</b> can select one of external communications channels <b>216</b><i>a</i>-<i>m </i>to receive incoming signals from NVM packages <b>204</b><i>a</i>-<i>n. </i></p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The total number of external communications channels <b>216</b><i>a</i>-<i>m </i>may be optimized for the particular system configuration.

The total number of external communications channels <b>216</b><i>a</i>-<i>m </i>may depend on, for example, the speed of host <b>202</b> and/or external interfaces <b>210</b><i>a</i>-<i>m</i>. In general, as the speed of host <b>202</b> and external interfaces <b>210</b><i>a</i>-<i>m </i>increase, the number of external communications channels <b>216</b><i>a</i>-<i>m </i>that device <b>200</b> can accommodate also increases.

Host <b>302</b> can include host controller <b>314</b> and external channel MUX <b>340</b>. External channel MUX <b>340</b> may correspond to, for example, external channel MUX <b>340</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. External communications channels <b>316</b><i>a</i>-<i>m </i>can extend from host <b>302</b> to external interfaces (e.g., external interface <b>310</b>) in NVM packages <b>304</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>. According to some embodiments, more than one external communications channel can extend from host <b>302</b> to each of NVM packages <b>304</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>. Each external communications channel <b>316</b><i>a</i>-<i>m </i>may communicate with a memory controller (e.g., memory controller <b>306</b>) through external interfaces (e.g., external interface <b>310</b>) included in NVM packages <b>304</b><i>a</i>-<i>n. </i></p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Memory controller <b>306</b> can correspond to, for example, memory controller <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and can be responsible for carrying out memory management functions (e.g., wear leveling and garbage collection, etc.) and access requests (e.g., read, program, and erase operations). To carry out these operations, memory controller <b>306</b> may include one or more processors as well as volatile and/or nonvolatile memory (not shown for clarity). Memory controller <b>306</b> can also include internal channel MUX <b>342</b>, which may be similar to external channel MUX <b>340</b>. In particular, internal channel MUX <b>342</b> can be used to switch between one or more internal communications channels <b>326</b><i>a</i>-<i>p</i>, which extend from internal interfaces <b>311</b><i>a</i>-<i>p </i>of memory controller <b>306</b> to memory dies <b>312</b><i>a</i>-<i>p. </i></p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to some embodiments, memory controller <b>306</b> can adjust the number of active external communications channels <b>316</b><i>a</i>-<i>m </i>used in NVM package <b>304</b><i>a </i>based on the total number of available external communications channels <b>316</b><i>a</i>-<i>m</i>. For example, memory controller <b>306</b> may activate a number of external interfaces <b>310</b> (and, thereby external communications channels) less than the number of memory dies <b>312</b><i>a</i>-<i>p </i>and use internal channel MUX <b>342</b> to activate a number of internal interfaces (thereby switching between internal communications channels <b>326</b><i>a</i>-<i>p </i>to access memory dies <b>312</b><i>a</i>-<i>p</i>). Alternatively, memory controller <b>306</b> may activate a number of external interfaces equal to the number of internal communications channels <b>326</b><i>a</i>-<i>p </i>in NVM package <b>304</b><i>a </i>(as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> below). In these embodiments, memory controller <b>306</b> can associate each external communications channel <b>316</b><i>a</i>-<i>m </i>with a corresponding internal communications channel <b>326</b><i>a</i>-<i>p </i>to transmit data directly between memory dies <b>312</b><i>a</i>-<i>p </i>and host <b>302</b>.</p>

For example, internal channel MUX <b>342</b> may not be capable of toggling among all internal communications channels <b>326</b><i>a</i>-<i>p </i>to access each memory dies <b>312</b><i>a</i>-<i>p</i>. As a result, memory controller <b>306</b> may increase the number of external communications channels <b>316</b><i>a</i>-<i>m </i>communicating with NVM package <b>304</b><i>a </i>to reduce the burden on internal channel MUX <b>342</b>. In some embodiments, more than one internal communications channel MUX may be included in memory controller <b>306</b>, each of which can be coupled to an incoming external communications channel.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The particular configuration depicted in device <b>300</b> may be advantageous for embodiments in which host <b>302</b> and memory controller <b>306</b> are both fast devices that are capable of toggling between multiple channels.

Although not shown, persons skilled in the art will appreciate that corresponding memory controllers in NVM packages <b>304</b><i>b</i>-<i>n </i>can also toggle between multiple memory dies. Generally, however, the total number of external communications channels <b>316</b><i>a</i>-<i>m </i>extending from host <b>302</b> to each NVM package <b>304</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>can be optimized based on factors such as, for example, the relative speed of host <b>302</b> and the memory controllers, the speed of external and internal interfaces, the total number of NVM packages <b>304</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>, and the total number of memory dies in each NVM package <b>304</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>, and any combination thereof.</p>
