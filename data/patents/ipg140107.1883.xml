<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Described herein are flexible implantable occluding devices that can, for example, navigate the tortuous vessels of the neurovasculature. The occluding devices can also conform to the shape of the tortuous vessels of the vasculature. In some embodiments, the occluding devices can direct blood flow within a vessel away from an aneurysm or limit blood flow to the aneurysm. Some embodiments describe methods and apparatus for adjusting, along a length of the device, the porosity of the occluding device. In some embodiments, the occluding devices allows adequate blood flow to be provided to adjacent structures such that those structures, whether they are branch vessels or oxygen-demanding tissues, are not deprived of the necessary blood flow.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Not Applicable.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The subject technology generally relates to implantable devices for use within a patient's body and, in particular, relates to methods and apparatus for luminal stenting.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Lumens in the body can change in size, shape, and/or patency, and such changes can present complications or affect associated body functions. For example, the walls of the vasculature, particularly arterial walls, may develop pathological dilatation called an aneurysm. Aneurysms are observed as a ballooning-out of the wall of an artery. This is a result of the vessel wall being weakened by disease, injury or a congenital abnormality. Aneurysms have thin, weak walls and have a tendency to rupture and are often caused or made worse by high blood pressure. Aneurysms could be found in different parts of the body; the most common being abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) and the brain or cerebral aneurysms. The mere presence of an aneurysm is not always life-threatening, but they can have serious heath consequences such as a stroke if one should rupture in the brain. Additionally, a ruptured aneurysm can also result in death.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An aspect of the disclosure provides a highly flexible implantable occluding device that can easily navigate the tortuous vessels of the neurovasculature. Additionally, occluding device can easily conform to the shape of the tortuous vessels of the vasculature. Furthermore, the occluding device can direct the blood flow within a vessel away from an aneurysm; additionally such an occluding device allows adequate blood flow to be provided to adjacent structures such that those structures, whether they are branch vessels or oxygen demanding tissues, are not deprived of the necessary blood flow.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The occluding device is also capable of altering blood flow to the aneurysm, yet maintaining the desired blood flow to the surrounding tissue and within the vessel. In this instance, some blood is still allowed to reach the aneurysm, but not enough to create a laminar flow within the aneurysm that would cause injury to its thinned walls. Instead, the flow would be intermittent, thereby providing sufficient time for blood clotting or filler material curing within the aneurysm.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The occluding device is flexible enough to closely approximate the native vasculature and conform to the natural tortuous path of the native blood vessels. One of the significant attributes of the occluding device according to the present disclosure is its ability to flex and bend, thereby assuming the shape of a vasculature within the brain. These characteristics are for a neurovascular occluding device than compared to a coronary stent, as the vasculature in the brain is smaller and more tortuous.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In general terms, aspects of the disclosure relate to methods and devices for treating aneurysms. In particular, a method of treating an aneurysm with a neck comprises deploying a vascular occluding device in the lumen of a vessel at the location of the aneurysm, whereby the blood flow is redirected away from the neck of the aneurysm. The induced stagnation of the blood in the lumen of the aneurysm would create embolization in the aneurysm. The occluding device spans the width of the stem of the aneurysm such that it obstructs or minimizes the blood flow to the aneurysm. The occluding device is very flexible in both its material and its arrangement. As a result, the occluding device can be easily navigated through the tortuous blood vessels, particularly those in the brain. Because the occluding device is flexible, very little force is required to deflect the occluding device to navigate through the vessels of the neurovasculature, which is of significance to the operating surgeon.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A feature of the occluding device, apart from its flexibility, is that the occluding device may have an asymmetrical braid pattern with a higher concentration of braid strands or a different size of braid strands on the surface facing the neck of the aneurysm compared to the surface radially opposite to it. In one embodiment, the surface facing the aneurysm is almost impermeable and the diametrically opposed surface is highly permeable. Such a construction would direct blood flow away from the aneurysm, but maintain blood flow to the side branches of the main vessel in which the occluding device is deployed.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment, the occluding device has an asymmetrical braid count along the longitudinal axis of the occluding device. This provides the occluding device with a natural tendency to curve, and hence conform to the curved blood vessel. This reduces the stress exerted by the occluding device on the vessel wall and thereby minimizing the chances of aneurysm rupture. Additionally, because the occluding device is naturally curved, this eliminates the need for the tip of the catheter to be curved. Now, when the curved occluding device is loaded on to the tip of the catheter, the tip takes the curved shape of the occluding device. The occluding device could be pre-mounted inside the catheter and can be delivered using a plunger, which will push the occluding device out of the catheter when desired. The occluding device could be placed inside the catheter in a compressed state. Upon exiting the catheter, it could expand to the size of the available lumen and maintain patency of the lumen and allow blood flow through the lumen. The occluding device could have a lattice structure and the size of the openings in the lattice could vary along the length of the occluding device. The size of the lattice openings can be controlled by the braid count used to construct the lattice.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to one aspect of the disclosure, the occluding device can be used to remodel an aneurysm within the vessel by, for example, neck reconstruction or balloon remodeling. The occluding device can be used to form a barrier that retains occlusion material within the aneurysm so that introduced material will not escape from within the aneurysm due to the lattice density of the occluding device in the area of the aneurysm.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another aspect of the disclosure, a device for occluding an aneurysm is disclosed. The device is a tubular with a plurality of perforations distributed on the wall of the member. The device is placed at the base of the aneurysm covering the neck of the aneurysm such that the normal flow to the body of the aneurysm is disrupted and thereby generating thrombus and ultimately occlusion of the aneurysm.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In yet another aspect of this disclosure, the device is a braided tubular member. The braided strands are ribbons with rectangular cross section, wires with a circular cross section or polymeric strands.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another embodiment, a device with a braided structure is made in order to conform to a curved vessel in the body, where the density of the braid provides enough rigidity and radial strength. Additionally, the device can be compressed using a force less than 10 grams. This enables the device to be compliant with the artery as the arterial wall is pulsating. Also, the device is capable of bending upon applying a force of less than 5 gram/cm.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another aspect, the device may include an occluding device having a first lattice density in one portion and a second lattice density in a second portion, the first and second lattice densities being different. In another example, the first lattice density and/or the second lattice density may be adjusted. For example, an input motion may determine the first and/or lattice density.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Aspects of the disclosure include a system and method of deploying an occluding device within a vessel. The occluding device can be used to remodel an aneurysm within the vessel by, for example, neck reconstruction or balloon remodeling. The occluding device can be used to form a barrier that retains occlusion material such as a well known coil or viscous fluids, such as &#x201c;ONYX&#x201d; by Microtherapeutics, within the aneurysm so that introduced material will not escape from within the aneurysm. Also, during deployment, the length of the occluding device can be adjusted in response to friction created between the occluding device and an inner surface of a catheter. When this occurs, the deployed length and circumferential size of the occluding device can be changed as desired by the physician performing the procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">An aspect of the disclosure includes a system for supporting and deploying an occluding device. The system comprises an introducer sheath and an assembly for carrying the occluding device. The assembly includes an elongated flexible member having an occluding device retaining member for receiving a first end of the occluding device, a proximally positioned retaining member for engaging a second end of the occluding device and a support surrounding a portion of the elongated flexible member over which the occluding device can be positioned.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Another aspect of the disclosure includes a system for supporting and deploying an occluding device. The system comprises an assembly for carrying the occluding device. The assembly comprises an elongated member including a flexible distal tip portion, a retaining member for receiving a first end of the occluding device, and a support surrounding a portion of the elongated flexible member for supporting the occluding device.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A further aspect of the disclosure comprises a method of introducing and deploying an occluding device within a vessel. The method includes the steps of introducing an elongated sheath including an introducer sheath carrying a guidewire assembly into a catheter and advancing the guidewire assembly out of the sheath and into the catheter. The method also includes the steps of positioning an end of the catheter proximate an aneurysm, advancing a portion of the guidewire assembly out of the catheter and rotating a portion of the guidewire assembly while deploying the occluding device in the area of the aneurysm.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In another aspect an elongated flexible member supports and deploys an occluding device and the occluding device may be expanded and retracted based on input pressure. For example, air of fluid pressure may be applied to the occluding device via the flexible member to cause the occluding device to expand or retract.</p>

Some embodiments further include after compressing the stent to the contracted configuration, moving the stent to a different location within a vessel of the patient; and expanding the stent at the different location.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Some embodiments of treating a patient's vessel include advancing a stent into a patient's vessel, the stent having lumen extending between a proximal end of the stent and a distal end of the stent; expanding the stent from a first state, having a first cross-sectional dimension to a second state, having a second cross-sectional dimension greater than the first cross-sectional dimension, the stent having a second state stent length less than a first state stent length; and axially compressing a first portion of the stent to a third state, such that the stent has a third state stent length less than the second state stent length; wherein the expanding the stent from the first state comprises permitting the stent to axially compress and radially expand by unrestraining the stent; and wherein the axially compressing the first portion of the stent comprises applying an axially compressive force on the stent when the stent is in the second state.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Some embodiments further include permitting the stent to axially expand from the third state to the second state by unrestraining the stent. In some embodiments, the stent, in the third state, has a third cross-sectional dimension that is substantially the same as the second cross-sectional dimension.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Some embodiments relate to a stent, for implanting in a patient's vessel, that includes a proximal portion having a proximal end; a distal portion having a distal end; a stent length extending from the proximal end to the distal end; a stent wall that defines a lumen extending between the proximal end and the distal end, the stent wall having a delivery configuration and an expanded configuration; wherein, when in the expanded configuration, the stent wall has a porosity that is changeable in a discrete location proximal to the distal portion by changing the stent length.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, the porosity of the stent wall is decreased as the stent length is decreased. In some embodiments, as the stent length is changed, the stent wall porosity changes in the discrete location relative to the stent wall porosity in at least one of the proximal portion and the distal portion. In some embodiments, when the stent length is decreased, the porosity of the stent wall in the discrete location is reduced relative to the porosity of the stent wall in the proximal portion and the distal portion. In some embodiments, axially compressing the stent decreases the porosity of the stent. In some embodiments, the stent automatically changes from the delivery configuration to the expanded configuration when unrestrained.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, the stent is radially collapsible, after changing from the delivery configuration to the expanded configuration, by increasing the stent length. In some embodiments, the stent is radially collapsible, after changing from the delivery configuration to the expanded configuration, by advancement of a catheter over the expanded stent. In some embodiments, the stent comprises a first stent length when the stent is in the delivery configuration, and a second stent length, shorter than the first stent length, when the stent is in the expanded configuration. In some embodiments, the porosity of the stent can be reduced in the discrete location by decreasing the stent length beyond the second stent length. In some embodiments, when in the expanded configuration, the porosity is changeable in the discrete location by changing the stent length without substantially changing a cross-sectional dimension of the stent, the cross-sectional dimension spanning the lumen. In some embodiments, when in the expanded configuration, the stent length is reducible without substantially changing a radial cross-sectional dimension of the stent lumen.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Some embodiments describe a system, for implanting a stent in a patient's vessel, including an elongate body, having a proximal portion, a distal portion, and a body lumen extending from the proximal portion to the distal portion, the distal portion being configured to extend within a blood vessel of a patient; and a stent expandable from a compressed configuration to an expanded configuration, the stent having a proximal end, a distal end, a stent lumen extending from the proximal end to the distal end, and a stent wall that has, in the expanded configuration, an adjustable porosity; wherein the stent in the compressed configuration is configured to be slideably positioned within the body lumen and to change to an expanded configuration as the stent is advanced out of the body lumen; and wherein, when the distal end of the stent is in the expanded configuration, the adjustable porosity is adjustable by advancing or withdrawing the proximal end of the stent relative to the distal end of the stent.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, the adjustable porosity is adjustable in multiple discrete locations along a length of the stent wall. In some embodiments, when stent is in the expanded configuration, the adjustable porosity is decreasable in discrete, spatially separate sections of the stent wall as the proximal end of the stent is advanced toward the distal end of the stent. In some embodiments, when stent is in the expanded configuration, the adjustable porosity is increasable in the discrete, spatially separate sections of the stent wall as the proximal end is withdrawn from the distal end of the stent. In some embodiments, axially compressing the stent, when the stent is in the expanded configuration, decreases the porosity of at least a portion of the stent. In some embodiments, the stent automatically changes from the delivery configuration to the expanded configuration when unrestrained. In some embodiments, the stent is collapsible, after changing from the delivery configuration to the expanded configuration, by increasing a length of the stent. In some embodiments, the stent has a length extending from the proximal end to the distal end; and when in the expanded configuration, the stent length is reducible without substantially changing a radial cross-sectional dimension of the stent lumen.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Some embodiments relate to a stent, for implanting in a body lumen of a patient, including a proximal portion and a distal portion; a stent wall that defines a lumen extending from the proximal portion to the distal portion, the stent wall having a compressed configuration and an expanded configuration; wherein, when in the expanded configuration, the stent wall has a variable porosity that is adjustable by relative movement of the proximal portion with respect to the distal portion.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, the porosity of the stent wall is adjustable in a plurality of spatially separated locations between the proximal and distal portions. In some embodiments, the porosity of the stent wall is decreased when a length of the stent, extending from the proximal portion to the distal portion, is decreased. In some embodiments, when a length of the stent, extending from the proximal portion to the distal portion, is changed, a porosity of the stent wall in a first region, located between the proximal portion and the distal portion, changes relative to a porosity of the stent wall in a second region, located in at least one of the proximal portion and the distal portion. In some embodiments, when the length of the stent is decreased, the porosity in the first region is reduced relative to the porosity in the second region. In some embodiments, when the stent is in the expanded configuration, axially compressing the stent decreases the porosity of the stent. In some embodiments, the stent has a length extending from the proximal portion to the distal portion; and when in the expanded configuration, the stent length is substantially reducible without substantially changing a radial cross-sectional dimension of the stent lumen.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Some embodiments relate to a stent, for implanting in a patient, comprising a stent wall that has an adjustable porosity, such that a porosity of at least a portion of the stent wall can be adjusted while the stent is positioned in the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Some embodiments disclose a stent, for implanting in a patient's vessel, including a stent wall configured to change between a compressed configuration and an expanded configuration, the stent wall having a proximal portion, a distal portion, and a middle portion extending between the proximal portion and the distal portion; wherein the middle portion of the stent has a variable porosity that is adjustable when the distal portion is in the expanded configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, the porosity of the middle portion decreases when a length of the stent extending from the proximal portion to the distal portion decreases. In some embodiments, the porosity of the middle portion changes by changing a length of the middle portion. In some embodiments, when a length of the middle portion is decreased, the porosity of the middle portion is reduced relative to a porosity in at least one of the proximal portion and the distal portion. In some embodiments, when the stent is in the expanded configuration, axially compressing the stent decreases the porosity of the middle portion. In some embodiments, the stent has a length extending from the proximal portion to the distal portion; and when in the expanded configuration, the stent length is substantially reducible without substantially changing a radial cross-sectional dimension of the stent.</p>

<p id="p-0133" num="0132"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a typical cerebral aneurysm <b>10</b>. A neck <b>11</b> of the aneurysm <b>10</b> can typically define an opening of between about 2 to 25 mm. As is understood, the neck <b>11</b> connects the vessel <b>13</b> to the lumen <b>12</b> of the aneurysm <b>10</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the blood flow <b>3</b> within the vessel <b>13</b> is channeled through the lumen <b>12</b> and into the aneurysm. In response to the constant blood flow into the aneurysm, the wall <b>14</b> of lumen <b>12</b> continues to distend and presents a significant risk of rupturing. When the blood within the aneurysm <b>10</b> causes pressure against the wall <b>14</b> that exceeds the wall strength, the aneurysm ruptures. An aspect of the subject technology may prevent or reduce likelihood of such ruptures. Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are the bifurcation <b>15</b> and the side branches <b>16</b>.</p>

A plurality of openings <b>23</b> extend between the surfaces <b>21</b>, <b>24</b> and allow for fluid flow from the interior of the occluding device <b>200</b> to the wall of the vessel. Occluding device <b>200</b> is radially compressible and longitudinally adjustable.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a catheter <b>25</b> and the occluding device <b>200</b> inside the catheter <b>25</b> in a compressed state prior to being released within the vasculature of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates another embodiment of the occluding device <b>30</b> having two or more strands of material(s) <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> wound in a helical fashion. The braiding of such material in this fashion results in a lattice structure <b>33</b>. As can be understood, the dimension of the lattice <b>33</b> and the formed interstices <b>34</b> is determined, at least in part, by the thickness of the strand materials, the number of strands and the number of helices per unit length of the occluding device <b>30</b>. For example, the interstices <b>34</b> and/or the dimension of the lattice <b>33</b> may be determined by the number of strands of material(s) <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> wound in helical fashion. In some embodiments, any number of braiding ribbons up to 16 braiding ribbons may be used (e.g., 5, 8, 10, 13, 15 or 16 braiding ribbons). In some embodiments, 16-32 braiding ribbons may be used (e.g., 20, 23, 25, 27, 30, or 32 braiding ribbons). In some embodiments greater than 32 braiding ribbons may be used such as, for example, 35, 40, 48, 50, 55, 60, 80, 100, or greater braiding ribbons. In some embodiments, 48 braiding ribbons are used.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Hence, strands of material, such as ribbons, may intersect to form a braid pattern. The intersection of the strand material may be formed in either a radial or axial direction on a surface of a forming device such as a braiding mandrel. When the intersection of the strand material is along an axial path, for example, the intersecting material may be at a fixed or variable frequency. As one example of strand material intersecting at a fixed frequency, the intersecting strand material may be along any 1.0 inch axial path on the surface of the forming device (e.g., a braiding mandrel) to indicate the pick count. When the intersection of the strand material is along a radial path or circumferential path, the spacing of the strand material may be uniformly or variably distributed. In one example of the strand material along a radial or circumferential path in which the spacing is uniformly distributed, the spacing along the radial direction may be determined based on the following formula:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>(&#x3c0;)*(forming device diameter)/(#ribbons/2)&#x2003;&#x2003;Eq. (1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates an example of braiding elements or cells in the radial and PPI (picks per inch) directions. Any single element of the braid (i.e., braid element) may be combined to form a mesh pattern as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> on a surface of a forming device (e.g., braiding mandrel). The braid is capable of impeding or disrupting the some types of fluid flow (e.g., blood) in a lumen of a patient (e.g., blood vessel). The braid or lattice pattern, density, shape, etc. when the occluding device is deployed in the vessel, may at least partially determine the flow within the vessel. Each of the parameters of the braid or lattice may also be controlled by a user to control flow.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Parameters for determining the flow through an occluding device containing a lattice pattern, density, shape, etc. include surface coverage of the occluding device and cell size of the braid or lattice pattern. Each of these parameters may further characterize the geometry of the braid or lattice. Surface coverage may be determined as (surface area)/(total surface area), where the surface area is the surface area of the frame or solid element and the total surface area is of the entire element (i.e., frame and opening).</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Cell size may be determined as the greater length defining a cell opening. Braiding patterns that increase surface coverage while decreasing cell size may have an increased effect on disrupting or impeding the flow through the braid or lattice. Each of the parameters of surface coverage and cell size may further be enhanced by varying the width of the strand material (e.g., the ribbons), increasing the number of strands of strand material defining the braid, and/or increasing the PPI.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">The braiding or lattice pattern as described may be further defined by various parameters including, for example, the number of strands (e.g., ribbons), the width of each ribbon/strand, the braiding PPI, and/or the diameter of the forming device (e.g., mandrel diameter), to name a few. In some embodiments, the diameter of each strand is between about 0.001 inches and 0.0014 inches. In some embodiments, the diameter of each strand is between about 0.0005 inches and 0.0020 inches. In some embodiments, the diameter of each strand is less than or equal to about 0.0005 inches or greater than about 0.0020 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Based on the lattice parameters, a leg length and a ribbon angle may be determined. The leg length may define the length of an aspect of the braiding element. For example, if the braiding element is diamond shaped as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the length of one side of the diamond shaped braiding element is the &#x201c;leg length.&#x201d; A ribbon angle may define the angle created by two intersecting aspects of the braiding element. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the ribbon angle is the angle formed between two adjacent sides of the diamond shaped braiding element. Radial spacing of braid elements in a lattice pattern can define the width of a braiding element in radial direction. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates an example of a radial spacing, leg length and ribbon angle of a braid element.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Radial spacing of the lattice may be determined as set forth in Equation 1 as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Radial Spacing=(&#x3c0;)*(forming device diameter)/(#ribbons/2)&#x2003;&#x2003;Eq. (1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The braiding element may be fitted into a vessel based on the radial spacing or the diameter of the vessel. The radial spacing of the lattice may be adjusted based on the diameter of the vessel. For example, if the diameter of the vessel is small, the radial spacing may be adjusted to a smaller dimension while the leg length of the braid elements may be maintained. Also in this example, the ribbon angle may also be adjusted to achieve the adjusted radial spacing. Adjusting the ribbon angle may also alter the spacing of the braid element in the PPI direction.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates an example of determining a radial spacing and ribbon angle of a lattice structure in an occluding device. In this example, a lattice or braid contains sixteen interlacing ribbons, with each ribbon being about 0.004 inches wide and braided on a forming device such as a mandrel with a diameter of about 4.25 mm and 65 PPI. Thus, in this example, the number of braiding elements is sixteen, the ribbon width is about 0.004 inches, the spacing in the PPI direction is about 1/65=0.01538 inches and the diameter of the forming device (e.g., mandrel diameter) is about 4.25 mm. Hence, the radial spacing may be calculated as: Radial spacing=(&#x3c0;)*(forming device diameter)/(#ribbons/2)=(3.14)*(0.425/2.54)/(16/2)=0.0657 inches. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates an example of a braiding element with a radial spacing of about 0.0657 inches. In addition, the leg length of the example is about 0.0337 inches, the ribbon angle is about 153.65 degrees, and the spacing of the braiding element in the PPI direction, based on the ribbon angle and leg length is about 0.0154 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In some embodiments, the braiding pattern can include a &#x201c;1 over 1 under 1&#x201d; pattern. In some embodiments, the braiding pattern can include a &#x201c;1 over 2 under 2&#x201d; pattern. In some embodiments, the braiding pattern can include other variations of braids.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> after the braiding element is fitted into an appropriate vessel diameter. In this example, the radial spacing is adjusted to a smaller length to accommodate a smaller vessel diameter. The leg length remains constant at about 0.0337 inches so the ribbon angle changes based on changes in the radial spacing. In this example, the radial spacing is adjusted to about 0.06184 inches and the ribbon angle is adjusted to about 132.79 degrees. Also, the spacing of the braid element in the PPI direction is also changed. In this example, the spacing of the braid element in the PPI direction increases from about 0.0154 inches to about 0.0270 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Table 1 illustrates additional examples of lattice or braid patterns of varying PPI, ribbon width (RW), or number of ribbons. In addition, each of the braid patterns in Table 1 may produce patterns with the same percent coverage within a vessel.</p>

<p id="p-0150" num="0149">The occluding device may be placed into a protective coil to enhance placement of the occluding device in a vessel. Also, the occluding device may be housed in a delivery device, such as a catheter, for placement within a vessel. The occluding device may be created at a size or dimension based on the size of the protective coil, delivery device, or catheter housing the occluding device. For example, the number of strands or ribbons in the lattice structure of the occluding device that fit into a corresponding protective coil, delivery device, or catheter may be determined such that the occluding device is effectively stored or housed prior to deployment in a vessel. In one example, the strands of the occluding device may overlap in a 2-layer structure including an inner layer and an outer layer, the outer layer contacting the protective coil.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">In some embodiments, the braiding diameter is 0.25 mm larger than the recommended vessel size. In some embodiments, the percent coverage by the stent of the vessel wall is about &#x2153;, or 33% of the total surface area when the stent is placed within the vessel. In some embodiments, the braiding PPI (picks per inch, or the number of wire crossings per inch) is 275 PPI. In some embodiments, the braid is manufactured over a metal core or mandrel, and the braiding is not too dense to hinder removal of the braiding from the metal core or mandrel. In some embodiments, the PPI of the stent, when implanted within the vessel, is about 100 PPI. In some embodiments, the diameter of the strands of the stent ranges from about 0.001 inch to about 0.0014 inch. In some embodiments, the number of strands selected for a stent is based on the desired diameter of the stent. For example, in some embodiments, 48 strands are used for a stent diameter ranging from about 2.75 mm to about 4.25 mm, 64 strands are used for a stent diameter ranging from about 4.5 mm to about 6.0 mm, 72 strands are used for a stent diameter ranging from 6.0 mm and greater, and 32 strands are used for a stent diameter ranging from 2.5 mm and smaller. In some embodiments, the number of strands is selected based on a diameter of the delivery catheter.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">In one example, a housing such as a protective coil, delivery device or catheter that houses the occluding device may have a constant size or diameter and the characteristics of the occluding device may be determined to fit the housing. For example, a ribbon size or width may be determined based on the desired size of the housing. In this way, the size (or diameter) of the housing (e.g., protective coil, delivery device or catheter) may be constant for a variety of occluding devices that may vary in size or number of ribbons.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> illustrates an example of a cross sectional view of a protective coil. In this example, a number of strands or ribbons in a lattice structure of an occluding device is determined for a protective coil. The protective coil illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> has a circular cross sectional area with a diameter. A strand or ribbon of a predetermined thickness or size is placed within the protective coil such that the outer surface of the strand/ribbon contact the inner surface of the protective coil. The inner surface of the strand/ribbon creates a concave surface within the protective coil. A second strand/ribbon is placed within the protective coil such that the outer surface of the second strand/ribbon contacts an inner circumference in contact with the concave surface of the strand/ribbon previously placed in the protective coil. The angle from a center point of the circular protective coil from one edge of the second strand/ribbon to an opposite edge of the second strand/ribbon is determined (i.e., the &#x201c;arc-angle&#x201d;). Based on these measurements, the number of strands or ribbons of the predetermined size or thickness may be determined as follows: (Arc-angle)*(#ribbons/2)&#x3c;=360 degrees (i.e., #ribbons&#x3c;=720 degrees/angle).</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, an occluding device is constructed using approximately a 0.001 inch by 0.004 inch ribbon. The arc-angle of the ribbon element at the center of the protective coil between a first line drawn from the center point of the protective coil to one edge of an inner layer ribbon and a second line drawn from the center point of the protective coil to the opposite edge of the inner layer ribbon is about 34.14 degrees. Thus, the calculated number of ribbons is less than or equal to about 720 degrees/34.14 degrees=20 ribbons.</p>

<p id="p-0157" num="0156"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> illustrates another example of determining ribbon dimensions for an occluding device in a protective coil or a delivery device. In this example, an occluding device with a lattice or braid structure based on a thickness of a ribbon. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> illustrates, the diameter of the protective coil or delivery device <b>2301</b> is about 0.0170 inches. A first ribbon <b>2302</b> is fitted within the outer surface of the protective coil or delivery device <b>2301</b>. A second ribbon <b>2303</b> is placed in contact with an inner circumference of the protective coil or delivery device <b>2301</b> where the inner circumference is a circumference that is tangential to the inner surface of the first ribbon <b>2302</b>. The second ribbon <b>2303</b> is placed within the inner circumference such that lateral ends of the second ribbon <b>2303</b> are in contact with the inner circumference of the protective coil or delivery device <b>2301</b>. The arc-angle between a first line extending from the center point of the protective coil or delivery device <b>2301</b> to one lateral end of the second ribbon <b>2303</b> and a second line extending from the center point of the protective coil or delivery device <b>2301</b> to the other lateral end of the second ribbon <b>2303</b> is calculated as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">In this example, the maximum dimensions of the first and second ribbons <b>2302</b>, <b>2303</b> are determined based on the calculated arc-angle formed. For example, to allow eight ribbons in the inner circumference of the protective coil or delivery device <b>2301</b>, the arc-angle may be calculated as (360 degrees)/8=45 degrees as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> illustrates. Based on a 45 degree angle, the maximum ribbon width may be determined as about 0.00476 inches to allow eight ribbons of a thickness of about 0.001 inches to fit within the inner circumference of the protective coil or delivery device <b>2301</b>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;maximum&#x201d; is a broad term, and is intended to mean, without limitation, a desired upper range of a particular parameter, and the term &#x201c;minimum&#x201d; is a broad term, and is intended to mean, without limitation, a desired lower range of a particular parameter. In some embodiments, the parameters explained herein, described as maximum, can extend greater than or beyond the maximum range, and parameters explained herein, described as minimum, can extend less than or beyond the minimum range.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">In another example, a narrower ribbon width is used to compensate for material tolerance variations and curvature. Based on extensive research and experimentation by the applicants, it was discovered that a tolerance range applied to the ribbon widths of about 20% can compensate for such material tolerance variations. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> illustrates an example of a 20% tolerance range or cushion applied to ribbon widths of an occluding device.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">In this example, 20% additional ribbons are desired in the occluding device (i.e., ribbons). The maximum width of the ribbons may be determined based on the desired number of 9.6 ribbons by calculating the angle as described above. Specifically, the arc-angle may be calculated as (360 degrees)/9.6=37.7 degrees. Based on this calculation, the maximum width of the ribbons may be determined as about 0.00405 inches as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. Thus, in this example, a 20% cushion is applied to permit about 9.6 ribbons in the protective coil or delivery device at a maximum width of about 0.00405 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Table 3 provides additional examples of ribbon widths for various ribbon thicknesses. In the examples provided in Table 3, the ribbon thicknesses range from about 0.0007 inches to about 0.0015 inches.</p>

<p id="p-0163" num="0162">In another example, an occluding device containing 32 ribbons is described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> illustrates an example of determining the ribbon width of a 32-ribbon occluding device based on the number of ribbons that can fit in the protective coil or delivery device <b>2501</b>. In this example, the protective coil or delivery device <b>2501</b> has a diameter of about 0.017 inches and the maximum ribbon width that can fit in the inner circumference of the protective coil or delivery device <b>2501</b> provides an arc-angle of about (360 degrees)/(32/2)=22.5 degrees as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. Hence, to fit 16 ribbons along the inner circumference of the protective coil <b>2501</b>, the width of the ribbons is determined to be about 0.00266 inches, with a thickness of about 0.00080 inches as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. Similarly a 20% cushion may be applied to the ribbon widths to provide for narrower ribbon widths to compensate for material tolerance variations. In this example, the modified ribbon widths may be determined based on the new arc-angle requirement of about (360 degrees)/19.2=18.75 degrees.

<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Alternatively, a larger number of ribbons may be included in the occluding device. For example, the strands or ribbons may be increased to greater than 32, such as 40, 44, 48, 50, 56, 60, 64, 70, 76, 80, 90, 100, or more. For any desired number of ribbons, a ribbon width may be determined based on a calculated angle or a ribbon thickness as described. In addition, a cushion may be applied to the ribbon width as described.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">In another example, oversized occluding devices may be used relative to the vessel. For example, a larger occluding device relative to the size of the vessel lumen may result in enhanced anchoring of the occluding device within the lumen of the vessel. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> illustrates a relationship between the PPI of the occluding device in place in the vessel (&#x201c;in-vessel PPI&#x201d;) versus the PPI of the occluding device in the free-standing state (&#x201c;braided PPI&#x201d;). The graph in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> demonstrates that for each design, the PPI of the occluding device in place in the vessel approaches a maximum value as the pick count of the occluding device in the free-standing state increases. For example, for the 4 mm vessel design, as the PPI of the free-standing occluding device is increased, the PPI of the occluding device in the vessel increases until the in-vessel PPI reaches about 45. When the in-vessel PPI reaches about 45, further increases in the braided PPI result in only minimal further increases in the in-vessel PPI. Also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, different vessel designs (e.g., 3 mm vessel design or 5 mm vessel design) result in a similar behavior in which the in-vessel PPI approaches a maximum value for high braided pick counts.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Similarly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> illustrates the in-vessel PPI as a function of the braided PPI of a 32 ribbon occluding device. In the examples illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the PPI of the occluding device in a vessel (&#x201c;in-vessel PPI&#x201d;) approaches a higher value as the PPI of the occluding device in a free-standing state (&#x201c;braided PPI&#x201d;). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> also illustrates alternate vessel designs. As can be seen in the examples of vessel designs of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, for each of the vessel designs, the in-vessel PPI approaches a higher value asymptotically as the braided PPI increases.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Similarly, the coverage of the occluding device may be based on ribbon width or braided PPI. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> illustrates an example in which the ribbon is about 0.00467 inches wide and 0.001 inches and is the greater ribbon size that fits in the protective coil. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> illustrates, the coverage approaches a greater value of approximately 65-100 PPI range. In this example, the percentage of coverage asymptotically approaches approximately 40% for a 0.001&#x2033;&#xd7;0.00467&#x2033; ribbon and 34% for a 0.001&#x2033;&#xd7;0.004&#x2033; ribbon.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> illustrates the percent coverage as a function of the braided PPI for a 32 ribbon occluding device. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> demonstrates, the % coverage approaches a greater value as the braided PPI in increases. For example, for an occluding device containing about 0.0008&#xd7;0.00266 inch ribbons, the % coverage approaches a greater value of about 43% as the braided PPI increases above about 150. Also, for an occluding device containing about 0.0008&#xd7;0.0020 inch ribbons, the % coverage approaches a greater value of about 35% as the braided PPI increases above about 150.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> is a graph showing the opening sizes of braiding elements in the occluding device as a function of the PPI of the lattice structure. As the PPI increases, the opening sizes or spaces through which flow of fluid (e.g., blood) decreases. As the PPI of the lattice structure reaches about 100, the opening sizes of the braiding elements when in place in a vessel asymptotically approaches a minimum value. In the examples illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, for a ribbon size of about 0.001&#xd7;0.004 inches, the opening sizes of the braiding elements in the lattice structure of an occluding device in a vessel approaches about 1280 microns or less. Similarly, for a ribbon size of about 0.001&#xd7;0.00467 inches, the opening sizes of the braiding elements in the lattice structure of an occluding device in a vessel approaches about 1220.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> illustrates the opening sizes of braiding elements in the occluding device as a function of the braided PPI of the lattice structure for a 32 ribbon occluding device. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> demonstrates, the opening size of braiding elements approaches a lower value as the braided PPI in increases. For example, for an occluding device containing about 0.0008&#xd7;0.00266 inch ribbons, the opening size approaches a lower value of about less than 600 microns as the braided PPI increases above about 150. Also, for an occluding device containing about 0.0008&#xd7;0.0020 inch ribbons, the opening sizes approaches a lower value of about 640 as the braided PPI increases above about 150.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">The occluding device <b>30</b> is radially compressible and radially expandable without the need for supplemental radially expanding force, such as an inflatable balloon. The occluding device <b>30</b> is constructed by winding the two strands (<b>31</b>, <b>32</b>) in opposite directions. Alternatively, greater than 2 strands may be wound in various directions. For example, 8, 10, 12, 14, 22, 28, 30, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 58, 64, 70, 86, 90, 110, 116, 120, 128, 136, 150, or greater strands may be wound in various directions. In an embodiment, the strands <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> are in the shape of rectangular ribbon (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>). The ribbons can be formed of known flexible materials including shape memory materials, such as Nitinol, platinum and stainless steel. In some embodiments, the occluding device <b>30</b> is fabricated from platinum/8% tungsten and 35NLT (cobalt nickel alloy, which is a low titanium version of MP35N alloy) alloy wires.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">The ribbon used as the braiding material for the strands <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> can include a rectangular cross section <b>35</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4C and 7</figref>, the surface <b>36</b> that engages an inner surface of the vessel has a longer dimension (width) when compared to the wall <b>38</b> that extends between the surfaces <b>36</b>, <b>37</b> (thickness). A ribbon with rectangular cross section has a higher recovery (expansive) force for the same wall thickness when compared to a wire with a circular (round) cross section. Additionally, a flat ribbon allows for more compact compression of the occluding device <b>200</b> and causes less trauma to the vascular wall when deployed because it distributes the radial expansion forces over a greater surface area. Similarly, flat ribbons form a more flexible device for a given lattice density because their surface area (width) is greater for a given thickness in comparison to round wire devices.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">While the illustrated embodiment discloses a ribbon having a rectangular cross section in which the length is greater than its thickness, the ribbon for an alternative embodiment of the disclosed occluding devices may include a square cross section. In another alternative embodiment, a first portion of the ribbon may include a first form of rectangular cross section and a second portion <b>39</b> of the ribbon (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>) may include a round, elliptical, oval or alternative form of rectangular cross section. For example, end sections of the ribbons may have substantially circular or oval cross section and the middle section of the ribbons could have a rectangular cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">In an alternative embodiment as described above, the occluding device <b>30</b> can be formed by winding more than two strands of ribbon. In an embodiment, the occluding device <b>30</b> could include as many as sixteen strands of ribbon. In another embodiment, the occluding device <b>30</b> can include as many as 32 strands of ribbon, as many as 48 strands of ribbon, as many as 60 strands of ribbon, as many as 80 strands of ribbon, as many as 100 strands of ribbon, as many as 150 strands of ribbon or greater than 150 strands of ribbon, for example. By using standard techniques employed in making radially expanding stents, one can create an occluding device <b>30</b> with interstices <b>34</b> that are larger than the thickness of the ribbon or diameter of the wire. The ribbons can have different widths. In such an embodiment, the different ribbon(s) can have different width(s) to provide structure support to the occluding device <b>30</b> and the vessel wall. The ribbons according to the disclosed embodiments can also be formed of different materials. For example, one or more of the ribbons can be formed of a biocompatible metal material, such as those disclosed herein, and one or more of the ribbons can be formed of a biocompatible polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the intravascular occluding device <b>30</b> in a radially compressed state located inside the catheter <b>25</b>. In one embodiment, the occluding device <b>30</b> could be physically attached to the catheter tip. This could be accomplished by constraining the occluding device <b>30</b> in the distal segment of the catheter. The catheter <b>25</b> is slowly advanced over a guidewire (not shown) by a plunger <b>50</b> and when the tip of the catheter <b>25</b> reaches the aneurysm, the occluding device is released from the tip. The occluding device <b>30</b> expands to the size of the vessel and the surface of the occluding device <b>30</b> is now opposed to the vessel wall <b>15</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the occluding device <b>30</b> is deployed inside the lumen of a cerebral vessel <b>13</b> with an aneurysm <b>10</b>. During its deployment, the proximal end <b>43</b> of the occluding device <b>30</b> is securely positioned against the lumen wall of the vessel <b>13</b> before the bifurcation <b>15</b> and the distal end <b>45</b> of the occluding device <b>30</b> is securely positioned against the lumen wall of the vessel <b>13</b> beyond the neck <b>11</b> of aneurysm <b>10</b>. After the occluding device <b>30</b> is properly positioned at the desired location within the vessel <b>13</b> (for example, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), flow inside the lumen of aneurysm <b>10</b> is significantly minimized while the axial flow within the vessel <b>13</b> is not significantly compromised, in part due to the minimal thickness of the walls <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">The flow into the aneurysm <b>10</b> will be controlled by the lattice density of the ribbons and the resulting surface coverage. Areas having greater lattice densities will have reduced radial (lateral) flow. Conversely, areas of lesser lattice densities will allow greater radial flow through the occluding device <b>30</b>. As discussed below, the occluding device <b>30</b> can have longitudinally extending (lateral) areas of different densities. In each of these areas, their circumferential densities can be constant or vary. This provides different levels of flow through adjacent lateral areas. The location within a vessel of the areas with greater densities can be identified radiographically so that the relative position of the occluding device <b>30</b> to the aneurysm <b>10</b> and any vascular branches <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> can be determined. The occluding device <b>30</b> can also include radiopaque markers.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">The reduction of blood flow to or within the aneurysm <b>10</b> results in a reduction in force against the wall <b>14</b> and a corresponding reduction in the risk of vascular rupturing. When the force and volume of blood entering the aneurysm <b>10</b> is reduced by the occluding device, the laminar flow into the aneurysm <b>10</b> is stopped and the blood within the aneurysm begins to stagnate. Stagnation of blood, as opposed to continuous flow through the lumen <b>12</b> of the aneurysm <b>10</b>, results in thrombosis in the aneurysm <b>10</b>. This also helps protect the aneurysm from rupturing. Additionally, due to the density of the portion of the occluding device <b>30</b> at the bifurcation <b>15</b>, the openings (interstices) <b>34</b> in the occluding device <b>30</b> allow blood flow to continue to the bifurcation <b>15</b> and the side branches <b>16</b> of the vessel. If the bifurcation <b>15</b> is downstream of the aneurysm, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the presence of the occluding device <b>30</b> still channels the blood away from the aneurysm <b>10</b> and into the bifurcation <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">In some embodiments, the lattice density of the occluding device <b>30</b> may be adjusted so as to result in a delayed occlusion. For example, the lattice density of the occluding device <b>30</b> may be configured to gradually reduce the flow of blood into the aneurysm <b>10</b> to result in substantial thrombosis in the aneurysm <b>10</b> within a time frame after deploying the occluding device <b>30</b> to treat the aneurysm. In some embodiments, substantial thrombosis refers to between about 90% and about 95% of the blood within the aneurysm <b>10</b> clotting. In some embodiments, substantial thrombosis refers to between about 50% and 99% of the blood within the aneurysm <b>10</b> clotting. In some embodiments, substantial thrombosis refers to between about 80% and 95% of the blood within the aneurysm <b>10</b> clotting. In some embodiments, substantial thrombosis refers to between about 70% and 98% of the blood within the aneurysm <b>10</b> clotting. In some embodiments, substantial thrombosis refers to between about 60% and 99% of the blood within the aneurysm <b>10</b> clotting. In some embodiments, substantial thrombosis refers to less than or equal to about 50% of the blood within aneurysm <b>10</b> clotting. In some embodiments, substantial thrombosis refers to sufficient clotting of the blood within the aneurysm <b>10</b> such that the threat of rupture of the aneurysm <b>10</b>&#x2014;for example from the blood flow <b>3</b>&#x2014;is reduced or eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">In some embodiments, the time frame associated with the delayed occlusion is about 3 months after deploying the occluding device <b>30</b> to treat the aneurysm. In some embodiments, the time frame is between about 2 months and about 4 months. In some embodiments, the time frame is between about 1 month and about 5 months. In some embodiments the time frame is less than or equal to about 1 month or greater than about 5 months. In some embodiments, the time frame is between about 2 weeks and about 4 weeks. In some embodiments, the time frame is between about 3 weeks and about 6 weeks.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">The lattice density of the occluding device <b>30</b> may be appropriately adjusted to achieve an optimum time frame for delayed occlusion. In some embodiments, the lattice density to achieve an optimum time frame for delayed occlusion is between about 60% and about 95%. In some embodiments, the lattice density to achieve an optimum time frame for delayed occlusion is between about 30% and about 60%. In some embodiments, the lattice density to achieve an optimum time frame for delayed occlusion is less than or equal to about 30% or greater than about 95%. In some embodiments, the lattice density can be combined with other features of the stent to achieve delayed occlusion. For example, the lattice density may be combined with specific features of the individual strands (e.g., cross-section, diameter, perimeter) or the braiding patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">The occluding devices described herein have flexibility to conform to the curvature of the vasculature. This is in contrast to coronary stents that cause the vasculature to conform essentially to their shape. The ability to conform to the shape of the vasculature (e.g., in radial compression, bending along an axis of the stent or vasculature, etc.) can be more significant for some neurovascular occluding devices than for some coronary stents, as the vasculature in the brain tends to be smaller and more tortuous. Tables 5 and 6 demonstrate characteristics of the claimed neurovascular occluding device. To demonstrate that the disclosed occluding devices exhibit very desirable bending characteristics, the following experiment was performed. The occluding device made by the inventors was set on a support surface <b>90</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. About 0.5 inches of the occluding device <b>30</b> was left unsupported. Then, a measured amount of force was applied to the unsupported tip until the occluding device was deflected by about 90 degrees from the starting point. A similar length of a coronary stent was subjected to the same bending moment. The results are shown in Table 5. Similar to the reduced compressive force, the occluding device of the present disclosure may require an order of magnitude lower bending moment (0.005 lb-in compared to 0.05 lb-in for a coronary stent). In some embodiments, the braiding pattern, stent diameter, number of ribbons, and other parameters can be adjusted to such that the bending force ranges from about 0.0005 lb-in to about 0.05 lb-in. In some embodiments, the bending force can range from about 0.00025 lb-in to about 0.03 lb-in, from about 0.003 lb-in to about 0.05 lb-in, from about 0.005 lb-in to about 0.01 lb-in, from about 0.01 lb-in to about 0.05 lb-in, from about 0.0025 lb-in to about 0.01 lb-in. In some embodiments, the bending force can range less than about 0.005 lb-in or greater than about 0.05 lb-in.</p>

<p id="p-0185" num="0184">The occluding devices according to the present disclosure also provides enhanced compressibility (i.e., for a given force how much compression could be achieved or to achieve a desired compression how much force should be exerted) compared to coronary stents. An intravascular device that is not highly compressible is going to exert more force on the vessel wall compared to a highly compressible device. This is of significant clinical impact in the cerebral vasculature as it is detrimental to have an intravascular device that has low compressibility. In some embodiments, the braiding pattern, stent diameter, number of ribbons, and other parameters can be adjusted such that the compressive force required to compress the stent 50% of the original diameter ranges from about 0.01 lb to about 0.5 lb. In some embodiments, the compressive force can range from about 0.05 lb to about 0.15 lb, from about 0.07 lb to about 0.1 lb, from about 0.03 lb to about 0.18 lb, from about 0.08 lb to about 0.19 lb, and from about 0.04 lb to about 0.3 lb. In some embodiments, the bending force can range less than about 0.01 lb or greater than about 0.5 lb.</p>

<p id="p-0187" num="0186"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33-36</figref> illustrate additional and/or other embodiments of the occluding device <b>3000</b>. The occluding device <b>3000</b> may be expanded or compressed. For example, the entire occluding device <b>3000</b>, or portions of the occluding device <b>3000</b>, may be compressed or expanded in an axial direction, radial direction, or both. The occluding device <b>3000</b> may be in various configurations or states depending on whether the occluding device <b>3000</b> is expanded or compressed. In some embodiments, when the occluding device <b>3000</b> is in a certain state, the occluding device <b>3000</b> may remain in the same state without any external forces acting on the occluding device <b>3000</b>. In some embodiments, when the occluding device <b>3000</b> is in a certain state, the occluding device <b>3000</b> may change to a different state without any external forces acting on the occluding device <b>3000</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">For example, the occluding device <b>3000</b> comprises walls <b>3014</b> that may change automatically from a compressed configuration (e.g., in a restrained state) to an expanded configuration (e.g., in an unrestrained stated), or vice versa. The walls <b>3014</b> may also change from an expanded configuration to a hyperexpanded configuration (e.g., another restrained state), and vice versa. The walls <b>3014</b> may exert an expanding force in any direction and/or a compressive force in any direction to allow the occluding device <b>3000</b> to change from any one state to another state. In some embodiments, the walls <b>3014</b> may have a spring constant k that causes the stent to require a force to change from an expanded, unrestrained state to a compressed state. In some embodiments, the spring constant is of the stent and/or filaments is configured such that the force is between 0.2 lb and about 0.02 lb. For example, the force to change the stent can be between 0.02 lb and 0.1 lb in some embodiments, 0.1 lb and 0.15 lb in some embodiments, and 0.15 lb and 0.2 lb in some embodiments. In some embodiments, the spring constant is such that the force is less than or equal to about 0.02 lb or greater than or equal to about 0.2 lb. The walls <b>3014</b> may also have a wall thickness that varies depending on the configuration of the occluding device <b>3000</b>. In some embodiments, the wall thickness is between about 2 strands and about 4 strands thick when the occluding device <b>3000</b> is in the compressed configuration. In some embodiments, the wall thickness is between about 4 strands and about 6 strands thick when the occluding device <b>3000</b> is in the compressed configuration. In some embodiments, the occluding device <b>3000</b> is less than or equal to about 2 strands or greater than about 6 strands thick when the occluding device <b>3000</b> is in the compressed configuration. In some embodiments, the wall thickness is between about 2 strands and about 4 strands thick when the occluding device <b>3000</b> is in the expanded configuration. In some embodiments, the wall thickness is less than or equal to about 2 strands or greater than about 4 strands thick when the occluding device <b>3000</b> is in the expanded configuration. In some embodiments, the wall thickness is between about 2 strands and about 5 strands thick when the occluding device <b>3000</b> is in the hyperexpanded configuration (a configuration beyond the unrestrained, expanded configuration). In some embodiments, the wall thickness is less than or equal to about 2 strands or greater than about 5 strands thick when the occluding device <b>3000</b> is in the hyperexpanded configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">In another example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> shows the occluding device <b>3000</b> in a compressed configuration. The occluding device <b>3000</b> may be in a compressed configuration, for example, when it is stored in the catheter <b>25</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The walls <b>3014</b> of the occluding device <b>3000</b>, in a compressed configuration, may exert a radially expansive force and an axially compressive force to change from the compressed configuration to an expanded configuration. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> illustrates the occluding device <b>3000</b> in an expanded configuration. Thus, after deploying the occluding device <b>3000</b> from a catheter into a vessel, the occluding device may change from a compressed configuration, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, to an expanded configuration, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">The occluding device <b>3000</b> may further be changed from the expanded configuration into a hyperexpanded configuration, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>. The walls <b>3014</b> of the occluding device <b>3000</b>, in a hyperexpanded configuration, may exert an axially expansive force to change the occluding device <b>3000</b> from the hyperexpanded configuration back to the expanded configuration. In some embodiments, the lattice density of the occluding device <b>3000</b> is increased when the occluding device <b>3000</b> changes from the expanded configuration to the hyperexpanded configuration. In some embodiments, the lattice density of the occluding device <b>3000</b> in the expanded configuration is between about 25% and about 35%. In some embodiments, the lattice density of the occluding device <b>3000</b> in the expanded configuration is between about 35% and about 50%. In some embodiments, the lattice density of the occluding device <b>3000</b> in the expanded configuration is less than or equal to about 25% or greater than about 50%. Correspondingly, the lattice density of the occluding device <b>3000</b> in the hyperxpanded configuration, in some embodiments, is between about 50% and about 70%. In some embodiments, the lattice density of the occluding device <b>3000</b> in the hyperexpanded configuration is between about 70% and about 95%. In some embodiments, the lattice density of the occluding device <b>3000</b> in the hyperexpanded configuration is less than or equal to about 50% or greater than about 95%.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">Furthermore, the entire occluding device <b>3000</b> or portions of the occluding device <b>3000</b> may expand or compress. Correspondingly, the lattice density of the entire occluding device <b>3000</b> or the lattice density of portions of the occluding device <b>3000</b> may decrease or increase depending on whether an expansive or compressive force, respectively, is applied to the occluding device <b>3000</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">Additionally, the length of the occluding device <b>3000</b> may change depending on whether the occluding device <b>3000</b> is expanded or compressed in the axial direction. The length of the occluding device <b>3000</b> may decrease when the occluding device <b>3000</b> is compressed in the axial direction. Alternatively, the length of the occluding device <b>3000</b> may increase when the occluding device <b>3000</b> is expanded in the axial direction. For example, the length <b>3008</b> of the occluding device <b>3000</b> in the expanded configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>) may be less than or about equal to the length <b>3004</b> of the occluding device <b>3000</b> in the compressed configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>). This may occur because the walls <b>3014</b> of the occluding device <b>3000</b> in a compressed configuration are exerting an axially compressive force to change into the expanded configuration. Similarly, the length <b>3008</b> of the occluding device <b>3000</b> in the expanded configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>) may be greater than or about equal to the length <b>3012</b> of the occluding device <b>3000</b> in the hyperexpanded configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>). This may occur because the walls <b>3014</b> of the occluding device <b>3000</b> in the hyperexpanded configuration are exerting an axially expansive force to change into the expanded configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">The diameter of the occluding device <b>3000</b> may also change depending on whether the occluding device <b>3000</b> is expanded or compressed in the radial direction. The diameter indicates the cross-sectional open area of the occluding device <b>3000</b>. Correspondingly, the cross-sectional open area of the occluding device <b>3000</b> changes depending on whether the occluding device <b>3000</b> is expanded or compressed in the radial direction. The diameter of the occluding device <b>3000</b> may decrease when the occluding device <b>3000</b> is compressed in the radial direction. Alternatively, the diameter of the occluding device <b>3000</b> may increase when the occluding device <b>3000</b> is expanded in the radial direction. For example, the diameter <b>3006</b> of the occluding device <b>3000</b> in the expanded configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>) may be greater than or about equal to the diameter <b>3002</b> of the occluding device <b>3000</b> in the compressed configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>). This may occur because the walls <b>3014</b> of the occluding device <b>3000</b> in the compressed configuration are exerting a radially expansive force to change into the expanded configuration. Similarly, the diameter <b>3006</b> of the occluding device <b>3000</b> in the expanded configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>) may be less than or about equal to the diameter <b>3010</b> of the occluding device <b>3000</b> in the hyperexpanded configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>). This may occur because the walls <b>3014</b> of the occluding device <b>3000</b> in the hyperexpanded configuration are exerting a radially compressive force to change into the expanded configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">In some embodiments, the diameter of the occluding device <b>3000</b> does not increase when changing from the expanded configuration into the hyperexpanded configuration. For example, applying an axially compressive force to the occluding device <b>3000</b> in the expanded configuration (thus, decreasing the length <b>3008</b>) to change into the hyperexpanded configuration does not cause the diameter of the occluding device <b>3000</b> to increase. In some embodiments, changing the length of the occluding device <b>3000</b>, such as by applying an axially compressive or expansive force, does not change the diameter of the occluding device <b>3000</b>. In some embodiments, changing the diameter of the occluding device <b>3000</b>, such as by applying a radially compressive or expansive force, does not change the length of the occluding device <b>3000</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36A</figref>, <b>36</b>B and <b>36</b>C illustrate various examples of relationships between the length and the diameter of the occluding device <b>3000</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36A</figref>, point <b>3602</b> represents the greater length and the lesser diameter of the occluding device <b>3000</b>. Point <b>3602</b> represents the greater length <b>3612</b> and the lesser diameter <b>3614</b> that the occluding device <b>3000</b> can be &#x201c;stretched&#x201d; to. That is, by applying an axially expansive force and/or a radially compressive force on the occluding device <b>3000</b>, occluding device <b>3000</b> may reach this point <b>3602</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">The greater length <b>3612</b> or the lesser diameter <b>3614</b> of the occluding device <b>3000</b> may vary depending on the treatment that the occluding device <b>3000</b> is used for, the materials used in making occluding device <b>3000</b>, the size of any storage or deployment devices utilizing the occluding device <b>3000</b>, or other factors. In some embodiments, the greater length <b>3612</b> of the occluding device <b>3000</b> is between about 2 times and about 5 times the unrestrained length <b>3616</b>. In some embodiments, the greater length <b>3612</b> is between about 5 times and about 10 times the unrestrained length <b>3616</b>. In some embodiments, the greater length <b>3612</b> is less than or equal to about 2 times or greater than about 10 times the unrestrained length <b>3616</b>. In some embodiments, the greater length <b>3612</b> may be when the occluding device <b>3000</b> is placed within a catheter. The greater length <b>3612</b> may be longer or shorter than the catheter. In some embodiments, the greater length <b>3612</b> when the occluding device <b>3000</b> is placed within a catheter is between about 40 mm and about 60 mm. In some embodiments, the greater length <b>3612</b> when the occluding device <b>3000</b> is placed within a catheter, the greater length <b>3612</b> is between about 25 mm and about 75 mm. In some embodiments, the greater length <b>3612</b> when the occluding device <b>3000</b> is placed within a catheter, the greater length <b>3612</b> is less than or equal to about 25 mm or greater than about 75 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">In some embodiments, the lesser diameter <b>3614</b> of the occluding device <b>3000</b> is between about 1% and about 5% of the unrestrained diameter <b>3618</b>.

In some embodiments, the length of the occluding device <b>3000</b> does not vary with the diameter of the occluding device <b>3000</b>. In some embodiments, the length of the occluding device <b>3000</b> varies with the diameter of the occluding device <b>3000</b> in any manner, such as linearly, inversely, exponentially, or logarithmically.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">Point <b>3604</b> represents the unrestrained length <b>3616</b> and the unrestrained diameter <b>3618</b> of the occluding device <b>3000</b> when the occluding device <b>3000</b> is in the expanded configuration. The unrestrained length <b>3616</b> or the unrestrained diameter <b>3618</b> of the occluding device <b>3000</b> may also vary depending on the treatment that the occluding device <b>3000</b> is used for, the materials used in making occluding device <b>3000</b>, the size of any storage or deployment devices utilizing the occluding device <b>3000</b>, or other factors. For example, the unrestrained length <b>3616</b> may be appropriately long enough for the treatment of aneurysms, such as being at least being longer than the neck of an aneurysm. In some embodiments, the unrestrained length <b>3616</b> is between about 8 mm and about 10.5 mm. In some embodiments, the unrestrained length <b>3616</b> is between about 5 mm and about 15 mm. In some embodiments, the unrestrained length <b>3616</b> is less than or equal to about 5 mm or greater than about 15 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">The unrestrained diameter <b>3618</b> of the occluding device <b>3000</b> may at least be approximately greater than the diameter of the blood vessel in which the occluding device <b>3000</b> is deployed in. That is, the unrestrained diameter <b>3618</b> may be greater than the diameter of the vessel such that a frictional force created between the contact of the occluding device <b>3000</b> and the walls of the vessel is great enough to prevent or reduce the likelihood the occluding device <b>3000</b> from migrating through the vessel. In some embodiments, the unrestrained diameter <b>3618</b> is between about 2.25 mm and about 5.25 mm. In some embodiments, the unrestrained diameter <b>3618</b> is between about 1.75 mm and about 6.5 mm.

<p id="p-0200" num="0199">In some embodiments, the number of strands that may be used for occluding device <b>3000</b> depends on the unrestrained diameter <b>3618</b>.

In some embodiments, decreasing the length of the occluding device <b>3000</b>, for example by applying an axially compressive force, does not cause the diameter of the occluding device <b>3000</b> to increase.

For example, by applying an axially expansive force to the occluding device <b>3000</b><i>a </i>in the first configuration, the occluding device <b>3000</b><i>a </i>may expand into a second configuration of the occluding device <b>3000</b><i>b</i>. Thus, the second lattice density <b>3622</b><i>b </i>may be lower than the first lattice density <b>3622</b><i>a</i>, and the second length <b>3624</b><i>b </i>may be greater than the first length <b>3624</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">Similarly, in some embodiments, applying an axially compressive force increases the lattice density and decreases the length. For example, by applying an axially compressive force to the occluding device <b>3000</b><i>b </i>in the second configuration, the occluding device <b>3000</b><i>b </i>may compress into the first configuration of the occluding device <b>3000</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the first lattice density <b>3622</b><i>a </i>may be greater than the second lattice density <b>3622</b><i>b</i>, and the first length <b>3624</b><i>a </i>may be lower than the second length <b>3624</b><i>b</i>. In some embodiments, applying an axially compressive or expansive force does not change the diameter <b>3626</b> of the occluding device <b>3000</b>. For example, the diameter <b>3626</b> remains substantially the same between the occluding device <b>3000</b><i>a </i>in the first configuration and the occluding device <b>3000</b><i>b </i>in the second configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36C</figref> illustrates an example of a relationship between the length <b>3630</b> and the diameter <b>3632</b> (as shown by diameters <b>3632</b><i>a </i>and <b>3632</b><i>b</i>) of the occluding device <b>3000</b> (as shown by occluding devices <b>3000</b><i>a </i>and <b>3000</b><i>b</i>). The occluding device <b>3000</b><i>a </i>may be in a first configuration, and comprises a length <b>3630</b>, a first diameter <b>3632</b><i>a</i>, and a first lattice density <b>3628</b><i>a</i>. A radially expansive force may be applied to the occluding device <b>3000</b><i>a</i>. In some embodiments, applying a radially expansive force decreases the lattice density and increases the diameter. For example, by applying a radially expansive force to the occluding device <b>3000</b><i>a </i>in the first configuration, the occluding device <b>3000</b><i>a </i>may expand into a second configuration of the occluding device <b>3000</b><i>b</i>. Thus, the second lattice density <b>3628</b><i>b </i>may be lower than the first lattice density <b>3628</b><i>a</i>, and the second diameter <b>3632</b><i>b </i>may be greater than the first diameter <b>3632</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">Similarly, in some embodiments, applying a radially compressive force increases the lattice density and decreases the diameter.

<p id="p-0207" num="0206"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-13</figref> show an embodiment of the occluding device <b>60</b> in which the lattice structure <b>63</b> of the occluding device <b>60</b> is non-uniform across the length of the occluding device <b>60</b>. Example occlusion devices, deployment devices, and deployment methods are described in U.S. Provisional Patent App. No. 60/574,429 and U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 11/136,395, 11/136,398, 11/420,023, 11/420,025, and 11/420,027, each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. In the mid-section <b>65</b> of the occluding device <b>60</b>, which is the section likely to be deployed at the neck of the aneurysm, the lattice density <b>63</b><i>a </i>is intentionally increased to a value significantly higher than the lattice density elsewhere in the occluding device <b>60</b>. For example, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, lattice density <b>63</b><i>a </i>is significantly higher than the lattice density <b>63</b> in adjacent section <b>64</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11B-11G</figref> illustrates other examples in which the lattice density varies across the length of the occluding device <b>60</b>. In some examples, the sections of the occluding device <b>60</b> with higher lattice densities <b>63</b><i>a </i>may be at the end, the middle, or other locations of the occluding device <b>60</b>. The occluding device <b>60</b> may also have different lattice densities across the length of the occluding device <b>60</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11F and 11G</figref>, the occluding device <b>60</b> may have a section with a lattice density <b>63</b><i>b </i>which is higher than lattice density <b>63</b> and lower than lattice density <b>63</b><i>a</i>. At one extreme, the lattice density could be 100%, i.e., the occluding device <b>60</b> is completely impermeable. In another embodiment, the lattice density <b>63</b>A in mid-section <b>65</b> could be about 50%, while the lattice density in the other sections <b>64</b> of the occluding device is about 25%. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows such an occluding device <b>60</b> in a curved configuration and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows this occluding device <b>60</b> deployed in the lumen of a vessel. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> also illustrates the part of the occluding device <b>60</b> with increased lattice density <b>63</b>A positioned along the neck of aneurysm <b>10</b>. As with any of the disclosed occluding devices, the lattice density of at least one portion of occluding device <b>60</b> can be between about 20% and about 30%. In some embodiments, the lattice density of at least one portion of occluding device <b>60</b> can be between about 30% and 65%. In some embodiments, the lattice density of at least one portion of occluding device <b>60</b> can be between about 65% and 95%. In some embodiments, the lattice density of at least one portion of occluding device <b>60</b> can be less than or equal to about 20% or greater than about 95%.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">The occluding device <b>60</b> may also be described in terms of porosity. According to one embodiment, the porosity of occluding device <b>60</b> may be equal to a ratio of an open surface area of the occluding device <b>60</b> to a total surface area of the occluding device <b>60</b>. Occluding device <b>60</b> may comprise a plurality of braided strands, which forms pores in open areas between the strands.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">In some embodiments, the pores have an average pore length. The average pore length may be any pore length suitable for aneurysm treatment or other types of treatments. In some embodiments, the average pore length is about 0.43 mm. In some embodiments, the average pore length is between about 0.15 mm and about 0.40 mm. In some embodiments, the average pore length is between about 0.4 mm and about 0.65 mm. In some embodiments, the average pore length is less than or equal to about 0.15 mm or greater than about 0.65 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">The pores may either increase or decrease in size depending on the structure of the occluding device <b>60</b>. For example, the porosity of a portion of the occluding device <b>60</b> can be reduced by axially compressing the portion of the occluding device <b>60</b>. By axially compressing the portion of the occluding device <b>60</b>, the open surface area decreases as the braided strands are compressed closer together, resulting in a reduced porosity.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">When the axially compressed portion of the occluding device <b>60</b> is unrestrained, the occluding device <b>60</b> may expand, resulting in an increased porosity. In some embodiments, the porosity of occluding device <b>60</b> can be between about 70% and about 80%. In some embodiments, the porosity of occluding device <b>60</b> can be between about 35% and 70%. In some embodiments, the porosity of occluding device <b>60</b> can be between about 5% and 35%. In some embodiments, the porosity of occluding device <b>60</b> can be less than or equal to about 5% or greater than about 80%.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">In some embodiments, the porosity is related to the pore length. For example, in some embodiments, the porosity multiplied by the average pore length is about 0.3 mm. In some embodiments, the porosity multiplied by the average pore length is between about 0.15 mm and about 0.3 mm. In some embodiments, the porosity multiplied by the average pore length is between about 0.3 mm and about 0.45 mm. In some embodiments, the porosity multiplied by the average pore length is less than or equal to about 0.15 mm or greater than about 0.45 mm. In one example, the porosity at 70% multiplied by the average pore length at 0.43 mm gives 0.3 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">In some embodiments, the porosity is related to the thickness of the braided strands. The braided strands may have an average strand thickness. In some embodiments, the average strand thickness is about 0.003 inches. In some embodiments, the average strand thickness is between about 0.001 inches and about 0.003 inches. In some embodiments, the average strand thickness is between about 0.003 inches and about 0.005 inches. In some embodiments, the average strand thickness is less than or equal to about 0.001 inches or greater than about 0.005 inches. The braided strands may comprise a ribbon having a width greater than its thickness. In other examples, the ribbon may have a width less than or equal to its thickness. In some embodiments, the porosity multiplied by the average strand thickness is about 0.002 inches. In some embodiments, the porosity multiplied by the average strand thickness is between about 0.001 inches and about 0.002 inches. In some embodiments, the porosity multiplied by the average strand thickness is between about 0.002 inches and about 0.004 inches. In some embodiments, the porosity multiplied by the average strand thickness is less than or equal to about 0.001 inches or greater than about 0.004 inches. For example, the porosity at 70% multiplied by the average strand thickness at 0.003 inches gives 0.002 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">In some embodiments, the pore size is related to the thickness of the braided strands. In some embodiments, the average pore length multiplied by the average strand thickness is about 9.4&#xd7;10-5 in<sup>2</sup>. In some embodiments, the average pore length multiplied by the average strand thickness is between about 4&#xd7;10-5 in<sup>2 </sup>and about 14&#xd7;10-5 in<sup>2</sup>. In some embodiments, the average pore length multiplied by the average strand thickness is less than or equal to about 4&#xd7;10-5 in<sup>2 </sup>or greater than about 14&#xd7;10-5 in<sup>2</sup>. For example, the average pore length at 0.6 mm multiplied by the average strand thickness at 0.004 inches results in a value of 9.4&#xd7;10-5 in<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">In some embodiments, the porosity of occluding device <b>60</b> is related to the volume of the pore and is configure to facilitate endotheliazation of the stented vessel. In such embodiments, that pore area can be multiplied by the average or actual stent thickness to determine the volume of space defined by each stent pore. By selecting a desired stent pore volume, endotheliazation of the stented vessel can be enhanced. In some embodiments, other parameters may be used to optimize or enhance functions of the stent, such as the average pore length, the average strand thickness, the average pore size, or other dimensions.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">Another embodiment of the occluding device <b>300</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>. In this embodiment, the occluding device <b>300</b> is deployed in lumen of a vessel with an aneurysm. The occluding device <b>300</b> includes a surface <b>310</b> that faces the lumen of the aneurysm. This surface <b>310</b> has a significantly higher lattice density (smaller and/or fewer interstices) compared to the diametrically opposite surface <b>320</b>. Due to the higher lattice density of surface <b>310</b>, less blood flows into the lumen of the aneurysm. However, there is no negative impact on the blood flow to the side branches as the lattice density of the surface <b>320</b> facing the side branches is not reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">As set forth in the examples above, different portions of the occluding device may have different lattice densities such that flow of fluids or blood may be controlled based on the location within the occluding device. The lattice densities may further be controlled by an input received at the occluding device. The input for controlling the lattice densities of different portions of the occluding device may include, for example, a pressure or motion force applied to a portion of the occluding device. The occluding device in this example may include helically-wound material such as strands or ribbons in a lattice structure as described herein. The strands that are helically wound may be movable relative to each other. For example, a first strand and a second strand may be helically wound to form a lattice structure that includes crossing strands (the first strand and the second strand may cross over each other) interspersed with openings between the strands.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">In another example, the lattice structure formed by crossing strands of the occluding device may be adjustable based on the input as described (e.g., motion, pressure or force input). When the input is received at the occluding device, the strands may move relative to each other. For example, a portion of the first strand may move closer to a corresponding portion of the second strand and a second portion of the first strand may also move farther from a corresponding first portion of the second strand. Hence, in this example, the spacing between the first and second strands of helically wound material forming the lattice structure of the occluding device may vary to create different lattice densities. Different portions of an occluding device may have different lattice densities when strands in one portion of the occluding device move closer to each other while strands in another portion of the occluding device move farther away from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">Also, the relative movement of the strands may be controlled based on an input received at the occluding device. As set forth above, the input may include any type of input for moving or adjusting the occluding device including, for example, pressure, force, motion, rotation, or other similar input.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">The occluding device, or stent, may be placed into a blood vessel and a certain portion of the occluding device may contain a high lattice density while retaining a lower lattice density in a different portion of the occluding device. The received input may control the placement and/or lattice density of the occluding device to achieve a desired lattice density at a selected portion of the occluding device. Thus, the input received at the occluding device may cause a first portion of the occluding device to have a first lattice density and a second portion of the occluding device to have a second lattice density in which the first lattice density and the second lattice density are different.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">In one example, a user may insert the occluding device into the blood vessel and may apply pressure on the occluding device to cause an adjustment of the lattice density of the occluding device. In another example, a motion force may be applied to the occluding device such that the strands of the occluding device forming the lattice structure may move relative to one another in at least one portion of the occluding device. The strands may also be rearranged differently at different portions of the occluding device such that the lattice density may vary from one portion of the occluding device to another portion of the occluding device.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">For example, the occluding device may include a lattice density adjusting implement such that pressure exerted by the lattice density adjusting implement on a portion of the occluding device may cause the lattice density of the portion of the occluding device acted upon by the lattice density adjusting implement to obtain a desired lattice density. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> illustrates an example of an occluding device <b>3101</b> containing a lattice density adjusting implement <b>3102</b> for adjusting the lattice density at any desired portion of the occluding device <b>3101</b>. The user may exert a force on a proximal end of the lattice density adjusting implement <b>3102</b> which may cause a distal end of the lattice density adjusting implement to adjust the lattice material for altering the lattice density. In addition, movement of the lattice density adjusting implement <b>3102</b> may enable a user to adjust the lattice density of any desired portion of the occluding device. In some embodiments, the lattice density adjusting implement <b>3102</b> is not required to adjust the lattice density.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">The occluding device may further be administered and positioned into a vessel via a delivery device. For example, a delivery device may include a tubular structure such as a catheter through which the occluding device may be placed into a vessel. The delivery device may further include the lattice density adjusting implement <b>3102</b> that may be used to adjust the lattice density of the occluding device. The lattice density adjusting implement <b>3102</b> may further adjust the lattice density only at one portion of the occluding device while not affecting other portions of the occluding device, if desired. Alternatively, the lattice density adjusting implement <b>3102</b> may be used to increase the lattice density at one portion of the occluding device while decreasing the lattice density at another portion of the occluding device. The lattice density adjusting implement <b>3102</b> may be controlled by pressure or motion forces applied via the delivery device.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">In one example, the lattice density adjusting implement <b>3102</b> may be connected to a wire to a proximal end of the delivery device. The user may apply a force to the proximal end of the wire at the proximal end of the delivery device. The force applied which may be a pressure or motion force, for example, may cause corresponding movement of the lattice density adjusting implement <b>3102</b>. The movement of the lattice density adjusting implement <b>3102</b> may further contact strands of the occluding device to move the strands. The movement of the strands of the occluding device may cause a change in the lattice density in at least one portion of the occluding device. Hence, user input may control a lattice density adjusting implement <b>3102</b> to cause varying lattice densities in selected portions of the occluding device.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">In another example, the lattice density of the occluding device may be adjusted based on movement of the occluding device, or part of the device, in a blood vessel. For example, the occluding device may be placed and moved within a blood vessel. As the occluding device is moved in the blood vessel, the lattice density in selected portions of the occluding device may be adjusted accordingly. The lattice density in one portion of the occluding device may increase while the lattice density in another portion of the occluding device may increase, decrease or stay the same. In one example, the occluding device contacts a wall of the blood vessel and a force is applied to a proximal end of the occluding device. For example a user may apply a force to a proximal end of the occluding device. This force, which may be a pressure or motion force, for example, may be applied at a proximal end of a delivery device through which the occluding device may be positioned in a vessel and may be adjusted in the vessel. The applied force causes the strands or ribbons of the occluding device to adjust such that the lattice density in the occluding device varies based on the portion of the occluding device.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">As one example, the occluding device contains intertwining ribbons forming a lattice structure with a lattice density. The occluding device is introduced to a site in a blood vessel of an aneurysm. The occluding device is further applied to the portion of the blood vessel at and around the aneurysm as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The outer sides of the occluding device may be in contact with at least a portion of the blood vessel in areas surrounding the aneurysm, however, the outer side of the occluding device at the site of the aneurysm does not contact a wall of the blood vessel. This may be because the aneurysm is situated such that the wall of the aneurysm protrudes outward from the wall of the surround blood vessel such that the outer sides or surface of the occluding device does not directly contact the inner surface of the wall of the aneurysm.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">Pressure may be applied to, for example, a proximal end of the occluding device. In this example, the lattice structure of the occluding device is freely adjustable such that the pressure may cause movement of the lattice structure of the occluding device in a distal direction. Frictional forces acting on the occluding device from the inner surface of the walls of the blood vessel in contact with the outer sides or surfaces of the occluding device may impede movement of the lattice structure in areas of the occluding device in contact with the wall of the blood vessel. However, gradual movement of the occluding device in the blood vessel can be accomplished by application of pressure or force at the proximal end of the occluding device.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">In some embodiments, a portion of the occluding device overlying the neck of the aneurysm does not contact the walls of the blood vessel. Because this portion of the occluding device subject to less frictional forces as compared to the portion of the occluding device in direct contact with the inner wall of the blood vessel, the lattice structure of the occluding device overlying the aneurysm may change as the applied force causes the portion of the occluding device proximal to the aneurysm to move distally to cause an increase in force applied to the portion of the occluding device overlying the aneurysm. Also, the section of the occluding device overlying the blood vessel wall distal to the aneurysm may be subject to higher frictional forces than that applied to the portion of the occluding device overlying the aneurysm. As a result, in some embodiments, the lattice density of the occluding device overlying the aneurysm is increased. In some embodiments, the lattice density of the occluding device either does not increase or increases to a lesser degree than the portion of the occluding device overlying the aneurysm.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">In another example, an aneurysm may be located at a branching of a blood vessel as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>. The occluding device is placed such that a first portion <b>3201</b> of the occluding device may be located proximal to a blood vessel branch and aneurysms. A second portion <b>3202</b> of the occluding device may be located overlying the blood vessel branch <b>3208</b>, a third portion of the occluding device may be located overlying a portion of the blood vessel distal to the blood vessel branch <b>3208</b> and proximal to a first aneurysm <b>3209</b>, a fourth portion of the occluding device may be located overlying the first aneurysm <b>3209</b>, a fifth portion of the occluding device may overlie the portion of the blood vessel distal to the first aneurysm <b>3209</b> and proximal to a second aneurysm <b>3210</b>. A sixth portion of the occluding device may overlie the second aneurysm <b>3210</b>. Blockage of blood flow to the aneurysms may be desired, however, blockage of blood flow to the branched blood vessel may not be desired.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">In this example, a user may apply a pressure or force to a proximal end of an occluding device to cause a portion of the occluding device to advance in the blood vessel in a distal direction. The first portion <b>3201</b> of the occluding device (proximal to the blood vessel branch <b>3208</b> and the aneurysms <b>3209</b> and <b>3210</b>) may transmit the force to more distal portions of the occluding device, including the second portion <b>3202</b> of the occluding device located over the blood vessel branch <b>3208</b>. The frictional force impeding advancement of the occluding device in the second portion <b>3202</b> of the occluding device is low because the second portion <b>3202</b> of the occluding device does not contact the wall (or contacts it less than the first portion) of the blood vessel directly. Rather, the second portion <b>3202</b> of the occluding device overlies a blood vessel branch <b>3208</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>. Hence, the lattice density in the second portion <b>3202</b> of the occluding device increases as the first portion <b>3201</b> of the occluding device transfers the force to the second portion <b>3202</b> of the occluding device. Also a negative force applied to the occluding device may cause the lattice density in the second portion <b>3202</b> of the occluding device to decrease, thus permitting flow of blood into the blood vessel branch <b>3208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">The second portion <b>3202</b> of the occluding device also transfers the force to the third portion <b>3203</b> of the occluding device overlying the portion of blood vessel distal to the blood vessel branch <b>3208</b>. However, the frictional forces acting on the third portion <b>3203</b> of the occluding device is higher than those frictional forces acting on the second portion <b>3202</b> because the third portion <b>3203</b> of the occluding device is in contact with the wall of the blood vessel. Hence, the lattice density of the occluding device in the third portion <b>3203</b> is initially lower than the lattice density of the occluding device in the second portion <b>3202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">The force applied to the third portion <b>3203</b> of the occluding device (overlying and in contact with the portion of the blood vessel distal to the blood vessel branch <b>3208</b> and first aneurysm <b>3209</b>) is transferred to the fourth portion <b>3204</b> of the occluding device, which is the portion of the occluding device overlying the first aneurysm <b>3209</b>. The frictional forces acting on the fourth portion <b>3204</b> of the occluding device is lower than the frictional forces acting on the third portion <b>3203</b> of the occluding device because the fourth portion <b>3204</b> of the occluding device is not in direct contact with the inner wall of the blood vessel. Hence, the pressure applied to the fourth portion <b>3204</b> of the occluding device causes the lattice density in the fourth portion <b>3204</b> of the occluding device to increase.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">Also, the force applied to the fourth portion <b>3204</b> of the occluding device may be transferred to the fifth portion <b>3205</b> of the occluding device, which is in contact with the portion of the blood vessel between the first aneurysm <b>3209</b> and the second aneurysm <b>3210</b>. The frictional force acting on the fifth portion <b>3205</b> of the occluding device is greater than the frictional force acting on the fourth portion <b>3204</b> of the occluding device because at least a portion of the fifth portion <b>3205</b> of the occluding device is in contact with the inner wall of the blood vessel. However, the fourth portion <b>3204</b> of the occluding device overlies the second aneurysm <b>3209</b> and is not in contact with the wall of the blood vessel. Hence, the difference in the frictional forces applied to the portions of the occluding device results in controlled changes in the lattice density of different portions of the occluding device in this example.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">Also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> is the sixth portion <b>3206</b> of the occluding device that overlies the second aneurysm <b>3210</b>. The frictional forces acting upon the sixth portion <b>3206</b> of the occluding device is less than the frictional force acting on the fifth portion of the occluding device <b>3205</b> because the sixth portion <b>3206</b> of the occluding device does not contact a wall of the blood vessel directly. Therefore, the force transferred from the fifth portion <b>3205</b> of the occluding device to the sixth portion <b>3206</b> of the occluding device may cause the lattice density of the sixth portion <b>3206</b> to increase. Hence, the lattice density of the fourth portion and the sixth portion of the occluding device may be increased by application of a pressure or motion force at the occluding device. Also, retraction of the occluding device such as by pulling a proximal end of the occluding device proximally may cause the lattice density of the second portion of the occluding device to decrease. This may cause increased flow of blood and/or fluids into the blood vessel branch <b>3208</b> while impeding flow of blood and/or fluids into the first or second aneurysms (<b>3209</b>, <b>3210</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref> illustrates another embodiment of the occluding device <b>3700</b>. The occluding device <b>3700</b> may be utilized to treat various forms of aneurysms. For example, the occluding device <b>3700</b> may be used to treat an aneurysm <b>3702</b> (as shown by aneurysm portions <b>3702</b><i>a</i>, <b>3702</b><i>b </i>and <b>3702</b><i>c</i>), which is a fusiform aneurysm. The occluding device <b>3700</b> may be deployed such that a distal portion <b>3710</b> of the occluding device <b>3700</b> arrives at a target site to treat the aneurysm <b>3702</b>. The occluding device <b>3700</b> may be deployed using any number of methods. For example, a catheter can store the occluding device <b>3700</b> in a compressed configuration and advance occluding device <b>3700</b> to the target site, upon which the distal portion <b>3710</b> of the occluding device <b>3700</b> is deployed. As the occluding device <b>3700</b> is deployed from the catheter, the occluding device <b>3700</b> may expand into the expanded configuration. At the distal portion <b>3710</b>, the occluding device <b>3700</b> makes contact with the vessel wall distal to the aneurysm <b>3702</b>. The catheter may further be retracted to deploy the rest of the occluding device <b>3700</b>, for example, allowing a middle portion <b>3714</b> (as shown by <b>3714</b><i>a </i>and <b>3714</b><i>b</i>) and a proximal portion <b>3712</b> (as shown by <b>3712</b><i>a </i>and <b>3712</b><i>b</i>) to expand. The middle portion <b>3714</b>, because of a greater diameter of the occluding device <b>3700</b> may not expand all the way to make contact with the aneurysm walls <b>3716</b>. The proximal portion <b>3712</b> of the occluding device <b>3700</b> may make contact with the vessel walls proximal to the aneurysm <b>3702</b> after expanding from the compressed configuration into the expanded configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">The porosity of middle portion <b>3714</b> may be adjusted to reduce the blood flow <b>3704</b> into the aneurysm <b>3702</b>. For example, the porosity of the middle portion <b>3714</b> can be reduced by applying an axially compressive force to the proximal portion <b>3712</b> of the occluding device <b>3700</b> towards the direction of the distal portion <b>3710</b>. The axially compressive force may be greater than the frictional force caused by the contact between the proximal portion <b>3712</b> and the vessel walls. The axially compressive force may continue to be applied until the porosity of the middle portion <b>3714</b> has been reduced appropriately to treat the aneurysm <b>3702</b>. The porosity of the middle portion <b>3714</b> may be adjusted by applying either an axially compressive force to the proximal portion <b>3712</b> or an axially expansive force to the proximal portion <b>3712</b> (e.g., by pulling proximal portion <b>3712</b> against the direction of the blood flow <b>3704</b>). A similar technique may be applied to the distal portion <b>3710</b> as well.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">The porosity of middle portion <b>3714</b><i>b</i>, specifically, may be adjusted so that it is higher than the porosity of the middle portion <b>3714</b><i>a </i>in order to allow sufficient blood flow <b>3706</b> into branch vessel <b>3708</b> while at the same time reducing blood flow to the aneurysm portion <b>3702</b><i>a</i>. This can be achieved by applying a lower axially compressive force to the proximal portion <b>3712</b><i>b </i>relative to the proximal portion <b>3712</b><i>a</i>. Alternatively, the porosity of the middle portion <b>3714</b><i>b </i>can be adjusted alone by applying either an axially compressive force to the proximal portion <b>3712</b><i>b </i>or an axially expansive force to the proximal portion <b>3712</b><i>b</i>. For example, if the porosity of middle portion <b>3714</b><i>b </i>is too low to allow blood flow <b>3706</b> into branch vessel <b>3708</b>, an axially expansive force may be applied to proximal portion <b>3712</b><i>b </i>(e.g., pulling on proximal portion <b>3712</b><i>b</i>). This may result in the middle portion <b>3714</b><i>b </i>expanding to increase the porosity of the middle portion <b>3714</b><i>b</i>, allowing more blood to flow into branch vessel <b>3708</b>. Furthermore, the porosity of middle portion <b>3714</b><i>b </i>may be adjusted by using an adjusting implement (such as adjusting implement <b>3102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>), as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">The porosity of the middle portion <b>3714</b><i>b </i>may be adjusted such that substantial thrombosis may occur within aneurysm <b>3702</b> while at the same time allowing blood flow <b>3706</b> into branch vessel <b>3708</b>. In some embodiments, the porosity of the middle portion <b>3714</b><i>b </i>may be adjusted such that endotheliazation may occur outlining the blood flow <b>3706</b> through the aneurysm <b>3702</b>. For example, the porosity of the middle portion <b>3714</b><i>b </i>may be adjusted such that substantial thrombosis may occur within aneurysm <b>3702</b>, particularly within aneurysm portions <b>3702</b><i>a</i>, <b>3702</b><i>b </i>and <b>3702</b><i>c</i>, while at the same time allowing an endothelium <b>3718</b> to develop around the aneurysm portions <b>3702</b><i>b </i>and <b>3702</b><i>c</i>, outlining the blood flow <b>3706</b>. In some embodiments, the porosity of the middle portion <b>3714</b><i>b </i>to achieve this endotheliazation effect is between about 5% and 35%. In some embodiments, the porosity of the middle portion <b>3714</b><i>b </i>to achieve this endotheliazation effect is between about 35% and about 70%. In some embodiments, the porosity of the middle portion <b>3714</b><i>b </i>to achieve this endotheliazation effect is between about 70% and 80%. In some embodiments, the porosity of the middle portion <b>3714</b><i>b </i>to achieve this endotheliazation effect is less than or equal to about 5% or greater than about 80%.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">This endotheliazation effect may be achieved depending on the foregoing factors or other factors. For example, in some embodiments, applying a delayed occlusion as described above may result in such an endotheliazation effect. In some embodiments, the wall thickness of middle portion <b>3714</b><i>b </i>as described above may result in such an endotheliazation effect. In some embodiments, the pore size of the pores of middle portion <b>3714</b><i>b </i>as described above may result in such an endotheliazation effect. In some embodiments, the width of the strands or the thickness of the strands of middle portion <b>3714</b><i>b </i>as described above may result in such an endotheliazation effect. In some embodiments, the shape of the strand as described above may result in such an endotheliazation effect. In some embodiments, the endotheliazation effect may be achieved based on any of the foregoing factors alone or in combination with any of the other factors.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">Any of the occluding devices disclosed herein can be used with a second occluding device to create a bifurcated occluding device <b>400</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. This device could be created in vivo. In forming the occluding device <b>400</b>, a portion of a first occluding device <b>410</b> having a low density can be combined with a portion of a second occluding device <b>410</b> that also has a low density. The occluding devices <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> can be any of those discussed herein. After these portions of the two occluding devices <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> are combined in an interwoven fashion to form an interwoven region <b>425</b>, the remaining portions <b>414</b>, <b>424</b> can branch off in different directions, thereby extending along two branches of the bifurcation. Areas outside of the interwoven region <b>425</b> can have greater lattice density for treating an aneurysm or lesser lattice density for allowing flow to branches <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> of the vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">Additional and/or other embodiments of the occluding device are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38-42</figref>. Multiple occluding devices may be utilized wherein at least a portion of each of the occluding devices overlap with each other. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> illustrates a first occluding device <b>3800</b>. A second occluding device <b>3900</b> may be deployed within the first occluding device <b>3800</b>. In some embodiments, the first occluding device <b>3800</b> and the second occluding device <b>3900</b> may be identical occluding devices. Thus, the porosity of the first occluding device <b>3800</b> and the second occluding device <b>3900</b> may be the same when both devices are unrestrained. The overlapping portion <b>3850</b> of the first occluding device <b>3800</b> and the second occluding device <b>3900</b> may provide a combined porosity that is less than the porosity of the same portion of the first occluding device <b>3800</b> or the second occluding device <b>3900</b> alone. The second occluding device <b>3800</b> may be deployed completely within the first occluding device <b>3900</b> or a portion of the occluding device <b>3800</b> may be deployed within the first occluding device <b>3800</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 39 and 41</figref>. Although two occluding devices are illustrated, more occluding devices may be used in combination with each other to provide various combined porosities that may be substantially lower than the porosity an individual occluding device may provide.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">In some embodiments, the first occluding device <b>3800</b> may be deployed within a vessel <b>3806</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> in a cross sectional view. For example, the first occluding device <b>3800</b> may be in a compressed configuration before deployment. Upon deploying the first occluding device <b>3800</b> within the vessel <b>3806</b>, the first occluding device <b>3800</b> expands into the expanded configuration with a first diameter <b>3804</b>, thus creating contact between the first occluding device <b>3800</b> and the walls of the vessel <b>3806</b>. The second occluding device <b>3900</b> may similarly be deployed with at least a portion of the second occluding device <b>3900</b> within the first occluding device <b>3800</b>. For example, the second occluding device <b>3900</b> may be in a compressed configuration before deployment. Upon deploying the second occluding device <b>3900</b> within the first occluding device <b>3800</b> (which is already in the expanded configuration), the second occluding device <b>3900</b> expands into the expanded configuration, thus creating contact between the second occluding device <b>3900</b> and either the inner wall <b>3802</b> of the first occluding device <b>3800</b>, the walls of the vessel <b>3806</b>, or both. This process may be repeated with more occluding devices to provide an appropriate combined porosity for aneurysm treatment or other types of treatments.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">Multiple occluding devices may be utilized to treat aneurysms as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>. For example, the first occluding device <b>3800</b> may be deployed to treat the aneurysm <b>4202</b> using similar techniques as described above. The first occluding device <b>3800</b> comprises a distal portion <b>3810</b> and a proximal portion <b>3812</b>, and extends such that the proximal portion <b>3812</b> is proximal to the aneurysm <b>4202</b> while the distal portion <b>3810</b> is distal to the aneurysm <b>4202</b>. The second occluding device <b>3900</b> may be deployed within the first occluding device <b>3800</b>. The second occluding device <b>3900</b> comprises a distal portion <b>3910</b> and a proximal portion <b>3912</b>. The second occluding device <b>3900</b> may be positioned such that the second occluding device <b>3900</b> is substantially adjacent to the aneurysm <b>4202</b>. For example, the proximal portion <b>3912</b> of the second occluding device <b>3900</b> is positioned distal to the proximal portion <b>3812</b> of the first occluding device <b>3800</b> and the distal portion <b>3910</b> of the second occluding device <b>3900</b> is positioned proximal to the distal portion <b>3810</b> of the first occluding device <b>3800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">The first occluding device <b>3800</b> and the second occluding device <b>3900</b> may have substantially the same porosity or different porosities when unrestrained. The overlapping portion <b>3850</b> may result in a combined porosity that is lower than the porosity of the first occluding device <b>3800</b> or the porosity of the second occluding device <b>3900</b>, resulting in reduced blood flow <b>4204</b> into aneurysm <b>4202</b>. The combined porosity may be adjusted in various ways, for example by individually adjusting the porosity of the first occluding device <b>3800</b>, the second occluding device <b>3900</b>, or by adding more occluding devices to decrease the combined porosity. At one extreme, the combined porosity may be adjusted to substantially 0%, or any other porosity resulting in little to no blood flow <b>4204</b> into aneurysm <b>4202</b>, inducing substantial thrombosis within the aneurysm <b>4202</b> over time.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">In one example, the porosity of the first occluding device <b>3800</b> may be adjusted before the second occluding device <b>3900</b> is deployed, using similar techniques as described above. Subsequently, the porosity of the second occluding device <b>3900</b> may be adjusted upon deployment of the second occluding device <b>3900</b>. For example, the distal portion <b>3910</b> of the second occluding device <b>3900</b> may be in a compressed configuration and advanced to an area proximal to the distal portion <b>3810</b> of the first occluding device <b>3800</b>. The distal portion <b>3910</b> of the second occluding device <b>3900</b> may be allowed to expand to make contact with the first occluding device <b>3800</b>. The rest of the second occluding device <b>3900</b> may be deployed such that the porosity of the second occluding device <b>3900</b> is decreased by allowing more portions of the second occluding device <b>3900</b> to expand closer to the distal portion <b>3910</b> of the second occluding device <b>3900</b>. Alternatively, the porosity of the second occluding device <b>3900</b> can be increased by allowing more portions of the second occluding device <b>3900</b> to expand farther from the distal portion <b>3910</b> of the second occluding device <b>3900</b>. Thus, the combined porosity may be adjusted by first adjusting the porosity of the first occluding device <b>3800</b> and then adjusting the porosity of the second occluding device <b>3900</b> upon deployment.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">In some embodiments, the combined porosity may be adjusted after both the first occluding device <b>3800</b> and the second occluding device <b>3900</b> have been deployed. For example, an axially compressive force may be applied to the proximal portion <b>3812</b> of the first occluding device <b>3800</b> towards the direction of the distal portion <b>3810</b>. The axially compressive force may be greater than the frictional force caused by the contact between the proximal portion <b>3712</b> and the vessel walls. The axially compressive force may continue to be applied until the combined porosity of the overlapping portion <b>3850</b> has been reduced appropriately to treat the aneurysm <b>4202</b>. In some embodiments, the second occluding device <b>3900</b> may expand and make contact with the first occluding device <b>3800</b> such that the axially compressive force applied to the first occluding device <b>3800</b> is less than or equal to the frictional force caused by the contact between the first occluding device <b>3800</b> and the second occluding device <b>3900</b>. As a result, applying the axially compressive force to the first occluding device <b>3800</b> also causes the portion of the second occluding device <b>3900</b> in contact with first occluding device <b>3800</b> to compress, resulting in a combined reduced porosity. The combined porosity of the overlapping portion <b>3850</b> may be adjusted by applying either an axially compressive force to the proximal portion <b>3812</b> or an axially expansive force to the proximal portion <b>3812</b> (e.g., by pulling proximal portion <b>3812</b> against the direction of the blood flow <b>4204</b>). A similar result can be achieved by applying the same technique to the proximal portion <b>3912</b> of the second occluding device <b>3900</b>. Furthermore, similar techniques may also be applied to the distal portions <b>3810</b> and <b>3910</b> as well.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">In some embodiments, the second occluding device <b>3900</b> may expand and make contact with the first occluding device <b>3800</b> such that the axially compressive force applied to the first occluding device <b>3800</b> is greater than the frictional force caused by the contact between the first occluding device <b>3800</b> and the second occluding device <b>3900</b>. In such a case, the porosity of the first occluding device <b>3800</b> or the porosity of the second occluding device <b>3900</b> may be adjusted independent of each other. For example, the porosity of any portion of the first occluding device <b>3800</b> may be adjusted applying either an axially compressive force to the proximal portion <b>3812</b> or an axially expansive force to the proximal portion <b>3812</b>. Similarly, the porosity of any portion of the second occluding device <b>3900</b> may be adjusted by applying either an axially compressive force to the proximal portion <b>3912</b> or an axially expansive force to the proximal portion <b>3912</b>. By individually adjusting the porosity of the first occluding device <b>3800</b> or the second occluding device <b>3900</b>, the combined porosity of the overlapping portion <b>3850</b> may also be adjusted. Furthermore, the porosity of the overlapping portion <b>3850</b> may be adjusted by using an adjusting implement (such as adjusting implement <b>3102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>) and applying an axially compressive or expansive force to the portions of the first occluding device <b>3800</b> or the second occluding device <b>3900</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">The density of the lattice for each of the disclosed occluding devices can be about 20% to about 80% of the surface area of its occluding device. In an embodiment, the lattice density can be about 20% to about 50% of the surface area of its occluding device. In yet another embodiment, the lattice density can be about 20% to about 30% of the surface area of its occluding device.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">In another example, the lattice density of an occluding device may be adjusted or altered by user input such as a user input motion. The input motion may be in a longitudinal orientation. For example, an input force or pressure may in a direction along a longitudinal axis of the occluding device may be received at a portion of the occluding device. The portion of the occluding device may have a lattice density prior to the application of the force, pressure or movement of the strands of the occluding device in the portion of the occluding device receiving the input force. The lattice density in the portion of the occluding device may change based on the received input. For example, the strands of the occluding device may move in a longitudinal direction in the occluding device. Also, the longitudinal movement of strands of the occluding device may occur at a portion of the occluding device or may occur at the entire occluding device. In the example of longitudinal movement of strands of the occluding device at a portion of the occluding device, the strands at the portion of the occluding device may move based on the received input such that the lattice density of the occluding device at the portion of the occluding device receiving the input may increase. Alternatively, the lattice in a portion of the occluding device may also decrease in response to the input force, pressure or motion. Also, based on the input force, pressure, or motion, the lattice density in a first portion of the occluding device may increase while the lattice density in a second portion of the occluding device may decrease or stay the same. Hence, different portions of the occluding device may have a different movement based on an input received at the occluding device such that one portion of the occluding device may have an increase or decrease in lattice density while any other portion of the occluding device may have a decrease or increase in the lattice density. Alternatively, the lattice density in any of the portions of the occluding device may stay the same.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">A typical occluding device having sixteen strand braids with about 0.005 inch wide ribbon, 30 picks per inch (PPI) (number of crosses/points of contact per inch), and about 0.09 inch outer diameter has approximately 30% of lattice density (surface covered by the ribbon). In the embodiments disclosed herein, the ribbon can be about 0.001 inch thick with a width of between about 0.002 inch to about 0.005 inch. In an embodiment, the ribbon has a thickness of about 0.004 inch. For a 16-strands ribbon that is about 0.001 inch thick and about 0.004 inch wide, the coverage for 50 PPI, 40 PPI, and 30 PPI will have 40%, 32% and 24% approximate surface coverage, respectively. For a 16-strands ribbon that is about 0.001 inch thick and about 0.005 inch wide, the coverage for 50 PPI, 40 PPI, and 30 PPI will be about 50%, 40% and 30% approximate surface coverage, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">In choosing a size for the ribbon, one may consider whether, when the ribbons are bundled up, they will slide through a delivery catheter. For example, sixteen strands of a 0.006 inch wide ribbon may not slide through a catheter having an internal diameter of about 0.027 inch or less as well as stents having a smaller contracted configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">While other strand geometry may be used, these other geometries, such as round, will limit the device due to their thickness dimension. For example, a round wire with about a 0.002 inch diameter may occupy up to about 0.008 inch in cross sectional space within the vessel. This space can impact and disrupt the blood flow through the vessel. The flow in the vessel can be disrupted with this change in diameter.</p>

In an alternative embodiment, the guidewire assembly <b>20</b> can have longitudinal sections, each with differing degrees of flexion/stiffness. The different degrees of flexions for the guidewire assembly <b>20</b> can be created using different materials and/or thicknesses within different longitudinal sections of the guidewire <b>41</b>. In another embodiment, the flexion of the guidewire <b>41</b> can be controlled by spaced cuts (not shown) formed within the delivery guidewire <b>41</b>. These cuts can be longitudinally and/or circumferentially spaced from each other. The cuts can be formed with precision within the delivery guidewire <b>41</b>. Different sections of the delivery guidewire <b>41</b> can include cuts formed with different spacing and different depths to provide these distinct sections with different amounts of flexion and stiffness. In any of the above embodiments, the guidewire assembly <b>20</b> and the guidewire <b>41</b> are responsive to torque applied to the guidewire assembly <b>20</b> by the operator. As discussed below, the torque applied to the guidewire assembly <b>20</b> via the guidewire <b>41</b> can be used to release the occluding device <b>100</b> from the guidewire assembly <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">The size and shape of the cuts formed within the delivery guidewire <b>41</b> may be controlled so as to provide greater or lesser amounts of flexibility. Because the cuts can be varied in width without changing the depth or overall shape of the cut, the flexibility of the delivery guidewire <b>41</b> may be selectively altered without affecting the torsional strength of the delivery guidewire <b>41</b>. Thus, the flexibility and torsional strength of the delivery guidewire <b>41</b> may be selectively and independently altered.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">Advantageously, longitudinally adjacent pairs of cuts may be rotated about 90 degrees around the circumference of the delivery guidewire <b>41</b> from one another to provide flexure laterally and vertically. However, the cuts may be located at predetermined locations to provide preferential flexure in one or more desired directions. Of course, the cuts could be randomly formed to allow bending (flexion) equally, non-preferentially in all directions or planes. In one embodiment, this could be achieved by circumferentially spacing the cuts.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">The flexible delivery guidewire <b>41</b> can include any number of sections having the same or differing degrees of flexion. For example, the flexible delivery guidewire <b>41</b> could include two or more sections. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>, the flexible delivery guidewire <b>41</b> includes three sections, each having a different diameter. Each section can have a diameter of about 0.003 inch to about 0.025 inch. In an embodiment, the diameter of one or more sections can be about 0.010 inch to about 0.020 inch. A first section <b>42</b> includes a proximal end <b>47</b> that is located opposite the position of the occluding device <b>100</b>. The first section <b>42</b> can have a constant thickness along its length. Alternatively, the first section <b>42</b> can have a thickness (diameter) that tapers along its entire length or only a portion of its length. In the tapered embodiment, the thickness (diameter) of the first section <b>42</b> decreases in the direction of a second, transition section <b>44</b>. For those embodiments in which the guidewire <b>41</b> has a circular cross section, the thickness is the diameter of the section.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262">The second, transition section <b>44</b> extends between the first section <b>42</b> and a third, distal section <b>46</b>. The second section <b>44</b> tapers in thickness from the large diameter of the first section <b>42</b> to the smaller diameter of the third section <b>46</b>. As with the first section <b>42</b>, the second section <b>44</b> can taper along its entire length or only a portion of its length.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">The third section <b>46</b> has a smaller thickness compared to the other sections <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> of the delivery guidewire <b>41</b>. The third section <b>46</b> extends away from the tapered second section <b>44</b> that carries the occluding device <b>100</b>. The third section <b>46</b> can taper along its entire length from the second section <b>44</b> to the distal end <b>27</b> of the delivery guidewire <b>41</b>. Alternatively, the third section <b>46</b> can have a constant diameter or taper along only a portion of its length. In such an embodiment, the tapering portion of the third section <b>46</b> can extend from the second section <b>44</b> or a point spaced from the second section <b>44</b> to a point spaced from distal end <b>27</b> of the delivery guidewire <b>41</b>. Although three sections of the delivery guidewire <b>41</b> are discussed and illustrated, the delivery guidewire <b>41</b> can include more than three sections. Additionally, each of these sections can taper in their thickness (diameter) along all or only a portion of their length. In any of the disclosed embodiments, the delivery guidewire <b>41</b> can be formed of a shape memory alloy such as Nitinol.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0264">A tip <b>28</b> and flexible tip coil <b>29</b> are secured to the distal end <b>27</b> of the delivery guidewire <b>41</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 46 and 47</figref>. The tip <b>28</b> can include a continuous end cap or cover as shown in the figures, which securely receives a distal end of the tip coil <b>29</b>. Flexion control is provided to the distal end portion of the delivery guidewire <b>41</b> by the tip coil <b>29</b>. However, in an embodiment, the tip <b>28</b> can be free of the coil <b>29</b>. The tip <b>28</b> has a non-percutaneous, atraumatic end face. In the illustrated embodiment, the tip <b>28</b> has a rounded face. In alternative embodiments, the tip <b>28</b> can have other non-percutaneous shapes that will not injure the vessel in which it is introduced. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>, the tip <b>28</b> includes a housing <b>49</b> that securely receives the distal end of the guidewire <b>41</b> within an opening <b>48</b> in the interior surface of the housing <b>49</b>. The guidewire <b>41</b> can be secured within the opening by any known means.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>, the tip coil <b>29</b> surrounds a portion of the guidewire <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">The tip coil <b>29</b> is flexible so that it will conform to and follow the path of a vessel within the patient as the tip <b>28</b> is advanced along the vessel and the guidewire <b>41</b> bends to follow the tortuous path of the vasculature. The tip coil <b>29</b> extends rearward from the tip <b>28</b> in the direction of the proximal end <b>47</b>, as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">The tip <b>28</b> and coil <b>29</b> have an outer diameter D<b>1</b> of about 0.010 inch to about 0.018 inch. In an embodiment, their outer diameter D<b>1</b> is about 0.014 inch. The tip <b>28</b> and coil <b>29</b> also have a length L<b>1</b> of about 0.1 cm to about 3.0 cm. In an embodiment, they have a total length L<b>1</b> of about 1.5 cm.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">A proximal end <b>80</b> of the tip coil <b>29</b> is received within a housing <b>82</b> at a distal end <b>44</b> of a protective coil <b>85</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43 and 46</figref>. The housing <b>82</b> and protective coil <b>85</b> have an outer diameter D<b>2</b> of about 0.018 inch to about 0.038 inch. In an embodiment, their outer diameter D<b>2</b> is about 0.024 inch. The housing <b>82</b> and protective coil <b>85</b> have a length L<b>2</b> of about 0.05 cm to about 0.2 cm. In an embodiment, their total length L<b>2</b> is about 0.15 cm.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">The housing <b>82</b> has a non-percutaneous, atraumatic shape. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>, the housing <b>82</b> has a substantially blunt profile. Also, the housing <b>82</b> can be sized to open/support the vessel as it passes through it. Additionally, the housing <b>82</b> can include angled sidewalls sized to just be spaced just off the inner surface of the introducer sheath <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">The housing <b>82</b> and protective coil <b>85</b> form a distal retaining member that maintains the position of the occluding device <b>100</b> on the flexible guidewire assembly <b>20</b> and helps to hold the occluding device <b>100</b> in a compressed state prior to its delivery and deployment within a vessel of the vasculature. The protective coil <b>85</b> extends from the housing <b>82</b> in the direction of the proximal end <b>47</b> of the delivery guidewire <b>41</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>. The protective coil <b>85</b> is secured to the housing <b>82</b> in any known manner. In a first embodiment, the protective coil <b>85</b> can be secured to the outer surface of the housing <b>82</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the protective coil <b>85</b> can be secured within an opening of the housing <b>82</b> so that the housing <b>82</b> surrounds and internally receives the distal end <b>51</b> of the protective coil <b>85</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 45 and 46</figref>, the distal end <b>102</b> of the occluding device <b>100</b> is retained within the proximal end <b>52</b> so that the occluding device <b>100</b> cannot deploy while positioned in the sheath <b>4</b> or the catheter <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271">At the proximal end of the occluding device <b>100</b>, a bumper coil <b>86</b> and cap <b>88</b> prevent or limit lateral movement of the occluding device <b>100</b> along the length of the guidewire <b>41</b> in the direction of the proximal end <b>47</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>. The bumper coil <b>86</b> and cap <b>88</b> have an outer diameter D<b>4</b> of about 0.018 inch to about 0.038 inch. In an embodiment, their outer diameter D<b>4</b> is about 0.024 inch. The cap <b>88</b> contacts the proximal end <b>107</b> of the occluding device <b>100</b> and prevents or limits it from moving along the length of the guidewire <b>41</b> away from the protective coil <b>85</b>. The bumper coil <b>86</b> can be in the form of a spring that contacts and pressures the cap <b>88</b> in the direction of the protective coil <b>85</b>, thereby creating a biasing force against the occluding device <b>100</b>. This biasing force (pressure) aids in maintaining the secured, covered relationship between the distal end <b>102</b> of the occluding device <b>100</b> and the protective coil <b>85</b>. As with any of the coils positioned along the delivery guidewire <b>41</b>, the bumper coil <b>86</b> can be secured to the delivery guidewire <b>41</b> by soldering, welding, RF welding, glue, and/or other known adhesives.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">In an alternative embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>, the bumper coil <b>86</b> is not utilized. Instead, a proximal end <b>107</b> of the occluding device <b>100</b> is held in position by a set of spring loaded arms (jaws) <b>104</b> while positioned within the introducer sheath <b>4</b> or the catheter <b>1</b>. The inner surfaces of the catheter <b>1</b> and the introducer sheath <b>4</b> limit the radial expansion of the arms <b>104</b>. When the proximal end of the occluding device passes out of the catheter <b>1</b>, the arms <b>104</b> would spring open and release the occluding device as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0273">In another example, the occluding device <b>100</b> in the introducer sheath <b>4</b> or the catheter <b>1</b> may expand within a vessel under pressure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref> illustrates an example of an expanded occluding device <b>100</b> that expands responsive to pressure. Pressure may be applied through the catheter <b>1</b> or the introducer sheath <b>4</b> as the occluding device <b>100</b> passes out of the catheter <b>1</b>. The pressure may be exerted through application of air, fluid, or any material for increasing the internal pressure of the occluding device. The increase in pressure within the occluding device <b>100</b> when the occluding device <b>100</b> passes out of the catheter <b>1</b> may cause the occluding device to expand within the vessel. Conversely, a negative pressure may be exerted at the occluding device <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref> illustrates the occluding device <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref> after a negative pressure is applied to the occluding device <b>100</b>. The negative pressure may be applied via the catheter <b>1</b> or the introducer sheath <b>4</b> and may cause the occluding device <b>100</b> to retract or decrease in size. In one example, a negative pressure is exerted at the occluding device <b>100</b> after the occluding device <b>100</b> is passed out of the catheter <b>1</b> and expanded in the vessel. The negative pressure causes the occluding device <b>100</b> to retract. Upon retraction, the occluding device <b>100</b> may be reduced in size. In another example, the occluding device <b>100</b> may be replaced back into the catheter <b>1</b> after retraction. The negative pressure may be applied in a variety of ways. For example, the negative pressure may be applied by suction of air from the catheter <b>1</b> or by removal or suction of fluid from the catheter <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0274">Also, in another example, the occluding device <b>100</b> may be expanded, for example, by application of increased pressure within the occluding device. The increased pressure may be administered via the delivery device by, for example, injecting air or fluid via the delivery device to the occluding device <b>100</b>. The occluding device <b>100</b> may thus be expanded in a vessel such that the occluding device <b>100</b> may come into contact with the internal aspect of the wall of the vessel. In this way, at least a portion of the occluding device <b>100</b>, while in the expanded state, may contact the wall of the vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275">While in the expanded state, the occluding device <b>100</b> may be repositioned within the vessel. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref> illustrates an example of an expanded occluding device <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref> illustrates the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref> after the occluding device is repositioned within a blood vessel. In this example, the occluding device <b>100</b> may be expanded in a longitudinal axis along the vessel such that the occluding device <b>100</b> may move within the vessel while expanded. Pressure may be exerted by a user at a proximal end of the occluding device <b>100</b> such that the proximal end is moved distally within the vessel lumen. At the same time, frictional forces between the wall of the vessel and the more distal portions of the occluding device may prevent or limit immediate movement of the more distal portions of the occluding device. When the pressure or force exerted at the proximal end exceeds a threshold level, the force may be transmitted to the more distal portions of the occluding device to cause the more distal portions of the occluding device to more distally in the lumen of the vessel. In this way, the occluding device may move distally in the vessel lumen and may be repositioned at a desired location within the vessel by the user. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref> illustrates distal repositioning of the occluding device in a blood vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">Similarly, the occluding device may be repositioned more proximally in the vessel lumen by the user. For example, the user may provide a force or pressure at a distal portion of the occluding device in a proximal direction. The distal portion of the occluding device may move proximally while frictional forces between the more proximal portions of the occluding device prevent or limit initial movement of the more proximal portions of the occluding device. Hence, in this example, the occluding device compresses at a portion intermediate between the distal portion and the more proximal portions of the occluding device. When the pressure or force exerted by the user at the distal portion of the occluding device exceeds a threshold level that exceeds the frictional force preventing or limiting movement of the more proximal portions of the occluding device, the more proximal portions of the occluding device may move in a proximal direction responsive to the applied pressure or force. In this way, the occluding device may be repositioned proximally in the vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">In another example, the occluding device <b>100</b> may be repositioned in a blood vessel while the occluding device <b>100</b> is in a retracted state. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</figref> illustrates an example of the occluding device <b>100</b> in a retracted state. For example, negative pressure may be exerted at the occluding device <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref> to cause the occluding device <b>100</b> to decrease in size as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</figref>. The occluding device <b>100</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</figref> is retracted and approximates the delivery device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</figref> illustrates an example of repositioning the occluding device <b>100</b> while the occluding device is retracted. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</figref> illustrates, the occluding device is moved in a distal direction. Similarly, the occluding device may also be repositioned in a proximal direction (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">Also, deployment of the occluding device may be performed in parts. For example, the occluding device <b>100</b> may have a distal end and a proximal end. Deployment of the occluding device may include release of a distal end followed by release of the proximal end of the occluding device. Alternatively, deployment of the occluding device may include release of the proximal end followed by release of the distal end. Also, deployment of the occluding device may include release of the proximal end and the distal end of the occluding device <b>100</b> at approximately the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref> illustrates an example of release of the distal end of the occluding device <b>100</b> while the proximal end of the occluding device remains attached to the delivery device. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref> shows, the distal end of the occluding device <b>100</b> is deployed and abuts the wall of the blood vessel. The proximal end of the occluding device <b>100</b> is still attached to the delivery device. Release of the proximal end of the occluding device may be accomplished in a variety of ways as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">In addition, the partially deployed occluding device <b>100</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref> may be repositioned in the blood vessel. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref> illustrates an example of a partially deployed occluding device <b>100</b> in which the distal end of the occluding device <b>100</b> has been released from the delivery device while the proximal end of the occluding device <b>100</b> remains attached and non-deployed to the delivery device. In addition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref> demonstrates repositioning of the occluding device while partially deployed. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref> shows, the delivery device and occluding device <b>100</b> has been moved proximally in the blood vessel. Also, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref> illustrates that the occluding device is partially deployed in the blood vessel such that the distal end of the occluding device is released from the delivery device while the proximal end of the occluding device <b>100</b> remains attached to the delivery device.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 56 and 57</figref>, the proximal end of the occluding device <b>100</b> remains in a compressed configuration while the rest of the occluding device <b>100</b> is in the expanded configuration. In addition to repositioning the occluding device <b>100</b>, the porosity of any portion of the occluding device <b>100</b> may be decreased by applying an axially compressive force to the occluding device <b>100</b>, for example by advancing the proximal end of the occluding device <b>100</b> towards the distal end of the occluding device <b>100</b> such that the middle portions of the occluding device <b>100</b> are axially compressed. In one example, an axially compressive force may be applied to the proximal end of the occluding device <b>100</b> where the axially compressive force is greater than a frictional force between the contact of a first portion <b>111</b> of the occluding device <b>100</b> and the vessel wall. The axially compressive force may continue to be applied such that a second portion <b>112</b> of the occluding device <b>100</b> is axially compressed, resulting in a decrease in porosity. Note that the second portion <b>112</b> is substantially adjacent to the aneurysm A, which presents less frictional force between the contact of the second portion <b>112</b> of the occluding device <b>100</b> and the surrounding vessel wall.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">Additionally, the porosity of any portion of the occluding device <b>100</b> may be increased by applying an axially expansive force to the occluding device <b>100</b>, for example by withdrawing the proximal end of the occluding device <b>100</b> away from the distal end of the occluding device <b>100</b> such that the middle portions of the occluding device <b>100</b> are axially expanded.

The porosity of any portion of the occluding device <b>100</b> may be adjusted similarly by advancing or withdrawing the occluding device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">The occluding device <b>100</b> may also be retracted or removed from the vessel by withdrawing the proximal end of the occluding device <b>100</b>, which remains attached to the delivery device, into the catheter <b>1</b>. By continually withdrawing the proximal end of the occluding device <b>100</b> into the catheter <b>1</b>, any expanded portions of the occluding device <b>100</b> may be drawn into the catheter <b>1</b> and compressed such that the occluding device <b>100</b> may fit within the catheter <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">Alternatively, the proximal end of the occluding device may be released from the delivery device while the distal end of the occluding device remains attached to the delivery device.

In a first embodiment, the support <b>70</b> can include an outer surface of the delivery guidewire <b>41</b> that is sized to contact the inner surface of the occluding device <b>100</b> when the occluding device <b>100</b> is loaded on the guidewire assembly <b>20</b>. In this embodiment, the outer surface of the delivery guidewire <b>41</b> supports the occluding device <b>100</b> and maintains it in a ready to deploy state. In another embodiment, illustrated in the Figures, the support <b>70</b> comprises a mid-coil <b>70</b> that extends from a location proximate the protective coil <b>85</b> rearward toward the bumper coil <b>86</b>. The mid-coil <b>70</b> extends under the occluding device <b>100</b> and over the delivery guidewire <b>41</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>. The mid-coil <b>70</b> can be coextensive with one or more sections of the delivery guidewire <b>41</b>. For example, the mid-coil <b>70</b> could be coextensive with only the second section <b>44</b> of the delivery guidewire <b>41</b> or it could extend along portions of both the third section <b>46</b> and the second section <b>44</b> of the delivery guidewire <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290">The mid-coil <b>70</b> provides the guidewire assembly <b>20</b> with an outwardly extending surface that is sized to contact the inner surface of the occluding device <b>100</b> in order to assist in supporting the occluding device and maintaining the occluding device <b>100</b> in a ready to deploy state. Like the other coils discussed herein and illustrated in the figures, the coiled form of the mid-coil <b>70</b> permits the mid-coil <b>70</b> to flex with the delivery guidewire <b>41</b> as the delivery guidewire <b>41</b> is advanced through the vasculature of the patient. The mid-coil <b>70</b> provides a constant diameter along a length of the delivery guidewire <b>41</b> that is covered by the occluding device <b>100</b> regardless of the taper of the delivery guidewire <b>41</b> beneath the occluding device <b>100</b>. The mid-coil <b>70</b> permits the delivery guidewire <b>41</b> to be tapered so it can achieve the needed flexibility to follow the path of the vasculature without compromising the support provided to the occluding device <b>100</b>. The mid-coil <b>70</b> provides the occluding device <b>100</b> with constant support regardless of the taper of the delivery guidewire <b>41</b> prior to the occluding device <b>100</b> being deployed. The smallest diameter of the occluding device <b>100</b> when in its compressed state is also controlled by the size of the mid-coil <b>70</b>. Additionally, the diameter of the mid-coil <b>70</b> can be chosen so that the proper spacing, including no spacing, is established between the occluding device <b>100</b> and the inner wall of the catheter <b>1</b> prior to deployment of the occluding device <b>100</b>. The mid-coil <b>70</b> can also be used to bias the occluding device <b>100</b> away from the delivery guidewire <b>41</b> during its deployment.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">In either embodiment, the support <b>70</b> can have an outer diameter D<b>3</b> of about 0.010 inch to about 0.018 inch. In an embodiment, the outer diameter D<b>3</b> is about 0.014 inch. The support <b>70</b> can also have a length L<b>3</b> of about 2.0 cm to about 30 cm. In an embodiment, the length L<b>3</b> of the support <b>70</b> is about 7 cm.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">The occluding device <b>100</b> may also be placed on the mid-coil <b>70</b> between an optional pair of radio-opaque marker bands located along the length of the guidewire assembly <b>20</b>. Alternatively, the protective coil <b>85</b>, bumper coil <b>86</b> and or mid-coil <b>70</b> can include radio-opaque markers. In an alternative embodiment, the guidewire assembly <b>20</b> may include only a single radio-opaque marker. The use of radio-opaque markers allows for the visualization of the guidewire assembly <b>20</b> and the occluding device <b>100</b> during placement within the vasculature. Such visualization techniques may include conventional methods such as fluoroscopy, radiography, ultra-sonography, magnetic resonance imaging, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">The occluding device <b>100</b> can be delivered and deployed at the site of an aneurysm according to the following method and variations thereof. The delivery of the occluding device <b>100</b> includes introducing the catheter <b>1</b> into the vasculature until it reaches a site that requires treatment. The catheter <b>1</b> is introduced into the vasculature using a conventional technique such as being advanced over or simultaneously with a conventional vascular guidewire (not shown). The positioning of the catheter <b>1</b> can occur before it receives the guidewire assembly <b>20</b> or while it contains the guidewire assembly <b>20</b>. The position of the catheter <b>1</b> within the vasculature can be determined by identifying radio-opaque markers positioned on or in the catheter <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">After the catheter <b>1</b> is positioned at the desired location, the guidewire is removed and the distal end of the introducer sheath <b>4</b> is inserted into the proximal end of the catheter <b>1</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>. In an embodiment, the distal end of the introducer sheath <b>4</b> is introduced through the hub <b>2</b> at the proximal end of the catheter <b>1</b>. The introducer sheath <b>4</b> is advanced within the catheter <b>1</b> until a distal tip of the introducer sheath <b>4</b> is wedged within the catheter <b>1</b>. At this position, the introducer sheath <b>4</b> cannot be advanced further within the catheter <b>1</b>. The introducer sheath <b>4</b> is then securely held while the delivery guidewire assembly <b>20</b> carrying the occluding device <b>100</b> is advanced through the introducer sheath <b>4</b> until the occluding device <b>100</b> is advanced out of the introducer sheath <b>4</b> and into the catheter <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">The guidewire assembly <b>20</b> and the occluding device <b>100</b> are advanced through the catheter <b>1</b> until the tip coil <b>29</b> is proximate the distal end of the catheter <b>1</b>. At this point, the position of the catheter <b>1</b> and guidewire assembly <b>20</b> can be confirmed. The guidewire assembly <b>20</b> is then advanced out of the catheter <b>1</b> and into the vasculature of the patient so that the proximal end <b>107</b> of the occluding device <b>100</b> is positioned outside the distal end of the catheter <b>1</b> and adjacent the area to be treated. At any point during these steps, the position of the occluding device <b>100</b> can be checked to determine that it will be deployed correctly and at the desired location. This can be accomplished by using the radio-opaque markers discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">When the distal end <b>102</b> of the occluding device <b>100</b> is positioned outside the catheter <b>1</b>, the proximal end <b>107</b> will begin to expand, in the direction of the arrows shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>, within the vasculature while the distal end <b>102</b> remains covered by the protective coil <b>85</b>. When the occluding device <b>100</b> is in the proper position, the delivery guidewire <b>41</b> is rotated (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>) until the distal end <b>102</b> of the occluding device <b>100</b> moves away from the protective coil <b>85</b> and expands within the vasculature at the desired location. The delivery guidewire <b>41</b> can be rotated either clockwise or counter clockwise as needed to deploy the occluding device <b>100</b>. In an embodiment, the delivery guidewire <b>41</b> may be rotated, for example, between about two and ten turns in either or both directions. In another example, the occluding device may be deployed by rotating the delivery guidewire <b>41</b> clockwise for less than about five turns, for example, three to five turns. After the occluding device <b>100</b> has been deployed, the delivery guidewire <b>41</b> can be retracted into the catheter <b>100</b> and removed from the body.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0297">In one alternative or additional deployment method, the distal end <b>102</b> of the occluding device <b>100</b> may be passed outside of the catheter <b>1</b>. The occluding device <b>100</b> may be further advanced so that the proximal end <b>107</b> of the occluding device <b>100</b> passes outside of the catheter. However, in this example, the proximal end <b>107</b> of the occluding device <b>100</b> expands responsive to the application of pressure to the inner surfaces of the occluding device <b>100</b>. The applied pressure may be from any source. Examples of pressure exerted in the occluding device <b>100</b> include, but are not limited to, infusion of fluid or air into the lumen of the occluding device.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0298">The increase in pressure in the occluding device may cause the occluding device <b>100</b> to expand. Expansion of the occluding device <b>100</b> may cause a disconnection of the proximal end <b>107</b> of the occluding device <b>100</b> and/or the distal end <b>102</b> of the occluding device <b>100</b> such that the occluding device may substantially fill the lumen of the vessel. Alternatively, the increase in pressure in the occluding device may expand the occluding device <b>100</b> without detachment of either the proximal end <b>107</b> or the distal end <b>102</b> of the occluding device <b>100</b>. In this example, the occluding device <b>100</b> may be expanded without detaching the occluding device <b>100</b> from the delivery system. The expanded occluding device <b>100</b> may be adjusted and moved within the vessel in the expanded state while connected to the delivery system. When the occluding device <b>100</b> is at a desired location in the vessel, the occluding device <b>100</b> may be released from the delivery system. Release of the occluding device <b>100</b> from the delivery system may be accomplished in a variety of ways as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299">In addition, the coverage of the occluding device <b>100</b> may be adjusted while the occluding device is expanded and connected to the delivery system. For example, the occluding device <b>100</b> may be unsheathed from the catheter <b>1</b> and expanded under pressure (e.g., from fluid or air) such that the occluding device <b>100</b> is expanded in the vessel. The position of the occluding device <b>100</b> may be further adjusted. Also, the pressure applied within the occluding device <b>100</b> may be adjusted to increase the size of the expanded occluding device <b>100</b> in the vessel. Relative adjustments of the size of the expanded occluding device <b>100</b> (i.e., by adjusting the amount of pressure applied to the occluding device <b>100</b>) and of the position or location of the occluding device <b>100</b> permit control of coverage of the occluding device when placed in the vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">Also, a negative pressure may be applied (e.g., air suction or removal of fluid from within the occluding device <b>100</b>) to cause the occluding device to retract. The retracted occluding device <b>100</b> may further be placed back into the catheter <b>1</b>. In one example, the occluding device <b>100</b> may be expanded and retracted as desired for movement or placement of the occluding device <b>100</b> within the vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301">In an alternative or additional deployment step shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>, friction between the occluding device <b>100</b> and inner surface of the catheter <b>1</b> cause the distal end of the occluding device <b>100</b> to separate from the protective coil <b>85</b>. The friction can be created by the opening of the occluding device <b>100</b> and/or the mid-coil <b>70</b> biasing the occluding device <b>100</b> toward the inner surface of the catheter <b>1</b>. The friction between the catheter <b>1</b> and the occluding device <b>100</b> will assist in the deployment of the occluding device <b>100</b>. In those instances when the occluding device <b>100</b> does not open and separate from the protective coil <b>85</b> during deployment, the friction between occluding device <b>100</b> and the inner surface of the catheter <b>1</b> will cause the occluding device <b>100</b> to move away from the protective coil <b>85</b> as the delivery guidewire <b>41</b> and the catheter <b>1</b> move relative to each other. The delivery guidewire <b>41</b> can then be rotated and the occluding device <b>100</b> deployed within the vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0302">After the occluding device <b>100</b> radially self-expands into gentle, but secure, contact with the walls of the vessel so as to occlude the neck of the aneurysm A, the catheter <b>1</b> may be removed entirely from the body of the patient. Alternatively, the catheter <b>1</b> may be left in position within vasculature to allow for the insertion of additional tools or the application of drugs near the treatment site.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0303">Known materials can be used in the subject technology. One common material that can be used with the occluding device <b>100</b> and the guidewire <b>41</b> is Nitinol, a nickel-titanium shape memory alloy, which can be formed and annealed, deformed at a low temperature, and recalled to its original shape with heating, such as when deployed at body temperature in the body. The radio-opaque markers can be formed of radio-opaque materials including metals, such as platinum, or doped plastics including bismuth or tungsten to aid in visualization.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Treatment of Lumens in the Body</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0304">Systems and methods for treating lumens within the body of a patient are provided below. Although the description may be presented in the context of one or more embodiments, it is understood that such systems and methods can be used in various lumens of the body and in various ways that would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, systems and methods for treating atherosclerosis in a blood vessel and providing embolic protection during treatment are described according to embodiments of the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0305">Atherosclerosis is caused by plaque buildup in a blood vessel (e.g., carotid artery). The plaque may be made up of cholesterol, cells and other fatty substances. Over time, the plaque can restrict or block blood flow through the affected blood vessel. If left untreated, a portion of the plaque can break off as plaque debris that travels downstream through the blood vessel to smaller blood vessels. The plaque debris can block blood flow to the smaller blood vessels resulting in death of tissue receiving blood from the smaller blood vessels. For example, blockage of vessels supplying blood to the heart or brain can result in heart attack or stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0306">Numerous minimally invasive procedures have been developed to treat atherosclerosis in a blood vessel. In one procedure, a catheter with an inflatable balloon is advanced through the blood vessel to an occlusion site in the blood vessel caused by plaque buildup. The balloon is then inflated to compress the plaque against the inner wall of the blood vessel, thereby opening up the occluded blood vessel. In another procedure, a catheter with a cutting tool is advanced through the blood vessel to the occlusion site. The cutting tool is then used to cut away the plaque to open up the occluded blood vessel. The catheter may include an aspirator located near the cutting tool to remove plaque debris caused by cutting away the plaque. After the blood vessel is opened, a stent or other device can be deployed in the blood vessel at the treatment site to strengthen the wall of the blood vessel and prevent or reduce the likelihood of reclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0307">During treatment of atherosclerosis, plaque debris can be released into the blood stream and cause embolization. Embolization occurs when the released plaque debris travel downstream from the treatment site and block blood flow to smaller blood vessels. Embolization can result in heart attack, stroke or other ailment depending on the tissue being fed blood by the blocked blood vessels.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0308">To prevent or limit embolization during treatment of atherosclerosis, in some embodiments, a stent is at least partially deployed in the blood vessel downstream from the treatment site. The partially deployed stent acts as a filter that captures plaque debris released during treatment, preventing or limiting the plaque debris from traveling downstream to smaller blood vessels. In some embodiments, after treatment, the stent is fully deployed in the blood vessel, including the treatment site, to strengthen the wall of the blood vessel and prevent or reduce the likelihood of reclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0309"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref> illustrates a system <b>5</b> for treating atherosclerosis and providing embolic protection according to embodiments described herein. The system <b>5</b> comprises a catheter <b>8</b>, a guidewire assembly <b>57</b> within the catheter <b>8</b>, and a stent <b>66</b> loaded onto the guidewire assembly <b>57</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref> shows a cutaway view of the catheter <b>8</b> with the guidewire assembly <b>57</b> within a lumen <b>9</b> of the catheter <b>8</b>. The guidewire assembly <b>57</b>, which is used to deploy the stent <b>66</b> in a blood vessel, is slidable received within the lumen <b>9</b> of the catheter <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0310">The catheter <b>8</b> comprises an inflatable balloon <b>40</b> and one or more lumens <b>56</b> fluidly coupled to the balloon <b>40</b>. The lumens <b>56</b> extend from the balloon <b>40</b> to a proximal portion of the catheter <b>8</b> (not shown), where inflation fluid can be injected into the lumens <b>56</b> through a fluid injection port to inflate the balloon <b>40</b> from a deflated state to an inflated state.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0311"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref> shows the balloon <b>40</b> in the deflated state. In some embodiments, the balloon <b>40</b> has a tubular shape that expands radially when inflated. In these embodiments, the lumen <b>9</b> carrying the guidewire assembly <b>57</b> runs through the balloon <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0312">The catheter <b>8</b> has a distal opening <b>18</b> through which the guidewire assembly <b>57</b> can be advanced beyond the distal end <b>19</b> of the catheter <b>8</b> to deploy the stent in a blood vessel. The lumen <b>56</b> extends from the distal opening <b>18</b> to a proximal opening (not shown), through which the guidewire assembly <b>57</b> can be inserted into the catheter <b>8</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0313">The guidewire assembly <b>57</b> may have the same or similar structure as the guidewire assemblies described above. The guidewire assembly <b>57</b> comprises a delivery guidewire <b>59</b> having a flexible distal tip portion <b>61</b>. The delivery guidewire <b>59</b> is configured to transmit torque from a proximal portion of the delivery guidewire <b>59</b> to the distal portion while being flexible so that the delivery guidewire <b>59</b> can bend along a tortuous path of a blood vessel. The guidewire assembly <b>57</b> also includes one or both of a distal retaining member <b>62</b> and a proximal retaining member <b>26</b>, which are configured to retain the stent <b>66</b> therebetween and hold the stent <b>66</b> in position on the guidewire assembly <b>57</b>. The distal and proximal retaining members <b>62</b> and <b>26</b> may be implemented using the distal and proximal retaining members illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>. For example, the distal retaining member <b>62</b> may be implemented using the distal retaining illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref> so that the distal end of the stent <b>66</b> can be released by rotating the distal retaining member <b>62</b> via the delivery guidewire <b>59</b>. The guidewire assembly <b>57</b> may also comprise a support coil <b>70</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>) to support the delivery guidewire <b>59</b> on the delivery guidewire <b>59</b> and maintain the stent <b>66</b> in a ready to deploy state.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0314">In some embodiments, the stent <b>66</b> is a self-expanding stent comprising a tubular lattice structure having a compressed state and an expanded state. The stent <b>66</b> includes a distal portion <b>67</b> and a proximal portion <b>68</b>. The stent <b>66</b> is loaded onto the guidewire assembly <b>57</b> in the compressed state, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref>. The stent <b>66</b> may be maintained in the compressed state within the catheter <b>8</b> by the inner surface <b>17</b> of the lumen <b>9</b> and the retaining members <b>62</b> and <b>26</b>. The stent <b>66</b> is configured to automatically expand radially from the compressed state to the expanded stated when deployed in a blood vessel, as discussed in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0315">A procedure for treating atherosclerosis and preventing, reducing, or limiting embolization from the treatment is described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 65-69</figref> according to an embodiment of the disclosure. The procedure may be performed using the system <b>5</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0316">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</figref>, the catheter <b>8</b> is percutaneously introduced into a blood vessel <b>69</b> and advanced to a treatment site <b>53</b> in the blood vessel <b>69</b>. The treatment site <b>53</b> may be characterized by a narrowing (stenotic) of the blood vessel <b>53</b> caused by plaque buildup due to atherosclerosis. The blood vessel <b>69</b> may be the carotid artery or other artery. In one embodiment, the stenotic region <b>54</b> at the treatment site <b>53</b> is treated using balloon angioplasty and stenting. Other forms of angioplasty may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0317">The catheter <b>8</b> may guided to the treatment site <b>53</b> using fluoroscopic imaging, in which one or more radio-opaque markers (not shown) are placed on the distal portion of the catheter <b>8</b> to indicate a position of the catheter <b>8</b> in a fluoroscopic image. The catheter <b>8</b> may also be guided using other imaging techniques including ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. In one embodiment, the catheter <b>8</b> is positioned so that the balloon <b>40</b> of the catheter <b>8</b> is positioned within the stenotic region <b>54</b>. At this stage, the balloon <b>40</b> is in the deflated state, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0318">After the catheter <b>8</b> is positioned at the treatment site <b>53</b>, the guidewire assembly <b>57</b> is advanced through the distal opening <b>18</b> of the catheter <b>8</b>. A distal portion <b>67</b> of the stent <b>66</b> is advanced beyond the distal end <b>19</b> of the catheter <b>8</b> while a proximal portion <b>68</b> of the stent <b>66</b> remains within the lumen <b>9</b> of the catheter <b>8</b>. The distal portion of the stent <b>66</b> is positioned downstream or distally from the stenotic region <b>54</b>. The direction of blood flow through the blood vessel is indicated by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0319">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</figref>, the distal end of the stent <b>66</b> is released, allowing the distal portion <b>67</b> of the stent <b>66</b> to self expand. This may be done, for example, by rotating the distal retaining member <b>62</b> or other mechanism. A portion of the distal portion <b>67</b> of the stent <b>66</b> contacts the vessel wall <b>55</b> in the expanded state. The proximal portion of the <b>68</b> within the catheter <b>8</b> remains in the compressed state. In this configuration, the distal portion <b>67</b> of the stent <b>66</b> forms a filter between the vessel wall <b>55</b> and the distal end <b>19</b> of the catheter <b>8</b> for capturing plaque debris.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0320">Pores in the lattice structure of the stent <b>66</b> allow blood to flow through the distal portion <b>67</b> of the stent <b>66</b> while capturing plaque debris. Thus, the stent <b>66</b> is partially deployed in the blood vessel <b>69</b> to act as a filter for preventing or limiting embolization while allowing blood flow. In some embodiments, the porosity of the filter formed by the distal portion <b>67</b> of the stent <b>66</b> can be adjusted after the distal portion <b>67</b> is deployed. For example, the distal portion <b>67</b> of the stent <b>66</b> may be compressed axially to increase the lattice density and hence decrease the porosity of the distal portion <b>67</b> of the stent <b>66</b>. This may be done to filter smaller plaque debris. In another example, the distal portion <b>67</b> of the stent <b>66</b> may be expanded axially to decrease the lattice density and hence increase the porosity of the distal portion <b>67</b> of the stent <b>66</b>. This may be done to allow greater blood flow through the filter. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36B</figref> shows examples of axial compression and axial expansion of a stent to adjust porosity of the stent.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0321">The distal portion <b>67</b> of the catheter <b>8</b> may be compressed axially by advancing the distal end <b>18</b> of the catheter <b>8</b> after the distal portion <b>67</b> is deployed in the blood vessel <b>69</b>. Advancement of the catheter <b>8</b> causes the distal end <b>19</b> of the catheter <b>8</b> to engage and apply a compressive force on the distal portion <b>67</b> in the axial direction. Alternatively, the distal portion <b>67</b> of the stent <b>66</b> may be compressed axially by advancing the guidewire assembly <b>57</b> after the distal portion <b>67</b> is deployed in the blood vessel <b>67</b>. Advancement of the guidewire assembly <b>57</b> causes the proximal retaining member <b>26</b> to apply a compressive force on the stent <b>66</b> in the axial direction. In both implementations, contact between the distal portion <b>67</b> of the stent <b>66</b> and the vessel wall <b>55</b> holds the stent <b>66</b> in place during axial compression.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0322">The stent <b>66</b> may be partially deployed in the blood vessel <b>69</b> to form the filter using other techniques. For example, the distal end <b>19</b> of the catheter <b>8</b> may be advanced to a position in the blood vessel <b>69</b> distal from the stenotic region <b>54</b>. The catheter <b>8</b> may then be retracted relative to the guidewire assembly <b>57</b> to uncover the distal portion <b>67</b> of the stent <b>66</b>. In this example, the stent <b>66</b> may be retained in the compressed state by the lumen <b>9</b> of the catheter so that the distal portion <b>67</b> of the stent <b>66</b> automatically expand when the catheter <b>8</b> is retracted. In another example, a pusher <b>50</b> that engages the proximal end of the stent <b>66</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) may be used to partially deploy the stent <b>66</b> by pushing the distal portion <b>67</b> of the stent <b>66</b> out of the distal opening <b>18</b> of the catheter <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0323">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</figref>, the balloon <b>40</b> is expanded radially to the expanded state by the injection of fluid into the balloon <b>40</b> through the lumens <b>56</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref>). The expansion of the balloon <b>40</b> causes the balloon <b>40</b> to compresses the plaque in the stenotic region <b>54</b> against the vessel wall <b>55</b>, thereby increasing the diameter of the blood vessel <b>69</b> in the stenotic region <b>54</b>. During treatment, the distal portion <b>67</b> of the stent <b>66</b> captures plaque debris <b>58</b> released from the treatment. The capture of the plaque debris <b>58</b> limits the plaque debris from traveling downstream to smaller blood vessels and blocking blood to the smaller blood vessels.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0324">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</figref>, the balloon <b>40</b> is deflated to the deflated state after the diameter of the blood vessel is increased. The plaque debris <b>58</b> released from the treatment are trapped in the distal portion <b>67</b> of the stent <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0325">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 69</figref>, the catheter <b>8</b> is retracted relative to the stent <b>66</b> to fully deploy the stent <b>66</b> in the blood vessel <b>69</b>, including the stenotic region <b>54</b>. The rest of the stent <b>66</b> expands radially contacting the vessel wall <b>55</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 69</figref>, the proximal end of the stent <b>66</b> extends to a location proximal to the stenotic region <b>54</b>. After the stent <b>66</b> is fully deployed in the blood vessel <b>69</b>, the catheter <b>8</b> and guidewire assembly <b>57</b> are withdrawn from the blood vessel <b>69</b>. The plaque debris <b>58</b> and the remaining plaque in the stenotic region <b>54</b> are trapped between the stent <b>66</b> in the expanded state and the vessel wall <b>55</b>. The stent <b>66</b> provides structural support to the vessel wall to strengthen the blood vessel <b>69</b> and prevent or reduce the likelihood of reclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0326">The atherosclerosis may be treated using other techniques, in which the distal portion of the stent <b>66</b> is deployed to provide embolic protection. For example, the plaque in the stenotic region <b>54</b> may be removed using a cutting tool mounted on the catheter <b>8</b>, a laser beam emitted from a distal portion of the catheter <b>8</b>, high energy signal emitted from one or more transducers or electrodes disposed on the catheter <b>8</b> and other techniques. For the example of a laser beam, the catheter may include an optical fiber for transporting the laser beam from a laser source to the distal portion of the catheter. In each of the these example techniques, the distal portion <b>67</b> of the stent <b>66</b> can be deployed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</figref> to capture plaque debris from the treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0327"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 70</figref> shows the catheter <b>8</b> with a cutting tool <b>73</b> for treating atherosclerosis instead of an angioplasty balloon according to some embodiments. In these embodiments, the cutting tool <b>73</b> is mounted on the outer surface of the catheter <b>8</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71</figref> shows the cutting tool <b>73</b> comprising cutting blades orientated at an angle on the outer surface of the catheter <b>8</b>. In these embodiments, the cutting tool <b>73</b> can be used to cut away plaque by rotating the cutting tool <b>73</b> while advancing the catheter <b>8</b> through the stenotic region <b>54</b>. The cutting tool <b>73</b> may be rotated by rotating the catheter <b>8</b>. The cutting tool <b>73</b> may have any shape capable of cutting away plaque. In addition, the cutting tool may have an abrasive surface.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0328">In some embodiments, the cutting tool <b>73</b> comprises blades that are hinged to the catheter <b>8</b>. This allows the blades to be folded downward along the circumference of the catheter <b>8</b> to more easily advance the catheter <b>8</b> through the blood vessel. The blades may be deployed by rotating the catheter <b>8</b> in one direction such that the centrifugal force of the rotation causes the blades to unfold. Additionally, the resistance of the fluid in which the blades are rotating can cause the blades to be deployed. The hinges may be configured so that the blades are orientated radially from the circumference of the catheter <b>8</b> when deployed. After plaque remove, the catheter <b>8</b> may stop rotating or rotate in an opposite direction so that the blades fold back along the circumference of the catheter <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0329">The catheter <b>8</b> may also include one or more aspiration lumens <b>71</b> and aspiration ports <b>74</b> for removing plaque debris released during treatment. In these embodiments, the distal portion <b>67</b> of the stent <b>66</b> may be deployed to capture plaque debris that are not removed through the aspiration ports <b>74</b>.</p>
