<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based on and claims priority under 35USC 119 from Japanese patent Application No. 2009-166950 filed on Jul. 15, 2009.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an exposure apparatus, an image forming apparatus, and a hologram recording apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There has been proposed a printing apparatus including plural switching elements each of which converts a laser beam emitted from a laser light source into a spot beam and plural holographic optical elements each of which causes the spot beam to converge, and the switching elements and the holographic optical elements are provided in correspondence with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There has also been proposed an exposure apparatus including plural light-emitting devices, a first lens array, and a second lens array. The plural light-emitting devices are arrayed on a light source substrate. The first lens array includes plural diffraction positive lenses each of which diffracts transmitted light to cause beams of the light to converge, thereby forming an image. The second lens array includes plural lenses. The first lens array is sandwiched between the second lens array and the plural light-emitting devices. The plural diffraction positive lenses are respectively superimposed with the plural light-emitting devices in a direction perpendicular to the light source substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There has also been proposed an optical writing apparatus, in which an image is divided into many micro pixels, one or plural light sources emit light beams having an intensity corresponding to a density of each pixel, and an image recording medium is scanned with a bright point of the light beam to sequentially expose each pixel region, thereby writing the image. The image recording medium is irradiated with light having a light quantity density that is equal to or more than a threshold, the image recording medium is exposed to form a latent image by a surface potential change or a chemical change or the image recording medium is exposed to form an image having a density change. In the optical writing apparatus, units as many as the pixels are arrayed in a fast-scanning direction. One unit includes a light converging element, a micro optical aperture, a collimator, and a holographic optical element, which are arranged sequentially from the light source side between the light source and the image recording medium. The light converging element causes the light beams to converge. The optical aperture is provided at a position at which the light beam converges. The collimator forms the light beam outgoing from the optical aperture into a substantially parallel light beam. The holographic optical element radiates the light beam while splitting the light beam into plural directions, and the holographic optical element causes the plural light beams to converge onto substantially the same plane.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the invention is to provide, in an exposure apparatus in which beams emitted from plural light-emitting devices formed on a substrate are converged by a hologram to form converged beam spots arranged in a line on an exposed surface, an exposure apparatus that may obtain a line including a desired number of beam spots (light collecting points) at the exposed surface, even if a portion of the plural light-emitting devices is defective. Another object of the invention is to provide an image forming apparatus in which the exposure apparatus is used. A further object of the invention is to provide a hologram recording apparatus that records a hologram in a hologram recording layer in the process of producing the exposure apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided an exposure apparatus including a substrate in which a plurality of light-emitting devices are arrayed one-dimensionally or two-dimensionally; and a hologram recording layer that is disposed on the substrate, a plurality of holograms being recorded in the hologram recording layer by holographic interference between a first beam and a second beam such that a predetermined number of beam spots, each of which is formed by converging of the second beam, are disposed in the hologram recording layer in a predetermined array direction according to a portion of light-emitting devices being selected as emitters (emission points) from the plurality of light-emitting devices, the first beam passing through an optical path of diffusion light that passes through the hologram recording layer from a position corresponding to the emitter, and the second beam passing through an optical path of convergent light that converges at a predetermined distance outside the optical path of the first beam.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">An exemplary embodiment of the invention will be described in detail with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Image Forming Apparatus</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an example of a configuration of an image forming apparatus according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention. The image forming apparatus is a tandem digital full-color printer. The image forming apparatus includes an image forming process section <b>10</b>, a control section <b>30</b>, and an image processing section <b>40</b>. The image forming process section <b>10</b> forms an image according to image data of each color. The control section <b>30</b> controls an operation of the image forming apparatus. The image processing section <b>40</b> is connected to an image reading device <b>3</b> and an external device such as a Personal Computer (PC) <b>2</b>, and the image processing section <b>40</b> performs predetermined image processing on the image data received from the image reading device <b>3</b> or PC <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The image forming process section <b>10</b> includes four image forming units <b>11</b>Y, <b>11</b>M, <b>11</b>C, and <b>11</b>K that are arranged in parallel at constant intervals. The image forming units <b>11</b>Y, <b>11</b>M, <b>11</b>C, and <b>11</b>K form Yellow (Y), Magenta (M), Cyan (C), and Black (K) toner images, respectively. The image forming units <b>11</b>Y, <b>11</b>M, <b>11</b>C, and <b>11</b>K may be collectively referred to as &#x201c;image forming unit <b>11</b>&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Each image forming unit <b>11</b> includes a photosensitive drum <b>12</b>, a charging device <b>13</b>, an LED (light emitting diode) printhead (LPH) <b>14</b>, a development device <b>15</b>, and a cleaner <b>16</b>. The photosensitive drum <b>12</b> is an image holding member that forms an electrostatic latent image to hold a toner image. The charging device <b>13</b> uniformly charges a surface of the photosensitive drum <b>12</b> to a predetermined potential. LPH <b>14</b> is an exposure apparatus that exposes the photosensitive drum <b>12</b> charged by the charging device <b>13</b>. The development device <b>15</b> develops the electrostatic latent image obtained by LPH <b>14</b>. The cleaner <b>16</b> cleans the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>12</b> after transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">LPH <b>14</b> is a long bar shaped printhead having a length substantially identical to a length in an axis-line direction of the photosensitive drum <b>12</b>. In LPH <b>14</b>, plural LEDs are arrayed (in a line) along a length direction. LPH <b>14</b> is disposed around the photosensitive drum <b>12</b> such that the length direction of LPH <b>14</b> is oriented along the axis-line direction of the photosensitive drum <b>12</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, LPH <b>14</b> has a long operating distance (working distance), and LPH <b>14</b> is disposed away from the surface of photosensitive drum <b>12</b> by several centimeters. Therefore, the width in the circumferential direction of the photosensitive drum <b>12</b> which is occupied is reduced, thereby reducing crowding of the area around the photosensitive drum <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The image forming process section <b>10</b> also includes an intermediate transfer belt <b>21</b>, a primary transfer roller <b>22</b>, a secondary transfer roller <b>23</b>, and a fixing device <b>25</b>. The color toner images formed by the photosensitive drums <b>12</b> of the image forming units <b>11</b> are plurally transferred to the intermediate transfer belt <b>21</b>. The primary transfer roller <b>22</b> sequentially transfers the color toner images of the image forming units <b>11</b> to the intermediate transfer belt <b>21</b> (primary transfer). The secondary transfer roller <b>23</b> collectively transfers the superimposed toner images transferred to the intermediate transfer belt <b>21</b> to a sheet P that is a recording medium (secondary transfer). The fixing device <b>25</b> fixes the secondary-transferred image onto the sheet P.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">An operation of the image forming apparatus will be described. First, the image forming process section <b>10</b> performs an image forming operation based on a control signal such as a synchronous signal supplied from the control section <b>30</b>. At this point, the image processing section <b>40</b> performs image processing on the image data input from the image reading device <b>3</b> or PC <b>2</b>, and the image data is supplied to each image forming unit <b>11</b> through an interface.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">For example, in the yellow image forming unit <b>11</b>Y, the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>12</b> which is charged evenly to a predetermined potential by the charging device <b>13</b> is exposed with LPH <b>14</b> that emits light based on image data obtained from the image processing section <b>40</b>, thereby forming an electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive drum <b>12</b>. That is, when each LED of LPH <b>14</b> emits light based on the image data, slow-scanning is performed by rotation of the photosensitive drum <b>12</b> while fast-scanning is performed with respect to the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>12</b>, thereby forming the electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive drum <b>12</b>. The development device <b>15</b> develops the formed electrostatic latent image to form a yellow toner image on the photosensitive drum <b>12</b>. Similarly, the image forming unit <b>11</b>M, <b>11</b>C, and <b>11</b>K form magenta, cyan, and black toner images.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The color toner images formed by the image forming units <b>11</b> are sequentially electrostatically attracted and transferred onto the intermediate transfer belt <b>21</b>, which rotates in the direction of an arrow A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, by the primary transfer roller <b>22</b> (primary transfer). The superimposed toner images are formed on the intermediate transfer belt <b>21</b>. The superimposed toner images are conveyed to a region (secondary transfer section) where the secondary transfer roller <b>23</b> is provided according to the movement of the intermediate transfer belt <b>21</b>. When the superimposed toner images are conveyed to the secondary transfer section, a sheet P is supplied to the secondary transfer section in synchronization with the conveyance of the toner image to the secondary transfer section.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the secondary transfer section, the superimposed toner images are collectively electrostatically transferred onto the conveyed sheet P by a transfer electric field formed by the secondary transfer roller <b>23</b> (secondary transfer). The sheet P to which the superimposed toner images are transferred in the electrostatic manner is peeled off from the intermediate transfer belt <b>21</b>, and the sheet P is conveyed to the fixing device <b>25</b> by the conveying belt <b>24</b>. The unfixed toner image on the sheet P conveyed to the fixing device <b>25</b> is subjected to a fixing treatment with heat and pressure by the fixing device <b>25</b>, thereby fixing the toner image onto the sheet P. The sheet P at which the fixed image is formed is outputted to a sheet output tray (not shown) provided at an output section of the image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When the LPH operating distance increases, the area around the photosensitive drum is not crowded, and the overall size of the image forming apparatus may be reduced. In a conventional LPH in which a rod lens is used, an optical path length (operating distance) from an edge face of a lens array of the rod lens to an image forming point is several millimeters, and the ratio of space around the photosensitive drum occupied by the exposure apparatus increases. In an LPH in which LED emitting incoherent light (light waves having no interference) is used, generally coherency decreases to generate a blurred spot (chromatic aberration), and as a result a micro spot may be difficult to form.</p>

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Recording and Reconstruction of Hologram (Holographic Optical Element)</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A principle of recording and reconstruction of the holographic optical element <b>54</b> will briefly be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a view illustrating a state in which the holographic optical element is formed in the hologram recording layer. The illustration of the photosensitive drum <b>12</b> is omitted, and only the surface <b>12</b>A which is the image forming plane is illustrated. The hologram recording layer <b>60</b>A is a recording layer before the holographic optical element <b>54</b> is formed, and the hologram recording layer <b>60</b>A is distinguished by the letter A from the hologram recording layer <b>60</b> in which the holographic optical element <b>54</b> has been formed.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the hologram recording layer <b>60</b>A is irradiated with a signal beam (that is, an object beam), which is coherent light that passes through an optical path of the diffracted light and forms an image on the surface <b>12</b>A. At the same time, the hologram recording layer <b>60</b>A is irradiated with a reference beam, which is coherent light that passes through an optical path of diffusion light from an emitter (an emission point of a LED <b>50</b>) that spreads to the desired hologram diameter r<sub>H</sub>, when passing through the hologram recording layer <b>60</b>A. A laser source such as a semiconductor laser is used in irradiating the hologram recording layer <b>60</b>A with the coherent light.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The same side (the backside) of the hologram recording layer <b>60</b>A is irradiated with the signal beam and the reference beam. The backside of the hologram recording layer <b>60</b>A faces the side of the LED substrate <b>58</b>. An interference fringe (intensity distribution) obtained by interference between the signal beam and the reference beam is recorded over a thickness direction of the hologram recording layer <b>60</b>A, thereby obtaining a hologram recording layer <b>60</b> in which a transmission holographic optical element <b>54</b> is formed. The holographic optical element <b>54</b> is a volume hologram in which an intensity distribution of the interference fringe is recorded in a plane direction and a thickness direction. LPH <b>14</b> is produced by fixing the hologram recording layer <b>60</b> onto the LED substrate <b>58</b> on which the LED array <b>52</b> is mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Although the surface <b>12</b>A is schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, it is in practice located significantly further away, since the hologram diameter r<sub>H </sub>is several millimeters wide while the operating distance L is several centimeters long. Therefore, the holographic optical element <b>54</b> is in practice not a conical shape as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, but a truncated-cone shape as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a view illustrating a state in which the holographic optical element is formed in the hologram recording layer as with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. Unlike the recording method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the surface side of the hologram recording layer <b>60</b>A is irradiated with the signal beam and the reference beam. That is, the hologram is recorded by a phase conjugate wave. In this exemplary embodiment, the hologram is recorded by the phase conjugate wave in the hologram recording layer <b>60</b> formed on the LED substrate <b>58</b>. Accordingly, the detailed recording method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is described later.</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> are views illustrating a state in which diffracted light is produced from the holographic optical element. When LED <b>50</b> emits light, the light emitted from LED <b>50</b> passes through an optical path of diffusion light that spreads from the emitter to the hologram diameter r<sub>H</sub>. Light emission of the LED <b>50</b> generates substantially the same effect as when the holographic optical element <b>54</b> is irradiated with the reference beam. Owing to irradiation of the reference beam, a beam substantially identical to the signal beam is reconstructed from the holographic optical element <b>54</b> and is output as diffracted light. The output diffracted light converges on the surface <b>12</b>A of the photosensitive drum <b>12</b> at an operating distance of several centimeters to form an image. A beam spot <b>62</b> is formed on the surface <b>12</b>A. The volume hologram has a high incident angle selectivity and a high wavelength selectivity, and high diffraction efficiency is obtained. Therefore, background noise is reduced, and the signal beam accurately reconstructed to form a micro beam spot (light collecting point) having a clear outline on the surface <b>12</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The light emitted from LED <b>50</b> provided on the first straight line and represented by LED <b>50</b><sub>1 </sub>is diffracted from the emission optical axis by an angle &#x3b8;<sub>1</sub>, and the light emitted from LED <b>50</b> provided on the second straight line and represented by LED <b>50</b><sub>2 </sub>is diffracted from the emission optical axis by an angle &#x3b8;<sub>2</sub>. The angles &#x3b8;<sub>1 </sub>and &#x3b8;<sub>2 </sub>formed between the emission optical axis and the diffracted light optical axis (optical axis of the diffracted light) are set such that the photosensitive drum <b>12</b> is located outside the optical path of the diffusion light spreading from the LED <b>50</b> to the hologram diameter r<sub>H</sub>. Accordingly, even if the diffusion light is not diffracted by the hologram but transmitted through the hologram, the photosensitive drum <b>12</b> is not irradiated with the transmitted diffusion light as background light.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the output diffracted light converges in the direction of the photosensitive drum <b>12</b> to form the image on the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>12</b> disposed on the focal plane at a distance of several centimeters.

The plural LED chips <b>53</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>53</b><sub>2 </sub>are arrayed in a staggered manner, and the plural LEDs <b>50</b> are distributed in the slow-scanning direction; further, when the angles &#x3b8;<sub>1 </sub>and &#x3b8;<sub>2 </sub>are appropriately set according to the position of the LED chips in the slow-scanning direction, the beam spots <b>62</b><sub>1 </sub>to <b>62</b><sub>6 </sub>can be formed in a line in the fast-scanning direction even if the plural LEDs in each LED chip do not emit light at mutually different times. The beam spots <b>62</b><sub>1 </sub>to <b>62</b><sub>6 </sub>are collectively referred to as &#x201c;beam spot <b>62</b>&#x201d; unless expressly stated otherwise.</p>

Alternatively, the LED chip <b>53</b> may include four or more LEDs <b>50</b>, and three or more LED chips <b>53</b> may be arranged. In an actual image forming apparatus, several thousands of LEDs are arrayed in the fast-scanning direction according to a desired resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it is assumed that 58 SLED chips in which 128 SLEDs are mounted at an interval of 1200 spi (spots per inch), are arrayed in series to form the SLED array in which SLEDs are arranged in lines along the fast-scanning direction. Based on this assumption, 7424 SLEDs are arrayed at intervals of 21 &#x3bc;m in the image forming apparatus having a resolution of 1200 dpi. Assuming that all the SLEDs are used as the emitters, 7424 beam spots <b>62</b> corresponding to 7424 SLEDs are formed in a line in the fast-scanning direction on the photosensitive drum <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, for the purpose of convenience, plural LEDs <b>50</b> are arrayed in two lines.

As used herein, the &#x201c;emitter&#x201d; means a light-emitting element that is selected to be used as the light source. Based on the measurement values of the selected parts of LEDs <b>50</b>, the holographic optical element <b>54</b> is formed in a previously designated position. Because the hologram is recorded according to the position of the emitter used, either a one-dimensional array or a two-dimensional array may be adopted in the LED array <b>52</b>, and positional deviation of LED <b>50</b> or the LED chip <b>53</b> can be also compensated for.</p>

The beam spot formed by the converging lens is known as an Airy disc according to the following relational expression.

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In an LPH in which a conventional holographic optical element array is used, each of plural holographic optical elements is prepared with a diameter equal to or less than a pitch of plural light-emitting devices (an LED pitch) such that the holographic optical elements do not overlap each other, similar to the case in which each of plural lenses is arrayed corresponding to LEDs. The LED pitch is substantially equal to an interval (pixel pitch) between the micro beam spots formed on the photosensitive drum, and the LED pitch is tens of micrometers. In a holographic optical element whose diameter is tens of micrometers, as with a rod lens, only an operating distance in the order of magnitude of several millimeters is obtained, owing to beam expansion caused by diffraction (that is, it is limited by diffraction). On the other hand, in the exemplary embodiment, the diameter of the holographic optical element is larger than the LED pitch, thereby realizing an operating distance in the order of magnitude of centimeters.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">For example, when the diameter of the holographic optical element is set equal to or less than the LED pitch as is conventionally done, it is necessary to set the hologram size r<sub>H </sub>to about 20 &#x3bc;m or less at a resolution of 1200 dpi. At this point, when the wavelength is set to 780 nm, the operating distance is limited to at most 420 &#x3bc;m even if the beam spot size &#x3c6; is permitted to be enlarged to about 40 &#x3bc;m. In the conventional technique, it is difficult to lengthen the operating distance to the order of magnitude of centimeters.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">On the other hand, in the exemplary embodiment, when the diameter of the holographic optical element increases to be greater than the LED pitch, the operating distance is lengthened to the order of magnitude of centimeters. For example, the operating distance is lengthened to 1 cm or more when the diameter (hologram diameter r<sub>H</sub>) of the holographic optical element <b>54</b> that acts as the converging lens is set to 1 mm or more. For example, assuming hologram diameter r<sub>H</sub>=2 mm and hologram thickness h<sub>H</sub>=250 &#x3bc;m, beam spot size &#x3c6; becomes about 40 &#x3bc;m (about 30 &#x3bc;m in terms of half-value width) at an operating distance of 4 cm.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">When the diameter of the holographic optical element exceeds 10 mm, because a multiplicity of the holographic optical elements increases greatly, diffraction efficiency, which is limited by a dynamic range of the material, decreases. Accordingly, the diameter of the holographic optical element may be set to 10 mm or less according to the dynamic range of the material.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Outline of LPH Producing Method</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">An example of a method for producing LPH <b>14</b> will be described. An alignment inspection step and a hologram recording step will be described in more detail below as a procedure of a &#x201c;selective hologram formation&#x201d; along with a configuration of a hologram recording apparatus. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 6E</figref> are views illustrating the steps of an LED printhead producing process. The outline of the LED printhead producing process is described above as the principle of recording and reconstruction of the holographic optical element <b>54</b>. At this point, although only one LED <b>50</b> and one holographic optical element <b>54</b> are illustrated since the figure is a sectional view in the slow-scanning direction, the description of the process relates to producing an LPH <b>14</b> that includes the LED array <b>52</b> and the holographic optical element array <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, plural LEDs <b>50</b> are arrayed in each of plural LED chips <b>53</b>, and the LED array <b>52</b> mounted on the LED substrate <b>58</b> is thereby prepared. A mound portion <b>64</b> is formed into a frame shape at a peripheral portion on the surface of the LED substrate <b>58</b> in order to dam the photopolymer. For example, the mound portion <b>64</b> may be formed by applying a curable polymer having substantially the same thickness as the hologram recording layer <b>60</b> and curing the curable polymer by irradiating it with heat or light. When a thin volume hologram is recorded, the hologram recording layer <b>60</b> has a thickness of hundreds of micrometers, and the mound portion <b>64</b> is formed having a thickness of hundreds micrometers. When a thick volume hologram is recorded, the hologram recording layer <b>60</b> has a thickness of 1 mm to 10 mm, and the mound portion <b>64</b> is formed having a thickness of 1 mm to 10 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the photopolymer is caused to flow from a dispenser onto the LED substrate <b>58</b> at a periphery of which is formed the frame shaped mound portion <b>64</b>, to an extent that the photopolymer does not overflow from the mound portion <b>64</b>, thereby forming the hologram recording layer <b>60</b>A. Then, a thin cover glass that is transparent to recording (writing) light and reconstruction (reading) light is mounted on the surface of the hologram recording layer <b>60</b>A to form the protective layer <b>66</b> on the hologram recording layer <b>60</b>A. Subsequently, chip alignment inspection is performed to measure the position and luminous intensity of each of the plural LEDs <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, the hologram recording layer <b>60</b>A made of the photopolymer is simultaneously irradiated with the signal beam and the reference beam from the side of the protective layer <b>66</b> to form the plural holographic optical elements <b>54</b> in the hologram recording layer <b>60</b>A. The hologram recording layer <b>60</b>A is irradiated with the signal beam, which is a laser beam passing reversely through the optical path of the desired diffracted light. The hologram recording layer <b>60</b>A is irradiated with the reference beam, which is a laser beam passing through the optical path of the convergent light that converges from the desired hologram diameter r<sub>H </sub>to the emission point (emitter) when passing through the hologram recording layer <b>60</b>A. That is, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the hologram is recorded by phase conjugate waves. A laser beam having a wavelength of 780 nm emitted from a semiconductor laser may be used as the laser beams for the signal beam and the reference beam.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">LEDs <b>50</b> used as the emitters are selected based on the measurement data obtained by the chip alignment inspection. Properties of the signal beam and reference beam, such as an irradiation position, an irradiation angle, a spread angle, and a convergent angle, are set in each selected LED <b>50</b> according to the measurement data and design values (predetermined parameters such as a hologram diameter r<sub>H </sub>and a hologram thickness h<sub>H</sub>) of the holographic optical element <b>54</b>. At this point, the signal beam is set in each selected LED <b>50</b> such that spots <b>62</b>, each of which is formed from diffracted light (a reconstructed signal beam) produced by the hologram element <b>54</b>, are formed in a line at predetermined intervals on the photosensitive drum <b>12</b>. A recording optical system for irradiation of the hologram recording layer <b>60</b>A with the designed signal beam and reference beam is disposed in each selected LED <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The LED substrate <b>58</b> in which the hologram recording layer <b>60</b>A is formed is moved with respect to the optical system that irradiates the hologram recording layer <b>60</b>A with the reference beam. The LED substrate <b>58</b> is moved to a predetermined position such that the reference beam converges sequentially on each selected LED <b>50</b>. An optical system that irradiates the hologram recording layer <b>60</b>A with the signal beam is disposed in each position of the LED substrate <b>58</b> such that a reconstructed signal beam forms a beam spot <b>62</b> in a desired position on the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>12</b>. The hologram recording layer <b>60</b>A is irradiated at each position of the LED substrate <b>58</b> in accordance with the signal beam and the reference beam of the LEDs <b>50</b>, and the plural holographic optical elements <b>54</b> are plurally-recorded in the hologram recording layer <b>60</b>A by shift multiplexing with a spherical wave.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>, flood exposure of the hologram recording layer <b>60</b>A is performed with UV (ultraviolet) irradiation to polymerize the whole of the photo-polymerizable monomer. A refractive index profile (refractivity distribution) is fixed to the hologram recording layer <b>60</b>A by the fixing step. The photopolymer may be a mixture of the photo-polymerizable monomer and another non-polymerizable compound. In such cases, when the photopolymer is irradiated with an interference fringe, the photo-polymerizable monomer is polymerized at a bright portion, and a concentration gradient of the photo-polymerizable monomer is generated. As a result, the photo-polymerizable monomer diffuses in the bright portion, and a difference in refractive index is generated between the bright portion and the dark portion.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The photo-polymerizable monomer remaining in the dark portion is polymerized by the further flood exposure to complete the polymerization reaction, and thereby, re-recording (that is, rewriting or overwriting) or erasing becomes substantially impossible in the hologram recording layer <b>60</b>A. Materials for holographic memory have been proposed based on various recording mechanisms. A material in which a refractive index profile (refractivity modulation) is recorded according to a luminous intensity profile (light intensity distribution) may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6E</figref>, the plural LEDs <b>50</b> are sequentially turned on and emit light to inspect whether the desired diffracted light is obtained by the holographic optical element <b>54</b> that is formed according to each LED <b>50</b>. All steps of the producing process end after the inspection step.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the producing process, an LED <b>50</b> and the hologram recording layer <b>60</b> are in contact with each other. Alternatively, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3C</figref>, the hologram recording layer <b>60</b> may be separated from an LED <b>50</b> and an air layer or transparent resin layer may be interposed therebetween. In this case, a sheet including an unrecorded hologram recording layer <b>60</b>A sandwiched between protective layers may separately be prepared and disposed on a light-emitting device array.</p>

<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In the exemplary embodiment, the LED printhead includes plural LEDs (including SLEDs). Alternatively, other light-emitting devices such as an Electro Luminescent (EL) device and a Laser Diode (LD) may be used instead of an LED. In the exposure apparatus including an LD as a coherent light source, energy use efficiency is higher than that of the exposure apparatus including an incoherent light source. However, if unnecessary exposure of incoherent light is prevented and a holographic optical element is designed according to a characteristic of the light-emitting device, even if an LED or an EL that emits the incoherent light is used as the light-emitting device, a micro beam spot having a clear outline can be formed similar to when an LD that emits coherent light is used as the light-emitting device.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">In the exemplary embodiment, plural LEDs are arrayed along the length direction of the LED array. Alternatively, a light-emitting device array (light source array) such as an LED array may be formed by a one-dimensional array, or a two-dimensional array. For example, a surface-emitting laser array in which vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSEL) are arrayed one-dimensionally or two-dimensionally may be used. As described in the exemplary embodiment, the light source array includes an excess of light-emitting devices, the position and luminous intensity of each of the plural light-emitting devices are measured, and a portion of the light-emitting devices are selected based on the measurement values and used as emitters. Therefore, even if deficiencies such as defects, variations in luminous intensity, and positional deviation exist in the light source array, these can be compensated for by appropriately selecting the emitters.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">In the exemplary embodiment, the plural holographic optical elements are plurally-recorded by shift multiplexing with a spherical wave. Alternatively, the plural holographic optical elements may be plurally-recorded by another multiplexing method as long as the desired diffracted light is obtained by the multiplexing method Plural kinds of multiplexing methods may be used simultaneously. Examples of another multiplexing method include angle-multiplexing, in which the holographic optical elements are recorded while the incident angle of the reference beam is changed, wavelength-multiplexing, in which the holographic optical elements are recorded while the wavelength of the reference beam is changed, and phase-multiplexing, in which the holographic optical elements are recorded while the phase of the reference beam is changed. When multiple recording is performed, the different pieces of diffracted light may be reconstructed with no crosstalk from the plurally-recorded plural holograms.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In the exemplary embodiment, the image forming apparatus is a tandem digital color printer, and the LED printhead is an exposure apparatus that exposes the photosensitive drum of each image forming unit of the image forming apparatus. However, an image forming apparatus in which the exposure apparatus exposes a photosensitive image recording medium to form an image may be used, and the invention is not limited to the exemplary embodiment. For example, the image forming apparatus is not limited to an electrophotographic digital color printer. The exposure apparatus of the invention may be mounted on a writing apparatus such as a silver-salt photographic image forming apparatus or photo-addressable electronic paper. The photosensitive image recording medium is not limited to the photosensitive drum. The exposure apparatus of the invention may be applied to the exposure of a sheet-like photosensitive material, a photosensitive material (for silver salt photograph), a photoresist, or a photopolymer.</p>
