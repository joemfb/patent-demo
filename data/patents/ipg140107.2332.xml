<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to copolyesters containing residues of neopentyl glycol and 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclobutanediol having high intrinsic viscosity and thermal stability.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">High molecular weight copolyesters containing both neopentyl glycol (NPG) and 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl 1,3-cyclobutanediol (TMCD) are difficult to prepare using conventional catalysts (e.g. titanium and/or tin) and polymerization conditions. TMCD can increase the glass transition temperature (Tg) in copolyesters made from dimethyl terephthalate (DMT)</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Producing an amorphous copolyester having a high Tg is desirable for certain end use applications where the polymer must remain dimensionally stable under heat. While TMCD can raise the Tg of an amorphous copolyester, it becomes difficult to insert TMCD residues into the backbone of the copolyester in the melt phase polycondensation to produce a polymer with high Tg. Using an excess of TMCD to incorporate the desired amount of TMCD into the backbone of the copolyester results in increased costs for use of the excess TMCD.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, a polyester made using only TMCD as the glycol has such a high melt viscosity that it is difficult to make and process. Therefore, other glycol comonomers are used to lower the melt viscosity of the polymer melt and to also improve other properties such as toughness. One glycol that has been used is 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM). Copolyesters made from DMT, CHDM and TMCD have had commercial success, but can suffer from decreased thermal stability due to degradation reactions with the CHDM component, meaning that the polymer loses molecular weight during high temperature processing of the polymer in melt extrusion. Furthermore, high processing temperatures during the manufacture of the polymer, especially in the final polymerization reactor, also called the finisher, are desirable to produce polymers from the melt that have a high molecular weight, typically measured as the polymer's intrinsic viscosity (It.V). However, a polymer with poor thermal stability at the finisher reaction temperatures makes it difficult to adequately build the IV (0.55 dL/g or more) needed for many end use applications.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, there remains a need to develop a copolyester containing TMCD that has a good balance of high Tg (at least 90&#xb0; C.), good IV (0.55 dL/g or more), has an acceptable level of TMCD incorporation into the backbone of the copolyester polymer, and has good thermal stability.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">4. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0019">The present invention may be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0020">As used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. For example, reference to processing or making a &#x201c;polymer,&#x201d; a &#x201c;preform,&#x201d; &#x201c;article,&#x201d; &#x201c;container,&#x201d; or &#x201c;bottle&#x201d; is intended to include the processing or making of a plurality of polymers, preforms, articles, containers or bottles.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0021">References to a composition containing &#x201c;an&#x201d; ingredient or &#x201c;a&#x201d; polymer is intended to include other ingredients or other polymers, respectively, in addition to the one named.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0022">By &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; or &#x201c;containing&#x201d; or &#x201c;having&#x201d; is meant that at least the named compound, element, particle, or method step etc. must be present in the composition or article or method, but does not exclude the presence of other compounds, catalysts, materials, particles, method steps, etc., even if the other such compounds, material, particles, method steps etc. have the same function as what is named, unless expressly excluded in the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0023">It is also to be understood that the mention of one or more method steps does not preclude the presence of additional method steps before or after the combined recited steps or intervening method steps between those steps expressly identified. Moreover, the lettering of process steps is a convenient means for identifying discrete activities or steps, and unless otherwise specified, recited process steps can be arranged in any sequence. Expressing a range includes all integers and fractions thereof within the range. Expressing a range also includes the end points of the range regardless of whether the range is referred to a number &#x201c;within&#x201d; or &#x201c;between&#x201d; or &#x201c;of&#x201d; certain expressed numbers. The ranges stated in this disclosure and the claims are intended to include the entire range specifically and not just the endpoint(s). For example, a range stated to be 0 to 10 is intended to disclose all whole numbers between 0 and 10 such as, for example 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., all fractional numbers between 0 and 10, for example 1.5, 2.3, 4.57, 6.1113, etc., and the endpoints 0 and 10.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0024">Also, a range associated with chemical substituant groups such as, for example, &#x201c;C<sub>1 </sub>to C<sub>5 </sub>hydrocarbons&#x201d;, is intended to specifically include and disclose C<sub>1 </sub>and C<sub>5 </sub>hydrocarbons as well as C<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>, and C<sub>4 </sub>hydrocarbons.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0025">Expressing a temperature or a temperature range in a process, or of a reaction mixture, or of a melt or applied to a melt, or of a polymer or applied to a polymer means in all cases that the limitation is satisfied if either the applied temperature, the actual temperature of the melt or polymer, or both are at a value within the specified range, continuously or intermittently.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0026">The word &#x201c;composition&#x201d; means a single ingredient or polymer or multiple ingredients or polymers. Each listed ingredient is present in the composition, and the composition may contain any number and types of other unspecified ingredients or polymers. A composition does not imply that an ingredient in the composition is unbound or unreacted. The composition may be solid or liquid. The stated ingredients in the composition may be bound, unbound, reacted, unreacted, and unless otherwise specified, in any oxidation state.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0027">By &#x201c;atoms&#x201d; as used in conjunction with a metal is meant the metal atom occupying any oxidation state, any morphological state, any structural state, and any chemical state, whether as added to or as present in the polymer or composition of matter.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0028">The term &#x201c;polyester&#x201d;, as used herein, is intended to include &#x201c;copolyesters&#x201d; and is understood to mean a synthetic polymer prepared by the polycondensation of one or more difunctional carboxylic acids and two more difunctional hydroxyl compounds. Typically the difunctional carboxylic acid is a dicarboxylic acid and the difunctional hydroxyl compound is a dihydric alcohol such as, for example, glycols and diols.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0029">The term &#x201c;residue&#x201d;, as used herein, means any organic structure incorporated into a polymer through a polycondensation reaction involving the corresponding monomer. The term &#x201c;repeating unit&#x201d;, as used herein, means an organic structure having a dicarboxylic acid residue and a diol residue bonded through a carbonyloxy group. Thus, the dicarboxylic acid residues may be derived from a dicarboxylic acid monomer or its associated acid halides, esters, salts, anhydrides, or mixtures thereof. As used herein, therefore, the term dicarboxylic acid is intended to include dicarboxylic acids and any derivative of a dicarboxylic acid, including its associated acid halides, esters, half-esters, salts, half-salts, anhydrides, mixed anhydrides, or mixtures thereof, useful in a polycondensation process with a diol to make high molecular weight copolyester.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0030">The copolyester polymer of this invention is any thermoplastic copolyester polymer in any state (e.g. solid or molten), and in any shape, each as the context in which the phrase is used dictates, and includes the composition of matter resulting from the melt phase, or the composition of matter in a melt extrusion zone, or articles made from the copolyester, such as injection molded articles, injection blow molded articles, injection stretch blow molded articles, extruded film, extruded sheet, extrusion blow molded articles, and fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0031">The copolyester polymer is any thermoplastic copolyester polymer. Copolyester thermoplastic polymers of the invention are distinguishable from liquid crystal polymers and thermosetting polymers in that thermoplastic polymers have no appreciable ordered structure while in the liquid (melt) phase, they can be remelted and reshaped into a molded article, and liquid crystal polymers and thermosetting polymers are unsuitable for the intended applications such as packaging or stretching in a mold to make a container.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0032">The copolyester polymer is desirably a random polymer such that the monomer units in the polymer chain are randomly arranged rather than arranged in an ordered block fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0033">The term &#x201c;melt phase polymerization&#x201d; is a broad umbrella term referring to a stream undergoing reaction at any point in the melt phase for making a copolyester polymer, and includes the composition in the first esterification vessel and anywhere in the esterification phase even though the viscosity of the stream at this stage is typically not measurable or meaningful, and also includes the stream in the polycondensation phase including the prepolymer and finishing phases, in-between each phase, and less than the point where the melt is solidified, and excludes a copolyester polymer undergoing an increase in molecular weight in the solid state.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0034">The copolyesters of this invention can be amorphous or semi-crystalline depending on the type and amounts of monomers used. In one aspect, certain polyesters useful in the invention can have substantially amorphous morphology, meaning that the polyesters comprise substantially un-ordered regions of polymer. Amorphous copolyesters generally do not have melting points.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0035">The &#x201c;bulk&#x201d; of copolyester particles is defined as an accumulation of particles which together weigh at least 500 kg. A bulk having a defined characteristic can be determined by taking a random sampling of 10 particles from the bulk for analysis. When it is said that a bulk of copolyester exhibit the characteristics expressed herein, it is meant that a random sampling of 10 or more particles taken from the bulk exhibit an average of a defined characteristic determined by the suitable analysis. As in any manufacturing process, it is possible to obtain anomalous particles which exhibit characteristics either inside or outside of those stated herein. The particles of the invention, however, exhibit the stated characteristics across a bulk, and these characteristics can be measured by taking a random sampling of at least ten particles and determining the stated characteristics as an average across the ten particles. All ten particles may be measured together in one analysis, or each particle may be separately analyzed.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0036">The bulk of copolyester polymer particles are desirably packaged into a container. Examples of suitable containers to hold the particles are storage silos to hold the particles while they await shipment from one location to another. Another example of a container is a dryer hopper attached to an extruder or injection molding machine. Another example of a container to hold the particles is a shipping container, such as a Gaylord box, a crate, a railcar, a trailer that can be attached to a truck, a drum, a cargo hold on a ship, or any other suitable package used to transport particles. Thus, there are provided containers with particles which are finished and ready for shipment or in shipment to a customer for converting the pellets to an article. The particles have been subjected by the particle manufacturer to all the processing conditions needed to produce a particle with characteristics acceptable to its customers who convert the pellets to articles. In the embodiment where the pellets may occupy a dryer hopper, the converter of pellets places the bulk of the pellets into the dryer hopper and removes residual moisture from the pellets to prevent excessive IV degradation during melt processing.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0037">In a preferred embodiment, the copolyester composition, or the bulk of particles, are not solid state polymerized. For example, there is provided a bulk of particles in a container, most preferably a shipping container, which have not been solid state polymerized, meaning their molecular weight has not been increased in the solid state by more than 0.05 dL/g. Desirably, their molecular weight has not been increased in the solid state by more than 0.02 dL/g, or even 0.01 dL/g.</p>

Aluminum compounds can also be added as slurries or suspensions in a liquid that is volatile and/or reactive with the copolyester forming ingredients. Aluminum can also be added to the melt phase process by melt blending the aluminum compound with a copolyester polymer in a suitable extruder or other device to form a concentrate, and subsequently, preferably melting the concentrate as a molten feed to the melt phase process.

A nitrogen purge can minimize color formation in the solution or mixture if color bodies are a problem. The nitrogen purge rate should be sufficient to remove volatiles that react to form color bodies, such as from 0.5 to 3 scfm, or 1 to 2 scfm. To maintain or improve solubility, it is helpful to keep the solution or mixture at 115 to 135&#xb0; C. with a nitrogen purge. The contents of the catalyst mix tank may be transferred to a catalyst feed tank, which may be utilized to introduce the solution or mixture into the copolyester melt phase manufacturing process.

At least a portion of the tin atoms of the invention are catalytically active as compounds or metals. It is desirable to select a tin catalyst compound which can be dissolved in a diluent or a carrier that is volatile and/or reactive with the copolyester forming ingredients, or that is a liquid at ambient temperatures and can be fed directly to the process as a liquid; or as a low-melting solid that can be heated to form a liquid with can be fed directly to the process. Suitable liquid reactive carriers can have any molecular weight, such as those ranging from 62 to about 10,000 grams per mole. Tin compounds can also be added as slurries or suspensions in a liquid that is volatile and/or reactive with the copolyester forming ingredients. Tin can also be added to the melt phase process by melt blending the tin compound with a copolyester polymer in a suitable extruder or other device to form a concentrate, and subsequently, preferably melting the concentrate as a molten feed to the melt phase process. A preferred mode of addition of tin compounds is addition to a catalyst mix tank, which is part of the copolyester melt phase process equipment. A suitable solvent can include any of the hydroxyl compounds used as reactants to make the copolyester.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0096">For example, a tin compound, an aluminum compound and an alkali metal compound or an alkaline earth metal compound can be heated at a temperature and for an amount of time to affect dissolution initially. Suitable temperatures include 110 to 140&#xb0; C., or 115 to 135&#xb0; C., for one to four hours. A nitrogen purge can minimize color formation in the solution or mixture if color bodies are a problem. The nitrogen purge rate should be sufficient to remove volatiles that react to form color bodies, such as from 0.5 to 3 scfm, or 1 to 2 scfm. To maintain or improve solubility, it is helpful to keep the solution or mixture at 115 to 135&#xb0; C. with a nitrogen purge. The contents of the catalyst mix tank may be transferred to a catalyst feed tank, which may be utilized to introduce the solution or mixture into the copolyester melt phase manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0097">Desirably, the tin catalyst is added to the melt phase manufacturing process, and specifically during esterification before the addition of the aluminum atoms and the alkali or alkaline earth metal atoms. For example, the tin atoms that form part of the tin catalyst can be mixed with one or more of the acid component and/or hydroxyl component which are fed to the esterification process or the first esterification vessel. After reacting the acid component and hydroxyl component to form a reaction mixture after at least 1 minute of reaction time, or at least 5 minutes, or at least 15 minutes, or at least 20 minutes, the aluminum and alkali or alkaline earth metal catalyst can be added to the reaction mixture. This is particularly desirable when high catalyst loadings of tin are utilized. By adding tin catalysts first, one may achieve a copolyester that has a good IV and/or reduce the residence time of the melt in the finisher vessel or zone.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0098">Suitable examples of tin compounds include the organotin salts, the organotin oxides, and stannoic acids For example, see U.S. Pat. No. 2,720,507, where the portion concerning tin catalysts is incorporated herein by reference. These catalysts are tin compounds containing at least one organic radical. These catalysts include compounds of both divalent or tetravalent tin which have the general formulas set forth below:</p>

<p id="p-0098" num="0112">The order of addition of catalyst metals is not limited. The aluminum, alkali or alkaline earth metal atoms, and tin atoms may be added together or as separate streams, together with acid component or the hydroxyl component prior to feeding one or both to the first esterification vessel, or fed together or separately into a first esterification vessel separate from the feed of the acid component or the hydroxyl component, or fed sequentially. For example, the tin atoms may be pre-mixed together with the acid component, which can be formed into a paste, and the paste fed into the first esterification vessel, followed by feeding the aluminum and alkali or alkaline earth metal atoms into the last esterification vessel, into a line or vessel between the esterification phase and the polycondensation phase, or at or into the polycondensation phase vessels or lines.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0113">To avoid potential undesirably side reactions between aluminum catalyst and water generated in the esterification zone which may inhibit or deactivate the aluminum catalyst and thereby slow down the rate of polycondensation, it is desirable in yet another embodiment to add the aluminum compounds after substantial completion of the esterification reaction or at the beginning of or during polycondensation. In a further embodiment, at least 75%, or at least 85%, or at least 95% of the esterification reaction (in terms of conversion) is conducted in the absence of added aluminum compounds. It is desirable to add the aluminum compound and the alkali metal or alkaline earth metal compound at or near the same addition point. It is most desirable to premix and heat the aluminum compound and the alkali metal or alkaline earth metal compound, like in a catalyst mix tank, prior to addition to the melt phase manufacturing line for copolyester polymers.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0114">Other catalyst metals may be present if desired. For example, Mn, Zn, Sb, Co, Ti, and Ge catalysts may be used in conjunction with aluminum and alkaline earth metals or alkali catalysts. Titanium and zinc catalysts can be used, particularly if melt phase manufacture involves ester exchange reactions. The amount of titanium catalyst, if used, generally ranges from 2 ppm to 30 ppm, based on the weight of the polymer. Zinc catalysts can also be used in combination with the Sn/Al/alkali or alkaline earth metal system of the invention in amounts that are the same as the amounts from 30 to 80 ppm. It may be necessary to add a stabilizer such as a phosphorus compound If catalytic metals other than aluminum, alkaline earth metals, or alkali metals are present.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0115">Desirably, the copolyester polymer is made without the addition of titanium catalyst, cobalt catalyst, zinc catalyst or antimony catalyst to the melt phase reaction. More preferably, the copolyester polymer is made without the addition of any catalytically active metal or metal compounds to the melt phase reaction other than the tin/aluminum/alkali metal or alkaline earth or alkali system It is to be recognized, however, that one or more of metals such as cobalt or manganese will most likely be present at low levels in the melt because they come as impurities with the terephthalic acid composition made from a metal-catalyzed, liquid-phase oxidation process. Metal impurities present in the raw material supply to the melt phase process are not considered to be metals added to the melt phase process.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0116">The weight of aluminum and alkaline earth metal or alkali metal and tin and other co-catalyst metals can be measured upon addition to the melt phase or by analytical techniques for detecting the amount in the finished polymer or article. Suitable detection methods for the presence of aluminum and alkali metals or alkaline earth metals include inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). While X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) is a suitable detection method for some alkaline earth metals and some alkali metals, it is not suitable for detecting aluminum at lower levels, like those found in copolyester. The concentration of an alkaline earth metal or an alkali metal is reported as the parts per million of metal atoms based on the weight of the polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0117">The aluminum and alkali or alkaline earth metals may be added as a solution, fine dispersion, a paste, a slurry, or neat. They are preferably added as a liquid, a melt, or a free flowing solid which can be metered. Most preferably they are added as a liquid, and in particular as a liquid solution or dispersion.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0118">Optionally, the copolyester polymer also contains a stabilizer. By a catalyst stabilizer is meant a compound effective to at least partially deactivate or inhibit the activity of the catalyst system. Stabilizers useful in the invention can be phosphorus-based acids wherein one or more of the hydrogen atoms of the acid compound (bonded to either oxygen or phosphorus atoms) are replaced with alkyl, branched alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkyl ethers, substituted alkyl ethers, alkyl-aryl, alkyl-substituted aryl, aryl, substituted aryl, and mixtures thereof. The esters can contain alkyl, branched alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkyl ethers, aryl, and/or substituted aryl groups. The esters can also have at least one alkyl group and at least one aryl group. The number of ester groups present in the particular phosphorus compound can vary from zero up to the maximum allowable based on the number of hydroxyl groups present on the phosphorus compound used. For example, an alkyl phosphate ester can include one or more of the mono-, di-, and tri alkyl phosphate esters; an aryl phosphate ester includes one or more of the mono-, di-, and tri aryl phosphate esters; and an alkyl phosphate ester and/or an aryl phosphate ester also include, but are not limited to, mixed alkyl aryl phosphate esters having at least one alkyl and one aryl group.</p>

The phosphate esters include esters in which the phosphoric acid is fully esterified or only partially esterified.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0121">The phosphate esters include esters in which the phosphoric acid is fully esterified or only partially esterified. In one embodiment, for example, the thermal stabilizers useful in the invention can include at least one phosphate ester.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0122">The phosphate esters can include alkyl, alkoxy-alkyl, phenyl, or substituted phenyl groups. These phosphate esters are generally referred to herein as alkyl and/or aryl phosphate esters. Certain preferred embodiments include trialkyl phosphates, triaryl phosphates, alkyl diaryl phosphates, dialkyl aryl phosphates, and mixtures of such phosphates, wherein the alkyl groups are preferably those containing from 2 to 12 carbon atoms, and the aryl groups are preferably phenyl.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0123">Representative alkyl and branched alkyl groups are those containing from 1-12 carbon atoms, including but not limited to, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, hexyl, cyclohexyl, 2-ethylhexyl, octyl, decyl and dodecyl. Substituted alkyl groups include, but are not limited to, those containing at least one of carboxylic acid groups and esters thereof, hydroxyl groups, amino groups, keto groups, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0124">Representative of alkyl-aryl and substituted alkyl-aryl groups are those wherein the alkyl portion contains from 1-12 carbon atoms, and the aryl group is phenyl or substituted phenyl wherein groups such as alkyl, branched alkyl, aryl,</p>

<p id="p-0112" num="0126">Examples of aryl phosphates include Merpol A. Merpol A is a phosphate ester commercially available from Stepan Chemical Co and/or E.I. duPont de Nemours &#x26; Co. The CAS Registry number for Merpol A is believed to be 30 CAS Registry #37208-27-8.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0127">Amounts of stabilizer added during polymerization or post manufacturing, if added, can include but are not limited to: 1 to 200 ppm, 1 to 150 ppm, 1 to 100 ppm; 1 to 50 ppm, 1 to 30 ppm, 1 to 20 ppm, 1 to 15 ppm, 1 to 10 ppm, 1 to 8 ppm, 1 to 5 ppm, or 1 to 3 ppm, based on the total weight of the polyester composition.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0128">The copolyesters can be made by continuous, semi-continuous, and batch modes of operation and may utilize a variety of reactor types. Examples of suitable reactor types include, but are not limited to, stirred tank, continuous stirred tank, slurry, tubular, wiped-film, falling film, or extrusion reactors. The term &#x201c;continuous&#x201d; as used herein means a process wherein reactants are introduced and products withdrawn simultaneously in an uninterrupted manner. By &#x201c;continuous&#x201d; it is meant that the process is substantially or completely continuous in operation in contrast to a &#x201c;batch&#x201d; process. &#x201c;Continuous&#x201d; is not meant in any way to prohibit normal interruptions in the continuity of the process due to, for example, start-up, reactor maintenance, or scheduled shut down periods. The term &#x201c;batch&#x201d; process as used herein means a process wherein all the reactants are added to the reactor and then processed according to a predetermined course of reaction during which no material is fed or removed into the reactor. The term &#x201c;semicontinuous&#x201d; means a process where some of the reactants are charged at the beginning of the process and the remaining reactants are fed continuously as the reaction progresses. Alternatively, a semicontinuous process may also include a process similar to a batch process in which all the reactants are added at the beginning of the process except that one or more of the products are removed continuously as the reaction progresses.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0129">The copolyester compositions useful in the invention can be made by processes known from the literature such as, for example, by processes in homogenous solution, by trans-esterification processes in the melt, and by two phase interfacial processes. Suitable methods include, but are not limited to, the steps of reacting an acid component with the hydroxyl component at a temperature within a range of 100&#xb0; C. to 315&#xb0; C. and at a pressure within a range of 0.1 to 760 mm Hg.

<p id="p-0127" num="0154">It is desirable to feed one or more dicarboxylic acids, preferably aromatic dicarboxylic acids, or ester forming derivatives thereof, and one or more of the hydroxyl component continuously to an esterification reactor operated at a temperature of between about 150&#xb0; C. and 250&#xb0; C., and at a super-atmospheric pressure of between about 0 psig to 750 psig. The residence time of the reactants typically ranges from between about one and six hours. Normally, the esterification or trans-esterification reaction is continued desirably until a an acid or ester group conversion of at least 70% is achieved, but more typically until an acid or ester group conversion of at least 85% is achieved to make the desired oligomeric mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0155">Water is removed as the esterification reaction proceeds in order to drive the equilibrium toward the desired products. Methanol is removed as the ester exchange reaction of a dimethyl ester of a dicarboxylic acid proceeds in order to drive the equilibrium toward the desired products.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0156">The esterification zone typically produces the oligomer species, if any, continuously in a series of one or more reactors. Alternately, the oligomer species in the oligomeric mixture could be produced in one or more batch reactors. At this stage, the It.V. is usually not measurable or is less than 0.1 dL/g. The average degree of polymerization of the molten oligomeric mixture is typically less than 15, and often less than 7.0.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0157">Desirably, Step A or the esterification or transesterification reaction, or the whole melt phase process (includes esterification or ester exchange and polycondensation) reaction proceeds in the absence of added titanium compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0158">Once the oligomeric mixture is made to the desired percent conversion of the acid or ester groups, it is transported from the esterification zone or reactors to the polycondensation zone (Step B). The commencement of the polycondensation reaction is generally marked by either a higher actual operating temperature than the operating temperature in the esterification zone, or a marked reduction in pressure (usually sub-atmospheric) compared to the esterification zone, or both. Typical polycondensation reactions occur at temperatures ranging from about 230&#xb0; C. and 320&#xb0; C., and at sub-atmospheric pressure of between less than 760 torr to about 0.2 torr. The residence time of the reactants during polycondensation typically ranges from between about 2 to about 6 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0159">In some processes, polycondensation reactions are initiated and continued in the melt phase in a prepolymerization zone and finished in the melt phase in a finishing zone, after which the melt is solidified to form the copolyester polymer melt phase product, generally in the form of chips, pellets, or any other shape.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0160">The temperature applied to the polymer melt or of the polymer melt in at least a portion of the polycondensation zone is desirably greater than 260&#xb0; and less than about 290&#xb0; C. The pressure in the final reactor (or finishing zone) may be within the range of about 0.2 to 20 mm torr, or 0.2 to 10 torr, or 0.2 to 2 torr.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0161">It is desired that the aluminum compound and the alkali or alkaline earth metal compound are added close together e.g. both before the It.V. of the melt reaches 0.2 dL/g, or 0.1 dL/g, or before an increase of 0.1 dL/g after exiting the last esterification reactor, or before entering the first polycondensation reaction vessel). The aluminum, alakali or alkaline earth metal and tin atoms can be added during Step (A), or added together prior to the polycondensation zone, or added together before the I.V. of the melt phase product is 0.2 dL/g, or added before esterification or trans-esterification is 85% complete (by time) or before 75% completion or before 50% completion or before 30% completion each by time. Preferably, the tin catalyst is added at the start of ester exchange to maximize TMCD incorporation followed by a later addition of the Li/Al catalysts added together</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0162">The aluminum compound and the alakali or alkaline earth metal compound can be heated together prior to introduction into a melt-phase copolyester manufacturing line. Since aluminum operates as part of the polycondensation catalyst system, it is desirable to add aluminum to the melt phase manufacture early, such as before the polycondensation zone, to provide the benefit of shorter reaction time and/or a higher molecular weight build-up. An aluminum compound is added preferably together with reactants at the onset of the esterification reaction or step A, and prior to entry of the oligomer mixture into the polycondensation zone or Step (B); or alternatively, no later than when the It.V. of the melt reaches 0.3 dL/g, or no later than when the It.V. of the melt reaches 0.2 dL/g.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0163">Once the polymer molecular weight is built to the desired degree, it is discharged from the final polycondensation reactor, in this case a finisher, to be pelletized. A gear pump may be utilized to facilitate funneling an amount of bulk polymer through a conduit to exit from finishing vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0164">It is to be understood that the melt phase process conditions and reactor configurations described above are illustrative of a melt phase process, and that the invention is not limited to this illustrative process. For example, while reference has been made to a variety of operating conditions at certain discrete It.V. values, differing process conditions may be implemented inside or outside of the stated It.V. values, or the stated operating conditions may be applied at It.V. points in the melt other than as stated. Moreover, one may adjust the process conditions based on reaction time instead of measuring or predicting the It.V. of the melt. The process is also not limited to the use of tank reactors in series or parallel or to the use of different vessels for each zone.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0165">The melt phase product is processed to a desired form, such as amorphous particles. The shape of the copolyester polymer particles is not limited, and can include regular or irregular shaped discrete particles without limitation on their dimensions, including stars, spheres, particles, globoids, cylindrically shaped pellets, conventional pellets, pastilles, and any other shape, but particles are distinguished from a sheet, film, preforms, strands or fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0166">The method for solidifying the copolyester polymer from the melt phase process is not limited. For example, molten copolyester polymer from the melt phase process may be directed through a die, or merely cut, or both directed through a die followed by cutting the molten polymer. A gear pump may be used as the motive force to drive the molten copolyester polymer through the die. Instead of using a gear pump, the molten copolyester polymer may be fed into a single or twin screw extruder and extruded through a die, optionally at a temperature of 190&#xb0; C. or more at the extruder nozzle. Once through the die, the copolyester polymer can be drawn into strands, contacted with a cool fluid, and cut into pellets, or the polymer can be pelletized at the die head, optionally underwater. The copolyester polymer melt is optionally filtered to remove particulates over a designated size before being cut. Any conventional hot pelletization or dicing method and apparatus can be used, including but not limited to dicing, strand pelletizing and strand (forced conveyance) pelletizing, pastillators, water ring pelletizers, hot face pelletizers, underwater pelletizers and centrifuged pelletizers.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0167">The particles can be spheroidal in shape by cutting the molten copolyester underfluid (e.g. underwater) at the die head as the molten polymer is extruded through the die head. This process can be differentiated form strand cutting operations where the extruded polymer is fed into a water bath, allowed to cool and then the strands are cut after the polymer is solidified in the strand form.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0168">Articles can be formed from the solid products produced by the process of the invention by any conventional techniques known to those of skill. For example, the melt phase products are fed to a machine for melt extruding and injection molding the melt into shapes such as preforms suitable for stretch blow molding into beverage or food containers, or a machine for injection molding, or a machine for merely extruding into other forms such as sheet. Suitable processes for forming the articles are known and include extrusion, extrusion blow molding, melt casting, injection molding, a melt to mold process, stretch blow molding (SBM), thermoforming, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0169">Examples of the kinds of shaped articles which can be formed from the melt phase products and the copolyester polymer composition of the invention include sheet; film; packaging and containers such as preforms, bottles, jars, and trays; rods; tubes; lids; and filaments and fibers. Beverage bottles made from polyethylene terephthalate suitable for holding water or carbonated beverages, and heat-set beverage bottles suitable for holding beverages which are hot filled into the bottles are examples of the types of bottles which are made from the crystallized pellet of the invention. Examples of trays are those which are dual ovenable and other CPET trays. The copolyester polymers can be used in various types of film and/or sheet, including but not limited to extruded film(s) and/or sheet(s), calendered film(s) and/or sheet(s), compression molded film(s) and/or sheet(s), solution casted film(s) and/or sheet(s). Methods of making film and/or sheet include but are not limited to extrusion, calendering, compression molding, and solution casting.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0170">Copolyester blends comprising the copolyester and a polymer or ingredient other than the copolyester can be made. Copolyester blends may contain from 0.01 to 25% by weight of the overall composition common additives such as colorants, dyes, mold release agents, flame retardants, plasticizers, nucleating agents, stabilizers, including but not limited to, UV stabilizers, thermal stabilizers and/or reaction products thereof, fillers, and impact modifiers. Examples of typical commercially available impact modifiers well known in the art and useful in this invention include, but are not limited to, ethylene/propylene terpolymers, functionalized polyolefins such as those containing methyl acrylate and/or glycidyl methacrylate, styrene-based block copolymeric impact modifiers, and various acrylic core/shell type impact modifiers. Residues of such additives are also contemplated as part of the copolyester composition</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0171">Reinforcing materials may be useful in the polymer blends of this invention. The reinforcing materials may include, but are not limited to, carbon filaments, silicates, mica, clay, talc, titanium dioxide, Wollastonite, glass flakes, glass beads and fibers, and polymeric fibers and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the reinforcing materials include glass, such as, fibrous glass filaments, mixtures of glass and talc, glass and mica, and glass and polymeric fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0172">The copolyesters of the invention are desirably thermally stable. The weight average molecular weight (Mw) of a dry copolyester is measured before melting and then again after remelting to determine its thermal stability. Desirably, the copolyesters of the invention are thermally stable, meaning that the weight average molecular weight (Mw) of the copolyesters of the invention after heating in a nitrogen atmosphere at 310&#xb0; C. and holding the sample molten for 25 minutes is 15,000 or higher as determined by the GPC method described below. The Mw average molecular weight can be at least 17,000, or at least 18,000, or at least 19,000, or at least 20,000, or at least 21,000.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0173">For the purpose of determining whether the copolyester is thermally stable, the following test method may be employed. Approximately 200 mg of dried polymer granules with a particle size of 3 mm or less are placed in a dry GC headspace vial. A screw type cap with a septa insert is firmly attached to the vial to insure a good seal. The contents are purged with nitrogen by first piercing the septa with an open 18 gauge hypodermic needle that served as an exhaust. A second 18 gauge needle attached to an open nitrogen line with an adapter and Tygon tubing is inserted through the septum. Purging is performed for one minute to provide an inert atmosphere. A total of 6 vials/experiment are prepared in this manner. The vials are then placed in a heating block at 310&#xb0; C. and extracted after 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 minutes. After cooling to room temperature, the samples are submitted for Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) where their molecular weight distribution is measured. GPC is performed on an Agilent Series 1200 series LC instrument consisting of a degasser, an isocratic pump, an auto sampler and a UV detector. Each sample is dissolved in a solvent system made up of 95/5 by volume methylene chloride/hexafluoroisopropanol+0.5 g/L tetraethylammonium bromide.

From this, a % MWL is calculated for each copolyester.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0186">The amorphous copolyester composition is capable of having a molecular weight loss of less than 25% as determined by measuring the molecular weight difference between a dried (at 80 C for at least 24 hours) polymer having a molecular weight measured at ambient conditions before a first melting and the molecular weight of the same polymer sample after melting it for 25 minutes at a temperature of 310&#xb0; C. in a nitrogen atmosphere. The MWL can be as low as no more than 20%, or no more than 18%, or no more than 15%, or no more than 13%, or no more than 11%, or no more than 10%, or no more than 9%, or no more than 8%.</p>

The melt viscosity stability is also another measure of thermal stability. The melt stability of copolyesters can be determined by measuring the melt viscosity loss at a constant temperature and shear rate over a fixed period of time. Desirably, the copolyesters of this invention have a melt viscosity of 1,000 Poise or greater when tested on a Rheometrics Dynamic Analyzer (RDAII) at a constant temperature of 300&#xb0; C. with a 10% strain at a constant frequency of 25 rad/sec after 20 minutes in air. Prior to testing, the polymer is ground to a particle size of 3 mm or less and then dried under vacuum at a temperature close to its glass transition temperature (Tg) for a minimum of 16 hours. The melt viscosity (Poise) of a sample with an approximate weight of 2 grams is measured at 0 and after 20 minutes under the above conditions. The % melt viscosity loss (MVL) is calculated from the 0 and 20 minute data.</p>

<p id="p-0160" num="0210">All polymerizations were conducted on a 0.40 mole scale using a Camile&#x2122; interfaced polymerization stand. In each case the desired amount of DMT, NPG and TMCD were added to a 500 ml polymerization flask. The flask was equipped with a nitrogen inlet and stainless steel stirrer. The contents were purged under nitrogen and then heated in a metal bath under a nitrogen sweep of 0.5 SCFH to sweep over the methanol byproduct during the ester exchange phase (EE) of the polymerization. In some cases, a 40 wt % TMCD methanol solution was used as starting material. In these instances, the polymerization flask was barely dipped in the heated metal bath until most of the charged methanol distilled over which took approximately 10 minutes. Afterwards, the flask was lowered until the molten metal covered the flask approximately &#xbd; in. above the melt level in the flask. After the EE phase was complete, the flask was completely submerged in the metal bath. Vacuum was then applied to the system in order to build molecular weight. As the molecular weight/melt viscosity of the polymer increased in the finisher stage, the stirring speed was reduced to maintain good heat contact and surface renewal of the polymer melt.</p>

<p id="p-0168" num="0222">Table 2 illustrates many points of interest. Examples 3-10 and 13-18 show that a high temperature process in combination with an effective catalyst system (Sn/Li/Al/P, Sn, /Li/Al, Li/Al) can be used to produce high IV copolyesters containing TMCD and NPG with a broad range of glass transition temperatures (Tg). Examples 3-7, 8-10, and 13-18 show that TMCD batches (A-D) containing different ratios of cis/trans isomers (%) can be used (A=42/58, B=58/42 C&#x26;D=53/47). Examples 1 and 2 show that a Sn/P catalyst system alone does not produce high IV polymer and that increasing Sn concentration appears to actually lower the IV. Examples 11 and 12 show that Sn/P in combination with either Li or Al alone does not produce high IV polymer. Example 13 and 18 show that high IV polymer can be obtained with Li/Al catalysts alone or in combination with low Sn (13 ppm). The addition of Sn catalyst increases TMCD incorporation.</p>

<heading id="h-0014" level="1">Low Temperature Preparation of NPG-TMCD Copolyesters</heading>
<p id="p-0169" num="0223">Copolyesters were also prepared using a low temperature preparation method, which employed a lower finisher temperature (280&#xb0; C.) and in most cases, less finisher time (3 hours). Some of the notable differences instituted during the low temperature prep were: more Sn catalyst, the addition of Zn or Ti cocatalysts, the elimination of P, lower glycol/acid mole ratio (MR) and longer hold times during ester exchange. The addition points of Li/Al, and Zn and Ti cocatalysts were varied from up front to the midpoint of stage 3. The advantage of the low temperature prep is to increase TMCD yield by lowering TMCD excess and lessening the amount of TMCD lost due to chain end degradation. The trans isomer of TMCD degrades at elevated temperatures via an elimination reaction, which has the effect of enriching the cis TMCD isomer content in the finished copolyester.</p>

<p id="p-0177" num="0235">Examples (19-21) in Table 4 show that acceptably high IV copolymer containing NPG and TMCD can be prepared with Li/Al, Li/Al/Ti and Li/Al/Zn catalyst combinations. Examples 19, 22, 23 &#x26; 24 were prepared using the same charges of NPG and TMCD to show the effect of Sn catalyst concentration on TMCD incorporation. Higher Sn resulted in more TMCD incorporation, but lower IV. High catalyst loadings of Sn alone or Sn with Li/Al added up front to the paste appeared to cause foaming, which is undesirable. Examples 25-43 show that adding Sn up front, followed by later additions of Li/Al, Li/Al/Zn or Li/Al/Ti help increase IV, reduce finisher time and lessen the chance of foaming. Examples 44 and 45 show that a catalyst combination of Sn/Ti alone does not produce high IV polymer.</p>

A low temperature preparation method in combination with Sn, Li, Al catalysts were used to successfully prepare copolyesters with 3-11 mole % CHDM. The material charges for a typical run containing low CHDM are shown below along with polymerization conditions in Table 5.</p>

<p id="p-0183" num="0246">Table 7 shows the effect of finisher temperature and time on TMCD degradation. The starting cis/trans isomer ratio (%) of the incoming TMCD monomer was 53/47 (cis/trans). As can be seen by examples 50 and 51, the cis/trans ratio for finished polymers using the high temperature prep method was about 70/30. The high cis content is due to degradation of the trans isomer via an elimination reaction (which is a pathway not available to the cis isomer due to steric constraints). A higher cis/trans ratio in the finished polymer compared to that of the starting monomer is an indication of the undesired degradation of the trans-isomer to non-reactive byproducts. Examples 52 and 53 show copolyesters prepared using the low temperature prep method. The cis/trans ratio in these copolyesters was 60/40, indicating less trans-TMCD degradation.</p>

<p id="p-0185" num="0248">NPG/TMCD copolyesters were prepared in a pilot plant using a 30-lb batch style reactor (Unit HV). The batches required very long finisher times to obtain acceptable It.V's of &#x3e;0.556 dL/g or greater for testing. The thermal stability and off gassing behavior were evaluated in the same manner as that described for the lab prep materials. The procedures for successful pilot plant runs are described below. Table 8 reports the batch analytical data.</p>

The catalysts were charged in a 50/50 mixture of ethylene glycol/neopentyl glycol with approximate concentrations of 0.20 wt % Sn, 0.21 wt % Al, 0.15 wt % Li and 0.015 wt % P. The reaction was carried out under a nitrogen gas purge of 10 SCFH in an 18 gallon stainless steel pressure vessel fitted with a condensing column, a vacuum system, and a HELICONE-type agitator. The contents were heated to 50&#xb0; C. and the agitator was started at 25 rpm in the forward direction. Heating and stirring were continued for 2.25 hrs until the reaction temperature was 290&#xb0; C. The temperature was held at 290&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes with the agitator operating at 25 rpm for 6 minutes in the forward direction and 6 minutes in the reverse direction. The pressure was then reduced at a rate of 13 mm Hg/minute to full vacuum. When the pressure dropped below 3.6 mm Hg, the mixture was stirred at 25 rpm for 1 hr and then slowed to 15 rpm. The reaction continued at 290&#xb0; C. at a pressure between 1.4 mm-0.90 mm Hg for 8 hours. Upon completion, the vessel was pressurized with N<sub>2 </sub>to push the molten polymer through an extrusion die.

The molten rods were pulled through a cold water bath to solidify them and chopped into &#x2dc;&#x215b;-inch pellets.</p>

<p id="p-0197" num="0260">Examples 61-81 show that copolyesters containing NPG and TMCD maintain a weight average molecular weight (Mw) of 15,000 or greater after 25 minutes at 310&#xb0; C. when prepared with catalyst systems of Li/Al, Sn/Li/Al, and optionally containing P, Ti and Zn. Examples 82-86 show that a Mw above 15,000 can also be maintained after 25 minutes at 310&#xb0; C. if CHDM is added to NPG-TMCD copolyesters at up to 12 mole %. Examples 87 and 88 show that a Mw less than 15,000 after 25 minutes at 310&#xb0; C. resulted when CHDM-TMCD copolyesters were prepared using a Sn/Li/Al/P catalyst system. Examples 89-91 show that a Mw of less than 15,000 after 25 minutes at 310&#xb0; C. also resulted when production and pilot plant samples of CHDM-TMCD (prepared with high levels of Sn catalyst) were tested.</p>

<p id="p-0201" num="0264">Examples 92-99 show that NPG-TMCD copolyesters prepared with the Sn/Li/Al/P catalyst system at the highest finisher temperature (290&#xb0; C.) had the lowest off gas rates. Examples 100-112 show that the off gas rate increased when the finisher temperature was lowered to 280&#xb0; C. Examples 104-106 show that the addition of Zn cocatalyst at &#x2dc;30-50 ppm resulted in slightly higher off gas rates. Examples 107 &#x26; 108 where low level Ti cocatalyst (5-10 ppm) was added did not appear to adversely affect the off gas rate. The off gas rates of all NPG-TMCD copolyesters prepared with Sn, Li, Al and optionally P, and Zn &#x26; Ti, cocatalysts were lower than Tritan&#x2122; TX-1000 and TX-2000 controls (Examples 115 &#x26; 116) which contain CHDM in place of NPG. Example 113, a Tritan&#x2122; TX-1000 control prepared in the Pilot Plant had the highest off gas rate. Example 114 shows that a CHDM-TMCD copolyester prepared at a high finisher temperature (290&#xb0; C.) using low level Sn, Li, Al &#x26; P had a rate that was considerably lower than the ones prepared with very high Sn in combination with P (Examples 113, 115 &#x26; 116).</p>
