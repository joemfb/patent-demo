<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to content distribution and, more particularly, to a method, apparatus and system for securely communicating content such as audiovisual content.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Content such as audiovisual content, securely stored within a content device, such as a Set-top Box (STB), is often transferred over an unsecured channel (e.g., a home network), to a software player running on, for example, a personal computer (PC). The STB uses a sophisticated conditional access (CA) mechanism to prevent the unauthorized use of the content, however, pirating can easily take place along the unsecured channel.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As such, what is needed is a method, apparatus and system for the secure distribution of audiovisual content.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of the present invention address these and other deficiencies of the prior art by providing a method, apparatus and system for the secure distribution of content, such as audiovisual content.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one embodiment of the present invention, a method for the secure distribution of content includes encrypting the content using a first key, encrypting the first key using a second key, and distributing the encrypted content and the encrypted first key. In such an embodiment of the present invention, the distributed content is decrypted by decrypting the first key using a locally stored copy of the second key and decrypting the content using the decrypted first key. The method can further include the inclusion of identification information intended to identify the original intended user of misappropriated content. That is, the method can further include marking the decrypted content for identification purposes, and re-encrypting the marked content. In addition, the method can further include encrypting the content using a third key, the third key being acquired via a secure channel and communicating the content encrypted using the third key to a source of the third key, wherein the content encrypted using the third key is decrypted using a local copy of the third key.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an alternate embodiment of the present invention, an apparatus for the secure distribution of content includes a secure processing module for encrypting and decrypting the content and a smart card for locally storing and decrypting encryption keys.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention advantageously provides a method, apparatus and system for securely communicating content such as audiovisual content in, for example, a home network environment. Although the present invention will be described primarily within the context of audiovisual content in a home network environment including a software player, the specific embodiments of the present invention should not be treated as limiting the scope of the invention. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art and informed by the teachings of the present invention that the concepts of the present invention can be advantageously applied in substantially any network for the secure transfer of any content (e.g., video, audio, audiovisual, etc.) to be played on substantially any content player.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a high level block diagram of a system for adding security encryption to content such as audiovisual content in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustratively comprises an audiovisual content transmission device (illustratively a satellite dish) <b>110</b>, a Set-top Box <b>120</b>, an Electronic Counter-measure device <b>125</b> and a content and key storage device <b>130</b>. In the system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the Set-top Box <b>120</b> includes a smart card <b>140</b> and a secure processing and storage module <b>150</b>. In the system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the module <b>150</b> of the Set-top Box has a secure communications link to the smart card <b>140</b>. In addition, the smart card <b>140</b> has secure processing and storage capabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an electronic counter-measure (ECM) message from the ECM device <b>125</b> is communicated to the STB <b>120</b> along with the audiovisual content. The ECM message contains, among other things, an encryption key or work key, k<sub>w</sub>. To prevent interception, the work key, k<sub>w</sub>, is encrypted with a key to be used by the smart card <b>140</b>. The key is denoted herein as the smart card key, k<sub>sc </sub>and the encrypted work key as k<sub>sc</sub>(k<sub>w</sub>). The smart card key is stored safely on the smart card <b>140</b> and cannot be recovered by someone attempting to intercept or copy the audiovisual content. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the smart card key is a key to a symmetric key cipher. The encryption of the ECM message is not essential to the understanding of the embodiments of the invention presented herein and, as such, will not be described in detail herein. In one embodiment of the present invention, the encryption of the ECM message can be a public key cipher, however any known encryption methods can be applied.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As previously described, the ECM message is stored along with the encrypted audiovisual content in for example the content and key storage device <b>130</b>. Upon playback of the audiovisual content, the ECM is recalled from storage <b>150</b> and the encrypted work key is communicated to the smart card <b>140</b>. The smart card <b>140</b> uses a local copy of k<sub>sc </sub>to decrypt and return k<sub>w </sub>to the secure processing module <b>150</b> of the STB <b>120</b>. As such, the STB <b>120</b> obtains the necessary key to decrypt the stored audiovisual content. Such decryption can be accomplished in the secure processing module <b>150</b>. Although in the embodiment of the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the audiovisual content and ECM is depicted as being communicated to a single STB <b>120</b>, in alternate embodiments of the present invention, the audiovisual content and ECM can be broadcast to more than one Set-top box or other receiving device for encryption and processing as described above. For example, each broadcast audiovisual content can be encrypted using a symmetric key cipher. As previously recited, the encryption key or audiovisual work key is herein denoted as k<sub>w </sub>and the encrypted audiovisual content as k<sub>w</sub>(w). The encrypted audiovisual content is received by each STB and stored for later use.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a high level block diagram of a set-top box <b>120</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and a software player for receiving and playing the encrypted audiovisual content of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the software player illustratively comprises a personal computer (PC) <b>210</b>. In content distribution systems, it is desirable to allow stored content, such as the audiovisual content stored in the STB <b>120</b> and/or the content and key storage device <b>130</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as described above, to be transferred to a personal computer for display. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the software player <b>210</b> is provided with a unique private/public key pair and the public key of the STB <b>120</b>. The software player <b>210</b> encrypts its own public key with the STB public key and communicates this information to the STB. The STB can decrypt this message with its private key. As such, the two devices know each others public key and they can establish a secure communication channel. Through this channel they create and exchange a session key and then terminate the secure channel. The session key will be used to securely transfer the content from the STB to the software player.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">More specifically, in one embodiment of the present invention, stored audiovisual content is communicated directly from STB storage to the PC <b>210</b>. As such, the key, k<sub>w</sub>, needs to be communicated to the PC <b>210</b> along with the audiovisual content. In the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the PC <b>210</b> is considered an unsecured platform and poses a risk to the security of the key, k<sub>w</sub>, which before to the communication to the PC <b>210</b> was very secure.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">To maintain the security of k<sub>w</sub>, a link encryption is implemented. More specifically, the PC <b>210</b> and the STB <b>120</b> use a public key cipher to establish a secure communications channel, (e.g., a TLS). Public key ciphers, however, are computationally expensive and thus are not often used for large data payloads. Instead, this TLS channel is used to establish and exchange a session key, k<sub>s</sub>, for a symmetric key cipher. The STB will then decrypt the audiovisual content using the work key, k<sub>w</sub>, and then immediately encrypt it using the session key, k<sub>s</sub>. This re-encrypted audiovisual content can then be securely communicated through an unsecured channel, for example a home network, to the PC <b>210</b> and decrypted there for display.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts a high level block diagram of an audiovisual content distribution system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The audiovisual content distribution system <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustratively includes a content and key storage device <b>130</b> and a Set-top Box (STB) <b>120</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and a software player <b>210</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, once a session key, k<sub>s</sub>, has been established, the secure processing device <b>150</b> in the STB <b>120</b> is used to decrypt the work and re-encrypt it using the symmetric cipher session key, k<sub>s</sub>. The encrypted content can then be communicated to the PC <b>210</b> on an unsecured channel, such as a home network. The player can decrypt the content with its copy of the session key, k<sub>s</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In order to use a public key cipher, the STB <b>120</b> and the software running on the PC <b>210</b> must each have a public/private key pair. In one embodiment of the present invention, the private key of the STB <b>120</b>, k<sub>stb</sub><sup>pv</sup>, is embedded in the secure processing module <b>150</b> during manufacture and the public key, k<sub>sb</sub><sup>pu</sup>, is stored in a secure database for subsequent distribution. The software player <b>210</b> can comprise a proprietary player distributed by a STB owner/operator to its customers upon request. Each copy of the software player <b>210</b> will contain a unique private/public key pair, (k<sub>pc</sub><sup>pv</sup>,k<sub>pc</sub><sup>pu</sup>). A customer request for audiovisual content will include the unique identification of an STB from which the connection is requested. The public key of that STB will be embedded into a respective software player ensuring that the software player can only work with that STB. This also gives an STB operator a record of which STBs have been enabled to communicate with which PCs.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As such and in accordance with the present invention, the STB <b>120</b> has a private key and the software player <b>210</b> will have the corresponding public key as well as its own private/public key pair. The software player <b>210</b> initiates a connection with the STB <b>120</b> over an unsecured channel, for example a home network, and can communicate to the STB <b>120</b> information regarding its public key. In such a manner, the STB <b>120</b> and the software player <b>210</b> are able to establish a secure channel through which they can establish and exchange a symmetric cipher session key as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Many protocols for establishing a secure channel require that all communication devices have signed digital certificates from a trusted source. Given the proprietary nature of the proposed architecture, these certificates can be generated by, for example, the STB operator (the trusted source) and provided to both the STB <b>120</b> and the software player <b>210</b>. This ensures that the STB <b>120</b> will only establish a secure link with an STB-operator authorized software player. The concepts of the present invention as described above will assist in protecting distributed audiovisual content from being pirated. In various embodiments of the present invention, advanced software security techniques are implemented to protect the software private key and derived session key from being discovered. Unfortunately however, knowledgeable pirates most likely will be successful in discovering these keys. Once discovered, the session key can be used to decrypt the audiovisual content. However, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, different audiovisual content will be encrypted with a different session key. As such, while a discovered key is valuable for decrypting corresponding protected audiovisual content on a corresponding STB, the discovered key will not be valuable to anyone else having a different STB nor would it be useful for decrypting other distributed audiovisual content. To do so, another session key would need to be discovered.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Even further, a software private key can be discovered and used to observe a TLS session, thus learning each session key as the session is established. For example, there can be two groups of individuals who might pursue such unauthorized copying: customers who which to make copies for themselves and their friends and professional thieves. One difference between these two groups is that the misbehaving customers obtain primary value from the content delivery service and only secondary value from the copying. Professional thieves take advantage of the content delivery service for the purpose of generating pirate content.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Digital watermarking is a technique for modifying digital imagery in order to attach certain identifiable metadata to audiovisual content. The metadata is recoverable from a copy of the watermarked content, even if that content has been re-compressed or has been converted to analog format. The digital watermark in content is also intended to survive the decryption, decoding, and digital-to-analog conversion of content that can be performed in a single secure silicon chip so that the only capturable, clear text content is analog. Such a process is commonly referred to as the &#x201c;Analog Hole&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In various embodiments of the present invention, watermarking can be optionally applied to audiovisual content secured in accordance with the present invention. For example, in a first approach, received audiovisual content is not directly stored in a Set-top Box (STB). Instead, the content is decrypted, watermarked, and re-encrypted prior to storage. The watermark contains information that uniquely identifies the STB and the associated smart card and includes a timestamp indicating a receiving and recording time.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts a high level block diagram of an audiovisual content distribution and watermarking system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The system <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustratively includes a content transmission device (illustratively a satellite dish) <b>110</b>, a content and key storage device <b>130</b> and a Set-top Box (STB) <b>120</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. However, in the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the STB <b>120</b> further comprises a watermarking module <b>175</b> for applying a watermark to the content received from the content transmission device <b>110</b> prior to storage in the content and key storage device <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the system <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, if the security of the STB <b>120</b> is compromised and the content is successfully obtained from the STB <b>120</b> and is successfully pirated, the watermark applied by the watermarking module <b>175</b> will identify the offending STB/customer. The watermarking of the present invention, however, introduces an additional decryption/encryption cycle to the process and this, along with the watermarking, can become computationally expensive for real-time processing in the STB.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As such, in an alternate embodiment of the present invention, the content is not watermarked during storage, but instead, watermarked as they are transferred to the software player. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts a high level block diagram of a system for receiving and playing encrypted audiovisual content including an alternate watermarking means in accordance with an alternate embodiment of the present invention. The system <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustratively includes a content and key storage device <b>130</b> and a Set-top Box (STB) <b>120</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and a software player <b>210</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Similar to the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, received content is stored directly in its encrypted form. Upon request, the content is decrypted and re-encrypted with the session key as before, however in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a watermark is added by the watermarking module <b>175</b> to the content. As previously described, the watermark can include a time stamp identifying at least the time of download and, if available from the STB storage, the time of initial storage as is the case in the first watermarking approach. In addition, a unique ID of the software player <b>210</b> is now known at the time of watermarking (i.e., because of the digital signature), and as such, information identifying the particular software player <b>210</b> can be included in the watermark information.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one embodiment of the present invention, the watermark is added directly into an MPEG-2 bitstream. The marking process can be real-time for the first watermarking embodiment described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and can be faster than real-time for the second watermarking embodiment described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In one embodiment, the watermarking process does not introduce any visible or audible artifacts that would tip off a user of its existence. In addition, the watermark data can be recoverable after resizing to a smaller size, transcoding, and a number of other standard television picture processes including de-interlacing, noise reduction, color adjustment, etc. A watermark detector (not shown) does not have any information included in the embedding process. That is, an embedder (not shown) and detector can share a secret, but the detector will not know, apriori, which embedder was used. Detection is a forensic operation and can be slower than real-time.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Both above described watermarking approaches embed customer identifying information into content that are intended to be viewed and not distributed. If a user obtains piracy software that discovers software player keys and if that user uses that piracy software to make unauthorized copies of works stored on the STB, those copies will contain watermarks with identifying information to identify the location of origin of the pirated content. If any of those copies are distributed (i.e., on a P2P network or on a web site for example), each and every unauthorized copy will contain the necessary forensic information (e.g., watermark and identification information) to identify the original intended recipient of that content. After such discovery, an STB operator can take any remedial action deemed appropriate including but not limited to sending a warning letter, to cancellation of service, to the pursuit of legal remedies and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In accordance with various embodiments of the present invention, an STB includes a private/public key pair. The private key is embedded in the STB and the public key is stored in a secure database by the STB operator. The STB can also include a digital certificate supplied by the STB operator. Subsequently, a customer can contact the STB operator and requests a software player for viewing desired content. The request is accompanied by an STB identifier (this request could be facilitated through the STB). The STB operator recovers the STB public key from the database, creates a digital certificate for the software player, and communicates such information to the customer. Additionally, and as described above, the software player has its own private/public key pair.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As described above, in a first approach, content to be stored locally at the STB is first decrypted, watermarked, and then re-encrypted. The software player initiates a session with the STB and provides its public key. The software player and the STB negotiate a secure channel using their digital certificates, and establish a session key. In the first approach, stored watermarked content is decrypted on the STB and re-encrypted with the session key before being transferred to the software player.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the second approach, stored content is decrypted on the STB, watermarked, and then re-encrypted with the session key before being communicated to the software player. The software player decrypts the content with the session key and plays the content.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Having described various embodiments for a method, apparatus and system for the secure distribution of content (which are intended to be illustrative and not limiting), it is noted that modifications and variations can be made by persons skilled in the art in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that changes may be made in the particular embodiments of the invention disclosed which are within the scope and spirit of the invention as outlined by the appended claims. While the forgoing is directed to various embodiments of the present invention, other and further embodiments of the invention may be devised without departing from the basic scope thereof.</p>
