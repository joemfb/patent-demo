<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a U.S. divisional application of U.S. Ser. No. 11/492,117 filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office on Jul. 25, 2006, now abandoned which claims earlier priority benefit to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2005-0078861 filed with the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Aug. 26, 2005, the disclosures of both of which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an image display device, and more particularly to an image display device capable of supporting brightness enhancement and power control and a method thereof, which can enhance the brightness and contrast of an image and control the power of a light source in accordance with the image characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Information that is provided to a user through an image display device includes various kinds of multimedia contents as well as simple text information. Examples of the multimedia contents include still images, moving images, sound, and others. Among these multimedia contents, moving images are widely used in video on demand (VOD) services or interactive services. As such, researches on the standards for moving images are being actively carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">With the developments in the digital electronic engineering and technology, it is now common for analog data to be digitalized. Accordingly, various digital image processing technologies have been developed to efficiently process large amounts of digital data. The digital image processing technologies have the following advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Generally, unwanted noise which often occurs when analog signals are processed by analog image devices, causing eventual degradation in the processed analog signals, can be prevented in the digital image processing devices.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, since digital signals can be processed by a computer, it is possible to perform various kinds of image processing such as image data compression.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">At present, most of the digital image display devices such as liquid crystal displays (LCD), plasma display panels (PDP), and organic light-emitting diodes (OLED) adopt an RGB color model.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The color model (or color space) is used to obtain the correlation between any one color and other colors. Different image processing systems use different color models for their respective different reasons. The RGB color model is composed of the three primary colors of red (R), green (G), and blue (B). Spectral components of these colors are added to one another to form additional colors.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The RGB model has a three-dimensional cube having three axes that represent red, green and blue, respectively. The origin of the axes is expressed by black, and the opposite end of the cube is expressed by white. For example, in a 24-bit color graphic system having 8 bits per color channel, red is expressed as (255,0,0).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The RGB model allows a simple design of a computer graphic system. However, the RGB model is not ideal for all applications. This is because the correlation between color components red, green and blue is considerably high. Image processing technologies such as a histogram equalization process images using only brightness. Thus, it is necessary to frequently convert the RGB images into brightness images. To convert the images from RGB colors into brightness level, a value obtained by multiplying each component by &#x2153;, i.e., an average value is used. Alternatively, Equation (1) may be used in accordance with the National Television Systems Committee (NTSC) Standard.

</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. The aspects and features of the present invention and methods for achieving the aspects and features will be apparent by referring to the embodiments to be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. However, the present invention is not limited to the embodiments disclosed hereinafter, but will be implemented in diverse forms. The matters defined in the description, such as the detailed construction and elements, are nothing but specific details provided to assist those of ordinary skill in the art in a comprehensive understanding of the invention, and the present invention is only defined within the scope of appended claims. In the whole description of the present invention, the same drawing reference numerals are used for the same elements across various figures.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating the construction of an image display device <b>100</b> according to the present invention. The image display device <b>100</b> includes an image input unit <b>110</b>, a histogram analyzer <b>120</b>, a model selector <b>130</b>, a pixel controller <b>140</b>, a power controller <b>150</b>, a light source unit <b>160</b>, and an image output unit <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The image input unit <b>110</b> receives an input image, such as a still image or moving image, from a predetermined image source, and outputs sub-pixels constituting the input image, i.e., R, G, and B components. The input image may be an RGB type signal. Alternatively, the input image may be of another signal format such as YCbCr. If the input image is of a signal format including a gray scale signal Y, the image input unit <b>110</b> may include a gray image generator <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The gray image generator <b>115</b> generates a gray scale image from R, G, and B signals output from the image input unit <b>110</b>. There may be various methods of generating the gray scale signal Y from each of the R, G, and B signals. The gray scale signal Y may be generated using either a value obtained by multiplying each component by &#x2153; or an equation under the NTSC standard, such as Equation (1).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The histogram analyzer <b>120</b> prepares histogram from the gray scale signal Y for one image and calculates a parameter representative of the histogram.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an example of the histogram for an image. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a horizontal axis of the histogram represents a gray scale pixel value (brightness value), for example, a value in the range of 0 to 255 of 8-bit image. And, a vertical axis of the histogram represents frequency generated for each pixel value. The horizontal axis is divided into a low band, a middle band, and a high band. For example, the boundary L between the low band and the middle band means a brightness value corresponding to 30% of a lower rank of the histogram while the boundary H between the middle band and the high band means a pixel value corresponding to 30% of a higher rank of the histogram.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Examples of the parameter representative of the histogram include HighSUM, LowSUM, and Mean. HighSUM means the number of total pixels at the high band while LowSUM means the number of total pixels at the low band. Mean means an average of a pixel value for the total images.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> again, the histogram analyzer <b>120</b> calculates the parameters based on the histogram and provides the calculated result to the model selector <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The model selector <b>130</b> analyzes the parameters to select a corresponding model of the input image among representative models, and provides a brightness controlling function F(x) corresponding to the selected model to the pixel controller.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an example of the input image divided into four representative models. The models are divided into four based on the histogram of gray image. The number of the models and the type of the models may be subdivided or simplified. An example of an algorithm for determining a model of the input image among the models shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">First, a gray image is inputted S<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">If the input image belongs to a model A S<b>5</b>, HighSUM belongs to a range within a threshold ratio TH (for example, 25%) for the number of total pixels, and LowSUM belongs to the range within the threshold ratio TH. If Mean is in a middle value range of a brightness range of the total image, the input image belongs to the model A (Yes of S<b>2</b>). The pixel range means the number of gray levels that can be displayed by one pixel. For example, the pixel range may be 256 in the case of an 8-bit image.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Next, if the input image belongs to a model B S<b>6</b>, HighSUM exceeds the threshold ratio TH, and LowSUM belongs to the range within the threshold ratio TH, If Mean is in a pixel range of 0.45 to 0.55, the input image belongs to the model B (No of S<b>3</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">If the input image belongs to a model C S<b>7</b>, HighSUM belongs to the range within the threshold ratio TH, and LowSUM exceeds the threshold ratio TH. If Mean is in the pixel range of 0.45 to 0.55, the input image belongs to the model C (Yes of S<b>4</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A model D represents an image having a large number of pixel values corresponding to the high band and the low band. If the input image belongs to the model D S<b>8</b>, HighSUM and LowSUM exceed the threshold ratio TH, and a value obtained by adding HighSUM to LowSUM does not reach 125% (No of S<b>4</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The algorithm for determining the model of the input image has been described according to an embodiment of the present invention, but is not limited thereto. It will be understood that other models of the input image may be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In case where gain of uniform size applies to all pixel values to increase brightness of the input image, it is difficult to expect good quality of the output image. This is because that good image may be obtained by increasing brightness only or by appropriately controlling brightness and contrast to be suitable for image characteristics in view of visual characteristics. Hereinafter, brightness of the image means an average of brightness values of pixels constituting the image.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a graph illustrating brightness controlling functions selected to be suitable for characteristics of four type images. It is noted that four functions have &#x201c;S&#x201d;-shaped curve but their detailed formats are different from one another. The brightness controlling functions represent patterns suitable for increasing brightness for each model, and indicate how much each pixel of the input image should be increased. The horizontal axis (independent parameters) of the brightness controlling functions represents pixel values (marked as 0 to 63 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> supposing that a 6-bit pixel value exists) while the vertical axis (dependent parameters) of the brightness controlling functions represents a brightness increase ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">To obtain a brightness controlling function for a specific model, experimental operations are required. In other words, after various types of brightness controlling functions expected to be suitable for the specific model are provided, each brightness controlling function is applied to the specific model (brightness of each pixel is increased as much as a value corresponding to the function). Then, the most natural image is selected by a plurality of observers. Thus, the brightness controlling function representative of the selected image is matched with the specific model.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">If the above experimental operations are carried out for other models, the brightness controlling functions matching the respective models can be obtained as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> again, the model selector <b>130</b> provides the brightness controlling function F(x) matched with the selected model for the input image to the pixel controller <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The pixel controller <b>140</b> selects a representative signal among the RGB signals. The representative signal means a signal having the greatest size (the greatest pixel value) among the RGB signals. Therefore, the representative signal Y can be expressed as Equation (2).

</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The representative signal is substituted for F(x) provided from the model selector <b>130</b> and then is multiplied by a predetermined gain K to determine a brightness ratio F(Y<sub>in</sub>)*K to be increased by the pixel controller <b>140</b>. The pixel controller <b>140</b> adds the representative signal to the determined brightness ratio to calculate an output signal Y<sub>out </sub>of the representative signal Y<sub>in </sub>as Equation (3). The gain K can be selected appropriately within the range of 0 to 2.

</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The pixel controller <b>140</b> controls the respective RGB input signals R, G, B to increase them as much as the increase ratio C determined by Equation (4). In this way, RGB output signals R&#x2032;, G&#x2032;, B&#x2032; can be expressed as Equation (5).

</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The signal having the greatest pixel value among the RGB signals is selected as the representative signal Y<sub>in </sub>so as not to prevent the maximum range among the RGB components from being exceeded due to increase of the pixel value. The same increase ratio C for the respective RGB components is used so as not to generate color distortion.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">If an input color space is not an RGB color space, C of Equation (4) can be controlled in its size so as not to generate color distortion in a corresponding input color space. C can be applied to each color signal in the same manner as Equation (5).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring to the RGB color space of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, if brightness of P<sub>0 </sub>is increased (P<sub>1</sub>) in a direction not matched with a vector direction toward P<sub>0 </sub>from the origin, brightness is enhanced but color distortion occurs between P<sub>0 </sub>and P<sub>1</sub>. However, if brightness of P<sub>0 </sub>is increased (P<sub>2</sub>) in a direction matched with a vector direction toward P<sub>0 </sub>from the origin by multiplying each RGB component by the increase ratio C, brightness is enhanced so as not to generate color distortion.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The image output unit <b>170</b> generates a physical image from the signals R&#x2032;, G&#x2032;, B&#x2032; output from the pixel controller <b>140</b> and displays the physical image for a user. The image output unit <b>170</b> can be implemented by various display means such as LCD, PDP, LED, OLED, and flexible display.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Brightness or contrast of the image can be enhanced to be suitable for characteristics of the input image through the aforementioned operations. Meanwhile, for power control corresponding to another aspect of the present invention, the image display device <b>100</b> may further include the power controller <b>150</b>. The power controller <b>150</b> is to reduce power consumption caused by a light source of a device having a limited power supply, such as a cellular phone. If the light source is controlled to be dark in proportional to enhanced brightness, it is possible to reduce power consumption while maintaining the same image in view of the user. The operation for power control will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The pixel controller <b>140</b> outputs the controlled signals R&#x2032;, G&#x2032;, B&#x2032; and at the same time calculates brightness and contrast values Y<sub>mean </sub>and C<sub>mean </sub>of the input image from the RGB signals of the image input unit <b>110</b> and calculates brightness and contrast values Y<sub>mean</sub>&#x2032; and C<sub>mean</sub>&#x2032; of the output image are from the gain-controlled RGB signals to provide Y<sub>mean</sub>, Y<sub>mean</sub>&#x2032;, C<sub>mean</sub>, and C<sub>mean</sub>&#x2032; to the power controller <b>150</b>. The brightness values mean an average of the gray scale pixel values within one image. The gray scale pixel values can be defined as the value obtained by multiplying each component of R, G, B by &#x2153; or the NTSC standard value such as Equation (1). The power controller <b>150</b> calculates a power decrease ratio &#x394;P using the brightness and contrast values Y<sub>mean </sub>and C<sub>mean </sub>of the input image and the brightness and contrast values Y<sub>mean</sub>&#x2032; and C<sub>mean</sub>&#x2032; of the output image. The power controller <b>150</b> provides the power decrease ratio &#x394;P to the light source unit <b>160</b>. To this end, the power controller <b>150</b> needs to identify the correlation (gamma characteristics of the device) between brightness of the image, i.e., the gray scale pixel values and an output luminance value having characteristics dependent upon a display means. Also, the power controller <b>150</b> needs to identify the correlation (power characteristics of the device) between the power consumed by the light source unit <b>160</b> and the output luminance value.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Since the gamma characteristics of the device and its power characteristics depend upon the device, they can be determined by experiments.</p>

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the horizontal axis means a gray scale pixel value Y, and the vertical axis means a size of luminance L (cd/m<sup>2</sup>).

Generally, a slope of the gamma characteristic function tends to increase as Y increases.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Meanwhile, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the horizontal axis means intensity P (mW) of the power, and the vertical axis means a size of luminance.
