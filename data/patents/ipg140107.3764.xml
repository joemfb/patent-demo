<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority from Japanese application JP 2010-191720 filed on Aug. 30, 2010, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this application.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a display device including two pixel electrodes forming two pixels in a region surrounded by two video signal lines and two scanning signal lines.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, there has been a problem that it becomes more difficult to downsize a display device as the number of video signal lines increases. In light of the problem, a display device capable of driving each pixel by using a small number of video signal lines has been proposed (see, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2000-35589). The display device described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2000-35589 includes two pixel electrodes forming two pixels in a region surrounded by two video signal lines and two scanning signal lines.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">By the way, a parasitic capacitance Cds exists between the video signal line and the pixel electrode, and the potential of the pixel electrode is affected by the potential of the video signal line via the parasitic capacitance Cds. The potential of the pixel electrode is more affected by the potential of the video signal line as the parasitic capacitance Cds has a larger value. The value of the parasitic capacitance Cds becomes larger as the distance between the pixel electrode and the video signal line is smaller. Accordingly, as the distance between the pixel electrode and the video signal line becomes smaller, the potential of the pixel electrode is more affected by the potential of the video signal line. Countermeasures are therefore taken to prevent the potential of the video signal line from affecting the potential of the pixel electrode, such as providing a distance between the pixel electrode and the video signal line.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The display device of Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2000-35589, however, has the following problem. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, if two pixel electrodes Px<b>1</b> and Px<b>2</b> respectively forming two pixels D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> are displaced in the X-direction with respect to video signal lines DL due to displacement occurring during patterning, the two pixel electrodes Px<b>1</b> and Px<b>2</b> have different distances from an adjacent video signal line DL (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>) and are therefore affected by the potential of the video signal line DL to different degrees. Consequently, fluctuations in brightness of pixels occur. Here, the thickness of the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</figref> and <b>6</b>B represents the degrees to which the potentials of the pixel electrodes Px<b>1</b> and Px<b>2</b> are affected by the potential of the video signal line DL, and a thicker arrow indicates that the potential is affected to a higher degree.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention has been made in view of the above-mentioned circumstances, and it is an object thereof to provide a display device capable of reducing fluctuations in brightness of pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to solve the above-mentioned problem and achieve the object, a display device according to the present invention includes: two pixel electrodes respectively forming two pixels in a region surrounded by two video signal lines and two scanning signal lines; a first dummy wiring, which is connected to one video signal line of the two video signal lines; and a second dummy wiring, which is connected to a different one of the two video signal lines from the one video signal line to which the first dummy wiring is connected, in which the first dummy wiring and the second dummy wiring each extend along a contour of the region to a position between the two pixel electrodes, and further extend to a position at which respective end portions are closely opposed to each other between the two pixel electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, in the above-mentioned display device according to the present invention, the first dummy wiring and the second dummy wiring may each extend to a substantially central position of the two pixel electrodes in an extending direction of the two video signal lines.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, in the above-mentioned display device according to the present invention, the first dummy wiring and the second dummy wiring may be formed so that the end portion of the first dummy wiring and the end portion of the second dummy wiring are overlapped with each other in a direction of rubbing treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, in the above-mentioned display device according to the present invention: the end portion of the first dummy wiring and the end portion of the second dummy wiring may be formed to be inclined at the same inclination angle; and the first dummy wiring and the second dummy wiring may be arranged so that inclined portions of the end portions are opposed to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further, in the above-mentioned display device according to the present invention, the first dummy wiring and the second dummy wiring may each have the same width as a width of each of the two video signal lines.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the display device of the present invention, when the pixel electrodes are displaced with respect to the video signal lines and the pixel electrodes are positioned away from an adjacent video signal line, the pixel electrodes are positioned closer to the first dummy wiring and the second dummy wiring, and when the pixel electrodes are positioned closer to the adjacent video signal line, the pixel electrodes are positioned away from the first dummy wiring and the second dummy wiring. Therefore, the degrees to which the potentials of the pixel electrodes are affected by the potentials of the video signal lines DL can be averaged, with the result that the fluctuations in brightness of pixels can be reduced.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a configuration of a liquid crystal display device <b>1</b> according to the embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram illustrating a detailed configuration of a liquid crystal display panel <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view taken along the line F<b>1</b>-F<b>2</b> of the liquid crystal display panel <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the liquid crystal display panel <b>10</b> includes a plurality of video signal lines DL (DL<sub>1</sub>, . . . , DLi, . . . , DLn: where i and n are natural numbers) extending in the Y-direction and a plurality of scanning signal lines GL (GL<sub>1</sub>, . . . , GLj, . . . , GLm: where j and m are natural numbers) extending in the X-direction. Further, in the liquid crystal display panel <b>10</b>, the plurality of scanning signal lines GL are formed and arranged in parallel to each other, whereas the plurality of video signal lines DL are formed in zigzag. In other words, pixels D (a pixel D<b>1</b> and a pixel D<b>2</b>) are disposed in delta arrangement. In the liquid crystal display panel <b>10</b>, two adjacent pixels D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> arranged in an extending direction of the scanning signal lines GL (X-direction) are paired, and the video signal line DL is disposed for each of the pairs of pixels D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b>. The liquid crystal display panel <b>10</b> employs a double scanning line type, in which two scanning signal lines GL are disposed between two pixels adjacent in an extending direction of the video signal lines DL (Y-direction).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The data driver <b>11</b> generates an image signal (gray-scale voltage) to be input to each of the plurality of video signal lines DL.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The scanning driver <b>12</b> sequentially inputs scanning signals to the plurality of scanning signal lines GL. The data driver <b>11</b> and the scanning driver <b>12</b> are electrically connected to the liquid crystal display panel <b>10</b> via flexible boards or the like (not shown) which are connected to a peripheral portion of the liquid crystal display panel <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The backlight unit <b>13</b> is realized by light emitting diodes or the like, and irradiates the liquid crystal display panel <b>10</b> with light from the rear surface side.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The control portion <b>14</b> is realized by a CPU or the like, and is electrically connected to the respective portions of the liquid crystal display device <b>1</b> including the data driver <b>11</b>, the scanning driver <b>12</b>, and the backlight unit <b>13</b>, to thereby control the entire operation of the liquid crystal display device <b>1</b>. Further, the control portion <b>14</b> includes a memory (not shown) or the like for temporarily holding image data input from an external system.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Now, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the liquid crystal display panel <b>10</b> is described in detail. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the liquid crystal display panel <b>10</b> has a liquid crystal material <b>40</b> sealed between a TFT substrate <b>20</b> and a counter substrate <b>30</b>. In the TFT substrate <b>20</b>, the scanning signal lines GL are provided on an insulating substrate SUB<b>1</b> such as a glass substrate. The scanning signal lines GL are formed by, for example, subjecting a conductive film such as aluminum to etching.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Above the scanning signal line GL, a semiconductor layer SC, the video signal line DL (drain electrode SD<b>1</b>), a source electrode SD<b>2</b>, and dummy wirings L (dummy wirings L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b>) are provided through the intermediation of a first insulating layer PAS<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The semiconductor layer SC is shaped by, for example, subjecting an amorphous silicon film to etching and then implanting impurities in a drain region and a source region. The drain electrode SD<b>1</b> is electrically connected to the video signal line DL, and is formed by, for example, branching a part of the video signal line DL. The drain electrode SD<b>1</b> having a U-shape in plan view as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is exemplified, but the shape is not limited thereto and, for example, a linear shape may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Above the video signal line DL, a pixel electrode Px is provided through the intermediation of a second insulating layer PAS<b>2</b>. The pixel electrode Px is formed by etching a high light transmission rate conductive film, such as ITO, and is connected to the source electrode SD<b>2</b> via a through-hole TH. Further, the pixel electrode Px is formed into a flat shape in a region overlapping a counter electrode CT in plan view. Above the pixel electrode Px, the counter electrode CT is provided through the intermediation of a third insulating layer PAS<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The counter electrode CT is formed by etching a high light transmission rate conductive film, such as ITO. The counter electrode CT is formed into a comb shape having a plurality of slits SL in a region overlapping the pixel electrode Px in plan view. An orientation film ORI<b>1</b> is provided over the counter electrode CT.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the counter substrate <b>30</b>, a light shielding film BM called black matrix and a color filter CF are provided on the surface of an insulating substrate SUB<b>2</b> such as a glass substrate. The light shielding film BM is formed by, for example, subjecting a conductive film or an insulating film having a light transmission rate of almost zero to etching to be patterned into such a grid that separates the respective pixels D. The color filter CF is formed by, for example, forming an insulating film by etching or exposure/development and forming a filter serving as red (R) display, a filter serving as green (G) display, and a filter serving as blue (B) display in an opening region of the light shielding film in a periodic array. Further, above the light shielding film BM and the color filter CF, for example, an orientation film ORI<b>2</b> is provided through the intermediation of an overcoat layer OC.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Here, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the liquid crystal display panel <b>10</b> includes two pixel electrodes Px<b>1</b> and Px<b>2</b> respectively forming two pixels D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> in a region A surrounded by two video signal lines DL<sub>i+1 </sub>and DL<sub>i+2 </sub>and two scanning signal lines GL<sub>j+1 </sub>and GL<sub>j+2</sub>. The liquid crystal display panel <b>10</b> further includes the dummy wirings L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The dummy wiring L<b>1</b> is connected, as a first dummy wiring, to one video signal line DL<sub>i+1 </sub>of the two video signal lines DL<sub>i+1 </sub>and DL<sub>i+2</sub>. The dummy wiring L<b>2</b> is connected, as a second dummy wiring, to a different one of the two video signal lines DL<sub>i+1 </sub>and DL<sub>i+2 </sub>from the video signal line to which the dummy wiring L<b>1</b> is connected, that is, to the video signal line DL<sub>i+2</sub>. The dummy wirings L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> each extend along the contour of the region A (along the scanning signal lines GL) to a position between the two pixel electrodes Px<b>1</b> and Px<b>2</b>, and further extend to a position at which respective end portions E<b>1</b> and E<b>2</b> are closely opposed to each other between the two pixel electrodes Px<b>1</b> and Px<b>2</b>. The dummy wirings L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> each bend from a portion thereof extending in the X-direction along the contour of the region A and extend between the two pixel electrodes Px<b>1</b> and Px<b>2</b> so that the end portions E<b>1</b> and E<b>2</b> are opposed to each other. The end portions E<b>1</b> and E<b>2</b> are each shaped to be cut perpendicularly to an extending direction of the dummy wirings L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b>. Further, the dummy wirings L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> each extend to a substantially central position in the Y-direction of the two pixel electrodes Px<b>1</b> and Px<b>2</b> between the two pixel electrodes Px<b>1</b> and Px<b>2</b>, that is, a substantially central position of the two pixel electrodes Px<b>1</b> and Px<b>2</b> in the extending direction of the video signal line DL. Still further, the dummy wirings L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> each have substantially the same width as that of the video signal line DL.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">With the dummy wirings L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> provided in this way, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, even if the pixels D are displaced in the X-direction with respect to the video signal lines DL due to displacement when patterning is performed, the pixel electrodes Px<b>1</b> and Px<b>2</b> are positioned closer to the dummy wiring L<b>1</b> and the dummy wiring L<b>2</b> when the pixel electrodes Px<b>1</b> and Px<b>2</b> are positioned away from an adjacent video signal line DL, while the pixel electrodes Px<b>1</b> and Px<b>2</b> are positioned away from the dummy wiring L<b>1</b> and the dummy wiring L<b>2</b> when the pixel electrodes Px<b>1</b> and Px<b>2</b> are positioned closer to the adjacent video signal line DL. Therefore, the degrees to which the potentials of the video signal lines DL and the dummy wirings L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> affect the potentials of the pixel electrodes Px<b>1</b> and Px<b>2</b> are averaged. In other words, by providing the dummy wirings L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b>, the degrees to which the potentials of the video signal lines DL affect the potentials of the pixel electrodes Px<b>1</b> and Px<b>2</b> are averaged.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In this embodiment, in the liquid crystal display device <b>1</b>, when the pixel electrodes Px<b>1</b> and Px<b>2</b> are displaced with respect to the video signal lines DL and the pixel electrodes Px<b>1</b> and Px<b>2</b> are positioned away from an adjacent video signal line DL, the pixel electrodes Px<b>1</b> and Px<b>2</b> are positioned closer to the dummy wiring L<b>1</b> and the dummy wiring L<b>2</b>, and when the pixel electrodes Px<b>1</b> and Px<b>2</b> are positioned closer to the adjacent video signal line DL, the pixel electrodes Px<b>1</b> and Px<b>2</b> are positioned away from the dummy wiring L<b>1</b> and the dummy wiring L<b>2</b>. Therefore, the degrees to which the potentials of the pixel electrodes Px<b>1</b> and Px<b>2</b> are affected by the potentials of the video signal lines DL can be averaged, with the result that the fluctuations in brightness of the pixels D can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Further, in the embodiment of the present invention, the dummy wirings L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> each extend to a substantially central position of the two pixel electrodes Px<b>1</b> and Px<b>2</b> in the extending direction of the video signal lines DL, and hence even when adjacent video signal lines DL have different voltages, the degrees to which the potentials of the pixel electrodes Px are affected by the potentials of the video signal lines DL can be averaged.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Still further, in this embodiment, the dummy wirings L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> each have substantially the same width as that of the video signal line DL, and hence the pixel electrodes Px are affected by the potentials of the dummy wirings L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> equivalently to the potentials of the video signal lines DL. This way, the degrees to which the potentials of the pixel electrodes Px are affected by the potentials of the video signal lines DL can be further averaged.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Modified Example</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Next, a modified example of the above-mentioned embodiment is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> is a diagram illustrating the shape of the end portions of the dummy wirings according to the above-mentioned embodiment, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> is a diagram illustrating the modified example of the above-mentioned embodiment. The above-mentioned embodiment has exemplified the end portions of the dummy wirings L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b>, each of which is shaped to be cut perpendicularly to the extending direction of the dummy wirings L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>). In this modified example, however, the end portions of the dummy wirings L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> are formed to be inclined at the same inclination angle so that the tips of the end portions are sharpened. Then, an end portion E<b>3</b> of the dummy wiring L<b>1</b> and an end portion E<b>4</b> of the dummy wiring L<b>2</b> are overlapped with each other so that a cross section in the direction (X-direction) perpendicular to the extending direction of the dummy wirings L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> (Y-direction), which includes both the end portion E<b>3</b> and the end portion E<b>4</b>, is present (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">More specifically, the dummy wiring L<b>1</b> and the dummy wiring L<b>2</b> are arranged so that inclined portions of the end portions are opposed to each other, in which the dummy wiring L<b>1</b> extends farther beyond the position of the tip of the end portion E<b>4</b> of the dummy wiring L<b>2</b>, and the tip of the end portion E<b>3</b> is formed at a position closer to a portion of the dummy wiring L<b>2</b> which extends along the contour of the region A with respect to the tip of the end portion E<b>4</b>. Then, in this arrangement, the end portion E<b>3</b> of the dummy wiring L<b>1</b> and the end portion E<b>4</b> of the dummy wiring L<b>2</b> are overlapped with each other in the direction C of rubbing treatment carried out by a rubbing roller R. Specifically, both the end portion E<b>3</b> and the end portion E<b>4</b> are included in the cross-section at a predetermined position in the direction C of rubbing treatment, and the inclination angles of the end portions E<b>3</b> and E<b>4</b> are set so that the end portions E<b>3</b> and E<b>4</b> are inclined toward a direction of the rubbing roller R (direction perpendicular to the direction C of rubbing treatment) with reference to the direction (X-direction) perpendicular to the extending direction of the dummy wirings L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b>. In this case, the influence of a slit S, which is formed by providing the dummy wirings L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b>, can be reduced to a low level, with the result that light leakage B is comparable to that which is generated by a video signal line DL having no slit. Therefore, the state of the light leakage B can be made uniform to suppress the fluctuations in brightness consequently.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Note that, the above-mentioned embodiment and the modified example thereof have exemplified the dummy wirings L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> that have substantially the same width as that of the video signal line DL, but the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, the widths of the dummy wirings L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> may be smaller than the width of the video signal line DL.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Further, the above-mentioned embodiment and the modified example thereof have exemplified the liquid crystal display device <b>1</b> that employs the IPS mode, but the present invention is not limited thereto. In other words, the present invention is applicable to any display device that includes two pixel electrodes Px<b>1</b> and Px<b>2</b> respectively forming two pixels D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> in the region A surrounded by two video signal lines DL that are adjacent each other and two scanning signal lines GL that are adjacent each other. For example, the display device may be a liquid crystal display device of a vertical electric field type and may be an organic EL display device.</p>
