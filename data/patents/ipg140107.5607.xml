<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to authentication in a communications system, and more particularly, but not exclusively, to management of user security data.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A communication system can be seen as a facility that enables communication sessions between entities such as user equipment and/or other nodes associated with the communication system. The communication may comprise, for example, communication of voice, data, multimedia and so on. An user equipment connected to a communication system may, for example, be provided with a two-way telephone call or multi-way conference call or with a data connection. In addition voice call services, various other services, for example enhanced content services such as multimedia services or other data services, may be provided for a user. An user equipment may communicate data to and from a server entity, or between two or more user equipments.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A communication system typically operates in accordance with a given standard or specification, which sets out what the various entities associated with the system are permitted to do and how that should be achieved. Communication protocols, parameters, reference points and interfaces, which shall be used for a connection are typically defined by the standards or specifications.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Communication systems proving wireless communication for user equipment are known. These systems are commonly referred to as mobile systems, although in certain systems the mobility may be restricted to substantially small areas. An example of the mobile systems is the public land mobile network (PLMN). Another example is a mobile system that is based, at least partially, on use of communication satellites. Mobile communications may also be provided by means of other types of systems, such as by means of wireless local area networks (WLAN) or Wide Area Networks (WAN).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a wireless system an access node provides user equipment with access to the communication system. An user equipment may be in wireless communication with two or more access nodes at the same time. Communication on the wireless interface between the user equipment and the access node(s) can be based on an appropriate communication protocol. Examples of the various wireless access systems include the CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), WCDMA (Wide-band CDMA), TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access), FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access), or SDMA (Space Division Multiple Access), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 and further developments and hybrids thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The operation of the network apparatus is controlled by an appropriate control arrangement commonly including a number of various control entities. One or more gateways or intermediate servers may also be provided for connecting a network to other networks or hiding network internal details from external nodes. For example, a PLMN network may be connected to other mobile or fixed line communication networks or data communication networks such as an IP (Internet Protocol) and/or other packet data networks.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A user or the user equipment may need to be authenticated before he/she is allowed to access or otherwise use various applications and services. This may be required for security and privacy reasons, but also to enable correct billing of the service usage. For example, it may need to be verified that the user is whoever he/she claims to be, that the user has the right to use a certain service, that the user can be provided with an access to sensitive information and so on. In an authentication, a user can be identified based on various identifiers.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Various authentication mechanisms are already in place, or have been proposed. A non-limiting example is an authentication mechanism proposed by the third generation partnership project (3GPP) called the &#x2018;Generic Authentication Architecture&#x2019; (GAA). The GAA is indented to be used as a security procedure for various applications and services for users of mobile user equipment, such as mobile stations for cellular systems. The GAA is intended to be based on secret user identities that are stored on specific secure storage entities provided in association with the user equipment and subscriber databases. The secure storage entity of a user equipment may be provided by an appropriate security function, for example a security module, an identification module or a trusted platform. The subscriber database may be provided by an appropriate network entity, for example a Home Location Register (HLR) or Home Subscriber Server (HSS). Typically user data for each user is stored in a user profile. The secure user identity storage entities and the subscriber database entities have been controlled by the operators who issue the user identities and who typically run and own the subscriber databases.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, proposals for the authentication systems, such as the GAA, are based on subscriber databases that are under direct control of and manageable only by the operators. Operators are also assumed to have specific management arrangements of their own. User data, for example user security settings cannot be managed by other parties, for example service applications or other network application functions (NAFs) residing for example in trusted third party networks.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The management by other parties might, nevertheless, be desirable in certain occasions. For example, the burden to manage a subscriber database by non-standardized operator specific arrangements might become substantial, and an operator may not be prepared or even have the capability to take responsibility of the management. This situation can be exemplified with reference to application functions that also provide services such as those called Liberty Alliance Identity Provider services. A possibility to allow trusted third parties, for example partner operators, to update user security data in an operator database using for example GAA specific protocols might ease the maintenance burden of the operator for frequent management activities. Because of the unpredictability in the number and type of services and/or service provides the operators may not always have the resources to manage the subscriber databases in all occasions.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is noted that the problem is not limited to wireless systems, but may occur in any communication environment wherein the user may access services and applications by user equipment.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Embodiments of the present invention aim to address one or several of the above problems.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to one embodiment, there is provided a method for managing user data stored in a database of a communications system where the database is managed by a main controller. In the method a user is first authenticated, where after an application entity can manage user data in the database that associates with the user and an application by communicating data between the application entity and a second entity connected to the communications system.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to another embodiment, there is provided a node for a communications system where user data is stored in a database managed by a main controller. The node is configured to provide an application to an authenticated user. The node is further configured to manage user data associated with the authenticated user and the application in the database by communicating data to a second entity connected to the communications system.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to another embodiment, there is provided a security management entity for a communications system where user data is stored in a database managed by a main controller. The security management entity is configured for generating at least one authentication parameter for authentication of a user for enabling the user to use an application. It is also configured for managing, based on data received from the application entity, user data associated with the user and the application in the database by communicating data to the database.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to another embodiment, there is provided a user database for a communications system. The database is configured for management by a main controller. The user database is further configured so as to enable management of user data associated with an authenticated user and an application provided by an application entity based on data communicated from at least one of the application entity and a security management function.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to yet another embodiment, there is provided a system for managing data in a user database of a communications system where the database is managed by a main controller. The system is configured for authenticating a user for enabling the user to use an application provided by an application entity. The system is further configured for managing user data associated with the user and the application in a database of a communications system by communicating data to a second entity connected to the communications system.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a more specific embodiment the management occurs in a phased manner, for example such that managing user data comprises modifying user data in a second database, communicating data from the second database to the database managed by the main controller, and only then modifying user data in the database managed by the main controller based on said data from the second database. The step of communicating data may occur in response to a predefined event.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Data for management of the user data may be comprises communicated between the application entity and a security management function. User data may be modified by the security management function. Alternatively, data may be communicated on an interface directly connecting the application entity and the user database.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Management may be applied to the user data by a remote entity when a user starts using a new service application.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The user may the authenticated in a generic authentication architecture in accordance with specifications of the third generation partnership project.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The user data may comprises user security data, for example user security settings or service specific user security settings of a generic bootstrapping architecture user security settings.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Information regarding a user database to be managed in a communications system comprising a plurality of user databases may be fetched from an appropriate location. For example, such information may be fetched from a subscriber locator function to a security management function.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The embodiments may provide advantage in that management of data in a subscriber database is made easier. The operator of a network may not need to manage user data through operator specific or offline management means and arrangements in all occasions.</p>

Non-limiting examples of such data storages include various home location registers (HLR) and home subscriber servers (HSS).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The user equipment (UE) <b>14</b> can be provided by any appropriate user terminal. The user equipment may contain or have access to a secure environment. In a mobile communications system, the user equipment constitutes a mobile terminal, for example a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a mobile PC (personal computer), or the like. For use in a wireless communications system, the user equipment comprises receive and transmit circuitry and means for receiving and transmitting wireless signals for implementing calls and other signaling channels so that it is enabled to communicate with the base stations <b>12</b>, for example to make voice call and to send and receive data. The user equipment may also be enabled to process control instructions it may receive from the network and to send control information to the network.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A user may access various applications, for example service applications via the network he or she has access to. An application may be provided by a provider entity, for example any of service provider application servers <b>18</b>. It is noted that the application servers (AS) need only be connected to the mobile network, but are not necessarily a part of the mobile network. This means that the operator of the network <b>10</b> may not necessarily have any or may only have a limited control on the operation of an application provider. Furthermore, a communication system may be provided by a plurality of different communication networks. Thus the application provider entity may be connected to another network than the network the user subscribes to.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A user or the user equipment commonly needs to be authenticated before he/she is allowed to access or otherwise use various applications and services via the network. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a security management server <b>17</b> adapted for user authentication. The security management server may be capable of key generation. For example, the server <b>17</b> may provide a bootstrapping function.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A user can be identified by the security management server <b>17</b> based on various identifiers. These can be divided into public and private or secret identifiers. The secret identifiers are typically only known by the operator whereas the public identifiers may be made public. Non-limiting examples of secret user identities include International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) and Internet Protocol Multimedia Private Identity (IMPI). Non-limiting examples of public identities include Mobile Subscriber Integrated System Digital Number (MSISDN) and IP Multimedia Public Identity (IMPU).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">To maintain the identity information a mobile user equipment may be provided with an identity module <b>15</b>. The identity module is commonly understood to refer to a storage of a secure identifier that is arranged to enable the networks to ensure that the user and the user equipment are who they claim to be. A user identity module may contain a number of security and other applications. Well-known non-limiting examples of user identity modules are the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) of the 2G GSM and User Identity Circuit Card (UICC) of the 3G systems or trusted platforms. The user identity module might reside directly in the access device or be accessible from the user equipment providing the network access. User identity modules and the subscriber data storage of the network may store user identities and other shared secrets. A user may have several kinds of user identities that are stored in a user identity module and the subscriber data storage. For example, an IP Multimedia Private Identity (IMPI) may be used inside a security domain whereas a set of IMPUs (IM PUblic Identities) may be used outside the security domain. A user identity module may hold shared secrets with the subscriber data storage and generate security keys from the shared secret. These keys may then be used in creation of trusted connections between the user equipment and an application in operations such as bootstrapping.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an example of an authentication mechanism <b>20</b> that has been proposed. More particularly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic block diagram of an arrangement known as a generic authentication architecture (GAA) in accordance with the 3GPP system. The GAA is based on secret user identities that are stored on appropriate user identity modules <b>15</b> on the user equipment <b>14</b> and subscriber databases <b>16</b> on the network side. The GAA security domain may comprise a bootstrapping function (BSF) <b>23</b> which will be described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The exemplifying embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the GAA architecture as discussed in more detail below. Various possible components thereof will be described only briefly as the operation of these is not essential for embodying the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The user equipment <b>14</b> may communicate with an application entity, for example a network application function (NAF) <b>25</b> over an appropriate interface <b>4</b>, for example a Ua interface. The application function <b>25</b> is accessible by the user equipment <b>14</b> but before the application function can deliver its services to the user equipment <b>14</b> an authentication procedure may be needed. To enable this, the user equipment <b>14</b> can also communicate over an appropriate interface <b>3</b>, for example a Ub interface, with the bootstrapping function (BSF) <b>23</b>. The bootstrapping function <b>23</b> may communicate with a user database, such as a home subscriber server (HSS) <b>16</b> over an appropriate interface <b>2</b>, for example a Zh interface. The bootstrapping function <b>23</b> may also communicate with the application function <b>25</b> over an appropriate interface <b>1</b>, for example a Zn interface</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">When the user equipment <b>14</b> wishes to access an application function <b>25</b> and has not undergone an authentication before that resulted authentication key material that is still valid, the user equipment may undergo an authentication procedure by dispatching a mobile user identity to the bootstrapping function <b>23</b> over interface <b>3</b>. The bootstrapping function <b>23</b> can be in communication with the application function <b>25</b> over interface <b>1</b> to allow it to communicate the results of the authentication and the resulting authentication key material to the application function <b>25</b>. Authentication using the identities originated from the mobile network can be implemented at the bootstrapping function <b>23</b> in various manners. The application function <b>25</b> may then utilize the received authentication key material for direct authentication of the user via a Ua reference point.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a possible architecture of GAA, the home subscriber server (HSS) <b>16</b> contains security related information about all the users related to all the services that use the GAA or the Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA). This information may be stored in GBA user security settings (GUSS). GUSS provides a set of user security settings for a user. The set may include all security settings of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A new subscriber that has not used a service hosted by a network application function before may need to accomplish an initial service registration that results in the creation of user security settings. The service registration may be required before the new subscriber can start to use the service. However, these initial service registrations can become a too burdensome task for the operators since there has been no mechanism to perform these registrations automatically. In the following specific examples are given how an application, for example a network application function, that is hosting a service may also handle an initial registration of a user and to register the initial service parameters for example as a new service specific user security settings (USS) in the GBA user security settings (GUSS) of the subscriber in the HSS.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows some general steps that may be taken in accordance with an embodiment for modifying by an application function user data in a user database that is controlled by a controlling party, for example a network operator. The modification may comprise operations such as insertion, updating, and deletion of information stored in the user database. In step <b>100</b> a user accesses an application entity to request for an application. The application may be invoked in response to a service request, or otherwise, for example by a timer. The authenticity of the user is then verified at step <b>102</b>. The authentication may be based for example on GBA key material communicated between an application server and a user equipment, or based on a new run of GBA that authenticates the user via mobile credentials where after the application server receives the authentication result. User data stored in the database may then be managed in <b>104</b> by communicating data between the application entity and a second entity connected to the communications system without involvement of the controlling party.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The second entity may be a security application such as a bootstrapping function.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In accordance with a possibility the second entity comprises the user database, and the application entity may communicate directly with it via an appropriate interface.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The management may be handled in phased fashion such that management operation are first handled locally in the application entity or the security application and updated or otherwise modified data is then communicated to the user database in a later phase, and data in the user database is modified based on this data.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Management of user data requires identification of the user. To provide this, the management procedure may include assignment of a user identifier or a pseudonym that can be used identity the user in the subsequent sessions with the application server. In order to the GAA to support the initial service registration functionality, the network application function may need to be able to insert the newly created pseudonym to the GBA user security settings (GUSS) profile of a user, i.e., to the service specific user security settings (USS) in the HSS. The next time the subscriber attempts to authenticate itself towards the network application function a service specific USS may contain the pseudonym for the network application function so that it is possible to discover who the actual user is and what his related security settings are.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A network operator may allow only selected application functions to perform the changes for managing user data. For example, only such application functions that are fully trusted and have sufficient number of users to manage may be allowed to manage the user data.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">An authorized application function may be provided with the capability of managing service specific user security settings belonging to that application function in the HSS by means of a security management server. In the following specific examples it is assumed that the user has already been bootstrapped with a bootstrapping function (BSF) to create some NAF specific key material and that this key material is still valid before the management operations take place. The communication between NAF and BSF may be performed in a secure communication channel, for example using HTTPS (Hypertext Transport Protocol Security), MAP/Sec (Mobile Application Part Security) or IPSec (Internet Protocol Security).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">An approach is to manage the subscriber database asynchronously through a bootstrapping function over appropriate interfaces, for example interfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts messaging details related to the user data insert/update/delete procedure where the messaging between a network application function (NAF) through the bootstrapping function (BSF) and the home subscriber server (HSS) is asynchronous. It may be that the NAF is only authorized to perform some management procedure, but not others. For example, updating may be allowed whereas deleting is not.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The messaging between the NAF and the BSF, and the BSF and the HSS may take place in two phases such that in a first phase, during the lifetime of the bootstrapping temporary identifier (B-TID), different NAF servers may update the internal copy of the GUSS of a user in the BSF by inserting, updating, and deleting USSs (steps <b>41</b>-<b>44</b>). A second phase may start when the B-TID becomes invalid (e.g., expires or is replaces by a new B-TID), in response to timer, or periodically. If one or more NAF servers have modified subscriber's GUSS or parts of it in the BSF, the BSF may then update the whole or part of the subscriber's GUSS in the HSS (steps <b>46</b>-<b>49</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The arrangement may be such that each NAF has the right to modify only certain parts of the GUSS data. The BSF may also only allow one NAF or certain NAFs at the time to modify the content of the GUSS data. The BSF may also restrict modifications to dedicated USS or may allow management actions for a larger set of USSs.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">An advantage of employing a -multi-phased procedure is that since a NAF modifies only an internal copy of a GUSS stored in a BSF, this procedure may be substantially fast. Thus the number of modification messages going from the BSF to the HSS may be substantially small.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Turning now to some exemplifying management operations. An USS insert operation may be needed to modify user data after a NAF has fetched parameters, for example a key, from the BSF using the B-TID, and the user equipment and the NAF have completed the authentication between themselves. If the NAF has not received an USS from the BSF, or the received USS was empty meaning that the subscriber has not used the service before, a procedure for insertion of the USS may be needed to create the USS and place the created USS in the operators user database, for example a HSS or HLR. An example is a situation where a user roams and uses for the first time a service of the visited network operator.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> the NAF creates, at step <b>41</b>, a new service specific USS for the subscriber and populates the data fields with subscriber specific data. The USS may contain a pseudonym created by the NAF and other service specific data required by the service specific USS. The NAF then sends at step <b>42</b> an INSERT message with the B-TID, and the new USS to the BSF over the Zn interface. The BSF may then check at step <b>43</b> that the NAF is authorized to insert the new USS to subscriber's GUSS. If the NAF is not authorized to perform this management action, the BSF may return an ERROR message to the NAF, or take some other appropriate action. If the NAF is authorized by to insert the new USS to subscriber's GUSS, the BSF inserts the USS to its internal copy of subscriber's GUSS, and returns at step <b>44</b> an OK message to the NAF.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Steps <b>41</b> to <b>44</b> may occur multiple times during the lifetime of the B-TID. For example, different NAFs may modify subscriber's GUSS at step <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">When the B-TID and the corresponding bootstrapping session becomes invalid and if the BSF's internal copy of subscriber's GUSS has been modified (see step <b>46</b>), the BSF may send the subscriber's IMPI and GUSS to the HSS at step <b>47</b>. A complete GUSS or only the altered parts of the GUSS may be sent to the HSS at this stage. The HSS may then replace at step <b>48</b> the old GUSS with the modified GUSS received from the BSF or replace the modified parts. Subscriber's GUSS can be identified based on the IMPI. Upon successful replacement operation, an appropriate acknowledgement, such as an OK message, may be sent to the BSF at step <b>49</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">If the replacement or modification operation was not successful, an ERROR message may be sent to the BSF. It is noted that from the point of view of the management operations, it does not matter how NAFs that have modified the GUSS are informed of the failure, or whether they need to be informed at all.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Asynchronous USS update operation will be explained next with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As above, the NAF has fetched required parameters from the BSF using the B-TID, and the user equipment and the NAF have completed the authentication between themselves. If during the session the NAF discovers that subscriber's USS needs to be updated, the NAF may initiate at step <b>41</b> the modification of the existing service specific USS for the subscriber. The NAF then sends at step <b>42</b> an UPDATE message with the B-TID, and the updated USS to the BSF over the Zn interface. The BSF checks that the NAF is authorized to update the USS to subscriber's GUSS at step <b>43</b>. As above, if the NAF is not authorized to perform the requested management operation, the BSF may return an ERROR message to the NAF. If the NAF is authorized to update the USS to subscriber's GUSS, the BSF updates the USS in its internal copy of subscriber's GUSS, and returns an OK message at step <b>44</b> to the NAF.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As with the insertion, update steps <b>41</b> to <b>44</b> may occur multiple times during the lifetime of the B-TID. Steps <b>45</b> to <b>49</b> can the same as described before with reference to insertion. After step <b>49</b>, the USS in subscriber's GUSS in the HSS has been updated.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A further exemplifying embodiment of the asynchronous management relates to delete operations. It is again assumed that the NAF has already fetched required parameters from the BSF using the B-TID, and the user equipment and the NAF have completed the authentication between themselves. If the NAF discovers that the subscriber wants to terminate the service usage with it, and thus the subscriber's USS needs to be deleted from the GUSS, the NAF may initiate deletion of the existing service specific USS for the subscriber at step <b>41</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The NAF may then send a DELETE message with the B-TID and the USS identifier, i.e., application-id to the BSF over Zn interface at step <b>42</b>. The BSF checks at step <b>43</b> that the NAF is authorized to delete the USS to subscriber's GUSS. If the NAF is not authorized, the BSF may return an ERROR message to the NAF. If the NAF is authorized to delete the USS to subscriber's GUSS, the BSF removes the USS from its internal copy of subscriber's GUSS, and returns an OK message at step <b>44</b> to the NAF.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As above, steps <b>41</b> to <b>44</b> may occur multiple times during the lifetime of the B-TID. Steps <b>45</b> to <b>49</b> may be the same as described above. After step <b>49</b>, the USS in subscriber's GUSS in the HSS has been deleted. In all three management procedures one or more USS or even the whole GUSS may be managed by a NAF. The user data may associate with other applications. This may be provided, for example, by means of several separated messages or by concatenation of the necessary information in message <b>42</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In another scenario the management of the subscriber database may occur synchronously through a BSF over appropriate interfaces. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a chart depicting messaging details related to insert, update and delete procedures where the messaging between a NAF through a BSF and a HSS is synchronous.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">An USS insert operation will be described first. As above, it is assumed that the NAF has fetched required parameters from the BSF using the B-TID, and the user equipment and the NAF have completed the authentication between themselves or that the NAF has received the authentication information. However, it may occur that the NAF has not received an USS from the BSF, or the received USS was empty meaning that the user has not used the service before. In response to detection of this situation, the NAF may create a new service specific USS for the subscriber and populate the data fields with subscriber specific data in step <b>51</b>. The USS may contain a pseudonym created by the NAF and other service specific data required by the service specific USS. The NAF may create the USS not only for the service requested by the user, but also for other services. For example, a visiting network may also create a USS for similar services. The NAF may then send the B-TID, and the new USS to the BSF over Zn interface at step <b>52</b>. The NAF may also insert additional B-TIDs and USS for other services in the same message. The BSF then checks at step <b>53</b> that the NAF is authorized to insert the new USS to subscriber's GUSS. If the NAF is not authorized, the BSF may return an ERROR message to the NAF. If the NAF is authorized to insert the new USSs to subscriber's GUSS, the IMPI and the new USSs are sent to the HSS at step <b>54</b>. The HSS may then insert the USSs to subscriber's GUSS identified by the IMPI at step <b>55</b>. Upon successful insert operation, the HSS returns OK message at step <b>56</b> to the BSF. If the insert operation was not successful, an ERROR message may be sent to the BSF, or other appropriate action may follow. The BSF may then send at step <b>58</b> either OK or ERROR message to the NAF depending on the message received in step <b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Other management procedures such as update and delete may be provided accordingly. Again the rights of the NAF to perform the management of the USS might vary between the different actions.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the synchronous scenario each modification procedure on a subscriber's GUSS may trigger the BSF to contact the HSS. This may not always be desirable. Fore example, multiple NAFs may modify subscriber's GUSS during a bootstrapping session, and this may cause the BSF to contact the HSS multiple times. Thus the asynchronous approach may in certain applications be more appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Various other alternatives may also be provided for the management of the subscriber data. For example, a service specific user data may be inserted into, updated or deleted in the user database by a network application function directly via an existing interface or via new interface. An example of this interface is shown by a dashed line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. For example, a Sh interface or extension of it or a new GAA specific interface may be used for direct control between a network application function and a home subscriber server.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The direct management approach may be simpler and may require less or no changes in other interfaces. However, the access control for the network application function to insert, update, and delete a particular service specific user data may then need to be implemented in the user database, for example in the home subscriber server. Also, the Sh interface communication that does not utilize GAA may need to be able to handle the managing messages. This may not be always desired. Also, a BSF may already be provided with an access control functionality for the delivery USSs for different NAFs. Handling of the access control for user data insert/update/delete procedures may thus be more appropriately handled in a GM specific BSF.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">If the NAF is collocated with a Liberty Identity Provider (IdP), then a USS management procedure may relieve the HSS from the Identity Provider related management burden of the USS. Also, such a USS management procedure may allow operators to easily outsource the user registration to specific services. The IdP may act as a trusted party also for other services, for example fixed network services and manage the USS for these services also.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">If there are several user databases such as home subscriber servers in an operator system, then the BSF may need to know which server to contact. This information may be provided, for example, by a Subscriber locator Function (SLF). The BSF may contact the SLF with the request for data and be then provisioned with necessary information or redirected to the right HSS that contains the corresponding user data. The interface between BSF and SLF may be, for example, a Dz or similar interface.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The above described operations may require data processing in the various entities. The data processing may be provided by means of one or more data processors. Appropriately adapted computer program code product may be used for implementing the embodiments, when loaded to a computer. The program code product for providing the operation may be stored on and provided by means of a carrier medium such as a carrier disc, card or tape. A possibility is to download the program code product via a data network. Implementation may be provided with appropriate software in a location server.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The above embodiments relate to use cases where user data of a user using a service application is modified, either during initial registration or afterwards. User data may be managed accordingly also when the user is not using the service, but modification of user data is desired.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">It is noted that whilst in the above embodiments are described in relation to user equipment such as mobile stations, embodiments of the present invention are applicable to any other suitable type of user equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">It is also noted that even though the exemplifying communication system shown and described in more detail in this disclosure uses the terminology of the 3<sup>rd </sup>generation (3G) WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) networks, such as UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) or CDMA2000 public land mobile networks (PLMN), embodiments of the proposed solution can be used in any communication system wherein advantage may be obtained by means of the embodiments of the invention.
