<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to footwear, and more particularly to articles of footwear having support structures.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Articles of footwear typically include an upper and a sole. In athletic shoes, the sole is typically comprised of a foam midsole and a rubber outsole.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">When an article of footwear contacts a surface, considerable forces may act on the article of footwear and, correspondingly, the wearer's foot. The sole functions, in part, to cushion to the wearer's foot and to protect it from these forces. To achieve adequate cushioning, many footwear soles are relatively thick and heavy. When sole size and/or weight are reduced to achieve other performance goals, protection of the wearer's foot is often compromised.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Due to ordinary stretch and wear, even the best soles tend to lose their ability to provide adequate cushioning over time. Ideally, the resiliency or &#x201c;bounce&#x201d; of the sole should remain relatively constant over the useful life of the article of footwear.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Particularly in the heel region of the article of footwear, additional stability&#x2014;beyond that provided by the sole itself&#x2014;is often desired.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Various support structures may be incorporated into articles of footwear to provide required cushioning and/or stability. Using such support structures to strike an optimal balance between cushioning and stability is a difficult task, particularly when an article of footwear that is both relatively inexpensive and easy to manufacture is desired.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, a need exists for an article of footwear that is capable of overcoming one or more of the challenges described above.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments of the present invention may relate to an article of footwear comprising: a midsole having a plurality of cavities formed therein; and a flexible cage member disposed on the midsole and extending across at least one of the cavities.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Embodiments of the present invention may also relate to an article of footwear comprising: a sole having a plurality of exterior sidewalls and a plurality of cavities formed therein, wherein each of the cavities is disposed between adjacent exterior sidewalls; and a flexible support member disposed on the sole. The flexible support member may include a plurality of support arms disposed on the exterior sidewalls; and a linking member connecting two or more of the support arms and extending across at least one of the cavities.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Embodiments of the present invention may further relate to an article of footwear having a sole having a heel portion and a plurality of exterior sidewalls and a plurality of cavities formed therein, wherein each of the cavities is disposed between adjacent exterior sidewalls. A lateral flexible support member may be disposed on a lateral side of the heel portion; and a medial flexible support member may be disposed on a medial side of the heel portion.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to embodiments thereof as illustrated in the accompanying figures. While specific configurations and arrangements are discussed, it should be understood that this is done for illustrative purposes only. References to &#x201c;an embodiment&#x201d;, &#x201c;one embodiment&#x201d;, &#x201c;another embodiment&#x201d;, etc., indicate that the embodiment described may include a particular feature, structure, or characteristic, but every embodiment may not necessarily include the particular feature, structure, or characteristic. Moreover, such phrases are not necessarily referring to the same embodiment. Further, a person skilled in the relevant art will recognize that other configurations and arrangements can be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">An article of footwear <b>10</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention is shown generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Although the article of footwear <b>10</b> may be referred to herein as a shoe <b>10</b>, it is contemplated that it may comprise any type of footwear including, but not limited to, running shoes, basketball shoes, court shoes, tennis shoes, training shoes, cleated footwear, sandals, casual shoes, or boots.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">To the extent that only the left or right article of footwear <b>10</b> is described for a particular embodiment of the present invention, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the article of footwear <b>10</b> suitable for the other foot, even if not specifically described, may comprise a mirror image of the described article of footwear <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Articles of footwear <b>10</b> according to embodiments of the present invention may include an upper <b>20</b> disposed above a sole <b>100</b>. The upper <b>20</b> may be formed to generally accommodate a human foot, and may comprise one or more textiles made of natural or man-made fibers. Materials appropriate for the upper <b>20</b> including, but not limited to, leather, rubber, and plastic, are considered to be within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one embodiment of the present invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an article of footwear <b>10</b> may include a sole <b>100</b> with one or more cavities <b>102</b> formed in the sole <b>100</b>. A plurality of support arms <b>200</b> may be disposed on, or over, the sole <b>100</b>. One or more linking members <b>202</b> may extend across the one or more cavities <b>102</b> and may connect two or more of the plurality of the support arms <b>200</b>. In this manner, support arms <b>200</b> and linking members <b>202</b> may form a flexible cage structure. In some embodiments, the flexible cage structure is disposed on or over a midsole member of sole <b>100</b> and is entirely external to the midsole member. In other embodiments, the flexible cage structure is contained within the midsole member or portions of the flexible cage structure can extend into the midsole member.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The flexible cage structure can be attached to an existing sole member or the flexible cage structure can be attached to a sole member during formation of the sole member. Such a sole member can include a full or partial sole (e.g., a medial and/or lateral heel portion sole member or a medial and/or lateral forefoot sole member). In one embodiment, the flexible cage structure is attached to an existing sole member using an adhesive. In another embodiment, a sole member is molded around the flexible cage structure, for example, by placing the flexible cage structure in a mold and then molding the sole member around the flexible cage structure. In some embodiments, at least one of the support arms is attached to the sole member. For example, at least the upper portion of at least one support arm is attached to the sole member. In some embodiments, the upper portions of all of the support arms are attached to the sole member.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The sole <b>100</b> may be a midsole of an athletic shoe <b>10</b> and may provide cushioning and/or stability to the shoe <b>10</b>. The sole <b>100</b> may comprise a foam such as, for example, ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA). Other materials appropriate for the sole <b>100</b> include, but are not limited to, polyurethane (PU), thermoplastic urethane (TPU), and thermoplastic rubber (TPR). The sole <b>100</b> may be constructed of one or more materials, and may have zones of differing densities.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The sole <b>100</b> may include one or more cavities <b>102</b>. The cavities <b>102</b> of one embodiment of the present invention are best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which is a bottom view of the midsole <b>100</b> of an athletic shoe <b>10</b>, wherein the support arms <b>200</b> and linking members <b>202</b> have been removed to better illustrate the cavities. In some embodiments, including cavities <b>102</b> in the sole <b>100</b> may reduce the overall weight of the article of footwear <b>10</b>. For athletic shoes <b>10</b> in particular, this may be advantageous in that the wearer may be able to run or make other athletic movements more quickly than when wearing a heavier shoe <b>10</b>. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is also believed that athletic shoes which include cavities in the sole, for example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, can better accommodate shear or other forces than conventional athletic shoes by providing a sole structure that can flex and deform in response to shear or other forces. In some embodiments, cavities <b>102</b> are empty cavities. In other embodiments, cavities <b>102</b> can be filled with one or more materials that are different from one or more materials used in the remainder of the sole (e.g., the midsole). For example, in one embodiment, cavities <b>102</b> are filled with a material, such as a foam, that has a different hardness or compressibility than the material used in the majority of the remainder of the sole (e.g., the midsole).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The cavities <b>102</b> may be formed by discontinuities <b>104</b> in the sole <b>100</b> material. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in one embodiment of the present invention, the sole <b>100</b> may include a plurality of exterior side wall surfaces <b>106</b>, one or more interior side wall surfaces <b>108</b>, and a plurality of joining surfaces <b>110</b> connecting the exterior and interior side wall surfaces <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>. The cavities <b>102</b> may be defined by the space between the exterior side wall, interior side wall, and joining surfaces <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, and <b>110</b>. The cavities can be formed in the sole simultaneously with formation of the sole, e.g., by molding. Alternatively, the cavities can be formed in an existing sole by methods such as, for example, cutting, boring, or melting.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The size and shape of the cavities <b>102</b> may vary according to embodiments of the present invention. The cavities can include, but are not limited to, generally box-shaped cavities, generally cylindrical cavities, channel-like cavities, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the cavities can include generally vertical channels. For example, the cavities can include generally vertical channels that extend through the bottom surface of the sole. In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the cavities <b>102</b> may comprise generally vertical channels with a slight forward tilt. The cavities may extend through the bottom surface <b>118</b> of the sole <b>100</b>. In other embodiments, the cavities do not extend through the bottom surface <b>118</b> of the sole <b>100</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the cavities include holes extending into the sole <b>100</b> from the side of the sole <b>100</b>. Other cavity configurations are considered to be within the scope of the present invention provided a void is formed in at least a portion of sole <b>100</b> that may otherwise have contained the material of sole <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further, while the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes defined, flat side wall surfaces meeting each other at angles, other embodiments can include rounded or otherwise gradual transitions between exterior side wall, interior side wall, and joining surfaces <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, and <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, one or more cavities are at least about 3 mm in width or diameter. For example, one or more cavities can be at least about 5 mm, at least about 7 mm, at least about 10 mm, or at least about 13 mm in width or diameter. In some embodiments, all of the cavities are the same width or diameter. However, in other embodiments, one or more of the cavities has a different width or diameter from the others. In some instances, the width or diameter of the cavities progressively changes as a function of the location of the cavities in a forefoot to heel direction. For example, the width or diameter of the cavities can progressively increase as a function of the location of the cavities in a forefoot to heel direction, e.g., the width or diameter of the heel-most cavity is largest and the width or diameter of the forefoot-most cavity is smallest. In some embodiments, the width or diameter of a cavity can vary along its length.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A plurality of support arms <b>200</b> may be disposed on the sole <b>100</b>. Generally, the support arms <b>200</b> may be adapted to provide additional cushioning and/or stability to portions of the sole <b>100</b>. The support arms <b>200</b> may comprise, for example, thermoplastic materials such as thermoplastic urethane (TPU), thermoplastic elastomer (TPE), thermoplastic rubber (TPR), thermoplastic vulcanizate (TPV), latex, and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the support arms include a polyester-based TPU such as, for example, Elastollan&#xae; 685A10 (Elastollan is a trademark of BASF Corporation; Florham Park, N.J.) or a polyether block amide such as, for example, PEBAX&#xae; 6333 or 7233 (Arkema, Inc.; Philadelphia, Pa.). Other materials appropriate for the support arms <b>200</b> including, but not limited to, various plastics, rubbers, reinforced materials (such as, for example, glass-fiber reinforced materials), and suitable composite materials are considered to be within the scope of the present invention. All of the support arms <b>200</b> can be formed of the same material or, alternatively, one or more of the support arms can be formed of different materials. Thus, in some embodiments, the support arms <b>200</b> can be formed of different materials and thereby the cushioning or control characteristics of portions of the flexible cage structure can be varied. The support arms <b>200</b> may be formed, for example, by injection molding, blow molding, compression molding, die cutting, or stamping.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The material or materials used for the support arms <b>200</b> may be selected to achieve a desired level of support, cushioning, and/or stability in a particular region of sole <b>100</b> of the article of footwear <b>10</b>. Generally, more flexible materials may provide better cushioning, while stiffer materials may provide increased stability. In some embodiments, the support arms have a Shore A hardness of about 65 to about 95 such as about 65 to about 90; about 65 to about 85; or about 85. In other embodiments, the support arms have a Shore D hardness of about 30 to about 70 such as about 50 to about 70; about 60 to about 65; or about 65.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Generally, the support arms can be of any dimension. In some embodiments, the support arms have a thickness of at least about 0.5 mm such as, for example, about 0.5 to about 4 mm; about 0.75 to about 3 mm; about 1 to about 2.5 mm; or about 1 to about 2 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the support arms <b>200</b> may be disposed on or over the exterior side wall surfaces <b>106</b> of the sole <b>100</b>. A fully assembled version of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The support arms <b>200</b> may approximate the shapes of the exterior side wall surfaces <b>106</b> that the support arms <b>200</b> are disposed on, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. For example, support arms <b>200</b> can bend outwardly from the sole <b>100</b> and exterior side wall surfaces <b>106</b> may similarly extend outwardly so as to accommodate the support arms <b>200</b>. In other embodiments of the present invention, the support arms <b>200</b> may have shapes that differ from that of the corresponding exterior side wall surfaces <b>106</b>. In some instances, the support arms <b>200</b> bend outwardly from the sole <b>100</b> and a gap exists between the support arms <b>200</b> and the exterior side wall surfaces <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In embodiments of the present invention where the support arms <b>200</b> are disposed on the exterior side wall surfaces <b>106</b> of the sole <b>100</b>, spaces may be present between adjacent support arm <b>200</b> edges due to the presence of the one or more cavities <b>102</b> existing between the exterior side wall surfaces <b>106</b>. In this configuration, the support arms <b>200</b> may be capable of providing additional cushioning and stability in a region of the sole <b>100</b> where cushioning and stability have been reduced due to the presence of the cavities <b>102</b> in the sole <b>100</b>. The support arms <b>200</b> may also help to maintain the resiliency or &#x201c;bounce&#x201d; of the sole <b>100</b> for a longer period of time because a portions of the forces acting on the footwear <b>10</b> will be imparted to the support arms <b>200</b> instead of the sole <b>100</b> itself.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, one or more linking members <b>202</b> may extend across the cavities <b>102</b>, and may connect a plurality of support arms <b>200</b>. In general, the linking members <b>202</b> include one or more of the materials, described supra, for use in support arms <b>200</b>. However, one or more linking members <b>202</b> may or may not comprise the same materials as one or more of support arms <b>200</b>. In some embodiments, the linking members <b>202</b> include one or more materials with different properties from those of the materials of the support arms <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">All of the linking members can be formed of the same material or, alternatively, one or more of the linking members can be formed of different materials than the other linking members. Thus, in some embodiments, one or more of linking members can be formed of different materials and thereby the cushioning or control characteristics of portions of the flexible cage structure can be varied.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The linking members <b>202</b> may or may not be integrally formed with the support arms <b>200</b>, such as by injection molding, blow molding, compression molding, die cutting, or stamping. While the embodiment illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> shows two sets of roughly horizontal linking members <b>202</b>, alternate embodiments containing any number of linking members in other orientations are considered to be within the scope of the present invention. The embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> includes linking member <b>202</b> which extends across and partially covers cavity <b>102</b>. In other embodiments, a linking member <b>202</b> can extend across and substantially, or fully, cover a cavity <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, a linking member <b>202</b> can include one or more transparent or translucent portions or windows that extend across and cover all or part of a cavity <b>102</b>. In other instances, a linking member <b>202</b> can include a frame portion of a window member that extends across and covers all or part of a cavity <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Generally, the linking members <b>202</b> can be of any dimension. In some embodiments, the linking members <b>202</b> have a thickness of at least about 0.5 mm such as, for example, about 0.5 to about 4 mm; about 0.75 to about 3 mm; about 1 to about 2.5 mm; or about 1 to about 2 mm. In some instances, the maximum thickness of at least one linking member <b>202</b> is less than the maximum thickness of at least one support arm <b>200</b>. In some embodiments, wherein the linking member <b>202</b> includes a window member, the window member can be made of different material(s) than the support arms <b>200</b> and/or have a different thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The linking members <b>202</b> may assist in providing cushioning and/or stability to the portions of the sole <b>100</b> where the cavities <b>102</b> are disposed. This may be accomplished by offering additional resiliency to the support arms <b>200</b> that are flexed during a wearer's stride, and by further stabilizing the support arms <b>200</b> and their underlying sole <b>100</b> portions in the vicinity of the cavities <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, the linking members <b>202</b> can help to moderate the dynamics of the portions of the sole <b>100</b> adjacent to the cavities <b>102</b> and/or of the support arms <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that athletic shoes which include cavities <b>102</b> in the midsole, for example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, can better accommodate shear forces than conventional athletic shoes by providing a midsole structure that can flex and deform in response to shear forces. However, when the midsole contains cavities <b>102</b>, the structural integrity or the resiliency of the midsole can be compromised. The flexible cage members described herein can help to maintain or improve the structural integrity or the resiliency of the sole as a whole. Further, the flexible cage members described herein can help to moderate the dynamics of the sole.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in one embodiment of the present invention, lower portions <b>204</b> of the support arms <b>200</b> may extend underneath a portion of a bottom surface <b>118</b> of the sole <b>100</b>. For example, in the case of an athletic shoe <b>10</b>, the lower portions <b>204</b> may extend underneath a portion of the bottom surface <b>118</b> of the midsole <b>100</b>. Support arms <b>200</b> with lower portions <b>204</b> that extend underneath the sole <b>100</b> may be fixed to the bottom surface <b>118</b> by adhesives, frictional force between the sole <b>100</b> and another contacting member, and/or other means known in the art. When the lower portions <b>204</b> of the support arms <b>200</b> are anchored in this way, the support arms <b>200</b> may be capable of acting as cantilevers to resist motion of higher portions of the support arms <b>200</b> during a wearer's stride, thus enhancing the cushioning and/or stability characteristics of the sole <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in some embodiments, upper tips of support arms <b>200</b> can extend to or abut a sole ridge <b>500</b>. In one preferred embodiment, the upper portions of support arms <b>200</b> abut sole ridge <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The support arms <b>200</b> may include angled or curved portions <b>206</b>, examples of which are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Such angled or curved portions <b>206</b> may similarly aid in enhancing cushioning and/or stability characteristics of the sole <b>100</b> during a wearer's stride, and additionally may allow the support arms <b>200</b> to better contour the shape of the side walls of the sole <b>100</b>.
