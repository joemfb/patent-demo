<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a pneumatic tire intended to support heavy loads and, more specifically, to a bead structure of such a tire.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A heavily loaded vehicle tire comprises a crown part surmounted radially on the outside by a tread intended to come into contact with the roadway, this crown part extending radially inward by sidewalls ending in bead structures. A pneumatic tire comprises a plurality of reinforcement armatures including, in particular, a carcass reinforcement for supporting loads created by the tire internal inflation pressure and the vehicle. This carcass reinforcement extends into the crown and the sidewalls of the pneumatic tire and is anchored at its ends to appropriate anchoring structures located in the bead structures. A carcass reinforcement may be generally made up of a plurality of reinforcing members arranged parallel to one another and making an angle of, or in the region of, 90 degrees with the circumferential direction (in which case, the carcass reinforcement is said to be &#x201c;radial&#x201d;). The carcass reinforcement is usually anchored by turning it up around an anchoring structure of appropriate circumferential rigidity in order to form a turned-up portion of which the length, measured for example with respect to the radially innermost point of the anchoring structure, may be chosen to provide the pneumatic tire with satisfactory durability. Axially between the turned-up portion and the carcass reinforcement may be one or more elastomer-based materials which provide a mechanical coupling between the turned-up portions and the main carcass reinforcement.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In use, the pneumatic tire may be mounted on a rim with rim seats intended to contact the radially innermost parts of the bead structures. On the axially outer side of each rim seat, a rim flange may fix the axial position of each bead structure when the pneumatic tire is fitted onto the rim and inflated to its normal operational pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to withstand the mechanical stresses of rotating under load, additional reinforcements may be provided for reinforcing the bead structures. For example, plies may be arranged against at least a part of the turned-up portion of the carcass reinforcement. During use, the bead structures may be subjected to a great many bending cycles, thereby conforming/deforming themselves to the rim flanges (e.g., partially adopting the geometry of the rim flanges). This results in greater or lesser variants in curvature of the bead structures combined with variations in tension in the reinforcement armatures that reinforce the bead structures and, in particular, in the turned-up portion of the carcass reinforcement. These same cycles may induce compressive and extensile loadings in the materials of the bead structures. Also, the reinforcing members of the carcass ply may shift circumferentially and cyclically in the sidewalls and the bead structures of the pneumatic tire. A cyclic circumferential shift is a shift in one circumferential direction and in the opposite circumferential direction each time the wheel and pneumatic tire revolve about a position of equilibrium (or no shift).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Stresses and/or deformations may be generated within the materials of the bead structures, and particularly within the elastomeric materials in the immediate vicinity of the ends of the reinforcements (the ends of the turned-up portions of the carcass reinforcement, or ends of the additional reinforcements). These stresses and/or deformations may lead to an appreciable reduction in the operating/service life of the pneumatic tire.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">These stresses and/or deformations may cause delamination and cracking near the ends of the reinforcements. Because of the radial direction of some of the reinforcing members and because of the nature of the reinforcing members (e.g., metal cables), the turned-up ends of the carcass reinforcement may be particularly sensitive to this phenomenon.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A pneumatic tire in accordance with the present invention includes a carcass ply extending from one bead structure to another bead structure.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF AN EXAMPLE EMBODIMENT OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> show an example bead structure <b>5</b> of a pneumatic tire <b>1</b> in accordance with the present invention. The pneumatic tire <b>1</b> may be mounted on a mounting rim <b>2</b> (not shown) of which the bead structure may seat during rotation of the pneumatic tire under load. The bead structure <b>5</b> may comprise a seat part <b>51</b> intended to be in contact with a seat portion of the rim. This seat part <b>51</b> may extend axially outwards through an external part <b>52</b>. A hook flange of the mounting rim may axially limit the extent to which the bead structure <b>5</b> may shift axially when the pneumatic tire <b>1</b> is inflated and under load. Under such operational conditions, the external part <b>52</b> of the bead structure <b>5</b> may wind/encompass itself around the hook flange to some extent.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">A carcass ply <b>10</b> of the pneumatic tire <b>1</b> may have a plurality of metal cords formed of several elemental wires. These metal cords may be embedded in an elastomeric compound and directed substantially in a radial direction. The carcass ply <b>10</b> may be anchored at one of its ends around an anchoring structure <b>20</b> of the bead structure <b>5</b>. The anchoring structure <b>20</b> may comprise a cover profile <b>22</b> coating a circumferential reinforcement armature, or bead <b>21</b> (e.g., a bead of a plurality of circumferentially wound metal wires). The carcass ply <b>10</b> may encase the cover profile <b>22</b>, thereby being mechanically coupled to the cover profile by adhesion to the carcass ply.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">A first reinforcement, or chipper <b>30</b>, having a plurality of reinforcing members may extend axially towards an inner surface (e.g., bead-side surface) of the carcass ply. A first part <b>31</b> of the chipper <b>30</b> may be in contact with the carcass ply <b>10</b> along the axially inner portion of the bead structure <b>5</b>. A second part <b>32</b> of the chipper <b>30</b> may be in contact with the turned-up portion of the carcass ply <b>10</b> along the axially outer portion of the bead structure <b>5</b>. An apex <b>60</b> of a suitable elastomeric compound may be inserted between the carcass ply <b>10</b> and the turned-up portion of the carcass ply.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The bead structure <b>5</b> may further include a second reinforcement, or protrusion <b>40</b> of the carcass ply <b>10</b> extending radially inward and axially inward from the axial inner portion of the bead structure. This protrusion <b>40</b> may increase strength and durability of the bead structure <b>5</b> during operation of the pneumatic tire <b>1</b> under loaded conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The bead structure <b>5</b> in accordance with the present invention may increase durability of conventional bead structures (e.g., bead structures of radial medium truck tire, semi-tractor trailer tires, etc.). Such a bead structure <b>5</b> may further reduce the weight of the pneumatic tire <b>1</b> (e.g., 3.5 percent weight reduction in a tire size 315/70R22.5) while providing equal to plus performances versus conventional tires.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The bead structure <b>5</b> described herein may thus add more value to such a pneumatic tire <b>1</b>. Such value may include a weight optimization strongly desired by truck manufacturers to reduce the total truck load (e.g., more pay load for same truck total load). The example bead structure <b>5</b> may include a carcass ply orientation generally equivalent to a natural inflated profile of the carcass ply <b>10</b> (e.g., increasing casing stability through multiple tire lives/retreads). This may provide a larger flexure zone in the sidewalls, thereby reducing stress concentrations and/or sidewall fatigue in the sidewalls of the casing during operation under load.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Further, a bead <b>21</b> in accordance with the present invention may have a cross-sectional profile with a radial height to axial width ratio H/W greater than 1.0 or 1.2 with a bead orientation angle &#x3b3; (the longitudinal axis of the radial cross section of the bead <b>21</b> relative to the radial direction R) between 30 degrees and 60 degrees or between 40 degrees and 50 degrees or about 45 degrees. The example bead <b>21</b> may thus reduce weight by 3.5 percent of a conventional tire (e.g., 315/70R22.5), may increase durability by 30 percent, and may reduce rolling resistance by 4 percent.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">As described above, truck manufacturers may desire weight reduction for tires, which may lead to continuous optimization of manufacturing, materials, design, etc. The bead structure <b>5</b> in accordance with the present invention may thus provide a lighter tire weight tire with equal or superior performance compared to conventional tires.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The increased ratio H/W may lead to a desirous reduced thickness gauge distribution near the bead structures <b>5</b>. The increased orientation angle &#x3b3; of the bead <b>21</b> may increase radial stiffness of the bead structure <b>5</b>. The radial extension of the turned-up portions of the carcass ply <b>10</b> beyond the apexes further stabilize the bead structure <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">As shown particularly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the bead <b>21</b> may have an irregular hexagonal shape tilted in cross-section at an angle &#x3b3; relative to the radial direction R. Two sides of the bead <b>21</b> are parallel to the angle &#x3b3; while the other four sides complete the hexagon.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">As stated above, a bead structure <b>5</b> in accordance with the present invention produces reduced rolling resistance and weight in a pneumatic tire <b>1</b>. These bead structures <b>5</b> thus enhance the performance of the pneumatic tire <b>1</b>, even though the complexities of the structure and behavior of the pneumatic tire are such that no complete and satisfactory theory has been propounded. Temple, <i>Mechanics of Pneumatic Tires </i>(2005). While the fundamentals of classical composite theory are easily seen in pneumatic tire mechanics, the additional complexity introduced by the many structural components of pneumatic tires readily complicates the problem of predicting tire performance. Mayni, <i>Composite Effects on Tire Mechanics </i>(2005). Additionally, because of the non-linear time, frequency, and temperature behaviors of polymers and rubber, analytical design of pneumatic tires is one of the most challenging and underappreciated engineering challenges in today's industry. Mayni.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">A pneumatic tire has certain essential structural elements. United States Department of Transportation, <i>Mechanics of Pneumatic Tires</i>, Pages 207 and 208 (1981). An important structural element is the overlay, typically made up of many flexible, high modulus cords of natural textile, synthetic polymer, glass fiber, or fine hard drawn steel embedded in, and bonded to, a matrix of low modulus polymeric material, usually natural or synthetic rubber. Id. at 207 through 208.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The flexible, high modulus cords are usually disposed as a single layer. Id. at 208. Tire manufacturers throughout the industry cannot agree or predict the effect of different twists of overlay cords on noise characteristics, handling, durability, comfort, etc. in pneumatic tires, <i>Mechanics of Pneumatic Tires</i>, Pages 80 through 85.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">These complexities are demonstrated by the below table of the interrelationships between tire performance and tire components.</p>

<p id="p-0115" num="0114">As seen in the table, bead characteristics affect the other components of a pneumatic tire (i.e., bead affects apex, belt, overlay, carcass ply, etc.), leading to a number of components interrelating and interacting in such a way as to affect a group of functional properties (noise, handling, durability, comfort, high speed, and mass), resulting in a completely unpredictable and complex composite. Thus, changing even one component can lead to directly improving or degrading as many as the above ten functional characteristics, as well as altering the interaction between that one component and as many as six other structural components. Each of those six interactions may thereby indirectly improve or degrade those ten functional characteristics. Whether each of these functional characteristics is improved, degraded, or unaffected, and by what amount, certainly would have been unpredictable without the experimentation and testing conducted by the inventors.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Thus, for example, when the structure (e.g., twist, cord construction, axial width, etc.) of the bead of a pneumatic tire is modified with the intent to improve one functional property of the pneumatic tire, any number of other functional properties may be unacceptably degraded. Furthermore, the interaction between the bead and the apex, belt, overlay, carcass, and tread may also unacceptably affect the functional properties of the pneumatic tire. A modification of the bead structure may not even improve that one functional property because of these complex interrelationships.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Thus, as stated above, the complexity of the interrelationships of the multiple components makes the actual result of modification of a bead structure, in accordance with the present invention, impossible to predict or foresee from the infinite possible results. Only through extensive experimentation have the bead structures <b>5</b> of the present invention been revealed as an excellent, unexpected, and unpredictable option for a tire overlay.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The above description is given in reference to example embodiments of a tire having a tread portion for reducing rolling resistance and increasing fuel economy. However, it is understood that many variations are apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art from a reading of the disclosure of the invention. Such variations and modifications apparent to those skilled in the art are within the scope and spirit of the instant invention, as defined by the following appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Variations in the present invention are possible in light of the description of it provided herein.
