<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to seatbelt harnesses for pets such as dogs and they are intended to be used for their protection during travel in a motor vehicle by directly connecting to a vehicle seatbelt system including a seatbelt webbing lock-release system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">About 70 million plus homes in United States of America have a pet and 50% of those have two pets. Whether it's a quick trip to the supermarket or a long ride to the beach, companion animals are now traveling animals too and pet friendly lodging has increased 300% since 2005. For example, 82% of pets travel on vacation with their owners. However, 98% of dogs do not travel properly restrained in a moving vehicle. When driving at 35 mph speed, a 60-pound unrestrained dog can cause an impact of 2,700 lbs, slamming into a motor vehicle seat, windshield, or driver/passenger(s). In fact, driver distraction causes more accidents than any other issue.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An average of seventy five percent family pets visit veterinary clinic every year for treatment. Forty percent of all vet fees come from unforeseen illnesses or accidents. Only 20% of family pets are covered by a pet insurance. The average vet bill for attention and care needed following a road accident involving a cat or dog last year was around $1000 to $1,500.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Traveling in a vehicle with a dog can pose a serious danger to the pet. In an accident, a pet&#x2014;like a person&#x2014;can exert a force of 20 times its body weight if it is not properly restrained. Should another passenger collide with a pet, serious, life-threatening injuries can result to both occupants. Even worse, a dog can be thrown from a vehicle in a collision. For pet safety during their travel in a vehicle, use of a variety of pet containers or harnesses types and designs is known in the prior art. Several of these known pet containers or harnesses comprise familiar, expected and obvious structural configurations, notwithstanding the myriad of designs encompassed by the many of such pet containers or harnesses which have been devised to fulfill numerous objectives and requirements associated with pet travel in a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">While these solutions fulfill their respective, particular objectives and requirements, many known pet restraining container or harness systems fail to disclose a way for easier use in a vehicle for safely securing a pet. More particularly, such known solutions do not enable a safe, secure and comfortable environment for a pet traveling in a vehicle as is otherwise available to human occupants of the vehicle. When the pet is traveling within the vehicle, these known solutions to the pet safety during their travel in a vehicle fail to safely and controllably restrain a pet during a collision or sudden breaking of the vehicle.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The following presents a simplified summary of the present invention in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects thereof. It is neither an exhaustive overview of the invention nor intended to identify key or critical elements of the invention or to delineate its scope. Its sole purpose is to act as a prelude to detailed description set forth later. This invention is directed to overcoming, or at least reducing, the effects of, one or more of the problems set forth above.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a seatbelt harness is provided to restrain a pet such as a dog in a motor vehicle. The vehicle may include a vehicle seat and an associated shoulder lap belt combination seatbelt system that has at least one of a seatbelt connected to a seatbelt webbing lock-release system, a first belt connector connected to the seatbelt, a second belt connector and an anchor that connects to an auto child seat all of which are being provided near or at the vehicle seat. The seatbelt harness may include a restraint portion configured to be worn by the pet on their torso. The seatbelt harness may further include an attachment portion that is coupled or couples to the restraint portion. The attachment portion may have at least one of first and second connectors each of which have a free end. The first connector may be adapted to couple to at least one of the seatbelt or the first belt connector in default positions thereof during a state of non-operating mode. The first connector may connect the attachment portion directly to the seatbelt webbing lock-release system via the seatbelt. The second connector may be adapted to couple to at least one of the second belt connector or the anchor. While the first connector may be configured and arranged at a first predetermined position, the second connector may be configured and arranged at a second predetermined position relative to the first determined position. The first and second predetermined positions may be selected for aligning the first and second connectors with the restraint portion such that the attachment portion to act in conjunction with the restraint portion. This arrangement or configuration may enable positioning of the pet on the vehicle seat at an intermediate point along a longitudinal path between the first belt connector and the second belt connector or between the first belt connector and the anchor.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a kit for a seatbelt harness is provided to restrain a pet such as a dog in a motor vehicle. The vehicle may include a vehicle seat and an associated shoulder/lap belt combination seatbelt system that has at least one of a seatbelt connected to a seatbelt webbing lock-release system, a first belt connector connected to the seatbelt, a second belt connector and an anchor that connects to an auto child seat all of which are being provided near or at the vehicle seat. The seatbelt harness kit may include a restraint portion that may be configured to be worn by the pet on their torso. The seatbelt harness kit may further include an attachment portion that may be configured to be removably coupled to the restraint portion. The attachment portion may have at least one of first and second connectors each of which have a free end. The first connector may be adapted to couple to at least one of the seatbelt or the first belt connector in default positions thereof during a state of non-operating mode. The first connector may connect the attachment portion directly to the seatbelt webbing lock-release system via the seatbelt.

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Generally, a method and apparatus are provided for safely and comfortably restraining a pet within a motor vehicle for their protection during travel according to various embodiments of the present invention. For example, embodiments of seatbelt harnesses are provided for pets such as dogs. These seatbelt harnesses are intended to be used in a motor vehicle by directly connecting them to a vehicle seatbelt system including a seatbelt connected to a seatbelt webbing lock-release system, a buckle, a prong and/or an anchor for attaching an auto child seat. Consistent with one embodiment of the present invention, a seatbelt harness securely, flexibly and controllably restrains a pet for his/her protection during travel in a vehicle. More particularly, a seatbelt harness as a pet travel safety device is provided which a pet may wear while traveling in the vehicle to protect him/her from harm during a collision or sudden maneuvering or sudden braking of the vehicle. It is to be understood that all the embodiments may be used in combination with one or more other embodiments. For instance, a seatbelt harness may include a restraint portion and an attachment portion wherein a harness may be provided to connect a first connector of the attachment portion to the restraint portion in combination with a second connector of the attachment portion which may be directly attached to the restraint portion without a harness. That is, either no harnesses are provided or one or more harnesses are provided in the attachment portion. Likewise, one connector is attached to the harness of the attachment portion or two connectors are attached to it. And one or more such harnesses may be directly attached to the restraint portion or include one connector to couple to another connector of the restraint portion. Accordingly, many permutations and combinations of no or one or more connectors and no or one or more harnesses for coupling the restraint portion to the attachment portion and coupling the attachment portion to the vehicle are provided. The restraint portion may be configured in a form of a vest to be worn on the body of a pet such as on the torso of a dog. The vest may include a male and female connector such as a buckle and a prong or mating Velcro to engage the body of the dog. The harnesses can be adjusted to a desired length when they are present in the seatbelt harness. In some embodiments, connectors directly or fixedly attach to the vest without the use of a harness. The vest may have one or more connectors such as D-rings to attach to harnesses of the attachment portion or directly to connectors of the attachment portion which are provided to attach to either the seatbelt, belt connectors such as a buckle, a prong and/or an anchor. These connectors of the attachment portion may be user-operable buckle type connectors with an open mouth or regular buckles or prongs. For example, to restrain a pet in a motor vehicle a seatbelt harness may include a restraint portion coupled to an attachment portion that may have first and second connectors which may be either fixedly or removably attached to the restraint portion. The first connector may be adapted to attach to a seatbelt or a first belt connector in their default positions and the second connector may be adapted to attach to a second belt connector or an anchor. The first and second connectors may be disposed relative to each other at first and second predetermined positions, respectively. The first and second predetermined positions may be selected for aligning the first and second connectors with the restraint portion such that the attachment portion to act in conjunction with the restraint portion to enable positioning of the pet on a vehicle seat at an intermediate point along a longitudinal path between the first belt connector and the second belt connector or between the first belt connector and the anchor. The first belt connector may be connected to the seatbelt which is generally further connected to the seatbelt webbing lock-release system of the shoulder/lap belt combination seatbelt system. The seatbelt webbing lock-release system may be configured and arranged to lock a given position on the pet upon at least one of a vehicle collision, a sudden braking or deceleration and a sudden maneuvering of the motor vehicle. In use, the restraint portion may have a first distance from the default position of the seatbelt or the default position of the first belt connector and the restraint portion may have a second distance from the free end of the second connector such that the second distance determines the maximum increase allowable to the first distance. Likewise, a kit for such a seatbelt harness may also be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Accordingly, in one embodiment, a seatbelt harness called as a pet travel safety device (k9 Seatbelt&#x2122;) for dogs is designed to protect them from injury during ride in a vehicle by directly attaching the dog to the seat belt webbing lock-release system of a vehicle seatbelt. So this design enables a dog to stand or stretch while providing an unmatched degree of safety in comparison to any competing products sold today in the market. This seatbelt harness attaches the dog to the vehicle seatbelt system to protect the dog just like a vehicle seatbelt protects humans by connecting the dog to a vehicle's seatbelt webbing lock-release system. This seatbelt harness doubles up as a vest having a D-ring which can be connected to a leash for taking the dog for a walk. Its competitive advantage is that the seatbelt harness couples to both a vehicle seatbelt buckle and a vehicle seatbelt prong/tongue or anchor for restraining a dog within a vehicle seat area. This seatbelt harness secures the dog by locking only during collision or sudden braking while staying flexible in otherwise normal travel conditions. The seatbelt harness may be made of two parts, one&#x2014;a restraint vest to go over the torso of the dog and second&#x2014;a harness having two connectors (e.g., a buckle and a prong but instead of the buckle/prong it can be a snap-hook type connector) meant to attach to the vehicle seat buckle and prong. In this embodiment, a lower strap of the harness connects to the vest at the belly of the dog (under or bottom) and an upper strap of the harness connects to the vest at the back of the dog (top). The length of the lower strap gives enough leverage to the dog to stand and move freely. The upper strap connects to the prong or tongue of the vehicle seatbelt which is coupled to the seatbelt webbing lock-release system of the vehicle. This seatbelt harness increases comfort as when the dog is at ease and in the absence of a jerk, break or collision the upper strap can be released as much as the dog wishes (only restricted by the length of the lower strap). This seatbelt harness improves safety since a dog has no problem in standing, stretching or moving but as soon as the jerk or collision happens the vehicle seatbelt webbing lock-release system kicks in and locks the dog's position where it was before the jerk or collision just like how the vehicle seatbelt system locks a vehicle occupant in its position in case of an accident.</p>

The seat belt webbing <b>405</b> may include a first side length <b>436</b> having a first prong <b>444</b> attached thereto and a second side length <b>438</b> having a first buckle <b>450</b> combined with a webbing adjuster <b>420</b> for adjusting and locking the seat belt webbing <b>405</b>. In this way, when the seat belt webbing <b>405</b> is buckled and adjusted snugly across a torso of a pet, the detachable seat belt <b>400</b> may hold the pet safely on a vehicle seat during at least one of a sudden deceleration of the vehicle <b>200</b> or in response to an impact force that the vehicle <b>200</b> to experience in a collision. A suitable webbing and an adjuster including the seat belt webbing <b>405</b> and the webbing adjuster <b>420</b> for the detachable seat belt <b>400</b> is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,088,160, entitled &#x201c;Lap Belt Webbing Adjuster&#x201d; and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Seat belt restraint systems used in vehicles to protect the occupant in the event of sudden decelerations are generally known. In particular, seatbelt webbing adjusters are used in aircraft passenger lap seatbelts. For example, a lap seatbelt, when buckled and adjusted snugly across the waist of the passenger, holds a passenger safely within a seat during sudden decelerations of a vehicle. A typical aircraft passenger lap seatbelt consists of two lengths of seatbelt webbing, each anchored to the seat at one end, one webbing (here selected to be the left side length) having a buckle connector attached to its free end, and the other webbing (here selected to be the right side length) having a combined buckle and webbing adjuster attached to it so that the buckle connector fits into and releasably locks with a buckle to join the two side lengths of webbing together and form the seatbelt.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The webbing adjuster includes a moveable load bar in a base frame. The free end of the right side length of webbing is inserted through a slot in the bottom of the base frame, wound around the load bar, and then passed back through the slot to exit the webbing adjuster. With no tension in the webbing, the webbing adjuster is said to be in the adjustment mode and the length of belt webbing may be adjusted by pulling on the free end of the webbing.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">When heavy loads are suddenly applied to the webbing adjuster, as in deceleration during landing or crash situations, the load bar rotates further counter-clockwise, pinching and joggling the loose webbing around the end of the bar and through a close series of very tight <b>90</b> degree bends, until the webbing is clinched between the notch and the body and web lock occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Other typical configurations and arrangements of seat belt adjusters seen in the prior art and in the marketplace are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,118,208, U.S. Pat. No. 3,576,056, U.S. Pat. No. 4,366,604 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,679,852.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The seatbelt webbing <b>405</b> and the webbing adjuster <b>420</b> may be suitably adapted for use with the detachable seatbelt <b>400</b> for pets. The operation of the webbing adjuster <b>420</b> of for a pet is the same as described above for aircraft passenger webbing adjusters. The webbing adjuster <b>420</b> utilizes a load bar of unique shape which provides a plurality of webbing pressure/friction generating edges which can grab and securely hold the seatbelt webbing <b>405</b> under severe load conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The seat belt webbing <b>405</b> and the webbing adjuster <b>420</b> may better grip the set belt webbing <b>405</b> during normal usage and most importantly during rapid deceleration as in sudden braking or crash conditions. The webbing adjuster <b>420</b> securely grip and lock the set belt webbing <b>405</b> during crash conditions, while at the same time providing for the easy release of the webbing when the webbing adjuster <b>420</b> is moved to its adjustment mode.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it shows the detachable seat belt <b>400</b> including a buckle such as the first buckle <b>450</b> and a buckle connector such as the first prong <b>444</b> joining together the webbing <b>436</b> on one side and webbing <b>438</b> on the other side to form the detachable seat belt <b>400</b>. The buckle <b>450</b> includes a base frame <b>451</b> having side flanges <b>425</b> in which the webbing adjuster <b>420</b> is mounted.

<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, it schematically illustrates a side view, partially in cross-section, of a webbing adjuster assembly in the adjustment mode for lengthening the seat belt webbing <b>405</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, when the buckle <b>450</b> and the webbing adjuster <b>420</b> is rotated to an angle of approximately 50 degree measured between the bottom surface of base frame <b>451</b> and anchor end of webbing <b>438</b>B, tension in anchor end of webbing <b>438</b>B cannot cause load bar <b>422</b> to slide in the direction of bar stop <b>432</b> and thus cannot pinch the free end of the webbing <b>438</b>A. The webbing <b>438</b> can then move freely over load bar <b>422</b> and the webbing adjuster <b>420</b> is said to be in its adjustment mode. Further, pulling on the buckle body <b>450</b> in the adjustment mode causes the free end <b>438</b>A of webbing <b>438</b> to slide into the webbing adjuster <b>420</b> and around load bar <b>422</b> in a counter-clockwise direction, thus increasing the length of the anchored end <b>438</b>B of the web.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, it schematically illustrates a side view, partially in cross-section, of the webbing adjuster assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> for shortening the seat belt webbing <b>405</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, during the shortening adjustment the user pulls on the free end of the webbing <b>438</b>A, causing the webbing to flow through the adjuster. Pulling on the free end of the webbing <b>438</b>A causes the load bar <b>422</b> to slide to the left away from the bar stop <b>432</b>. This prevents excessive loads and wear on the webbing during the shortening adjustment is that the bend angles in the webbing at points I, H, G, and F are of a large radii. These present friction areas which the webbing encounters as it moves in the clockwise direction. Accordingly, the changes in direction for the webbing at those points are slight and prevent the webbing from experiencing high tension loads at those points. As disclosed hereinafter, sharper changes in direction and higher tension loads on the webbing occur at points E, D, C, and A.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a block diagram shows a configuration of a typical seatbelt webbing lock-release system <b>910</b> that is generally provided in a typical motor vehicle for a vehicle seat to restraint a human occupant. The seatbelt webbing lock-release system <b>910</b> is mounted on a vehicle and includes an occupant restraint device <b>901</b> and a typical vehicle's seatbelt system <b>902</b>. The occupant restraint device <b>901</b> (corresponding to a controller) performs a control of timing to activate and expand equipment for restraining an occupant, or occupants, in a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The occupant restraint device <b>901</b> is connected to a driver's seat airbag system <b>911</b> for an occupant seated in a driver's seat, to a front-passenger's seat airbag system <b>912</b> for an occupant seated in a front-passenger's seat, and to a pretensioner <b>913</b>. Upon receiving information to the effect that the occurrence of a collision has been detected by an external collision sensor, the occupant restraint device <b>911</b> expands the driver's seat airbag system <b>911</b> and the front-passenger's seat airbag system <b>912</b>, and activates the pretensioner <b>913</b>, thereby performing a control to restrain the occupants seated in the driver's seat and in the front-passenger's seat. Note that the driver's seat airbag system <b>911</b>, the front-passenger's seat airbag system <b>912</b> and the pretensioner <b>913</b> are collectively referred to also as occupant restraint equipment in this specification.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a schematic view is shown of the vehicle's seatbelt system <b>902</b>. The vehicle's seatbelt system <b>902</b> includes at least one of the seatbelt <b>914</b> connected to the seatbelt webbing lock-release system <b>910</b>, a first belt connector such as the prong or the tongue <b>918</b>, a second belt connector such as the buckle <b>917</b> and an anchor <b>920</b> that connects to an auto child seat to restrain a pet such as a dog or a cat. The anchor <b>920</b> has been mandated to be provided in at least two rear seats of all passenger vehicles sold in U.S. after September 2002. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, in order to prevent an excessive forward movement of an occupant in the event of a vehicle collision, the pretensioner <b>913</b> (seatbelt tensioner <b>913</b>) immediately winds up a typical seatbelt <b>914</b>, and exerts a tensile force on the occupant, and thus the occupant is restrained. The pretensioner <b>913</b> is configured to instantaneously wind up the seatbelt <b>914</b> with an explosive force using an explosive or a spring upon a vehicle collision. In one embodiment, a seatbelt webbing lock-release system <b>910</b><i>a </i>includes the pretensioner <b>913</b> and a motor <b>915</b> to wind-up the seatbelt <b>914</b> or release it during the operation of the vehicle's seatbelt system <b>902</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a perspective view of a prong or tongue and a buckle of the seatbelt <b>914</b> is shown. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, the seatbelt <b>914</b> is worn in such a manner that the seatbelt <b>914</b> is drawn out from a retractor (not shown) which is fixed to a lower portion of a pillar <b>916</b> on a body side, or the like; a prong or tongue <b>918</b> is mechanically inserted into a buckle <b>917</b> on the body side and fixed thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The vehicle's seatbelt system <b>902</b> in the seatbelt webbing lock-release system <b>910</b> includes the seatbelt <b>914</b>. Further, the vehicle's seatbelt system <b>902</b> is connected to a unit (corresponding to a first sensor unit) for detecting a state of wearing the seatbelt <b>914</b> which is worn by an occupant seated in the driver's seat or in the front-passenger's seat. Specifically, the vehicle's seatbelt system <b>902</b> is connected to a switch <b>919</b> serving as the first sensor unit for detecting whether or not the prong or tongue <b>918</b> of the seatbelt <b>914</b> is connected to the buckle <b>917</b>. When the prong or tongue <b>918</b> is inserted into the buckle <b>917</b> and fixed thereto, a connection signal is sent from the switch <b>919</b>, as the first sensor unit, to the vehicle's seatbelt system <b>902</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In addition, the seatbelt webbing lock-release system <b>910</b> is applied to a vehicle including a pre-crash seatbelt system. Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, at the lower portion of the pillar <b>916</b>, the pretensioner <b>913</b> and the motor <b>915</b> that is included in the pre-crash seatbelt system are provided. Further, the seatbelt <b>914</b> is connected to both the pretensioner <b>913</b> and the motor <b>915</b>. The pre-crash seatbelt system is a system of winding up the seatbelt <b>914</b> with the motor <b>915</b> to restrain an occupant before a vehicle collision.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a typical graph shows a time history of acceleration G of a typical vehicle upon a collision. When the vehicle collides against an obstacle in front, acceleration G as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is generated in the vehicle. This acceleration G can be detected by an acceleration sensor or the like. At this event, if an occupant is not wearing the seatbelt, the body of the occupant is moved toward the front of the vehicle due to the collision, and therefore there is a strong possibility that the occupant strikes his/her head and chest on a steering wheel and/or a windshield. However, if an occupant is wearing the seatbelt, the occupant is restrained to some extent by the pre-crash seatbelt system before a collision. Upon the collision, the pretensioner <b>913</b> is activated and instantaneously winds up the seatbelt <b>914</b>, thereby firmly restraining the occupant. Accordingly, there is less possibility that the occupant strikes his/her head and chest on the steering wheel and/or the windshield.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Here, in the case of the occupant not wearing the seatbelt, since the occupant is considerably moved toward the front of the vehicle upon the collision, it is necessary to start expansion time of the airbag system as soon as possible after the collision. However, in the case of the occupant wearing the seatbelt, the occupant is restrained by the seatbelt before the collision. Accordingly, even if the expansion time of the airbag system is delayed in comparison with the case of the occupant not wearing the seatbelt, the occupant can be properly protected by the airbag system and can be prevented from colliding against the interior equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Here, in this specification, the state of wearing the seatbelt <b>914</b> is a state where the prong or tongue <b>918</b> of the seatbelt <b>914</b> is inserted into the buckle <b>917</b> and fixed thereto, that is, a state where an occupant wears the seatbelt <b>914</b>. The state of not wearing the seatbelt <b>914</b> is a state for a non-operating mode. In this state, the prong or tongue <b>918</b> of the seatbelt <b>914</b> is not inserted into the buckle <b>917</b> and both of these are at their default positions. Also the seatbelt <b>914</b> is also in a default position in this state, i.e., not being not used for its intended purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a schematic view shows a seatbelt harness <b>1000</b>(<b>1</b>) according to one embodiment of the present invention.

<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In particular, in one embodiment of the present invention, the first and second predetermined positions <b>1017</b><i>a</i>, <b>1017</b><i>b </i>may be selected for aligning the first and second connectors <b>1015</b>, <b>1020</b> with the restraint portion <b>1005</b> such that the attachment portion <b>1010</b> to act in conjunction with the restraint portion <b>1005</b> to enable positioning of the given pet on the vehicle seat at a desired intermediate point <b>1022</b> along a longitudinal path <b>1027</b> between the first belt connector <b>918</b><i>a </i>and the second belt connector <b>917</b><i>a </i>or between the first belt connector <b>918</b><i>a </i>and the anchor <b>920</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">One example of the desired intermediate point <b>1022</b> may be near or at a middle of a length of the longitudinal path <b>1027</b>.

<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Consistent with one embodiment, the first and second predetermined positions <b>1017</b><i>a</i>, <b>1017</b><i>b </i>may be selected to align the first and second connectors <b>1015</b>, <b>1020</b> with respect to the restraint portion <b>1005</b> such that, in use, a pet standing on a vehicle seat would be approximately situated in a state which is about perpendicular to the longitudinal path <b>1027</b>. In this way, the restraint portion <b>1005</b> when coupled to the first and second belt connectors <b>918</b><i>a</i>, <b>917</b><i>a </i>via the first and second connectors <b>1015</b>, <b>1020</b> respectively of the attachment portion <b>1010</b>, positions the pet about the middle of a movable link which gets formed between the first and second belt connectors <b>918</b><i>a</i>, <b>917</b><i>a </i>when the seatbelt harness <b>1000</b>(<b>1</b>) is attached thereto. Accordingly, the above configuration of the restraint and attachment portions <b>1005</b>, <b>1010</b> of the seatbelt harness <b>1000</b>(<b>1</b>) enables it to be directly connected to the seatbelt webbing lock-release system <b>910</b><i>a </i>via the seatbelt <b>914</b><i>a</i>. Since the seatbelt webbing lock-release system <b>910</b><i>a </i>remains free to operate in its intended manner should the seatbelt <b>914</b><i>a </i>was to be used for protection by a human occupant sitting on the vehicle seat, the pet is provided with almost the same safety as the occupant. Moreover, the pet also simultaneously has an ability to sit, stand, move, and/or stretch with ease without sacrificing any safety.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the first belt connector <b>918</b><i>a </i>is fixedly connected to the seatbelt <b>914</b><i>a </i>which is further connected to the seatbelt webbing lock-release system <b>910</b><i>a </i>of the vehicle's seatbelt system <b>902</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) such as a shoulder/lap belt combination seatbelt system. The seatbelt webbing lock-release system <b>910</b><i>a </i>is generally configured and arranged to lock a given position on the pet upon at least one of a vehicle collision, a sudden braking or deceleration and a sudden maneuvering of the motor vehicle. By limiting a distance that a pet can go from the default position of the seatbelt <b>914</b><i>a </i>or the default position of the first belt connector <b>918</b><i>a </i>when the pet is wearing the seatbelt harness <b>1000</b>(<b>1</b>) it protects the pet as he/she avoids hitting the interior of the vehicle or the driver/any passengers in the vehicle with a significant force. The occupants of the vehicle are also protected from being getting injured by avoiding the pet hitting them with a sufficient force or by avoiding any impact at all from the pet since the pet gets locked in his/her position by the action of the seatbelt webbing lock-release system <b>910</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) in response to a collision, sudden braking/deceleration or sudden maneuvering of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">According to any one of the disclosed embodiments of the present invention, the first predetermined position <b>1017</b><i>a </i>may be a point such as a point <b>2030</b> on the restraint portion <b>1005</b> of the seatbelt harness <b>1000</b>(<b>1</b>). Likewise, the second predetermined position <b>1017</b><i>b </i>may be a point such as a point <b>2035</b> on the restraint portion <b>1005</b> of the seatbelt harness <b>1000</b>(<b>1</b>). The positions of these points <b>2030</b>, <b>2035</b> can be at any suitable place on the restraint portion <b>1005</b>. For example, the points <b>2030</b>, <b>2035</b> may be located, as shown, on distal ends of the second and first vest portions <b>1080</b>, <b>1075</b>, respectively. Otherwise the points <b>2030</b> and <b>2035</b> can be offset from the distal ends of the restraint portion <b>1005</b>, e.g., at about the middle of the lengths of the first and second vest portions <b>1080</b>, <b>1075</b>, respectively. The first and second connectors <b>1015</b>, <b>1020</b> may be directly and fixedly connected to the restraint portion <b>1005</b> at the points <b>2030</b> and <b>2035</b>, respectively. Otherwise, via the use of the first and second harnesses <b>1040</b>, <b>1055</b>, the first and second connectors <b>1015</b>, <b>1020</b> may be connected at locations away from the points <b>2030</b>, <b>2035</b> based on a desired application or either alone or in combination of one or more of dimensions, weight, height, breed of the pet, e.g., a dog.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The restraint portion <b>1005</b>, in use, may have a first distance <b>1030</b><i>a </i>or <b>1030</b><i>b </i>from the default position of the seatbelt <b>914</b><i>a </i>or the default position of the first belt connector <b>918</b><i>a</i>, respectively. Likewise, the second connector <b>1020</b> may be adapted to couple to at least one of the second belt connector <b>917</b><i>a </i>such as a buckle or the anchor <b>920</b><i>a </i>such that, in use, the restraint portion <b>1005</b> has a second distance <b>1035</b> from the free end <b>1025</b><i>b </i>of the second connector <b>1020</b>. In operation, it is the second distance <b>1035</b> that determines the maximum increase allowable to the first distance <b>1030</b><i>a </i>or <b>1030</b><i>b </i>because the second distance <b>1035</b> remains fixed due to the non-movable nature of the second belt connector <b>917</b><i>a </i>and the anchor <b>920</b><i>a </i>but the first distance <b>1030</b><i>a</i>, <b>1030</b><i>b </i>can vary (increase or decrease) depending upon the extent to which the seatbelt <b>914</b><i>a </i>can be pulled out from the seatbelt webbing lock-release system <b>910</b><i>a</i>. In this way, the seatbelt harness <b>1000</b>(<b>1</b>) may be configured and arranged such that the second distance <b>1035</b> controls how much the first distance <b>1030</b><i>a </i>or <b>1030</b><i>b </i>can be at the most.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In other words, due to the above structure and functionality of the seatbelt harness <b>1000</b>(<b>1</b>) having the given arrangement or configuration of the restraint portion <b>1005</b> and the attachment portion <b>1010</b> relative to various components of the vehicle's seatbelt system <b>902</b><i>a </i>including the seatbelt <b>914</b><i>a</i>, the first belt connector <b>918</b><i>a</i>, the second belt connector <b>917</b><i>a </i>or the anchor <b>920</b><i>a </i>and the seatbelt webbing lock and release system <b>910</b><i>a</i>, the second distance <b>1035</b> is in a position to stop the first distance <b>1030</b><i>a </i>or <b>1030</b><i>b </i>from increasing any further than allowed by, e.g., the length of second harness <b>1055</b>. By limiting the first distance <b>1030</b><i>a </i>or <b>1030</b><i>b</i>, the restraint portion <b>1005</b> cannot go too far from the default position of the seatbelt <b>914</b><i>a </i>or the default position of the first belt connector <b>918</b><i>a </i>when the pet is wearing the seatbelt harness <b>1000</b>(<b>1</b>). This protects the pet as he/she avoids hitting the interior of the vehicle or the driver/any passengers in the vehicle with a significant force. The occupants of the vehicle are also protected from being getting injured by avoiding the pet hitting them with a sufficient force or by avoiding any impact at all from the pet since the pet gets locked in his/her position by the action of the vehicle's seatbelt system <b>902</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) in response to a collision, sudden braking/deceleration or sudden maneuvering of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">According to one embodiment of the present invention, the attachment portion <b>1010</b> of the seatbelt harness <b>1000</b>(<b>1</b>) may further include a first harness <b>1040</b> having first and second harness ends. Another example of the first connector <b>1015</b> may be a regular buckle, e.g., a vehicle seatbelt buckle. The first harness <b>1040</b> may include a strap whose length can be adjusted and which can be made of a vehicle seatbelt webbing material. The first harness <b>1040</b> may be disposed between the restraint portion <b>1005</b> and the first connector <b>1015</b> such that the first harness end of the first harness <b>1040</b> is coupled or couples to the restraint portion <b>1005</b> and the second harness end of the first harness <b>1040</b> is coupled to the first connector <b>1015</b>. Likewise, one example of the first connector <b>1015</b> may be a user-operable buckle type connector with an open mouth to latch onto an object and it may be made of materials those are generally used to manufacture a vehicle seatbelt buckle.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The first connector <b>1015</b> may be made capable of connecting either directly to the seatbelt <b>914</b><i>a </i>or the first belt connector <b>918</b><i>a </i>when these are in their default positions, i.e., in a state of non-operating mode or when they are not in use, e.g., the first belt connector <b>918</b><i>a </i>is not being coupled to or inserted into the second belt connector <b>917</b><i>a</i>. That is, the seatbelt <b>914</b><i>a </i>is in a state that it can be released freely such that when the restraint portion <b>1005</b> is connected to it the seatbelt harness <b>1000</b>(<b>1</b>) can move horizontally or vertically without any significant resistance. This flexibility enables the pet such as dog to easily stand, stretch and/or move, providing a comfortable ride to him/her.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As explained above, when the restraint portion <b>1005</b> is attached to the second belt connector <b>917</b><i>a </i>via the second connector <b>1020</b> of the attachment portion <b>1010</b>, the second distance <b>1035</b> limits the first distance <b>1030</b><i>a </i>or <b>1030</b><i>b </i>in terms of how far the restraint portion <b>1005</b> can go away from default positions of the seatbelt <b>914</b><i>a </i>or the first belt connector <b>918</b><i>a</i>. In other words, a connection point between the second connector <b>1020</b> and the second belt connector or the anchor <b>920</b><i>a </i>functions as a pivot point for the seatbelt harness <b>1000</b>(<b>1</b>). By restricting the range of travel/movement of the pet, the safety of the pet is enhanced since the chance that he/she can harm themselves by hitting something are minimized while in normal conditions of travel the pet remains quite free to stand, stretch and/or move around the vehicle seat to which they are attached with the seatbelt harness <b>1000</b>(<b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Consistent with one embodiment of the present invention, the restraint portion <b>1005</b> of the seatbelt harness <b>1000</b>(<b>1</b>) may further include a first vest portion <b>1075</b>. One example of the first vest portion <b>1075</b> is a pad shaped and configured to hug the chest of the pet when it is worn on the torso of the pet. Likewise, the restraint portion <b>1005</b> may further include a second vest portion <b>1080</b>. For example, the second vest portion <b>1080</b> may be a pad shaped and configured to hug the back of the pet when it is worn on the torso of the pet. The first vest portion <b>1075</b> may include a plurality of length adjustable straps <b>1085</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>4</b>) each having a corresponding prong <b>1090</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>4</b>) attached thereto at their free ends. Likewise, the second vest portion <b>1080</b> may include a plurality of mating buckles <b>1095</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>4</b>) attached thereto for the corresponding prongs <b>1090</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>4</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Alternatively, in one another embodiment of the restraint portion <b>1005</b>, instead of having buckles <b>1095</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>4</b>) and prongs <b>1090</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>4</b>) the first and second vest portions <b>1075</b>, <b>1080</b> may be in one piece or at least two pieces where either the one piece has mating Velcros or two pieces include one of the opposing form of the mating Velcros, respectively. Similarly, instead of Velcro other types of fasteners can be used to provide a vest format to the restraint portion <b>1005</b>. One in the skilled in the pertinent art would recognize that any form, shape, material suitable to function as a vest can be deployed and all such variations are contemplated to be as different embodiments of the restraint portion <b>1005</b> as described herein according to the present invention. For example, in one another embodiment, in the restraint portion <b>1005</b> the first vest portion <b>1070</b> may include the buckles <b>1095</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>4</b>) and the second vest portion <b>1080</b> may include the prongs <b>1090</b>(<b>1</b>-<b>4</b>).</p>

The fourth connector <b>1050</b> may be configured to removably couple to the third connector <b>1045</b>. An example of the third connector <b>1045</b> is a D-ring which can be made of metal and may be fixedly attached to the second vest portion <b>1080</b> of the restraint portion <b>1005</b> at the point <b>2030</b>. Likewise, one example of the fourth connector <b>1050</b> is a spring link which can be made of metal. In this case, the first distance <b>1030</b><i>a</i>, <b>1030</b><i>b </i>may be the distance between the point <b>2030</b> and the seatbelt <b>914</b><i>a </i>or the first belt connector <b>918</b><i>a</i>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the attachment portion <b>1010</b> of the seatbelt harness <b>1000</b>(<b>1</b>) may further include a second harness <b>1055</b> having first and second harness ends.
