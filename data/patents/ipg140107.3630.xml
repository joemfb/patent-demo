<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE DESCRIBED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The described embodiments generally relate to portable electronic devices. More particularly, the present embodiments describe use of multiple sensors in combination to confirm a status of an accessory device in relation to an electronic device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Recent advances in portable computing includes the introduction of hand held electronic devices and computing platforms along the lines of the iPad&#x2122; tablet manufactured by Apple Inc. of Cupertino, Calif. These handheld computing devices can be configured such that a substantial portion of the electronic device takes the form of a display used for presenting visual content leaving little available space for an attachment mechanism that can be used for attaching an accessory device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When the accessory device takes the form of a cover, the handheld computing device can be operable in modes consistent with the presence of the cover. For example, when the handheld computing device has a display, the presence of the cover can render the display unviewable. In order to save power, the unviewable display can be rendered temporarily inoperable until the cover is moved or otherwise repositioned to expose the display.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, accurate and reliable techniques for determining a current status of an accessory device in relation to an electronic device to which it is connected are desired.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DESCRIBED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">This paper describes various embodiments that relate to a system, method, and apparatus for releasably attaching an accessory to an electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A consumer electronic product includes at least an electronic device. In the described embodiment, the electronic device includes at least a processor and a first sensor in communication with the processor arranged to detect a first type stimulus. The first sensor responds to the first type stimulus by providing a first signal to the processor indicating a first status of an accessory device in relation to the electronic device. The electronic device also includes at least a second sensor in communication with the processor arranged to detect a second type stimulus. The second sensor responds to the second type stimulus by providing a second signal to the processor indicating a second status of the accessory device in relation to the electronic device. In the described embodiment, when the processor receives the first signal from the first sensor, the processor compares the first status indicated by the first signal and the second status indicated by the second signal and when the processor determines that the indications of the first and second status are the same, the processor accepts the first signal, otherwise, the processor ignores the first signal.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect of the described embodiment, the accessory device is a protective cover having a flap incorporating a magnetic element and the first sensor is a Hall Effect (HFX) sensor. The protective cover is pivotally attached to the electronic device such that in a closed configuration the magnetic element in the flap provides a first stimulus in the form of a saturating magnetic field that is detected by the HFX sensor only when the flap is in a closed configuration with respect to the electronic device. The second sensor is any of at least an ambient light sensor, a camera, a magnetometer, a multi-touch sensitive surface, an RFID device, and a second Hall Effect sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment, a consumer electronic product includes at least an electronic device and an accessory unit. In the described embodiment, the electronic product includes a processor, a Hall Effect sensor (HFX) in communication with the processor arranged to detect a saturating magnetic field and in response to the detected saturating magnetic field, provide a signal to the processor where the processor uses the signal to alter an operating state of the electronic device. The electronic device also includes a second sensor separate and distinct from the HFX sensor. The accessory unit includes a body portion pivotally attachable to the electronic device having at least a magnetic element. When the accessory unit is in a closed configuration, an inner surface of the body portion is placed in proximity to the protective top layer such that the magnetic element presents the saturating magnetic field to the HFX sensor. When the processor receives the signal from the HFX sensor indicating the presence of the saturating magnetic field, the processor queries the second sensor to corroborate the signal received from the HFX sensor is consistent with the cover being in the closed configuration, the processor accepts the signal from the HFX sensor, otherwise the processor ignores the signal from the HFX sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In yet another embodiment, in a consumer electronic product that includes an electronic device, a method performed by a processor in the electronic device is described. The method can be carried out by performing at least the following operations: detecting a first type stimulus at a first sensor in communication with the processor, receiving a first signal from the first sensor at the processor, the first signal indicating a first status of an accessory device in relation to the electronic device, detecting a second type stimulus at a second sensor in communication with the processor, receiving a second signal from the second sensor at the processor, the second signal indicating a second status of the accessory device in relation to the electronic device, comparing the indication of the first status and the indication of the second status by the processor, and accepting the first signal by the processor only when the comparing determines that the indications of that the first and second status are the same.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another embodiment, non-transitory computer readable medium for storing program code executable by a processor for detecting a state of a protective cover in relation to an electronic device having a processor and at least a first sensor and a second sensor is described. The computer readable medium includes at least computer code for receiving a signal from the first sensor indicating that the protective cover is in a closed configuration with respect to the electronic device, computer code for querying the second sensor, computer code for receiving information from the second sensor, and computer code for ignoring the signal from the first sensor when the information from the second sensor does not corroborate the signal from the first sensor; otherwise, accepting the signal from the first sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one aspect of the described embodiment, the protective cover includes a flap incorporating a magnetic element and the first sensor is a Hall Effect sensor. The protective cover is pivotally attached to the electronic device such that in a closed configuration the magnetic element in the flap provides a first stimulus in the form of a saturating magnetic field that is detected by the HFX sensor only when the flap is in a closed configuration with respect to the electronic device. The second sensor is any of at least an ambient light sensor, a camera, a magnetometer, a multi-touch sensitive surface, an RFID device, and a second Hall Effect sensor.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SELECTED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Reference will now be made in detail to representative embodiments illustrated in the accompanying drawings. It should be understood that the following descriptions are not intended to limit the embodiments to one preferred embodiment. To the contrary, it is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as can be included within the spirit and scope of the described embodiments as defined by the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The following description relates in general to a mechanism that can be used to confirm a status of an accessory device in relation to an associated host device having operating states consistent with the accessory device status. More specifically, when the accessory device is a protective cover having a size and shape in accordance with the electronic device, the protective cover can have a hinge portion and flap pivotally attached to the hinge portion. The flap can rotate about the hinge portion in one direction to bring the flap in substantial contact with the electronic device in a closed configuration. Conversely, the flap can pivot about the hinge assembly in the other direction to expose the electronic device in an open configuration. In one embodiment, the electronic device can operate in a closed cover mode when the protective cover is detected to be in the closed configuration and an open cover mode when the cover is detected to be in the open configuration. The protective cover can provide protection to certain aspects (such as a display) of the electronic device while enhancing the overall look and feel of the electronic device. The protective cover can include at least a hinge portion. The hinge portion can be magnetically attached to the electronic device using a magnetic attachment feature. The hinge portion can be pivotally connected to a flap that can be placed upon a portion of the electronic device to be protected. The protective cover can include electronic circuits or other elements (passive or active) that can cooperate with electronic elements in the electronic device. As part of that cooperation, signals can be passed between the protective cover and the electronic device that can, for example, be used to modify operations of the electronic device, operations of electronic circuits or elements of the protective cover, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The electronic device can include a magnetometer circuit that can be used to detect the directional magnitude of an external magnetic field. In this regard, the magnetometer can function as a compass arranged to indicate a directional bearing and magnitude of an external magnetic field. In this way, the directional heading of the electronic device in relation to the external magnetic field can be deduced. For example, when the external magnetic field is essentially the Earth's magnetic field, the onboard compass can provide an indication of the directional bearing of the electronic device in relation to the magnetic pole of the Earth. In one embodiment, the protective cover includes a flap having magnetic elements. The magnetic elements can include magnetic elements used for magnetic attachment and magnetic elements used to trigger a Hall Effect (HFX) sensor in the electronic device. In this situation, the onboard compass can be used to detect the presence of the flap based upon the effect of the magnetic elements on the onboard compass.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">For example, the onboard compass can detect that the flap is magnetically attached to the electronic device based upon a first static magnetic deviation, also referred to as a hard magnetic offset. The first static magnetic deviation can be based upon the presence of magnetic elements included in the flap of the protective cover used to trigger the HFX sensor as well as magnetic elements used to magnetically attach the flap and the electronic device. In another embodiment, the compass can detect a dynamic magnetic displacement in accordance with movement of the magnetic elements in the flap as the flap rotates about the pivot axis of the hinge assembly. The dynamic magnetic displacement can be used to determine if the flap is in motion relative to the onboard compass. In one embodiment, the relative displacement of the flap and the electronic device can be deduced from data received in real time from an accelerometer and gyroscope. The data from the accelerometer and gyroscope can be related to the spatial orientation of the electronic device. The spatial orientation data and magnetic readings from the onboard compass can be used to determine if the magnetic elements in the flap are moving in relation to the electronic device providing an indication that the flap is rotating about the pivot line of the hinge assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one embodiment, the electronic device can have a touch sensitive surface that can react to a plurality of conductive elements incorporated into the protective cover near an inner layer of the protective cover. The plurality of conductive elements can be grounded when the protective cover is magnetically attached to the electronic device. In one embodiment, the conductive elements can be arranged in a pre-determined and therefore recognizable pattern. In this way, when an inner layer of the protective cover includes elements capable of interacting with the touch sensitive surface, the elements can be arranged in a pre-determined pattern in order to assist the electronic device in detecting the current position of the protective cover. For example, in one embodiment, the touch sensitive surface can be capacitive in nature in which case the embedded elements in the protective cover can be formed of conductive material such as metal along the lines of aluminum. The conductive elements can be grounded in order to increase a capacitive signal to noise ratio of the signal generated by the interaction between capacitive touch sensitive surface and the capacitive embedded elements.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The magnetic elements in the flap portion can interact with a magnetically sensitive circuit incorporated into the electronic device. The magnetically sensitive circuit can in one embodiment take the form of the HFX sensor that can detect the presence of an extrinsic magnetic field provided by the magnetic element in the protective cover. It should be noted, however, that in order to trigger the HFX sensor, the detected magnetic field must saturate the HFX sensor. In this way, the likelihood that the HFX sensor provides a false indication that the protective cover is enclosing the electronic device is greatly reduced. For example, the relatively weak magnetic field strength associated with the Earth's magnetic field is insufficient to saturate the HFX sensor thereby triggering a false indication of the protective cover status.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">When the HFX sensor is exposed to a saturating magnetic field (i.e., one of sufficient magnetic strength to saturate the HFX sensor), the HFX sensor can respond to the saturating magnetic field by generating a binary (i.e., ON/OFF) signal. One of the advantages of using the HFX sensor (in addition to reducing the likelihood of a false cover status indication) is that the amount of power required to operate the HFX sensor is relatively small and therefore does not present an undue power drain on the electronic device. In any case, when the HFX sensor is exposed to the saturating magnetic field, the HFX sensor can issue a signal. The signal can be received by a processing unit and used to alter an operating state of the electronic device. It should be noted, however, that any appropriate sensing device in addition to or in place of the HFX sensor can be used to detect the status of the protective cover in relation to the electronic device. For example, a magnetometer (a form of which can be used as a compass) can be used in lieu of the HFX sensor. In contrast to the HFX sensor, the magnetometer is substantially more sensitive to an extrinsic magnetic field and will respond accordingly by providing a more continuous (analog) signal representative of the extrinsic magnetic field requiring a greater amount of power. Accordingly, dynamic magnetic activity can be detected by the magnetometer (indicative of, for example, relative motions of the magnetometer and a magnetic source) by periodically sampling the signal from the magnetometer. The sampled data can be used, for example, to provide a relative position of the magnetic elements in the protective cover in relation to the magnetometer in the electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Accordingly, the protective cover can include a magnetic element such as a permanent magnet having a magnetic field that can cause the HFX sensor to generate the signal. The magnetic element can be positioned on the protective cover in a location that triggers the HFX sensor to generate the signal when the cover is placed on or in proximity to a surface of the electronic device. The signal can indicate that the protective cover is in a predetermined position relative to the electronic device that can result in a change in an operating state of the electronic device. For example, with the portion of the protective cover having the magnetic element in proximity to the HFX sensor, the magnetic field from the magnetic element can cause the HFX sensor to generate a signal. The signal can, in turn, be used to alter the operating state to one consistent with a portion of the electronic device being covered. For example, when the electronic device includes a display, the protective cover can be used to cover the display and therefore render it unviewable and therefore the display can be disabled. On the other hand, when the portion of the protective cover having the magnetic element is removed to the point where the HFX sensor no longer responds to the magnetic field of the magnetic element, then the HFX sensor can generate another signal. The other signal can result in the electronic device entering another, different, operating state consistent with at least a portion of the display being uncovered and viewable and therefore enabled for displaying visual content.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">However, the HFX sensor can be triggered by any magnetic field strong enough to saturate the HFX sensor thereby potentially providing a false indication of the presence of the protective cover. Therefore in order to avoid such false indications, when the HFX sensor is triggered, additional sensors can be queried in order to confirm that indication provided by the HFX sensor that the protective cover is in the closed configuration. In one embodiment, a triggering event at the HFX sensor indicating that the cover is in the closed configuration can also cause the electronic device to query at least another sensor in order to confirm the closed configuration indicated by the HFX sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one embodiment, an ambient light sensor (ALS) can be queried by the electronic device. The ALS can include a photosensitive circuit (such as a photodiode) that can respond to varying levels of incident light, typically in the form of ambient light. In one embodiment, the ALS can detect ambient light. The ALS can, however, be configured to respond to the detection of the ambient light in many ways. For example, the ALS can respond by providing a signal whenever the photosensitive circuit within the ALS detects an amount (i.e., intensity) of ambient light greater than a pre-defined amount of ambient light. In other words, the threshold amount of ambient light can be a defined threshold level. For example, a threshold amount of &#x201c;x&#x201d; lumens can represent an amount of ambient light consistent with the protective cover being in a closed configuration where the value &#x201c;x&#x201d; takes into account light leaking in from around the edges of the protective cover. Of course, the threshold amount of ambient light can be set to any amount deemed appropriate. For example, in some cases where the electronic device is in bright environment such as daylight, the amount of light leakage can be much higher than would be expected in darker conditions. Therefore, the amount of light leaking around the edges of the protective cover can be substantially greater and therefore, the threshold amount of light consistent with the protective cover being in the closed configuration can increased to take this fact into account.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In another embodiment, the threshold amount can be consistent with a differential change in ambient light detected by the photosensitive circuit in the ALS. For example, in those situations where electronic device is in a bright environment (such as outdoors in daylight), there can be substantial amount of light leakage when the protective cover is in fact closed. However, in order to reduce uncertainties related to just how much light leakage there really is, the ALS can be configured to provide a signal based upon a differential change in the amount of light detected by the photosensitive circuit within the ALS. For example, when the protective cover is open, the ALS can detect an amount of light represented by &#x201c;y<sub>1</sub>&#x201d; lumens. However, when the protective cover is closed, the amount of light detected by the photosensitive circuit in the ALS can change from &#x201c;y<sub>1</sub>&#x201d; to &#x201c;y<sub>2</sub>&#x201d; lumens. Only in those situations where the difference in the amount of light detected (i.e., &#x394;y=abs (y<sub>1</sub>&#x2212;y<sub>2</sub>)) is greater than a predetermined value, will the ALS provide the appropriate signal indicating that the protective cover is in the closed configuration. The advantage to this approach lies in the fact that light leakage values are difficult to deduce and therefore by relying upon a well-defined change in detected ambient light a more accurate and robust indication of the status of the protective cover in relation to the electronic device can be forthcoming.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Therefore, by using the ALS, the electronic device can corroborate the indication of the status of the protective cover provided by the HFX sensor. In this way, if the ALS corroborates the indication from the HFX sensor by detecting an amount of ambient light consistent with the protective cover being in the closed configuration, the electronic device can accept the indication from the HFX sensor and alter the operating state of the electronic device accordingly. However, if the amount of ambient light is not consistent with the signal from the HFX sensor indicating that the protective cover is in the closed, configuration, the electronic device can query another sensor in order to obtain yet another data point to be used in evaluating the signal from the HFX sensor or more simply can ignore the indication from the HFX sensor altogether thereby presuming that the cover is not fully covering the electronic device and therefore the operating state of the electronic device will not be altered to one consistent with the electronic device being fully covered. If, however, the ALS detects an amount of light that corroborates the indication from the Hall Effect, then the electronic device can accept the indication from the HFX sensor that the protective cover is in the closed configuration and can thereby respond accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In another embodiment, a camera can be activated and based upon a type of image captured by the camera, can be used to corroborate the indication provided by the HFX sensor that the cover is closed. For example, when the cover is closed, the camera can capture an image that is essentially black (or very low luminance value). However, if the electronic device is located within dark environment such as a dark room, outdoors at night with little or no moonlight or other external light sources, and so on, what little external illumination there is (such as from the display) can provide sufficient illumination (on the end user's face for example) for the camera to capture an image. In one embodiment, the captured image can be characterized for an overall luminance value or luminance histogram which can be used to determine if the cover is fully closed or partially closed. For example, even with the cover fully closed, there may be some light leakage that can be captured by the camera resulting in a low luminance captured image. However, in another embodiment, the camera can be adjusted in such a way the unless there is sufficient light on the image capture device within the camera, there will be no image registered by the camera based upon, for example, a defined specification for light leakage. If, however, an image is captured by the camera, by evaluating the overall luminance value of the captured image (less than a threshold luminance value for example), the position of the protective cover can be estimated and used to corroborate (or not) the indication from the HFX sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In another embodiment, a magnetometer in the form of an onboard compass can be used to detect the presence of a hard magnetic offset consistent with the magnetic element embedded in the protective cover in place at or near the HFX sensor. In this embodiment, the presence of the hard magnetic offset can be used to confirm the indication from the HFX sensor of the closed cover state. On the other hand, the absence of the hard magnetic offset can be used by the electronic device to decide that the indication from the HFX sensor is not accurate with regards to the state of the protective cover and can therefore be ignored, or other actions such as querying another sensor can be undertaken.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">It should also be noted that magnetic materials included in the protective cover can affect the performance of the magnetometer such as the onboard compass. In particular, the basic operations of the onboard compass (embodied as instructions executable by a processor or other appropriate circuit) can be altered by the presence of the magnetic materials in the protective cover. In particular, the motion of the protective cover can be detected by the onboard compass as a change in magnetic field strength and direction that can result in an &#x201c;error&#x201d; since the onboard compass will experience a dynamic offset based upon the positional change in the protective cover. For example, when the cover is going from the open to closed configuration, the dynamic offset at the onboard compass can increase due to the fact that the magnetic elements within the protective cover are moving closer to the magnetometer and are therefore inducing a greater offset value in the readings of the onboard compass (of course, just the opposite occurs when the cover status changes from closed to open).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The maximum offset, or differential in compass heading, experienced by the onboard compass that can be induced by the change in position of the magnetic element in the protective cover is a function of the change in the magnitude of the magnetic field as seen by the magnetic sensor associated with the onboard compass when the position of the protective cover changes as well as the horizontal strength of the external magnetic field. In order to compensate for the offset induced by the motion of the protective cover (more specifically the magnetic elements in the protective cover), the onboard compass can utilize a model of the maximum change in magnetic field magnitude that the onboard compass can detect as a function of change in cover position. In this way, by using both the model of the maximum change in magnetic field magnitude as a function of cover position and a current estimate of the magnitude of the horizontal component of the external magnetic field, the electronic device can estimate a maximum change in compass heading likely to be induced by the relative change in position of the protective cover in relation to the electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Accordingly, an accelerometer and gyroscope incorporated within the electronic device can be used in conjunction with the compass to evaluate a dynamic magnetic signature of changes in detected external magnetic field. The accelerometer and gyroscope can provide, in real time, the spatial position and rotation of the electronic device and the compass can provide an indication, again in real time, of changes in external magnetic field. The readings from the accelerometer and gyroscope and the compass can be used together and compared to a model of the motion of the magnetic elements in relation to the electronic device and, in turn, be used to evaluate the likelihood that the cover is present and moving in relation to the electronic device (by way of the compass).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">These and other embodiments are discussed below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-15</figref>. However, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the detailed description given herein with respect to these figures is for explanatory purposes only and should not be construed as limiting. For the remainder of this discussion, a first and second object each suitably configured to magnetically attach to each other in accordance with the described embodiments will be described. It should be noted, however, that any number and type of suitably configured objects can be magnetically attached to each other in a precise and repeatable manner. In particular, for simplicity and clarity, for the remainder of this discussion, the first object is presumed to take the form of an electronic device and in particular a handheld electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The electronic device can take many forms. For the remainder of this discussion, the electronic device is described in terms of a handheld portable computing device. Accordingly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a top perspective view of electronic device <b>10</b> in accordance with the described embodiments. Electronic device <b>10</b> can process data and more particularly media data such as audio, visual, images, etc. By way of example, electronic device <b>10</b> can generally correspond to a device that can perform as a smart phone, a music player, a game player, a visual player, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a tablet computer and the like. Electronic device <b>10</b> can also be hand held. With regards to being handheld, electronic device <b>10</b> can be held in one hand while being operated by the other hand (i.e., no reference surface such as a desktop is needed). Hence, electronic device <b>10</b> can be held in one hand while operational input commands can be provided by the other hand. The operational input commands can include operating a volume switch, a hold switch, or by providing inputs to a touch sensitive surface such as a touch sensitive display device or a touch pad.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Electronic device <b>10</b> can include housing <b>12</b>. In some embodiments, housing <b>12</b> can take the form of a single piece housing formed of any number of materials such as plastic or non-magnetic metal which can be forged, molded, or otherwise formed into a desired shape. In those cases where electronic device <b>10</b> has a metal housing and incorporates radio frequency (RF) based functionality, a portion of housing <b>12</b> can include radio transparent materials such as ceramic, or plastic. Housing <b>12</b> can be configured to enclose a number of internal components. For example, housing <b>12</b> can enclose and support various structural and electrical components (including integrated circuit chips) to provide computing operations for electronic device <b>10</b>. The integrated circuits can take the form of chips, chip sets, or modules any of which can be surface mounted to a printed circuit board, or PCB, or other support structure. For example, a main logic board (MLB) can have integrated circuits mounted thereon that can include at least a microprocessor, semi-conductor memory (such as FLASH), and various support circuits and so on. Housing <b>12</b> can include opening <b>14</b> for placing internal components and as necessary can be sized to accommodate display assembly for presenting visual content, the display assembly being covered and protected by cover layer <b>16</b>. In some cases, the display assembly can be touch sensitive allowing tactile inputs that can be used to provide control signals to electronic device <b>10</b>. In some cases, the display assembly may be a large prominent display area that covers a majority of the real estate on the front of the electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Electronic device <b>10</b> can include a magnetic attachment system that can be used to magnetically attach electronic device <b>10</b> to at least one other suitably configured object. The magnetic attachment system can include a number of magnetic attachment features distributed within and in some cases connected to housing <b>12</b>. For example, the magnetic attachment system can include first magnetic attachment feature <b>18</b> and second magnetic attachment feature <b>20</b> located on different sides of electronic device <b>10</b>. In particular, first magnetic attachment feature <b>18</b> can be located in proximity to side wall <b>12</b><i>a </i>of housing <b>12</b>. Second magnetic attachment feature <b>20</b> can be located within opening <b>14</b> near side wall <b>12</b><i>b </i>of housing <b>12</b>. In those embodiments where electronic device <b>10</b> includes a display with cover glass substantially filling opening <b>14</b>, second attachment feature <b>20</b> can be placed beneath the cover layer.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The placement of first magnetic attachment feature <b>18</b> at side wall <b>12</b><i>a </i>can facilitate the use of magnetic attachment feature <b>18</b> to magnetically attach electronic device <b>10</b> to another suitably configured object such as another electronic device or an accessory device. Accordingly, without loss of generality, first magnetic attachment feature <b>18</b> will henceforth be referred to as device attachment feature <b>18</b>. The placement of second magnetic attachment feature <b>20</b>, on the other hand, can facilitate the use of second magnetic attachment feature <b>20</b> to secure aspects of another device attached to electronic device <b>10</b> by way of device attachment feature <b>18</b>. In this way, the overall attachment between the other device and electronic device <b>10</b> can be more secure than attaching through first attachment feature <b>18</b> alone. Accordingly, and again without loss of generality, second attachment feature <b>20</b> will henceforth be referred to as securing attachment feature <b>20</b>. Securing attachment feature <b>20</b> can include one or more of magnetic elements <b>22</b>. When a plurality of magnetic elements is used, the arrangement of the plurality of magnetic elements can be widely varied and can magnetically interact with a cooperating feature on another device. In one embodiment, the plurality of magnetic elements associated with securing feature <b>20</b> can assist in securing at least a portion of another device otherwise attached to electronic device <b>10</b> by way of device attachment feature <b>18</b>. Electronic device <b>10</b> can also include Hall Effect sensor <b>24</b> and magnetometer circuit <b>26</b> in the form of onboard compass <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The remainder of this discussion will describe particular embodiments of devices that can use the magnetic attachment system. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> show electronic device <b>100</b> presented in terms of tablet device <b>100</b> and accessory device <b>200</b> is shown as protective cover <b>200</b> each in perspective top views. These elements may generally correspond to any of those previously mentioned. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> shows two perspective views of tablet device <b>100</b> and protective cover <b>200</b> in the open configuration. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows device attachment feature <b>108</b> included in tablet device <b>100</b> and its relationship to tablet device <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, on the other hand, is the view presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> rotated about 180&#xb0; to provide a second view of attachment feature <b>202</b> and its relationship with protective cover <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Tablet device <b>100</b> can take the form of a tablet computing device such as the iPad&#x2122; manufactured by Apple Inc. of Cupertino, Calif. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, tablet device <b>100</b> can include housing <b>102</b> that can enclose and support device attachment feature <b>108</b>. In order to not interfere with the magnetic field generated by device attachment feature <b>108</b>, at least that portion of housing <b>102</b> nearest device attachment feature <b>108</b> can be formed of any number of non-magnetic materials such as plastic or non-magnetic metal such as aluminum. Housing <b>102</b> can also enclose and support internally various structural and electrical components (including integrated circuit chips and other circuitry) to provide computing operations for tablet device <b>100</b>. Housing <b>102</b> can include opening <b>104</b> for placing internal components and can be sized to accommodate a display assembly or system suitable for providing a user with at least visual content as for example via a display. In some cases, the display assembly can include touch sensitive capabilities providing the user with the ability to provide tactile inputs to tablet device <b>100</b> using touch inputs. The display assembly can be formed of a number of layers including a topmost layer taking the form of transparent cover glass <b>106</b> formed of polycarbonate or other appropriate plastic or highly polished glass. Using highly polished glass, cover glass <b>106</b> can substantially fill opening <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Although not shown, the display assembly underlying cover glass <b>106</b> can be used to display images using any suitable display technology, such as LCD, LED, OLED, electronic or e-inks, and so on. The display assembly can be placed and secured within the cavity using a variety of mechanisms. In one embodiment, the display assembly is snapped into the cavity. It can be placed flush with the adjacent portion of the housing. In this way, the display can present visual content that can include visual, still images, as well as icons such as graphical user interface (GUI) that can provide information the user (e.g., text, objects, graphics) as well as receive user provided inputs. In some cases, displayed icons can be moved by a user to a more convenient location on the display.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some embodiments, a display mask can be applied to, or incorporated within or under cover glass <b>106</b>. The display mask can be used to accent an unmasked portion of the display used to present visual content and can be used to make less obvious device attachment feature <b>108</b> and securing attachment feature <b>20</b>. Tablet device <b>100</b> can include various ports that can be used to pass information between tablet device <b>100</b> and the external environment. In particular, data port <b>109</b> can facilitate the transfer of data and power whereas speakers <b>110</b> can be used to output audio content. Home button <b>112</b> can be used to provide an input signal that can be used by a processor included in tablet device <b>100</b>. The processor can use the signal from home button <b>112</b> to alter the operating state of tablet device <b>100</b>. For example, home button <b>112</b> can be used to reset a currently active page presented by the display assembly. Tablet device <b>100</b> can also include camera assembly <b>114</b> arranged to capture an image or images. Tablet device <b>100</b> can also include ambient light sensor <b>116</b> (ALS) used to detect a level of ambient light. In one embodiment ALS <b>116</b> can be used to set a brightness level of the display assembly. For example, in a darker environment with little ambient light, the readings from ALS <b>116</b> can cause a processor in tablet device <b>100</b> to dim the display assembly. In a brighter environment, the display assembly can be made brighter. Tablet device can further include compass <b>118</b> used to detect external magnetic fields that can help in the determination of a position of tablet device <b>100</b>. Tablet device <b>100</b> can also include Hall Effect sensor <b>120</b> that can be used to detect the presence of a magnetic element in when cover <b>200</b> is placed on top of tablet device <b>100</b> in a closed configuration. An accelerometer and gyroscope (not shown) can determine any dynamic changes in the position and orientation of tablet device <b>100</b> in real time.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Protective cover <b>200</b> can have a look and feel that complements that of the tablet device <b>100</b> adding to overall look and feel of tablet device <b>100</b>. Protective cover <b>200</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> attached to tablet device <b>100</b> in an open configuration in which cover glass <b>106</b> is fully viewable. Protective cover <b>200</b> can include flap <b>202</b>. In one embodiment, flap <b>202</b> can have a size and shape in accordance with cover glass <b>106</b>. Flap <b>202</b> can be pivotally connected to accessory attachment feature <b>204</b> by way of hinge assembly <b>206</b> each shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. In this way, flap <b>202</b> can rotate about pivot line <b>211</b>. The magnetic attachment force between attachment feature <b>204</b> and device attachment feature <b>108</b> can maintain protective cover <b>200</b> and tablet device <b>100</b> in a proper orientation and placement vis-a-vis flap <b>202</b> and cover glass <b>106</b>. By proper orientation it is meant that protective cover <b>200</b> can only properly attach to tablet device <b>100</b> having flap <b>202</b> and cover glass <b>106</b> aligned in a mating engagement. The mating arrangement between cover glass <b>106</b> and flap <b>202</b> is such that flap <b>202</b> covers substantially all of cover glass <b>106</b> when flap <b>202</b> is placed in contact with cover glass <b>106</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Flap <b>202</b> can be pivotally connected to hinge assembly <b>206</b> that, in turn, can be connected to attachment feature <b>204</b>. Hinge assembly <b>206</b> can, in turn, be coupled to electronic device <b>100</b> by way of accessory attachment feature <b>204</b>. In this way, the flap <b>202</b> can be used as a protective cover to protect aspects of electronic device <b>100</b> such as a display cover <b>106</b>. Flap <b>202</b> can be formed of various materials such as plastic, cloth, and so forth. Flap <b>202</b> can be segmented in such a way that a segment of the flap can be lifted to expose a corresponding portion of the display. Flap <b>202</b> can also include a functional element that can cooperate with a corresponding functional element in electronic device <b>100</b>. In this way, manipulating flap <b>202</b> can result in an alteration in the operation of electronic device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Flap <b>202</b> can include magnetic material. For example, magnetic elements <b>207</b> can be used to magnetically attach to corresponding magnetic attachment feature <b>20</b> whereas magnetic element <b>209</b> can be used to activate Hall Effect sensor <b>120</b> when flap <b>202</b> is in position above cover glass <b>106</b>. In this way, Hall Effect sensor <b>120</b> can respond by generating a signal that can, in turn, be used to alter an operating state of electronic device <b>100</b>. Since the cover can be easily attached directly to the housing of the tablet device without fasteners, the flap <b>202</b> can essentially conform to the shape of electronic device <b>100</b>. In this way, the cover <b>200</b> will not detract or otherwise obscure the look and feel of electronic device <b>100</b>. Flap <b>202</b> can also include capacitive elements <b>208</b> arranged in a defined pattern. Capacitive elements <b>208</b> can be used to activate a multi-touch (MT) sensitive layer incorporated in display assembly. When flap <b>202</b> is placed upon cover glass <b>106</b>, the MT sensitive layer can respond to the presence of capacitive elements <b>208</b> by generating a touch pattern consistent with the defined pattern. In this way, the signal from Hall Effect sensor <b>120</b> indicating the presence of flap <b>202</b> in the closed configuration can be corroborated. When corroborated, tablet device <b>100</b> can accept the indication from Hall Effect sensor <b>120</b> that flap <b>202</b> is in the closed configuration and react accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In one embodiment, flap <b>202</b> can include RFID device <b>210</b> that can be used to identify protective cover <b>200</b>. In particular, when protective cover <b>200</b> is in the closed configuration, flap <b>202</b> can be in contact with cover glass <b>106</b> thereby allowing a RFID sensor within tablet device <b>100</b> to &#x201c;read&#x201d; RFID device <b>210</b>. In this way not only can the indication from Hall Effect sensor <b>120</b> be corroborated, but an identification of protective cover <b>200</b> can also be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> show protective cover <b>200</b> and tablet device <b>100</b> magnetically attached to each other. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows a closed configuration in which cover glass <b>106</b> is fully covered by and in contact with flap <b>202</b>. Protective cover <b>200</b> can pivot about hinge assembly <b>206</b> from the closed configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> to an open configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. In the closed configuration, inner layer of flap <b>202</b> can come in direct contact with cover glass <b>106</b>. In this way, capacitive elements <b>208</b> can be detected by MT circuit disposed within the display assembly beneath cover glass <b>106</b>. Moreover, the MT circuit can detect a pattern, or signature, corresponding to the pattern of capacitive elements <b>208</b>. In this way, the detection of the pattern can corroborate the indication from Hall Effect sensor <b>120</b> that flap <b>202</b> is in contact with cover glass <b>106</b>. If the pattern is not detected, then tablet device <b>100</b> can ignore the indication from Hall Effect sensor <b>120</b> (or possibly use another sensor, such as ALS <b>116</b> as a further check).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In order to transition from the closed to the open configuration, releasing force F<sub>release </sub>can be applied to flap <b>202</b>. Releasing force F<sub>release </sub>can overcome the magnetic attractive force between attachment feature <b>207</b> in flap <b>202</b> and attachment feature <b>110</b> in tablet device <b>100</b>. Hence, protective cover <b>200</b> can be secured to tablet device <b>100</b> until releasing force F<sub>release </sub>is applied to flap <b>202</b>. In this way, flap <b>202</b> can be used to protect cover glass <b>106</b>. For example, protective cover <b>200</b> can be magnetically attached to tablet device <b>100</b>. Flap <b>202</b> can then be placed upon and magnetically secured to cover glass <b>106</b> by the magnetic interaction between magnetic attachment feature <b>20</b> and <b>207</b>. Flap <b>202</b> can be detached from cover glass <b>106</b> by the application of releasing force F<sub>release </sub>directly to flap <b>202</b>. Releasing force F<sub>release </sub>can overcome the magnetic attraction between magnetic attachment features <b>20</b> and <b>207</b>. Hence, flap <b>202</b> can then move away from cover glass <b>106</b> unhindered.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a top view of a specific embodiment of protective cover <b>200</b> in the form of segmented cover <b>300</b>. Segmented cover <b>300</b> can include body <b>302</b>. Body <b>302</b> can have a size and shape in accordance with tablet device <b>100</b>. Body <b>302</b> can be formed from a single piece of foldable or pliable material. Body <b>302</b> can also be divided into segments separated from each other by a folding region. In this way, the segments can be folded with respect to each other at the folding regions. In one embodiment, body <b>302</b> can be formed layers of material attached to one another forming a laminate structure. Each layer can take the form of a single piece of material that can have a size and shape in conformance with body <b>302</b>. Each layer can also have a size and shape that correspond to only a portion of body <b>302</b>. For example, a layer of rigid or semi-rigid material about the same size and shape of a segment can be attached to or otherwise associated with the segment.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In another example, a layer of rigid or semi-rigid material having a size and shape in accordance with body <b>302</b> can be used to provide segmented cover <b>300</b> as a whole with a resilient foundation. It should be noted that the layers can each be formed of materials having desired properties. For example, a layer of segmented cover <b>300</b> that comes in contact with delicate surfaces such as glass can be formed of a soft material that will not mar or otherwise damage the delicate surface. In another embodiment, a material such as micro-fiber can be used that can passively clean the delicate surface. On the other hand, a layer that is exposed to the external environment can be formed of a more rugged and durable material such as plastic or leather. In yet another embodiment, capacitive elements <b>208</b> can be incorporated within the laminate structure of cover assembly <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In a specific embodiment, segmented body <b>302</b> can be partitioned into a number of segments <b>304</b>-<b>310</b> interspersed with thinner, foldable portions <b>312</b>. Each of the segments <b>304</b>-<b>310</b> can include one or more inserts disposed therein. By way of example, the segments can include a pocket region where the inserts are placed or alternatively the inserts may be embedded within the segments (e.g., insert molding). If pockets used, the pocket region can have a size and shape to accommodate corresponding inserts. The inserts can have various shapes but are most typically shaped to conform to the overall look of segmented body <b>302</b> (e.g., rectangular). The inserts can be used to provide structural support for segmented body <b>302</b>. That is, the inserts can provide stiffness to the cover assembly. In some cases, the inserts may be referred to as stiffeners. As such, the cover assembly is relatively stiff except along the foldable regions that are thinner and do not include the inserts (e.g., allows folding) making segmented cover <b>300</b> more robust and easier to handle. In one embodiment segments <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, and <b>310</b> can be related to segment <b>308</b> in size in the proportion of about 0.72 to 1 meaning that segments <b>304</b>, <b>306</b> and <b>310</b> are sized in width to be about 72% of the width of segment <b>308</b>. In this way, a triangle having appropriate angles can be formed (i.e., about 75&#xb0; for display stand and about 11&#xb0; for keyboard stand discussed below).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Segments <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, and <b>310</b> can include inserts <b>314</b>, <b>316</b>, and <b>318</b>, respectively (shown in dotted lines form). Inserts <b>314</b>-<b>318</b> can be formed of rigid or semi-rigid material adding resiliency to body <b>302</b>. Examples of materials that can be used include plastics, fiber glass, carbon fiber composites, metals, and the like. Segment <b>304</b> can include insert <b>320</b> also formed of resilient material such as plastic but also arranged to accommodate magnetic elements <b>322</b> some of which can interact with magnetic elements in table device <b>1100</b> and more specifically attachment feature <b>110</b>. Inserts <b>314</b>-<b>318</b> can also incorporate capacitive elements <b>208</b> that can be sensed by a MT sensitive portion of the display of tablet device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Due to the ability of segmented body <b>302</b> to fold and more particularly the various segments to fold with respect to each other, most of magnetic elements <b>322</b> can be used to magnetically interact with magnetically active insert <b>324</b> embedded in insert <b>318</b>. By magnetically binding both active insert <b>324</b> and magnetic elements <b>322</b> various support structures can be formed some of which can be triangular in shape. The triangular support structures can aid in the use of tablet device <b>1100</b>. For example, one triangular support structure can be used to support tablet device <b>1100</b> in such a way that visual content can be presented at a desirable viewing angle of about 75&#xb0; from horizontal. However, in order be able to appropriately fold segmented cover <b>300</b>, segment <b>308</b> can be sized to be somewhat larger than segments <b>304</b>, <b>306</b> and <b>310</b> (which are generally the same size). In this way, the segments can form a triangle having two equal sides and a longer third side, the triangle having an interior angle of about 75&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Cover assembly <b>300</b> can pivotally attach to accessory attachment feature <b>202</b> by way of a hinge assembly. The hinge assembly can provide one or more pivots to allow the cover to fold over on the device while the cover assembly is attached to the device through the magnets. In the illustrated embodiment, the hinge assembly can include first hinge portion (also referred to as first end lug) <b>328</b> and a second hinge portion (or second end lug) <b>330</b> disposed opposite the first end lug. First end lug <b>328</b> can be rigidly connected to second end lug <b>330</b> by way of connecting rod <b>332</b> (shown in dotted line form) incorporated into a tube portion of segmented body <b>302</b>. The longitudinal axis of connecting rod <b>332</b> can act as pivot line <b>1333</b> about which the segmented body can pivot relative to the hinge assembly. Connecting rod <b>332</b> can be formed of metal or plastic strong enough to rigidly support cover assembly <b>300</b> as well as any objects, such as tablet device <b>1100</b>, magnetically attached to magnetic attachment feature <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In order to prevent metal on metal contact, first end lug <b>328</b> and second end lug <b>330</b> can each have protective layers <b>336</b> and <b>338</b>, respectively, attached thereto. Protective layers (also referred to as bumpers) <b>336</b> and <b>338</b> can prevent direct contact between first end lug <b>328</b> and second end lug <b>330</b> with housing <b>102</b>. This is particularly important when end lugs <b>328</b>, <b>330</b> and housing <b>102</b> are formed of metal. The presence of bumpers <b>336</b> and <b>338</b> can prevent metal to metal contact between the end lugs and housing <b>102</b> thereby eliminating the chance of substantial wear and tear at the point of contact that can degrade the overall look and feel of tablet device <b>1100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">First end lug <b>328</b> and second end lug <b>330</b> can be magnetically connected to the electronic device by way of hinge span <b>340</b> that is configured to pivot with respect to the end lugs. The pivoting can be accomplished using hinge posts <b>342</b> (a portion of which can be exposed). Hinge posts <b>342</b> can rotatably secure hinge span <b>340</b> to both first end lug <b>328</b> and second end lug <b>330</b>. Hinge span <b>304</b> can include magnetic elements. The magnetic elements can be arranged to magnetically attach hinge span <b>340</b> to a magnetic attachment feature having a matching arrangement of magnetic elements in the electronic device. In order to fix the magnetic elements in place within hinge span <b>340</b>, hinge posts <b>342</b> can be used to secure magnetic elements located at both ends of hinge span <b>340</b> reducing the likelihood that the magnetic elements in hinge span <b>340</b> will move about having the potential for disrupting the magnetic attachment between hinge span <b>340</b> and the magnetic attachment feature in the electronic device.</p>

In the open configuration, distance r is a fixed distance R<sub>open </sub>whereas in the closed configuration distance r is a fixed distance R<sub>closed</sub>.

However, since distance r between combined magnetic element ME and onboard compass <b>118</b> varies with pivot angle &#x398;, a change in magnetic flux density M detected by onboard compass <b>118</b> can provide an estimation of the movement of flap <b>202</b> about pivot line <b>211</b>.

The electronic device <b>1450</b> stores media data pertaining to media items in a file system <b>1454</b> and a cache <b>1456</b>. The file system <b>1454</b> is, typically, a storage disk or a plurality of disks. The file system <b>1454</b> typically provides high capacity storage capability for the electronic device <b>1450</b>. However, since the access time to the file system <b>1454</b> is relatively slow, the electronic device <b>1450</b> can also include a cache <b>1456</b>. The cache <b>1456</b> is, for example, Random-Access Memory (RAM) provided by semiconductor memory.
