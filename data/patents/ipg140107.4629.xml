Herein, regions that are secured for users to perform communications and that are defined along the frequency and time axes are referred to as assignment slots, and blocks serving as the basis for determining assignment slots are referred to as chunks.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the above, there are provided methods that, in order to transmit broadcast signals, multicast signals, and control signals, blocks whose ranges are broadened in the frequency axis direction are assigned so as to produce frequency diversity effects, thus reducing errors irrespective of low reception power. In addition, there are provided methods that, in order to transmit unicast signals in one-to-one communications between wireless transmission devices and wireless reception devices, blocks whose ranges are reduced in the frequency axis direction are assigned so as to produce multiuser diversity effects, thus improving reception power in wireless reception devices.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref> show the relationships regarding signals transmitted from a wireless transmission device to a wireless reception device with respect to time (horizontal axis) and frequency (vertical axis). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>, the horizontal axis represents time, and the vertical axis represents frequency. Transmission times t<sub>1 </sub>to t<sub>3 </sub>are set to the time axis. Herein, the same time length is set to the times t<sub>1 </sub>to t<sub>3 </sub>respectively. Transmission frequencies f<sub>1 </sub>to f<sub>5 </sub>are set to the frequency axis. Herein, a same frequency range F<sub>c </sub>is set to the frequencies f<sub>1 </sub>to f<sub>5</sub>. With reference to the transmission times t<sub>1 </sub>to t<sub>3 </sub>and the transmission frequencies f<sub>1 </sub>to f<sub>5</sub>, fifteen chunks K<sub>1 </sub>to K<sub>15 </sub>are set as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, five chunks K<sub>1 </sub>to K<sub>5 </sub>are connected as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref> and are then equally divided into six slots along the time axis, thus setting communication slots s<sub>1 </sub>to s<sub>6 </sub>each of which has a time length of t<sub>1</sub>/6 and a frequency range of 5f<sub>1</sub>.

<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Furthermore, the chunk K<sub>11 </sub>is assigned to a seventh user as a communication slot s<sub>12</sub>.

This makes it possible for this user to obtain a multiuser diversity effect.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, the two chunks K<sub>12 </sub>and K<sub>14 </sub>are equally divided into six slots, thus forming slots s<sub>13 </sub>to s<sub>18 </sub>and s<sub>20 </sub>to s<sub>25</sub>. The communication slots s<sub>13</sub>, s<sub>16</sub>, s<sub>20</sub>, and s<sub>23 </sub>are assigned to a ninth user; the communication slots s<sub>14</sub>, s<sub>17</sub>, s<sub>21</sub>, and s<sub>24 </sub>are assigned to a tenth user; and the communication slots s<sub>15</sub>, s<sub>18</sub>, s<sub>22</sub>, and s<sub>25 </sub>are assigned to an eleventh user.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to obtain frequency diversity effects in the aforementioned conventionally-known methods, it is necessary to increase spread coefficients or to reduce coding coefficients in error correcting coding in response to frequency variations of transfer functions in propagation paths.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref> are graphs showing delay profiles and transfer functions with regard to signals that are propagated through plural propagation paths having different delay times so as to reach wireless reception devices.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 18A</figref> show delay profiles showing transmission signals, which are propagated through plural propagation paths so as to reach a wireless reception device, with respect to time (horizontal axis) and power (vertical axis). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17B and 18B</figref> show transfer functions for performing frequency conversion on delay profiles with respect to frequency (horizontal axis) and power (vertical axis).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> shows the appearance of six delay waveforms w<b>11</b> to w<b>16</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref> shows the appearance of three delay waveforms w<b>21</b> to w<b>23</b>. They differ from each other with respect to maximum delay times t<b>1</b> and t<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">When the maximum delay time t<b>1</b> is long as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>, i.e., when relatively rapid frequency variations (rapid power variations in the frequency direction) occur in the transfer function, it is expected to produce an adequate frequency diversity effect irrespective of a small spread coefficient and a high coding coefficient in error correcting coding. However, when the maximum delay time t<b>2</b> is small as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref>, i.e., when relatively moderate frequency variations occur in the transfer function, it is not expected to produce an adequate frequency diversity effect when the spread coefficient is small and the coding coefficient in error correcting coding is high; hence, it is necessary to increase the spread coefficient and to reduce the coding coefficient in error correcting coding.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref> show signals, i.e., data. That is, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>, a spread ratio of the spectrum spreading technology is set to &#x201c;4&#x201d; with respect to data D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b>, thus assigning four sub-carriers a<sub>11 </sub>to a<sub>14 </sub>to the data D<b>1</b>. Similarly, four sub-carriers a<sub>15 </sub>to a<sub>18 </sub>are assigned to the data D<b>2</b>. In this case, the transfer function has rapid frequency variations; hence, reception power of the sub-carrier a<sub>13 </sub>regarding the data D<b>1</b> remarkably decreases, so that reception power of the sub-carrier a<sub>16 </sub>regarding the data D<b>2</b> remarkably decreases as well. Therefore, no reception failure occurs with respect to the data D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>, the spread ratio is set to &#x201c;8&#x201d; so as to assign eight sub-carriers a<sub>21 </sub>to a<sub>28 </sub>to the data D<b>1</b>. In this case, the transfer function has slow frequency variations so that the reception power of the sub-carrier a<sub>24 </sub>remarkably decreases, and the reception power of the sub-carriers a<sub>23 </sub>and a<sub>25 </sub>slightly decreases, whereas the data spreading ratio is increased compared with the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref> so that no reception failure occurs with respect to the data D<b>1</b>. The aforementioned values of the spread ratios are described for the sake of convenience and are not necessarily limited.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention is made in consideration of the aforementioned circumstances, wherein it is an object of the invention to provide a wireless transmission device and a wireless transmission method that can produce an adequate frequency diversity effect without controlling a spread coefficient and a coding coefficient in error correcting coding in the wireless transmission side.</p>

<p id="p-0088" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic illustration showing that signals transmitted from a wireless transmission device <b>1</b> are propagated through plural propagation paths so as to reach a wireless reception device <b>7</b>. The wireless transmission device <b>1</b> has plural transmission antennas <b>2</b> to <b>4</b>, which are respectively applied with different delay times 0, T, and 2T and from which signals are transmitted. The wireless reception device <b>7</b> receives signals transmitted from the wireless transmission device <b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example in which the wireless transmission device <b>1</b> is equipped with three transmission antennas <b>2</b> to <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0110">Suppose that plural transmission antennas are transmission antennas installed in a wireless transmission device facilitated in a base station for cellular phones, wherein three types of transmission antennas are provided with respect to different sectors of the same base station and with respect to different base stations. The following description is given with respect to the situation in which they belong to the same sector, for example, but it is possible to employ another constitution. That is, n transmission antennas belong to different sectors, or n transmission antennas belong to different base stations.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0111">In the figure, delays <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> apply a delay time T, by which, as described above, the delay time T is applied to the transmission antenna <b>3</b>, and the delay time 2T is applied to the transmission antenna <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> show a delay profile and a transfer function with respect to signals, which are propagated through plural (three) propagation paths having different delay times so as to reach a wireless reception device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows the delay profile showing that transmission signals are propagated through plural propagation paths having different delay times so as to reach the wireless reception device with respect to time (horizontal axis) and power (vertical axis). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the delay profile instantaneously has a maximum delay waveform of 2T+d<sub>max</sub>; hence, compared with the constitution in which the same signal is transmitted via each transmission antenna, the maximum delay waveform becomes very large. Herein, d<sub>max </sub>represents an arrival time difference between a fast propagation path and a slow propagation path when radio waves arrive at a reception antenna from a transmission antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows a transfer function that is produced by performing frequency conversion on the delay profile of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> with respect to frequency (horizontal axis) and power (vertical axis). In the delay profile, the increasing maximum delay time 2T+d<sub>max </sub>indicates rapid frequency variations of the transfer function. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> (similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>), data D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> are spread with a spread ratio &#x201c;4&#x201d; and are assigned with sub-carriers. It is preferable that the spread coefficient or the coding coefficient of error correcting coding be controlled in response to frequency variations of the transfer function in the wireless transmission device <b>1</b>, wherein the aforementioned method states that the delay time 2T is acknowledged in advance by the wireless transmission device <b>1</b>; hence, it is possible to determine the spread coefficient or the coding coefficient of error correcting coding irrespective of frequency variations of propagation paths.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0114">In order to produce multiuser diversity effects, it is preferable that the maximum delay time 2T+d<sub>max</sub>, which appears instantaneously in the delay profile, be not increased so much. Multiuser diversity effects will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0115"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3C</figref> show a delay profile and transfer functions with respect to signals that are propagated through plural propagation paths having different delay times so as to reach a wireless reception device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows the delay profile adapted so transmission signals that are propagated through plural (three) propagation paths having different delay times so as to reach the wireless reception device with respect to time (horizontal axis) and power (vertical axis).</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows a transfer function with regard to a wireless reception device used by a user u<b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> shows a transfer function with regard to a wireless reception device used by a user u<b>2</b>. Since the wireless reception devices of the users u<b>1</b> and u<b>2</b> differ from each other in location, the instantaneous transfer functions thereof differ from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0117">Suppose that a left region is connected to a frequency channel b<b>1</b> and a right channel is connected to a frequency channel b<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3C</figref>, the user u<b>1</b> enjoys a good quality in the frequency channel b<b>2</b>, while the user u<b>2</b> enjoys a good quality in the frequency channel b<b>1</b>. Therefore, data D<b>1</b> to D<b>4</b> are transmitted to the user u<b>1</b> over the frequency channel b<b>2</b>. Data D<b>1</b> to D<b>4</b> are subjected to spectrum spreading. Data D<b>1</b> to D<b>4</b> are transmitted to the user u<b>2</b> over the frequency channel b<b>1</b>. In this case, data D<b>1</b> to D<b>4</b> are subjected to spectrum spreading.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0118">As described above, by use of a quality difference between frequency channels at a certain instant, it is possible to produce multiuser diversity effects for improving transmission efficiency with respect to different users who perform communications using different frequency channels.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0119">However, when the maximum delay time 2T+d<sub>max </sub>is increased so much, rapid frequency variations occur in the transfer function, thus reducing quality difference between the frequency channel b<b>1</b> and the frequency channel b<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0120">Therefore, in order to produce adequate multiuser diversity effects, it is important to reduce the maximum delay time 2T+d<sub>max </sub>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> show the relationships between the maximum delay time (n&#x2212;1)T and frequency variations. When an arrival time difference (n&#x2212;1)T appears between arrival waves w<b>31</b> and w<b>32</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a transfer function of this propagation path is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. That is, a frequency difference between amplitude drops of power (vertical axis) is defined as F=1/(n&#x2212;1)T.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0122">When plural delay waves w<b>41</b> to w<b>43</b> appear as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, an arrival time difference (n&#x2212;1)T appears between the first arrival wave w<b>41</b> and the last arrival wave w<b>43</b>, so that a frequency difference between amplitude drops of power (vertical axis) is defined as F=1/(n&#x2212;1)T as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0123">In this connection, the frequency diversity effect differs from the multiuser diversity effect in terms of frequency variations of appropriate transfer functions thereof; hence, in order to produce the frequency diversity effect, the maximum delay time (n&#x2212;1)T is set as (n&#x2212;1)T&#x3e;F<sub>c </sub>where F<sub>c </sub>denotes a frequency bandwidth of a chunk, which is a basic region secured by the user to perform communication and defined with respect to the frequency axis and time axis, thus creating an environment easily producing the frequency diversity effect.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0124">In contrast, in order to produce the multiuser diversity effect, the maximum delay time (n&#x2212;1)T is set as (n&#x2212;1)T&#x3c;1/F<sub>c</sub>, where F<sub>c </sub>denotes a frequency bandwidth of a chunk, thus creating an environment easily producing the multiuser diversity effect. In the following description, an inequality of (n&#x2212;1)T&#x3c;1/F<sub>c </sub>encompasses (n&#x2212;1)T=0. In the following description, delay times applied to transmission antennas are each represented as (n&#x2212;1) multiples of T where T is assumed to be constant, whereas it is possible to change T with respect to each of transmission antennas. In order to produce the multiuser diversity effect, it is possible to reduce the maximum delay time by reducing the number of transmission antennas used for transmission instead of setting the inequality of (n&#x2212;1)T&#x3c;1/F<sub>c</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0125">As described above, in response to a determination as to whether transmission signals are subjected to the frequency diversity transmission or the multiuser diversity transmission (i.e., (n&#x2212;1)T&#x3e;1/F<sub>c </sub>or (1&#x2212;n)T&#x3c;1/F<sub>c</sub>), it is possible to produce the frequency diversity effect or the multiuser diversity effect without being affected by conditions of propagation paths.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0126">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>, with respect to the first user who performs communication by way of the communication slot s<sub>1 </sub>that is produced by connecting plural consecutive chunks in the frequency direction and the user who is assigned with discontinuous chunks such as the ninth user who is assigned with the communication slots s<sub>13</sub>, s<sub>16</sub>, s<sub>20</sub>, and s<sub>23</sub>, the bandwidth BW (i.e., BW=5F for the first user, and BW=3F for the ninth user) of a communication slot instantaneously assigned to the user defines the basis for the realization of the frequency diversity effect; hence, by setting the maximum delay time as (n&#x2212;1)T&#x3e;1/BW, it is possible to produce the frequency diversity effect.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0127">For example, the delay time T is set such that the maximum delay time (n&#x2212;1)T between transmission antennas falls within a range of (n&#x2212;1)T&#x3e;1/BW when a communication signal indicates the frequency diversity effect, while the delay time T is set such that the maximum delay time (n&#x2212;1)T between transmission antennas falls within a range of (n&#x2212;1)T&#x3c;1/F<sub>c</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0128">Although no illustration is provided, when a sub-carrier partially included in plural chunks is assigned to a certain user, the bandwidth BW of a communication slot assigned to the user represents a frequency difference between the sub-carriers, which deviate from each other at most within the sub-carriers instantaneously assigned to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0129">The determination as to whether signals are subjected to the frequency diversity transmission or the multiuser diversity transmission can be changed over based on types of transmission signals (e.g., pilot signals, control signals, broadcast/multicast signals, and the like), moving speeds of wireless reception devices (where the frequency diversity is selected in case of a high moving speed, and the multiuser diversity is selected in case of a low moving speed), and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0130"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 6C</figref> are explanatory drawings for the situation in which the same signal having no delay time is transmitted via plural antennas of a wireless transmission device <b>8</b>. Suppose that, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the wireless transmission device <b>8</b> is equipped with plural (three) transmission antennas, which are arranged in parallel and which have no directivity in the horizontal direction. Due to the occurrence of lobes e<b>11</b> and e<b>12</b> indicated by ellipses shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, there is a direction arranging a wireless reception device <b>9</b> that receives reception signals with a high reception level with respect to all frequency bands (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>) and a direction arranging a wireless reception device <b>10</b> that receives reception signals with a low reception level with respect to all frequency bands (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0131"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A to 7C</figref> are explanatory drawings in which the same signal is applied with different delay times respectively and is then transmitted via plural transmission antennas of the wireless transmission device <b>8</b>. Suppose that the wireless transmission device <b>8</b> is equipped with plural (three) transmission antennas having no directivity, which are arranged in parallel. Due to the occurrence of lobes e<b>21</b> to e<b>26</b> in narrow bands, there occur a frequency band securing a high reception level and a frequency band securing a low reception level within reception signals, whereas an average reception level is maintained substantially constant irrespective of directions; hence, it is possible to secure substantially the same quality with respect to both of the reception level of a wireless reception device <b>9</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>) and the reception level of a wireless reception device <b>10</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>).

<p id="p-0168" num="0189">The weight w<sub>m </sub>represents a vector of a weight used in the weighted multiplication section <b>319</b>, wherein in the equation (1), the first to last terms describe the weights used in first to n-th antennas.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0190">In the equation (1) expressing the weight w<sub>m</sub>, n denotes the number of antennas, wherein in the present embodiment, n=3; &#x3b8; denotes a direction in which a main beam is directed; and k denotes a ratio between the frequency used for transmission and the frequency that is measured based on &#x3b8;.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0191">With respect to the main beam direction &#x3b8;, a measured value produced by the wireless transmission device or a terminal of a counter-communicator is supplied to the weight calculation section <b>310</b>, in which it is used for calculation of the weight w<sub>m</sub>. The equation (1) presents an example of calculation for the weight w<sub>m</sub>, which can be calculated by way of another method. The calculation methods regarding &#x3b8; and w<sub>m </sub>are described in &#x201c;Technical Report RCS2004-229&#x201d; (published by the Corporate Institute of Electronic Information and Telecommunication on November, 2004) and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0192">The delay imparting and directivity control section <b>320</b> imparts a delay of the maximum delay time (n&#x2212;1)T or less between transmission antennas when the communication signal indicates frequency diversity, while it performs multiplication to produce the weight w<sub>m </sub>so as to perform directivity control when the communication signal indicates multiuser diversity.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0193">As described in the first embodiment, the delay imparting and directivity control section <b>320</b> sets the delay time T such that the maximum delay time (n&#x2212;1)T between transmission antennas falls within a range of (n&#x2212;1)T&#x3e;1/F<sub>c </sub>when the communication signal indicates frequency diversity.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0194">As described in the first embodiment, the delay imparting and directivity control section <b>320</b> sets the delay time T such that the maximum delay time (n&#x2212;1)T falls within a range of (n&#x2212;1)T&#x3e;1/BW when the communication signal indicates frequency diversity.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0195">The aforementioned description teaches that the weighted multiplication section <b>319</b> of the delay imparting and directivity control section <b>320</b> is instructed by the high-order layer controlling the physical layer to use either the frequency diversity region or the multiuser diversity region, based on which it applies a phase rotation &#x3b8;<sub>m </sub>so as to impart different delay times to antennas in the frequency diversity region, while it performs multiplication to produce the weight w<sub>m </sub>so as to perform directivity control in the multiuser diversity region; however, it is possible to use another method for using both the phase rotation &#x3b8;<sub>m </sub>and weight w<sub>m </sub>in the multiuser diversity region in such a way that, as described in the fourth embodiment, the phase rotation &#x3b8;<sub>m </sub>is imparted with respect to both the frequency diversity region and the multiuser diversity region before the main beam direction &#x3b8; is produced, and then the directivity control is performed using the weight w<sub>m </sub>after the main beam direction &#x3b8; is produced in the multiuser diversity region. Similar to the fourth embodiment, the delay time T varies in connection with &#x3b8;<sub>m </sub>in accordance with the frequency diversity region and the multiuser diversity region. Thus, in the stage before the main beam direction &#x3b8; is produced, it is possible to produce the same multiuser diversity effect as the fourth embodiment, while after the main beam direction &#x3b8; is produced, it is expected to produce a higher multiuser diversity effect by strictly performing directivity control using the weight w<sub>m</sub>. Furthermore, by using the configuration of the physical layer of the wireless transmission device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> rather than the fourth embodiment, it is possible to realize the improvement of characteristics due to the directivity control by slightly increasing the circuit constitution.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0196">As described above, the delay imparting and directivity control section <b>320</b> imparts a delay of the maximum delay time (n&#x2212;1)T or less between transmission antennas when the communication signal indicates frequency diversity, while it imparts a delay of the maximum delay time (n&#x2212;1)T or less between transmission antennas, or it performs multiplication to produce the weight w<sub>m </sub>so as to perform directivity control when the communication signal indicates multiuser diversity.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0197">The wireless transmission device performing the aforementioned processing has the constitution shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, wherein, when the communication signal indicates the multiuser diversity, the delay imparting and directivity control section imparts a delay of the maximum delay time (n&#x2212;1)T or less between transmission antennas, or it performs multiplication to produce the weight w<sub>m </sub>so as to perform directivity control.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0198">As described in the first embodiment, the delay imparting and directivity control section sets the delay time T such that the maximum delay time (n&#x2212;1)T between transmission antennas falls within a range of (n&#x2212;1)T&#x3e;1/F<sub>c </sub>when the communication signal indicates frequency diversity, while it sets the delay time T such that the maximum delay time falls within a range of (n&#x2212;1)T&#x3c;1/F<sub>c </sub>when the communication signal indicates multiuser diversity so that a delay is applied between transmission antennas.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0199">As described in the first embodiment, the delay imparting and directivity control section sets the delay time T such that the maximum delay time (n&#x2212;1)T between transmission antennas falls within a range of (n&#x2212;1)T&#x3e;1/BW when the communication signal indicates the frequency diversity.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0200">The aforementioned second to fifth embodiments are described with respect to the case in which the number of users is two and the number of antennas is three, whereas the number of users and the number of antennas are not necessarily limited to these numbers.</p>

<p id="p-0181" num="0202">The present embodiment will be described with respect to variations of the maximum delay time (n&#x2212;1)T dependent upon physical channels.

<p id="p-0182" num="0203">Normally, in communications other than one-to-one communication, a known signal referred to as a pilot channel is transmitted to a wireless transmission device in order to estimate a propagation path; alternatively, a control channel is used to inform various types of parameters before data communication.

<p id="p-0192" num="0213"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> are tables describing the relationships between the maximum delay time (n&#x2212;1)T between transmission antennas and the frequency bandwidth F<sub>c </sub>of chunks in connection with physical channels. As shown in the figures, it is preferable to set (n&#x2212;1)T&#x3c;1/F<sub>c </sub>irrespective of the frequency diversity region and the multiuser diversity region with respect to common control pilot channels, common control channels, and dedicated control channels. It is preferable to set (n&#x2212;1)T&#x3e;1/F<sub>c </sub>irrespective of the frequency diversity region and the multiuser diversity region with respect to downlink synchronization channels.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0214">With respect to dedicated pilot channels, it is preferable to set (n&#x2212;1)T&#x3e;1/F<sub>c </sub>in the frequency diversity region and to set (n&#x2212;1)T&#x3c;1/F<sub>c </sub>in the multiuser diversity region. Suppose that dedicated pilot signals are transmitted via transmission antennas, wherein the delay imparting section for delaying transmission signals supplied to n transmission antennas by the maximum delay time (n&#x2212;1)T or less sets the delay time T such that the maximum delay time (n&#x2212;1)T falls within a range of (n&#x2212;1)T&#x3e;1/F<sub>c </sub>when a communication signal, which indicates whether chunks including dedicated pilot channels are subjected to the frequency diversity transmission or the multiuser diversity transmission, indicates frequency diversity, while it sets the delay time T so as to perform directivity control using weights output from the weight calculation section or to define the maximum delay time (n&#x2212;1)T as (n&#x2212;1)T&#x3c;1/F<sub>c </sub>when the communication signal indicates multiuser diversity.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0215">Multicast/broadcast channels are used in the frequency diversity region only; hence, it is preferable to set (n&#x2212;1)T&#x3e;1/F<sub>c</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0216">The reasons why the aforementioned setups are performed are that common pilot channels are used for the notification of signal intensities observed by terminals, hence, it is undesirable that the delay time varies with respect to chunks, while it is necessary for the wireless transmission device to know signal intensities with respect to chunks in case of (n&#x2212;1)T&#x3c;1/F<sub>c </sub>in order to perform multiuser diversity, hence, it is preferable to set (n&#x2212;1)T&#x3c;1/F<sub>c </sub>in order that the maximum delay time does not vary with respect to chunks.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0217">Dedicated pilot channels are used for calculations of estimated values of propagation paths used for demodulation of data signals. Therefore, it is preferable to perform communication by setting (n&#x2212;1)T&#x3e;1/F<sub>c </sub>in the frequency diversity region and by setting (n&#x2212;1)T&#x3c;1/F<sub>c </sub>in the multiuser diversity region.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0218">Downlink synchronization channels are used for frame synchronization, wherein the estimation of propagation paths is not necessary, and it is preferable to secure accurate reception in case of low reception power; hence, it is preferable to set (n&#x2212;1)T&#x3e;1/F<sub>c </sub>in order to produce the frequency diversity effect. In particular, there is a possibility that the same signal is transmitted using the same time and the same frequency via downlink synchronization channels by way of plural sectors and plural antennas included in a single base station. Therefore, signals are applied with different delays with respect to antennas and are transmitted by way of plural sectors and plural antennas included in a single base station via downlink synchronization channels; thus, it is expected to produce a high frequency diversity effect, which is higher than that of another physical channel.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0219">It is presumed that common control channels and dedicated control channels use estimated values of propagation paths, which are produced by way of common pilot channels; hence, it is preferable that they be set to the maximum delay time, which is identical to that of the common pilot channels, and be subjected to transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0220">However, it is preferable to secure accurate reception in common control channels and dedicated control channels in case of low reception power; hence, it is preferable to produce the frequency diversity effect, wherein, in consideration of improvement of reception performance of control channels at first, when common control channels, dedicated control channels, and multicast/broadcast channels are included in the same chunk, it is preferable to perform transmission via common pilot channels by setting (n&#x2212;1)T&#x3e;1/F<sub>c</sub>, thus producing the frequency diversity effect in control channels.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0221">When the same chunk is used for the multiuser diversity, it is necessary to perform notification about signal intensities emerging in actual transmission suited to the multiuser diversity (communication under (n&#x2212;1)T&#x3c;1/F<sub>c</sub>); hence, it is preferable to perform transmission by setting (n&#x2212;1)T&#x3c;1/F<sub>c</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0222">For this reason, it is possible to set the relationship between the maximum delay time (n&#x2212;1)T between transmission antennas and the frequency bandwidth F<sub>c </sub>of the chunk, which is identical to the relationship shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, with respect to each physical channel.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0223">In order to produce the frequency diversity effect, it is preferable to perform communication by setting (n&#x2212;1)T&#x3e;1/F<sub>c</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0224">The aforementioned embodiment is described such that the maximum delay time falls within a range of (n&#x2212;1)T&#x3c;1/F<sub>c </sub>in the multiuser diversity region, whereas, the wireless transmission device described in the fifth embodiment can use the weight w<sub>m</sub>, which is produced by the weight calculation section <b>310</b>, in the multiuser diversity region.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0225">The aforementioned second to fifth embodiments are each described such that the wireless transmission device having n transmission antennas transmits signals applied with a prescribed delay time with respect to each of n transmission antennas; but this constitution is not restrictive. For example, when the wireless transmission device having n transmission antennas selects using the multiuser diversity, it is possible to transmit signals applied with a prescribed delay time T&#x2032; with respect to each of j transmission antennas (where j is an integer, 1&#x2266;j&#x3c;n) within n transmission antennas.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0226">In the aforementioned constitution compared with the constitution in which signals are transmitted using all the n transmission antennas, a maximum delay time (j&#x2212;1)T&#x2032; applied to signals transmitted via j transmission antennas decreases so as to further reduce variations of propagation paths; hence, it is possible to produce a good multiuser diversity effect. In case of j=1, in particular, it is possible to reduce the circuit scale of the delay section.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0227">The present embodiment is described under the precondition that the maximum delay time is set as (n&#x2212;1)T&#x3e;1/F<sub>c </sub>in order to produce the frequency diversity effect, whereas, as described in the first embodiment, when transmission is performed using a physical channel, which is assigned with chunks lying in plural frequency directions, the bandwidth BW assigned to the physical channel forms the basis for producing the frequency diversity effect; hence, it is possible to produce the frequency diversity effect by setting the maximum delay time to (n&#x2212;1)T&#x3e;1/BW.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0228">By use of the wireless transmission device, according to the aforementioned embodiments of the present invention, which selects the use of either the frequency diversity or the multiuser diversity in transmission of signals from n transmission antennas so as to vary delay times applied to signals transmitted via n transmission antennas on the basis of the selection result; hence, it is possible to produce the frequency diversity effect or the multiuser diversity effect without being affected by conditions of propagation paths.</p>
