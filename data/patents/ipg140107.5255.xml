<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/936,000, entitled &#x201c;Management of a 3D Package and Cooling System&#x201d;, filed on even date herewith, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Recent trends in semiconductor technology have been focused towards miniaturization of integrated circuit chip systems. This has resulted in the development of high density electronic package modules, such as, three-dimensional (3D) multi-die structures, which are composed of a plurality of die that are arranged in a stack to substantially reduce the amount of floorspace that the die occupy in a system. As with conventional die, part of the electrical energy for driving the stacked die is converted into thermal energy and dissipated as heat. The temperatures of the die greatly affect their performance. As such, effective heat removal is typically an important consideration in designing and operating the 3D multi-die electronic package modules.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Heat is typically removed from the die through use of passive cooling provisioning, such as, thermally conductive material positioned to convey heat from one die to another die or to a heat sink. Techniques for actively cooling the die have also been proposed through use of thermoelectric coolers having a P-type material plate and an N-type material plate mounted between various die. However, as the electronic package modules continue to become more dense with die having ever-increasing operational speeds, conventional techniques for dissipating the heat generated by the die in 3D multi-die electronic package modules may be unable to adequately cool the die, which may lead to reduced performance and early failure.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It should therefore be appreciated that improvements in removing the heat dissipated from the die in 3D multi-die electronic package modules would be beneficial.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">For simplicity and illustrative purposes, the present invention is described by referring mainly to an exemplary embodiment thereof. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent however, to one of ordinary skill in the art, that the present invention may be practiced without limitation to these specific details. In other instances, well known methods and structures have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Disclosed herein are a method for managing cooling provisioning in a three-dimensional package containing a plurality of die arranged in a stacked configuration with a cooling system having at least one active cooling mechanism. Also disclosed herein is a three-dimensional package having a cooling system that is controlled according to the disclosed method.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Through implementation of the method and three-dimensional package disclosed herein, one or both of the die and the cooling system may be controlled to substantially minimize energy consumption while providing adequate cooling to the die.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">With reference first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, there is shown a simplified schematic diagram of a three-dimensional package <b>100</b> containing a plurality of stacked die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> and a cooling system having a plurality of active cooling mechanisms <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n</i>, according to an example. In one regard, the various methods and systems disclosed herein may be implemented in the three-dimensional package <b>100</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> as discussed in greater detail herein below. It should be understood that the three-dimensional package <b>100</b> may include additional components and that some of the components described herein may be removed and/or modified without departing from a scope of the three-dimensional package <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the three-dimensional package <b>100</b> includes a plurality of die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b>. The die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> may comprise integrated circuit chips configured to perform any reasonably suitable function. By way of example, a first die <b>102</b> may comprise a processor die and a second and third die <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> may comprise flash memory die. In another example, the three-dimensional package <b>100</b> may comprise a solid-state memory package, in which the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> may each comprise flash memories.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The first die <b>102</b> is depicted as being mounted on a substrate <b>110</b> through a plurality of solder joints <b>112</b>. The second die <b>104</b> is depicted as being attached to the first die <b>102</b> through an adhesive material <b>120</b>, which may comprise a thermally conductive material. In addition, the third die <b>106</b> is depicted as being attached to the second die <b>104</b> through another adhesive material <b>122</b>, which may also comprise a thermally conductive material. The second die <b>104</b> and the third die <b>106</b> are also depicted as being connected to the substrate <b>110</b> through various interconnects <b>124</b>, which may comprise wirebonds, flip-chip interconnects, photonic interconnects, etc. configured to enable at least one of power and electronic signals to be communicated between the die <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> and the substrate <b>110</b>. In addition, or alternatively, the third die <b>106</b> may be connected to the second die <b>104</b>, which is connected to the substrate <b>110</b>. The die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> are further depicted as being supported within a mold compound <b>126</b>, which operates to protect the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> and through which some of the heat generated in the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> may be dissipated.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Also depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> are a plurality of active cooling mechanisms <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n</i>, where &#x201c;n&#x201d; is an integer equal to or greater than zero, positioned in the adhesive material <b>120</b>. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, some or all of the active cooling mechanisms <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n </i>may be integrated into one or more of the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> without departing from a scope of the three-dimensional package <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Active cooling mechanisms <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n </i>may generally be defined as cooling mechanisms that consume electrical energy during their operation and are generally more effective at removing heat as compared with passive cooling mechanisms. Active cooling mechanisms <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n </i>may therefore be controlled by variations in the electrical energy supplied to the active cooling mechanisms <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n</i>. According to an example, the active cooling mechanisms <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n </i>comprise thermoelectric coolers, which include a P-type material plate and an N-type material plate. The P-type material plate and the N-type material plate may operate by the Peltier effect to draw heat from the first die <b>102</b> and deliver the heat to the second die <b>104</b>, which may act to spread the heat. In this example, the active cooling mechanisms <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n </i>may be electrically connected to the substrate <b>110</b> to receive direct current (DC) power.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to another example, the active cooling mechanisms <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n </i>comprise other types of mechanisms, such as, cold plates through which a cooling fluid flows is pumped. In this example, an electronically controllable pump (not shown) may be operated to vary the cooling fluid flow through the cold plates and thereby vary the amount of heat removed from the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b>. In addition, or alternatively, the cold plates may include insulating material that may be pumped therethrough to vary the amount of heat transferred between the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b>, for instance. The active cooling mechanisms <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n </i>may individually controllable, such that, active cooling mechanisms <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n </i>positioned between different sets of die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> may be activated at different times, for instance. By way of particular example, the active cooling mechanisms <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n </i>may comprise liquid cooled loops with controllable valves that may be opened as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In any regard, the active cooling mechanisms <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n </i>may strategically be placed at various locations with respect to the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b>. The various locations may include those locations known to dissipate the greatest amount of heat, such as, local hot spots on one or more of the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b>. In this regard, heat removal from the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> may be targeted, thereby substantially optimizing energy efficiency in operating the active cooling mechanisms <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n. </i></p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Although the active cooling mechanisms <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n </i>have been depicted as being positioned between the first die <b>102</b> and the second die <b>104</b>, active cooling mechanisms <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n </i>may also be positioned between the second die <b>104</b> and the third die <b>106</b>, between the first die <b>102</b> and the third die <b>106</b>, across multiple die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b>, etc. In addition, the three-dimensional package <b>100</b> may include any reasonably suitable number of die and active cooling mechanisms without departing from a scope of the three-dimensional package <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The three-dimensional package <b>100</b> may also be equipped with other types of cooling mechanisms, both active and passive. Passive cooling mechanisms may generally be defined as mechanisms that are configured to dissipate heat generated by one or more of the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> or the package <b>100</b> itself, without requiring electrical energy. Some of these active and passive cooling mechanisms are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. As shown therein, passive cooling mechanisms, such as heat sinks <b>140</b>, may be positioned along various axes of a three-dimensional package <b>100</b>. Although not shown, other types of passive cooling mechanisms, such as, heat pipes, may also be positioned between two or more of the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> and may be thermally connected to one or more heat sinks <b>140</b> to convey heat from the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> to the one or more heat sinks <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, some or all of the active cooling mechanisms <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n </i>may be integrally formed with at least one of the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b>. The active cooling mechanisms <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n </i>are further depicted as including an electronically controllable fan <b>150</b> configured to provide airflow to one or more packages <b>100</b>. The active cooling mechanisms <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n </i>may also include one or more nozzles <b>160</b> for supplying either cooling fluid, either liquid or air, to the packages <b>100</b>. In one example, the nozzles <b>160</b> may be configured and operated to provide substantially precise delivery of the cooling fluid to desired locations on the packages <b>100</b>. In another example, the nozzles <b>160</b> may be controlled to deliver the cooling fluid according to the amount of heat generated in the packages <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It should be understood that the various package <b>100</b> and cooling provisioning configurations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> may be modified without departing from a scope of the three-dimensional package <b>100</b> and cooling system discussed herein. For instance, one or more packages <b>100</b> may be stacked on top of each other, packages <b>100</b> may be arranged to lie on their sides, heat sinks <b>140</b> may be attached to multiple packages <b>100</b>, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is shown a simplified block diagram of a system <b>200</b> for managing cooling provisioning in a three-dimensional package <b>100</b> with a cooling system having at least one active cooling mechanism <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n</i>. It should be understood that the system <b>200</b> may include additional components and that one or more of the components described herein may be removed and/or modified without departing from a scope of the system <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown therein, the system <b>200</b> includes a controller <b>202</b> configured to perform various computing operations in the system <b>200</b>. The controller <b>202</b> may comprise, for instance, one of the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> in a package, a processor remotely located from the package <b>100</b>, a computing device, etc. Alternatively, however, the controller <b>202</b> may comprise software stored on a computer readable storage medium, that when implemented, is configured to perform various operations in the system <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the controller <b>202</b> is configured to receive input from one or more sensors <b>204</b> and/or a workload monitor <b>206</b>. The controller <b>202</b> is configured to control either or both of the one or more active cooling mechanisms <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n </i>and the one or more die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> based upon the input received from either or both of the sensor(s) <b>204</b> and the workload monitor <b>206</b>. In performing these operations, the controller <b>202</b> may store the received input in a memory <b>208</b>, which may comprise one of the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b>. In one example, the controller <b>202</b> may access programs or algorithms stored in the memory <b>208</b> in determining how the active cooling mechanism(s) <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n </i>are to be manipulated based upon the data contained in the input. In another example, the controller <b>202</b> may access programs or algorithms stored in the memory <b>208</b> in determining how workloads should be placed on the respective die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> based upon the data contained in the input. Various programs or algorithms stored in the memory <b>208</b> are described below with respect to the flow diagrams.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The sensor(s) <b>204</b> may be configured and positioned to detect one or more environmental conditions, such as, temperature, vibration, airflow, optical conditions, etc. By way of example, the sensors <b>204</b> may comprise temperature sensors configured and positioned to detect the temperatures of one or more of the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b>. According to this example, the sensor(s) <b>204</b> may be positioned to detect temperatures at particular locations on the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b>, such as, known hot spots of the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b>. In addition, or alternatively, the sensor(s) <b>204</b> may monitor a condition that may be calculated to determine a correlated condition. For instance, the sensor(s) <b>204</b> may monitor electrical resistance and may calculate temperature from the monitored electrical resistance. In any regard, the controller <b>202</b> may process the temperature information received from the sensor(s) <b>204</b> to determine the workload on each of the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b>. More particularly, for instance, the controller <b>202</b> may correlate a particular workload level from the detected environmental condition at or around the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In addition, or alternatively, the controller <b>202</b> may determine the workload in each of the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> based upon information received from the workload monitor <b>206</b>. The workload monitor <b>206</b> may comprise, for instance, hardware and/or software configured to at least one of predict and track workloads and to determine which of the packages <b>100</b> is capable of performing the requested workloads. The workload monitor <b>206</b> may therefore communicate the workload requests to the controller <b>202</b> and the controller <b>202</b> may determine on which of the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> in one or more packages <b>100</b> the workload is to be placed based upon various considerations as discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">With reference first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is shown a flow diagram of a method <b>300</b> for managing cooling provisioning in a three-dimensional package <b>100</b> containing a plurality of stacked die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> with a cooling system having at least one active cooling mechanism <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n</i>, according to an example. It should be understood that the method <b>300</b> may include additional steps and that one or more of the steps described herein may be removed and/or modified without departing from a scope of the method <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The description of the method <b>300</b> is made with reference to the system <b>200</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and thus makes particular reference to the elements contained in the system <b>200</b>. It should, however, be understood that the method <b>300</b> may be implemented in a system that differs from the system <b>200</b> without departing from a scope of the method <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Generally speaking, the controller <b>202</b> may implement the method <b>300</b> to efficiently manage cooling provisioning in a three-dimensional package <b>100</b> containing a plurality of stacked die. In one example, cooling provisioning may be efficiently managed by selectively activating one or more active cooling mechanisms according to the workloads, and thus, the environmental conditions, of the plurality of stacked die. In another example, the cooling provisioning may be efficiently managed by selectively placing workloads, such as, storage of data, onto those stacked die that are operable to be cooled with minimal energy consumption by the at least one active cooling mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">With particular reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, at step <b>302</b>, the controller <b>202</b> identifies at least one of workloads on and an environmental condition at or around one or more of the stacked die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b>. According to an example, the controller <b>202</b> may identify the workloads from environmental condition data received from the one or more sensors <b>204</b>. In this example, the controller <b>202</b> may correlate, for instance, the temperature data with particular workload levels. For instance, the correlation between temperature levels and workload levels may be stored as a lookup table in the memory <b>208</b>, which the controller <b>202</b> may access in identifying the workloads. According to another example, the controller <b>202</b> may simply store the environmental condition data received from the one or more sensors <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to a further example, the controller <b>202</b> may identify the workloads from data received from the workload monitor <b>206</b>. In this example, the workload monitor <b>206</b> may track or predict the workloads that have been or are scheduled to be assigned to the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> and may communicate this information to the controller <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">At step <b>304</b>, the controller <b>202</b> controls one or both of the at least one active cooling mechanism and at least one of the plurality of stacked die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> based upon one or both of the identified workload and environmental condition.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Steps <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> may be repeated to continuously identify the workloads and/or environmental conditions on the stacked die and to continuously update control of the at least one active cooling mechanism <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n </i>and the stacked die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> based upon the identified workloads and/or environmental conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to an example, at step <b>304</b>, a plurality of the stacked die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> may be controlled to perform the same workload through allocation of the same workload to the plurality of stacked die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> to, for instance, provide redundancy in the performance of the workload. For instance, where the workload comprises storage of data, the data may be stored on multiple die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> to provide redundant storage of the data.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, there is shown a flow diagram of a method <b>400</b> for managing cooling provisioning in a three-dimensional package <b>100</b> containing a plurality of stacked die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> with a cooling system having at least one active cooling mechanism <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n</i>, according to an example. In the method <b>400</b>, steps <b>404</b> and <b>406</b> are more detailed illustrations of an example of step <b>304</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown, at step <b>402</b>, the controller compares the workloads on and/or environmental conditions at or around the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> identified at step <b>302</b> with a predetermined threshold (PT) range for each of the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b>. The PT range may be the same for each of the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b>, for instance, when the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> are configured to operate at around the same environmental conditions. Alternatively, the PT range may differ for one or more of the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b>, for instance, when one or more of the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> are configured to perform different types of workloads.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">At step <b>402</b>, if the identified workload for a die <b>102</b> exceeds the PT range, the controller <b>202</b> activates one or more active cooling mechanisms <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n </i>to increase cooling provisioning supplied to the die <b>102</b>, as indicated at step <b>404</b>. If, however, the identified workload falls below the PT range, and if at least one of the active cooling mechanisms <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n </i>is currently active, at step <b>406</b>, the controller <b>202</b> deactivates one or more of the active cooling mechanisms <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n </i>to decrease cooling provisioning supplied to the die <b>102</b> and therefore conserves energy.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the controller <b>202</b> controls the at least one active cooling mechanism <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n </i>based upon an &#x201c;as needed&#x201d; basis, thereby substantially minimizing the amount of energy associated with operating the at least one active cooling mechanism <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n</i>. In addition, the controller <b>202</b> may separately control a plurality of active cooling mechanisms <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n </i>to provide substantially focalized cooing provisioning, which may also substantially minimize energy consumption. In other words, the controller <b>202</b> may activate one or more of the active cooling mechanisms <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n </i>while simultaneously deactivating other ones of active cooling mechanisms <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n</i>, depending upon, for instance, the locations of the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> and whether not the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> require additional cooling or may operate with lesser amounts of cooling.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In any regard, following either or both of steps <b>404</b> and <b>406</b>, step <b>302</b> may be repeated to again identify workloads on and/or environmental conditions at or around the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b>, and may repeat steps <b>402</b>-<b>406</b> to substantially continuously monitor the workloads and/or environmental conditions and to substantially continuously control the active cooling mechanisms <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n </i>based upon changing conditions in the stacked die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to an example, the cooling system includes a plurality of active cooling mechanisms <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n </i>and the controller is configured to compare the workloads and/or environmental conditions with a plurality of PT ranges. In this example, during a first iteration of the method <b>400</b>, the workload and/or environmental condition identified at step <b>302</b> is compared with a first PT range at step <b>402</b> and at least one of the active cooling mechanisms <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n </i>is controlled in response to the identified workload and/or environmental condition exceeding the first PT range at steps <b>404</b> and <b>406</b>. In addition, for instance, when the identified workload and/or environmental condition exceeds the first PT range, during a second iteration of the method <b>400</b>, the identified workload and/or environmental condition is compared with a second PT range, which comprises a higher threshold as compared with the first PT range. Based on the comparison, one or more second active cooling mechanisms <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<b>130</b><i>n </i>are controlled at steps <b>404</b> and <b>406</b>. By way of example, at step <b>404</b>, a second active cooling mechanism <b>130</b><i>b </i>may be activated in response to the identified workload exceeding the second PT range to supplying greater cooling provisioning to one or more of the die <b>102</b>-<b>106</b>.</p>
