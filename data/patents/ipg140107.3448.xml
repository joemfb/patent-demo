<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to liquid crystal displaying technologies, and particularly, to a circuit for eliminating threshold voltage differences between backlight LED strings and a liquid crystal display using the same.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Due to advantages of light emitting diodes (LEDs) such as long lasting, energy saving, and easily to be driven, LEDs are widely used in various electronic devices, such as backlight modules of liquid crystal displays (LCDs). The backlight module generally includes edge-lighting type backlight modules and direct type backlight modules. In the direct type backlight modules, the LEDs are located under the liquid crystal panel. In the edge-lighting type of the backlight modules, a number of LED strings are disposed around a liquid crystal panel of the LCD. Each of the LED string includes a number of LEDs connected in series.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the manufacturing process of the LED backlight modules, the LEDs are connected in series to from the LED strings respectively. Due to the different manufacturing technology, threshold voltages of the LED strings may be different from each other to result in a threshold voltage difference between two LED strings. This may further result in energy consumptions on MOS transistors respectively connected to the LED strings and further increases of the temperatures of the MOS transistors. In this state, not only the performance of the MOS transistors are influenced, but also constant current integrated circuits used for respectively controlling the LED strings are heated to consume energy, which reduces efficiency of the backlight module.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Generally, a current of each of the LED strings can be increased and an on state duration t or a duty ratio D of each of the LED strings can be reduced to reduce the voltage differences between the LED strings.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To a first LED string, according to the calculating formula of the duty ratio D: D=t/T=t*F, (wherein t refers to the on state duration, T refers to an on state period, and F refers to a threshold frequency), when the threshold voltage (labeled as V<sub>f</sub>) equal to 40V, the current I is equal to 10 mA, the on state duration t is equal to 1 s, and the on state period T is equal to 10 s, the duty ratio D of the first LED string can be calculated to be 10% and a threshold energy for turning on the first LED string reaches 0.4 J according to the following expression: W=V<sub>f</sub>*I*D*T=0.4 J.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Due to the manufacturing difference between the LED strings, the threshold energy for turning on a second LED string can reach W=0.75 J when the threshold voltage V<sub>f </sub>thereof is equal to 50V, the current I thereof is equal to 15 mA, and the duty ratio D is the same as that of the first LED string. Therefore, the threshold energies of the two LED strings are different from each other and the brightness of the two LED strings may become different from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In other situations, the on state duration t may be changed to adjust the duty ratio D to allow the threshold energy of the second LED string to reach 0.4 J, thus, the threshold energy of the second LED string can keep the same as that of the first LED string.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, the on state duration t cannot be reduced unlimitedly due to the interior structure of the constant current integrated circuit, therefore, the energy consumption of each of the LED strings cannot be reduced unlimitedly.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, there is room for improvement in the art.</p>

It should be noted that references to &#x201c;an&#x201d; or &#x201c;one&#x201d; embodiment in this disclosure are not necessarily to the same embodiment, and such references mean at least one.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a circuit is used for eliminating a threshold voltage difference between two backlight LED strings. The circuit includes a first LED string <b>10</b>, a second LED string <b>20</b> connected to the first LED string <b>10</b> in parallel, two first switching units (labeled as Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> in the embodiment) respectively connected to the first and second LED strings <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>, a first resistor R<b>1</b> connected to one of the first switching units, and a second resistor R<b>2</b> connected to the other one of the first switching units. It is noted the number of the LED string is not limited to this embodiment. In other embodiments, the circuit may include more than two LED strings.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">One ends of the two LED strings <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> are connected to a voltage supply input V+. Each of the LED strings includes a number of LEDs connected to each other in series. For example, in the embodiment, the first LED string <b>10</b> includes a second LED D<b>2</b> with an anode thereof connected to the voltage supply input V+, and a first LED D<b>1</b>, a forth LED D<b>4</b>, and a third LED D<b>3</b> connected to an cathode of the second LED D<b>2</b> in series. The second LED string <b>20</b> includes a sixth LED D<b>6</b> with the anode thereof connected to the voltage supply input V+, and a fifth LED D<b>5</b>, an eighth LED D<b>8</b> and a seventh LED D<b>7</b> connected to the cathode of the sixth LED D<b>6</b> in series.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The two switching units Q<b>1</b>, Q<b>2</b> are both n-channel type metal oxide semiconductor field effect (NMOS) transistors and are respectively connected to the other ends of the two LED strings <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>. A drain D of the switching unit Q<b>1</b> is connected to the cathode of the third LED D<b>3</b> and a source S thereof is grounded via the first resistor R<b>1</b>. A drain D of the switching unit Q<b>2</b> is connected to the cathode of the seventh LED D<b>7</b> and a source S thereof is grounded via the second resistor R<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Since one ends of the two LED strings <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> are respectively connected to the same voltage supply input V+, therefore, voltages respectively inputted to the LED strings <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> are the same as each other. However, due to the difference in the manufacturing technology, threshold voltages of the two LED strings <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> are different from each other. This results in the difference between the voltages being respectively applied to the two switching units Q<b>1</b>, Q<b>2</b>. Thus, the energy consumptions on the two switching units Q<b>1</b>, Q<b>2</b> in an on state period of the LED strings <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> are also different from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to the relationship between a duty ratio D and a threshold frequency F of a MOS transistor: D=t*F, the duty ratio D of each of the first switching units can be adjusted by changing the threshold frequency F thereof to further eliminate the threshold voltage difference between the two LED strings <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>. In this way, the two LED strings <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> can have the same brightness level, and the energy consumption on each of the LED strings can be reduced, and the energy converting efficiency can be further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In order to eliminate the threshold voltage difference between the two LED strings <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>, the circuit further includes a constant current controller <b>30</b> connected to the two first switching units Q<b>1</b>, Q<b>2</b> for controlling the threshold frequencies of the two switching units Q<b>1</b>, Q<b>2</b>. The constant current controller <b>30</b> includes a constant current source <b>301</b>, a third resistor R<b>3</b>, a current detector <b>302</b>, a comparator <b>303</b>, and a square wave generator <b>304</b>. It is noted that in other embodiments, the constant current controller <b>30</b> may be disposed in a constant current integrated circuit (IC), or the two switching units Q<b>1</b>, Q<b>2</b> and the constant current controller <b>30</b> may be disposed in the constant current IC.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The constant current source <b>301</b> is used for supplying constant currents to the two LED strings <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> respectively. One end of the third resistor R<b>3</b> is connected to the constant current source <b>301</b> and the other end thereof is grounded. The current detector <b>302</b> is connected to the sources of the two switching units Q<b>1</b>, Q<b>2</b> for detecting the working currents of the two switching units Q<b>1</b>, Q<b>2</b> respectively. The comparator <b>303</b> is connected to the constant current source <b>301</b> and the current detector <b>302</b> for respectively receiving the constant current from the constant current source and the working currents of the two LED strings <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>. The comparator <b>303</b> is capable of comparing the constant current with the working current, and generating a comparing result. The square wave generator <b>304</b> is connected to the comparator <b>303</b> for receiving the comparing result and generating two corresponding driving signals to respectively drive each of the switching units Q<b>1</b>, Q<b>2</b> to work at the corresponding frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the square wave generator <b>304</b> includes two second switching units (labeled as Q<b>3</b> and Q<b>4</b> in the embodiment), a first oscillator <b>3041</b>, a second oscillator <b>3042</b>, a first amplifier <b>3043</b>, and a second amplifier <b>3044</b>. In the embodiment, the two switching units Q<b>3</b>, Q<b>4</b> are NMOS transistors. And the first and second oscillators <b>3041</b>, <b>3042</b> are crystal oscillators of high precision and high stability which are commonly used in various kinds of oscillating circuits and telecommunication systems. It is noted that the number of the second switching units, the oscillators, and the amplifiers are not limited to this embodiment. In some embodiments, the square wave generator <b>304</b> may include more than two second switching units, more than two oscillators, and more than two amplifiers.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The two switching units Q<b>3</b>, Q<b>4</b> are connected to the comparator <b>303</b> for receiving the comparing result from the comparator <b>303</b>. In this state, the output impedances of the two switching units Q<b>3</b>, Q<b>4</b> are respectively changed according to the comparing result. Specifically, both gates G of the two switching units Q<b>3</b>, Q<b>4</b> are connected to the comparator <b>303</b>, and both sources S thereof are grounded. The first oscillator <b>3041</b> and the second oscillator <b>3042</b> are respectively connected to the drains D of the two switching units Q<b>3</b>, Q<b>4</b>. The oscillating frequencies of the first and second oscillators <b>3041</b>, <b>3042</b> are capable of being changed to generate the driving signals to the two switching units Q<b>1</b>, Q<b>2</b> according to the impedances of the two switching units Q<b>3</b>, Q<b>4</b>. The first and second amplifiers <b>3043</b>, <b>3044</b> are respectively connected to the first and second oscillators <b>3041</b>, <b>3042</b> for amplifying the driving signals respectively and outputting the amplified driving signals to the two switching units Q<b>1</b>, Q<b>2</b>. Thus, each of the two switching units Q<b>1</b>, Q<b>2</b> is capable of working at the corresponding frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In operation, the constant current source <b>301</b> outputs the constant current to the comparator <b>303</b> and to the two LED strings <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>. In the embodiment, the constant current of the constant current source <b>301</b> can be adjusted by changing the resistance of the third resistor R<b>3</b>. The current detector <b>302</b> detects the working currents of the two LED strings <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> by obtaining the currents of the first and second resistors R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>. The current detector <b>302</b> then outputs the working currents of the two LED strings <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> to the comparator <b>303</b> to allow the comparator <b>303</b> to compare the working currents of the two LED strings <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> with the constant current from the current constant source <b>301</b>. The comparator then outputs the comparing result to the square wave generator <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The square wave generator <b>304</b> receives the comparing result and generates two corresponding driving signals based on the received comparing result to drive the two first switching units Q<b>1</b>, Q<b>2</b> to work at the corresponding frequencies respectively. Specifically, the two switching units Q<b>3</b>, Q<b>4</b> of the square wave generator <b>304</b> respectively receive the comparing result from the comparator <b>303</b>. After the comparing result is received, the output impedances of the two switching units Q<b>3</b>, Q<b>4</b> are changed and then are outputted to the first and second oscillators <b>3041</b>, <b>3042</b> respectively. The oscillating frequencies of the first and second oscillators <b>3041</b>, <b>3042</b> thus are adjusted to generate the first and second driving signals. The first and second driving signals then are amplified by the first and second amplifiers <b>3043</b>, <b>3044</b> for driving the two switching units Q<b>1</b>, Q<b>2</b> to work under the first and second frequencies respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Since the two switching units Q<b>1</b>, Q<b>2</b> work at different frequencies, therefore, the threshold frequency of the each of the first switching units can be changed to adjust the duty ratio D thereof. In this state, the difference of the threshold voltage between the two LED strings <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> can be eliminated to allow the two LED strings <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> to have the same brightness level. Thus, the energy consumption of each of the LED strings can be reduced and the energy converting efficiency can be improved.</p>
