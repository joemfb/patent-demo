<heading id="h-0001" level="1">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from Japanese patent application No. 2011-010440, filed on Jan. 21, 2011, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a thin film transistor, an active matrix substrate, and a manufacturing method thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A TFT active matrix substrate (which is hereinafter referred to simply as &#x201c;TFT substrate&#x201d;) using a thin film transistor (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;TFT&#x201d;) as a switching element is an example of semiconductor devices. The TFT substrate is used for an electro-optical device such as a display device. The semiconductor device such as TFT has features of low power consumption and low profile. Taking advantage of such features of the semiconductor device, its application to a flat panel display as an alternative to a cathode ray tube (CRT) is increasing.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is a demand for cost reduction for the semiconductor device. For this reason, a back-channel TFT is widely used for a switching element of a TFT substrate for liquid crystal displays. In the back-channel TFT for liquid crystal displays, amorphous silicon (Si) is typically used as a semiconductor active layer, and an inverted staggered structure is adopted.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, development of a TFT using an oxide semiconductor for an active layer has been growing active recently (cf. Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publications Nos. 2007-284342 and 2007-73702). The oxide semiconductor has a higher mobility than amorphous silicon used hitherto. As the oxide semiconductor, zinc oxide (ZnO) or IGZO containing gallium oxide (Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and indium oxide (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) in addition to zinc oxide (ZnO) is mainly used. This technique is disclosed also in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2005-77822, Nature Vol. 432(2004) p. 488, and Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2007-115902, for example. An oxide semiconductor film has a high translucency. For example, the technique of applying an oxide semiconductor film having a transmittance of 70% or higher for visible light of 400 nm to 800 nm is disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2007-115902.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The above-described oxide semiconductor film is insoluble in an alkaline developer for photoresist, just like an oxide conductive film such as ITO (indium oxide (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)+tin oxide (SnO<sub>2</sub>)) and IZO (indium oxide (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)+zinc oxide (ZnO)), which are known as a transparent conductive film. In addition, the oxide semiconductor film can be etched using a weak acid solution such as oxalic acid or carboxylic acid. Thus, the oxide semiconductor film has an advantage that patterning is easy.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">On the other hand, the oxide semiconductor film easily solves in an acid solution which is commonly used when etching a general metal film (Cr, Ti, Mo, Ta, Al and an alloy of them) used for a source electrode and a drain electrode of a TFT. Therefore, when manufacturing a TFT using an oxide semiconductor for an active layer, the technique disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2008-72011, for example, is used. According to the technique, the type of a metal film, an etching solution of a metal film, and an oxide semiconductor film is appropriately selected for manufacture. This enables selective etching by which only the metal film for the source electrode and the drain electrode is etched and the oxide semiconductor film remains unetched.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">To manufacture a TFT substrate, a metal film and a semiconductor film are sequentially formed. Then, after a photoresist pattern is formed in a photolithography process, etching is performed. A wiring, electrode and semiconductor pattern is thereby formed. In this way, a TFT substrate is manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">When there is an anomaly in the pattern of wiring, electrode or semiconductor, a failure occurs in a performance test after the process is completed, resulting in a decrease in yield. To avoid this, inspection of the final shape of the pattern is performed as appropriate after each process of manufacture in some cases. Namely, it is important for cost reduction to detect a pattern failure in the early stage before completion of products.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The detection of a pattern failure is typically performed by observing the pattern using an optical microscope and inspecting the pattern shape. The inspection of the pattern shape may be performed by automatically reading image data and comparing it with normal shape data or by direct visual examination.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">However, in the case of inspecting the pattern shape using the image through the optical microscope, the following problem occurs. Specifically, the inspection of a material with high transmittance like the oxide semiconductor film is difficult compared to a material that reflects light like the metal film, causing a decrease in detection sensitivity. This leads to a decrease in productivity.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further, as described above, in the case of using a known typical oxide semiconductor film, selective etching with a known typical metal film as a wiring and electrode material using a chemical solution is difficult. Accordingly, the variety of combinations of a metal film, a semiconductor film and an etching chemical solution is limited. This raises an issue that the range of choice of materials in improvement of TFT characteristics or the like is significantly restricted.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention has been accomplished in view of the above circumstances, and it is desirable to provide a thin film transistor allowing a broad range of choice of materials and having high productivity, an active matrix substrate, and a manufacturing method thereof.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">First Exemplary Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A TFT substrate according to an exemplary embodiment is an active matrix substrate using a thin film transistor (TFT) as a switching element. The TFT substrate is used for a flat panel display such as a liquid crystal display (LCD). First, the TFT substrate is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a plan view showing the structure of the TFT substrate. Detailed description is provided below by taking the TFT substrate for the LCD as an example.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A TFT substrate <b>100</b> is a TFT array substrate in which TFTs <b>108</b> are arranged in a matrix, for example. On the TFT substrate <b>100</b>, a display area <b>101</b> and a frame area <b>102</b> surrounding the display area <b>101</b> are laid out. In the display area <b>101</b>, a plurality of gate lines (scan signal lines) <b>22</b>, a plurality of auxiliary capacitor electrodes <b>3</b>, and a plurality of source lines (display signal lines) <b>27</b> are placed.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The plurality of gate lines <b>22</b> are laid out in parallel. The plurality of source lines <b>27</b> are also laid out in parallel. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the gate lines <b>22</b> are placed horizontally, and the source lines <b>27</b> are placed vertically. The gate lines <b>22</b> and the source lines <b>27</b> are arranged to intersect with each other. Further, the gate lines <b>22</b> and the source lines <b>27</b> are orthogonal to each other. A region surrounded by the adjacent gate lines <b>22</b> and the adjacent source lines <b>27</b> is a pixel <b>105</b>. In the TFT substrate <b>100</b>, the pixels <b>105</b> are arranged in matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The plurality of auxiliary capacitor electrodes <b>3</b> are placed in parallel with the plurality of gate lines <b>22</b>. The auxiliary capacitor electrodes <b>3</b> are respectively placed between the adjacent gate lines <b>22</b>. Thus, the gate lines <b>22</b> and the auxiliary capacitor electrodes <b>3</b> are arranged alternately with each other. The auxiliary capacitor electrodes <b>3</b> and the source lines <b>27</b> are arranged to intersect with each other. Further, the auxiliary capacitor electrodes <b>3</b> and the source lines <b>27</b> are orthogonal to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Further, a scan signal driver <b>103</b> and a display signal driver <b>104</b> are placed in the frame area <b>102</b> of the TFT substrate <b>100</b>. The gate lines <b>22</b> extend from the display area <b>101</b> to the frame area <b>102</b>. The gate lines <b>22</b> are connected to the scan signal driver <b>103</b> at the end of the TFT substrate <b>100</b>. The source lines <b>27</b> also extend from the display area <b>101</b> to the frame area <b>102</b>. The source lines <b>27</b> are connected to the display signal driver <b>104</b> at the end of the TFT substrate <b>100</b>. An external wiring <b>106</b> is connected in close proximity to the scan signal driver <b>103</b>. Further, an external wiring <b>107</b> is connected in close proximity to the display signal driver <b>104</b>. The external wirings <b>106</b> and <b>107</b> are wiring boards such as a flexible printed circuit (FPC), for example.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Various kinds of external signals are supplied to the scan signal driver <b>103</b> and the display signal driver <b>104</b> through the external wirings <b>106</b> and <b>107</b>. The scan signal driver <b>103</b> supplies a gate signal (scan signal) to the gate lines <b>22</b> according to an external control signal. In response to the gate signal, the gate lines <b>22</b> are sequentially selected. The display signal driver <b>104</b> supplies a display signal to the source lines <b>27</b> according to an external control signal or display data. A display voltage corresponding to the display data can be thereby supplied to the respective pixels <b>105</b>. Note that the scan signal driver <b>103</b> and the display signal driver <b>104</b> are not necessarily placed on the TFT substrate <b>100</b>. For example, the drivers may be connected by tape carrier package (TCP). Further, the auxiliary capacitor electrodes <b>3</b> overlap a pixel electrode, which is described later, and form an auxiliary capacitor together with the pixel electrode. For example, a common voltage is supplied to the auxiliary capacitor electrodes <b>3</b> from the scan signal driver <b>103</b>, the display signal driver <b>104</b> or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the pixel <b>105</b>, at least one TFT <b>108</b> is placed. The TFT <b>108</b> is placed in close proximity to an intersection between the source line <b>27</b> and the gate line <b>22</b>. The TFT <b>108</b> serves as a switching element for supplying a display voltage to the pixel electrode, for example. A gate electrode of the TFT <b>108</b> is connected to the gate line <b>22</b>, and ON and OFF of the TFT <b>108</b> are controlled according to a gate signal that is input through the gate terminal. A source electrode of the TFT <b>108</b> is connected to the source line <b>27</b>. When a voltage is applied to the gate electrode and the TFT <b>108</b> is turned ON, a current flows from the source line <b>27</b>. A display voltage is thereby applied to the pixel electrode that is connected to a drain electrode of the TFT <b>108</b>. Then, an electric field corresponding to the display voltage is generated between the pixel electrode and a counter electrode. Note that an alignment film (not shown) may be placed on the surface of the TFT substrate <b>100</b>. The TFT substrate <b>100</b> has the above-described structure.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Further, in the case of the liquid crystal display, a counter substrate is disposed opposite to the TFT substrate <b>100</b>. The counter substrate is a color filter substrate, for example, and placed on the viewing side. In the counter substrate, a color filter, a black matrix (BM), a counter electrode, an alignment film and the like are placed. In the case of an IPS liquid crystal display, for example, the counter electrode is placed on the TFT substrate <b>100</b> side. The TFT substrate <b>100</b> and the counter substrate are attached with a certain space (cell gap) therebetween. Liquid crystals are injected and sealed in the gap. In other words, a liquid crystal layer is placed between the TFT substrate <b>100</b> and the counter substrate. Further, a polarizing plate, a phase difference plate and so on are placed on the respective outer sides of the TFT substrate <b>100</b> and the counter substrate. Furthermore, a backlight unit or the like is placed on the non-viewing side of the liquid crystal display panel having the above structure. Because the TFT substrate <b>100</b> is placed on the non-viewing side and the counter substrate is placed on the viewing side, the backlight unit is placed on the outer side of the TFT substrate <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The liquid crystals are driven by the electric field between the pixel electrode and the counter electrode. Specifically, the orientation of the liquid crystals between the substrates varies. The polarization state of light passing through the liquid crystal layer is thereby changed. Specifically, the polarization state of light that has been linearly polarized through the polarizing plate is changed by the liquid crystal layer. To be more precise, light from the backlight unit is linearly polarized by the polarizing plate on the TFT substrate <b>100</b> side. The linearly polarized light then passes through the liquid crystal layer, thereby changing its polarization state.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Accordingly, the amount of light passing through the polarizing plate on the counter substrate side varies depending on the polarization state. Specifically, the amount of light passing through the polarizing plate on the viewing side, among transmitted light that is transmitted through the liquid crystal display panel from the backlight unit, varies. The orientation of the liquid crystals varies by the applied display voltage. Thus, the amount of light passing through the polarizing plate on the viewing side can be changed by controlling the display voltage. Specifically, a desired image can be displayed by changing the display voltage with respect to each pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The structure of the pixel <b>105</b> of the TFT substrate <b>100</b> is described hereinafter with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a plan view schematically showing a pixel structure, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional view along line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, on a substrate <b>1</b> are a gate electrode <b>2</b>, a gate insulating film <b>4</b>, a semiconductor layer <b>5</b>, a source electrode <b>7</b>, a drain electrode <b>8</b>, a channel part <b>9</b>, a protective insulating film <b>10</b>, a contact hole <b>11</b>, and a pixel electrode <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The substrate <b>1</b> is a transparent insulating substrate such as glass, for example. On the substrate <b>1</b>, the gate lines <b>22</b> and the auxiliary capacitor electrodes <b>3</b> are placed. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the gate lines <b>22</b> are laid out horizontally. The gate line <b>22</b> has the gate electrode <b>2</b> of the TFT <b>108</b>. Specifically, the gate line <b>22</b> at the TFT <b>108</b> serves as the gate electrode <b>2</b>. The gate electrode <b>2</b> is wider than the gate line <b>22</b>. The auxiliary capacitor electrodes <b>3</b> are arranged side by side with the gate lines <b>22</b>. Further, an extension part which extends from the auxiliary capacitor electrode <b>3</b> is placed in close proximity to the source line <b>27</b>. The extension part of the auxiliary capacitor electrodes <b>3</b> is in parallel with the source line <b>27</b>.

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">First, the substrate <b>1</b> is cleaned with a cleaning fluid or pure water.

As the first metal film, chromium (Cr), molybdenum (Mo), titanium (Ti), tantalum (Ta), tungsten (W), aluminum (Al), or an alloy with another trace element added to these metals may be used, for example. Further, the first metal film may have a laminated structure composed of two or more layers of those metals or alloy. By using such metals or alloy, it is possible to obtain a low-resistance film with a specific resistance of 50 &#x3bc;&#x3a9;cm or less</p>

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In this exemplary embodiment, an Al-3 mol % Ni alloy film with 3 mol % Ni added is used as the first metal film. The Al-3 mol % Ni alloy film is deposited with a thickness of 200 nm by sputtering using known Ar gas. After that, a photoresist pattern is formed by the first photolithography process. Etching is performed using the photoresist pattern as a mask. In this example, wet etching is performed using a known solution containing phosphoric acid, nitric acid and acetic acid. By removing the photoresist pattern after the etching, the gate electrode <b>2</b>, the auxiliary capacitor electrodes <b>3</b> and the like are formed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In this exemplary embodiment, a silicon nitride film (SiN) to serve as the gate insulating film <b>4</b> is formed using chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In this example, a silicon nitride film with a thickness of 300 nm is deposited under the substrate heating condition of about 300&#xb0; C. After that, the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a </i>is deposited by sputtering using an oxide target having an amorphous structure (hereinafter referred to as IGZO). In this example, the IGZO target with an atomic composition ratio of In:Ga:Zn:O=1:1:1:4 is used. The oxide film is deposited by sputtering using known Ar gas (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In this case, the proportion of oxygen atom is generally lower than the stoichiometric composition, producing an oxide film in oxygen ion deficient state (in the above example, the proportion of O is less than 4). It is thereby preferred to perform sputtering using Ar gas mixed with oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) gas. In this exemplary embodiment, sputtering is performed using a mixed gas prepared by adding O<sub>2 </sub>gas with a partial pressure ratio of 10% to Ar gas. The IGZO film is deposited with a thickness of 50 nm in this example.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A measurement result of the transmittance of the IGZO film is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the transmittance of the structure using the IGZO film as an example 1.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the horizontal axis indicates a light wavelength, and the vertical axis indicates a transmittance. The IGZO film has a high transmittance of 85.9% for a wavelength of 550 nm, though the transmittance is lower than that of the ITO film.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">After that, an Al film is deposited as the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b</i>. Note that the Al film may be a pure Al film or an Al alloy film predominantly composed of Al. The Al alloy film predominantly composed of Al is a film in which the content percentage of Al is the highest compared with other elements. In this example, the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>is an Al-3 mol % Ni film with 3 mol % nickel (Ni) added to Al is used as the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b</i>. The Al-3 mol % Ni film is deposited with a thickness of 20 nm by sputtering using known Ar gas. The light-reflecting ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>can be thereby formed. The structure in which the gate insulating film <b>4</b>, the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a </i>and the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>are laminated is thereby produced as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Next, a photoresist pattern <b>13</b> is formed by the second photolithography process. A novolac resin type positive photoresist is used in this example. The photoresist is applied with a thickness of about 1.6 &#x3bc;m by a slit coater or a spin coater. After that, exposure is performed using a photomask. Further, development is performed using an organic alkaline developer containing tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH). The photoresist pattern <b>13</b> can be thereby formed on the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. The photoresist pattern <b>13</b> is formed in an island shape and disposed in a region to become the TFT. Thus, the photoresist pattern <b>13</b> remains in the region to leave the pattern of the semiconductor layer <b>5</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">At the same time, the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>is etched away by the same developer using the photoresist pattern <b>13</b> as a mask. Thus, development of the photoresist pattern <b>13</b> and etching of the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>are performed in the same step. In the case of using an alkaline solution with TMAH 2.4% mass concentration as the developer at room temperature (23&#xb0; C.), for example, the Al-3 mol % Ni film is etched at a rate of about 0.5 nm/s. Therefore, after development of the photoresist, the developing time is extended for 40 seconds or more. The Al-3 mol % Ni film with a thickness of 20 nm can be thereby etched away completely. In this manner, by using the developer of the photoresist pattern <b>13</b> also as an etchant of the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b</i>, the manufacturing process can be simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2008-72011, the oxide semiconductor film such as the IGZO film used in this exemplary embodiment is highly soluble in an acid solution. Therefore, selective etching of the oxide semiconductor film and the metal thin film is not possible. It is thus known that patterning is very difficult. However, the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a </i>does not solve in an alkaline solution such as TMAH. Thus, by using an alkaline solution, it is possible to etch away only the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>in the upper layer without etching the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a</i>. The patterning accuracy can be thus improved.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Further, in the case where a light-transmitting oxide film such as the IGZO film is laminated with or brought into contact with an Al metal, a cell reaction involving those films as electrodes can occur in an alkaline developer at the time of photoresist patterning. This causes oxidation corrosion of the Al metal and reductive corrosion of the IGZO film, leading to the occurrence of a pattern failure. However, in this exemplary embodiment, the Al-3 mol % Ni film prepared by adding Al to Ni is used. By etching away the Al-3 mol % Ni film in an alkaline developer, the cell reaction which has been an issue with the Al metal used hitherto can be prevented. This enables suitable selective etching without the reductive corrosion of the IGZO film.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">It should be noted that, although the Al-3 mol % Ni film is used as the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>in this exemplary embodiment, a material of the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>is not limited thereto. For example, an element to be added to Al is not limited to Ni, and it may be palladium (Pd) or platinum (Pt), both in Group 10 of the periodic table. Further, two or more of Ni, Pd and Pt may be added to Al. By adding such elements to Al, etching can be performed without causing corrosion of the IGZO film in an alkaline solution (developer) containing TMAH. Further, the addition quantity is also not limited to 3 mol %, and etching can be performed by an alkaline developer containing TMAH as long as 0.5 mol % or more is added. When the addition quantity exceeds 10 mol %, the rate of precipitation of a compound phase of AlNi, AlPd and AlPt in the Al alloy film increases. It can become an etching residue in the alkaline developer to give rise to an etching defect. Thus, the total addition quantity of Ni, Pd and Pt to be added to Al is suitably between 0.5 mol % and 10 mol %. It is thereby possible to improve the etching rate by the organic alkaline developer, allowing easier etching.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Further, the TMAH concentration of the TMAH solution is not limited to 2.4 mass %, and it may be in the range of 0.2 mass % to 25 mass % at a solution temperature of 10&#xb0; C. to 50&#xb0; C., for example. This is because, when the TMAH concentration is less than 0.2 mass %, the etching rate of the Al alloy film significantly decreases, making etching difficult. On the other hand, when the TMAH concentration is more than 25 mass %, a damage to the photoresist pattern <b>13</b> increases, leading to a pattern failure.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Besides, an N-atom or O-atom may be further added. The addition of an N-atom or O-atom may be performed by reactive sputtering. For example, the reactive sputtering is performed using a mixed gas prepared by adding N<sub>2 </sub>gas or O<sub>2 </sub>gas to Ar gas. An N-atom or O-atom can be thereby added to the Al alloy film. By using an alloy film further containing an N-atom or O-atom in addition to the Al alloy film, electrical ohmic contact characteristics can be made better. Specifically, the contact characteristics with the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a </i>in the lower layer and the contact characteristics with the source electrode <b>7</b> and the drain electrode <b>8</b> in the upper layer can be made better. This improves the TFT characteristics. Note that the addition quantity of an N-atom and an O-atom can be controlled by adjusting the partial pressure ratio of N<sub>2 </sub>gas or O<sub>2 </sub>gas.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Then, the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a </i>is etched away using the photoresist pattern <b>13</b> as a mask. In this etching step, a solution with a 5 mass % concentration of oxalic acid is used. In this case, the IGZO film of the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a </i>is etched away at a rate of about 1 nm/s at room temperature (23&#xb0; C.). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a </i>is patterned, and the island-shaped semiconductor layer <b>5</b> can be formed. The light-reflecting ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>made of Al-3 mol % Ni does not solve in a known common oxalic acid solution, not limited to the oxalic acid solution in this exemplary embodiment. Therefore, only the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a </i>can be selectively etched. The patterning accuracy can be thus improved.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">After that, the photoresist pattern <b>13</b> is peeled off using an amine peeling liquid. The semiconductor pattern of the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a </i>and the light-reflecting ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>is thereby formed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>. Note that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> shows the same structure as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. The patterns of the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a </i>and the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>are substantially identical. In other words, the pattern of the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>is formed not protruding from the pattern of the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In this step, the quality of the pattern may be checked. An example of the quality check of the pattern is described hereinbelow. The quality check the finished pattern is typically performed by detecting a failure part using a pattern defect inspection device. For example, the pattern defect inspection device includes a lighting unit that applies illumination light to the pattern and an imaging unit that detects reflected light from the pattern. The lighting unit applies illumination light to the pattern formed on the substrate <b>1</b> by using a light source such as a halogen lamp, LED or metal halide lamp. When the illumination light is applied to the pattern formed on the substrate, it is reflected according to the pattern. The imaging unit captures the reflected light from the pattern and picks up the image. The imaging unit includes an optical system such as a CCD camera and a lens for detecting the reflected light. The image of the pattern formed on the substrate <b>1</b> can be thereby picked up. The image is represented as 256 gradation luminance data, for example, with respect to each pixel. Then, the pattern defect inspection device performs image processing on the image and thereby detects a failure part.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the image processing which detects a failure part from the picked-up image, pattern matching is typically used. In the pattern matching, the pixel luminance (e.g. 256 gradations) in the repetitive periodic portion is compared. There are at least three portions of the pixel luminance (256 gradations) to be compared, two with no failure defect and one with a failure defect. When there is a larger difference in luminance in the pixel luminance (256 gradations) of the portion with a failure defect than in the pixel luminance (256 gradations) of the portion with no failure defect, it is detected as a failure defect. Then, only non-defective items are passed to the next step. Alternatively, items are passed to the next step after the defect is corrected. By the defect inspection, the yield can be improved, leading to better productivity.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">However, in the case where the semiconductor pattern is made only of a material with high transmittance such as the oxide semiconductor film used hitherto, the illumination light passes through the semiconductor pattern. Consequently, the intensity of the reflected light received by the CCD camera is reduced. Accordingly, even when a pattern failure defect exists, a difference in luminance from a normal portion with no failure defect is small. This raises an issue that the defect detection sensitivity decreases. On the other hand, in the exemplary embodiment of the invention, the light-reflecting ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>is placed in the upper layer of the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a</i>. Further, the pattern of the semiconductor layer <b>5</b> is formed at a time. The light-reflecting pattern of the same shape is thereby present on the surface of the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a</i>. The illumination light is thus reflected by the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b</i>, allowing the highly sensitive pattern defect inspection of the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a </i>in the lower layer. For example, supposing that the luminance on the substrate is about 20 to 100 gradations, the luminance on a common light-reflecting metal film is about 150 to 256 gradations. Accordingly, a difference between the luminance on the glass substrate and the luminance on the metal film is large. By forming the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>into the same pattern shape as the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a</i>, more reliable inspection can be accomplished. Defective items having a defect in the pattern of the semiconductor layer <b>5</b> can be thereby eliminated. Eliminating defective items in this stage allows improvement of productivity. The above-described number of gradations is a typical example, and it varies depending on the intensity of illumination light and other conditions.</p>

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In this exemplary embodiment, a Mo film is used as the second metal film. The Mo film with a thickness of 200 nm is deposited by sputtering using known Ar gas. After that, a photoresist pattern is formed by the third photolithography process, and the Mo film is patterned. Specifically, the Mo film is etched using the photoresist pattern as a mask. In this example, the Mo film and the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>in the channel part <b>9</b> are wet-etched in succession.

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Then, the protective insulating film <b>10</b> is deposited. In this exemplary embodiment, the protective insulating film <b>10</b> is deposited using chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Specifically, a silicon nitride (SiN) film with a thickness of 300 nm is deposited under the substrate heating condition of about 250&#xb0; C. After that, a photoresist pattern is formed by the fourth photolithography process, and the SiN film is patterned. Specifically, the SiN film is etched using the photoresist pattern as a mask. In this etching, dry etching using known fluorine gas may be used. The contact hole <b>11</b> can be thereby made above the drain electrode <b>8</b>. After that, the photoresist pattern is removed, and the protective insulating film <b>10</b> having the contact hole <b>11</b> can be thereby formed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Finally, a transparent conductive film is deposited, and the pattern of the pixel electrode <b>12</b> is formed. In this exemplary embodiment, IZO (indium oxide (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)+zinc oxide (ZnO)) is used as the transparent conductive film. Then, an IZO film with a thickness of 100 nm is deposited by sputtering using known Ar gas. Then, a photoresist pattern is formed by the fifth photolithography process, and the pixel electrode <b>12</b> is patterned. Specifically, the IZO film is etched using the photoresist pattern as a mask. The pixel electrode <b>12</b> is thereby formed. In this etching, wet etching by a known oxalic acid solution may be used. Then, the photoresist pattern is removed after the etching. The structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref> is thereby produced, and the TFT substrate is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">On the surface of the TFT substrate which is completed by performing the photolithography process five times, an alignment film and spacers are formed. The alignment film is made of polyimide or the like for aligning liquid crystals. Further, a counter substrate provided with a color filter and an alignment film is prepared. The TFT substrate and the counter substrate are attached to each other. Then, liquid crystals are injected and sealed in the gap created between the substrates by the spacers. Further, a polarizing plate, a phase difference plate, a backlight unit and the like are provided on the outer sides of the both substrates. A liquid crystal display can be thereby completed (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In this exemplary embodiment, the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>is interposed between the source electrode <b>7</b>, the drain electrode <b>8</b> and the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a</i>. The ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>has a lower light transmittance than the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a</i>. Note that the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>may be a reflection film that reflects light as long as it has a lower light reflectance than the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a</i>, and it may be a low reflection film that transmits a part of light. The low reflection film may have a reflectance of 50% or less for light with a wavelength of 550 nm, for example. Specifically, a Si film to which an impurity such as phosphorus (P) is added may be used as the low reflection film.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the case of using the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a </i>also, it is possible to easily detect a pattern failure in the pattern shape inspection of the semiconductor layer <b>5</b>. Specifically, when applying illumination light by the pattern defect inspection device, the illumination light is reflected by the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b</i>. Accordingly, the amount of reflected light received by the imaging unit increases. The ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>has the same pattern shape as the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a</i>. The detection sensitivity of a pattern defect of the semiconductor layer <b>5</b> can be thereby enhanced. It is thereby possible to effectively reduce the occurrence of a manufacturing failure of the TFT <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">A material having a low resistance to an acid chemical solution is used for the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a</i>. Further, the source electrode <b>7</b> and the drain electrode <b>8</b> are made of a metal film which is typically etched by an acid chemical solution. At the time of patterning, the etching selectivity of those can be achieved. Specifically, at the patterning of the source electrode <b>7</b> and the drain electrode <b>8</b>, the etching selectivity with the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a </i>increases. The patterning accuracy can be thereby improved. Further, this eliminates the need for selecting the type of the metal film, the etching solution of the metal film, and the oxide semiconductor film for manufacture as in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2008-72011. The range of choice of materials such as a film type and an etching solution can be thereby broadened.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Particularly, the TFT substrate using an oxide semiconductor film with a high mobility can be achieved. Therefore, a TFT active matrix substrate with a high operating speed and a display device using the same can be manufactured with a high yield. It is thus possible to manufacture a high-performance TFT substrate and liquid crystal display with high productivity. The TFT substrate may be used for a display device other than a liquid crystal display as a matter of course. For example, the TFT substrate may be used for an electro-optical device such as an organic electroluminescence display. Further, application to a thin film transistor and an active matrix substrate used for a semiconductor component or the like other than a display device is also possible.</p>
<heading id="h-0017" level="1">Second Exemplary Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In this exemplary embodiment, a material of the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>is different. Although the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>is an Al alloy film in the first exemplary embodiment, the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>is a pure Cu film or a Cu alloy film predominantly composed of Cu. Hereinafter, a pure Cu film or a Cu alloy film predominantly composed of Cu is referred to as a Cu film. Note that the other structure and the like are the same as that of the first exemplary embodiment and thus not redundantly described below.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">A manufacturing process of a TFT according to the exemplary embodiment is described hereinafter with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A to 7D</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A to 7D</figref> are step-by-step cross-sectional views showing a manufacturing process of the TFT according to the exemplary embodiment, and the manufacturing step corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> according to the first exemplary embodiment is shown in detail.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">First, a silicon nitride (SiN) film to serve as the gate insulating film <b>4</b> is formed using chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In this example, a silicon nitride (SiN) film with a thickness of 300 nm is deposited under the substrate heating condition of about 300&#xb0; C. The gate electrode <b>2</b> and the auxiliary capacitor electrodes <b>3</b> are thereby covered with the gate insulating film <b>4</b>. After that, the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a </i>and the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>are deposited in succession.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Specifically, the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a </i>is deposited by sputtering. In the sputtering of the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a</i>, an oxide target having an amorphous structure with an atomic composition ratio of In:Ga:Zn:O=1:1:1:4 (hereinafter referred to as IGZO) is used. The IGZO film with a thickness of 50 nm is deposited by reactive sputtering using a mixed gas prepared by adding O<sub>2 </sub>gas to Ar gas. In this example, a mixed gas in which O<sub>2 </sub>gas with a partial pressure ratio of 10% is added to Ar gas is used.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Subsequently, a Cu film is deposited by sputtering as the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b</i>. In this sputtering, a pure Cu film with a thickness of 20 nm is deposited using pure Ar gas. Next, a photoresist pattern <b>13</b> is formed by the second photolithography process. The structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> is thereby produced.</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Next, the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>is etched away using the photoresist pattern <b>13</b> as a mask. The pattern of the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>is thereby formed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. In this etching, a chemical solution containing an aqueous solution with 0.3 mass % ammonium persulfate at a solution temperature of 23&#xb0; C. is used as an etchant. In this case, the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>made of a pure Cu film is etched at a rate of about 1 nm/s. As disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2008-72011, the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a </i>such as the IGZO film used in this exemplary embodiment is highly soluble in an acid solution. Therefore, selective etching of the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a </i>and the metal thin film is not possible. It is thus known that patterning is very difficult. However, the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a </i>is not easily etched by an ammonium persulfate solution. By using a chemical solution containing ammonium persulfate, only the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>made of Cu can be selectively etched.</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Then, the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a </i>is etched away using the photoresist pattern <b>13</b> as a mask. In this example, an oxalic acid solution is used as an etchant. The light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a </i>is patterned, and the island-shaped semiconductor layer <b>5</b> is formed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>. The ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>made of light-reflecting Cu does not solve in the oxalic acid solution. Therefore, only the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a </i>can be selectively etched. The patterning accuracy can be thereby improved, and the pattern of the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a </i>and the pattern of the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>placed thereabove are substantially identical.</p>
<p id="h-0021" num="0000">(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">After that, the photoresist pattern <b>13</b> is peeled off using an amine peeling liquid. The structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref> is thereby produced. The structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref> is the same as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>. The semiconductor layer <b>5</b> composed of the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a </i>and the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>is formed in an island shape.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">After that, the same process as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4C to 4E</figref> in the first exemplary embodiment is performed, and thereby the TFT substrate according to the second exemplary embodiment can be completed. Further, the second metal film to become the source electrode <b>7</b> and the drain electrode <b>8</b>, and the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>may be etched by different etching solutions. For example, when the second metal film is the Mo film, which is the same as in the first exemplary embodiment, the chemical solution containing phosphoric acid, nitric acid and acetic acid may be used for the etching of the second metal film, and the above-described ammonium persulfate solution may be used for the etching of the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b</i>. A foreign substance and contamination on the surface of the channel part <b>9</b> can be thereby removed, thus improving the TFT characteristics. Further, the channel part <b>9</b> may be cleaned by plasma processing or the like as in the first exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Then, the same process as in the first exemplary embodiment is performed, and thereby a liquid crystal display can be completed. In this exemplary embodiment, the same advantages as those of the first exemplary embodiment can be obtained. Although not described above, an optical pattern defect inspection may be performed as appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Although a pure Cu film is used as the light-reflecting ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>in the above description, it is not limited thereto. For example, a Cu alloy to which an N-atom or O-atom is added may be used as the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b</i>. Specifically, reactive sputtering using a mixed gas prepared by adding N<sub>2 </sub>gas or O<sub>2 </sub>gas to Ar gas is used. Alternatively, a Cu alloy to which an N-atom or O-atom is added may be deposited by the reactive sputtering. By using a Cu alloy film containing an N-atom or O-atom, etching by the ammonium persulfate solution can be further facilitated. This further improves electrical ohmic contact characteristics with the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a </i>in the lower layer and the source electrode <b>7</b> and the drain electrode <b>8</b> in the upper layer. As a matter of course, both of an N-atom and O-atom may be added to Cu, and an atom different from an N-atom and O-atom may be further added.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Further, the ammonium persulfate concentration of the ammonium persulfate solution is not limited to 0.3 mass %, and it may be in the range of 0.02 mass % to 10 mass % at a solution temperature of 10&#xb0; C. to 50&#xb0; C., for example. When the ammonium persulfate concentration is less than 0.02 mass %, the etching rate of the above-described Cu alloy film significantly decreases, making etching difficult. On the other hand, when the ammonium persulfate concentration is more than 10 mass %, the side etching amount of the Cu alloy film (the recessed amount from the end of the resist pattern <b>13</b> to the end of the Cu alloy film pattern <b>5</b><i>b</i>) increases. Consequently, in the plane pattern, the pattern shape of the Cu alloy film <b>5</b><i>b </i>is largely recessed inside the pattern shape of the light-transmitting semiconductor film light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a</i>. This makes it difficult to accurately inspect a pattern defect of the semiconductor layer <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Note that, although the case where an oxide semiconductor (IGZO) composed of indium oxide, gallium oxide and zinc oxide is applied as the light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a </i>is described in the first and second exemplary embodiments, the material is not limited thereto. For example, a nitride semiconductor made of nitrogen compound predominantly composed of a Group 13 element or a semiconductor made of a mixture of such oxide and nitride may be applied. In the case of using such materials also, the same advantages can be obtained. Thus, a semiconductor film containing at least one of an N-atom and an O-atom and having a translucency may be used. In this manner, by using the non-silicone light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a</i>, a high-performance TFT can be obtained. Note that, in this specification, the predominant component is defined as a component with the highest proportion among two or more kinds of components constituting a substance.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The transmittance of the light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a </i>is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 10</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 10</figref> are graphs showing the transmittance spectral characteristics of the light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a graph showing the transmittance characteristics of an IGZO film with a thickness of 50 nm. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a graph showing the transmittance characteristics of a TiOx film with a thickness of 50 nm. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a graph showing the transmittance characteristics of a GZO film with a thickness of 50 nm. In this example, the transmittance is measured with various addition quantities of oxygen. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 10</figref>, the horizontal axis indicates a light wavelength, and the vertical axis indicates a transmittance (as. depo). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 10</figref>, an amorphous ITO (a-TIO) and a polycrystalline ITO (p-ITO) are also shown as a comparative example. In each film type, the transmittance for a wavelength 550 nm is 50% or more.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Even in the case of using the light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a </i>with a high transmittance, pattern defect inspection can be reliably performed by forming the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b</i>. Note that, by performing the pattern defect inspection immediately after forming the semiconductor layer <b>5</b>, a defect can be detected effectively. For example, optical defect inspection is performed in the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>. It is thereby possible to effectively detect a defect. As a matter of course, pattern defect inspection may be performed at any timing after forming the semiconductor layer <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In the first and second exemplary embodiments, patterning is performed after depositing the light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a </i>and the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>in succession. Thus, the light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a </i>and the photoresist used for the patterning with the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>are common. Accordingly, the pattern end of the ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>in the upper layer substantially coincides with the pattern end of the light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a</i>. The ohmic conductive film <b>5</b><i>b </i>is formed not to protrude from the light-transmitting semiconductor film <b>5</b><i>a</i>. This allows simplification of the manufacturing process. Specifically, a photolithography step can be eliminated compared with the case where patterning is performed using different photoresist patterns. This enables reliable inspection of the semiconductor layer <b>5</b>. The productivity can be thereby improved.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">From the invention thus described, it will be obvious that the embodiments of the invention may be varied in many ways.
