<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This non-provisional application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a) on Patent Application No. 2010-200628 filed in JAPAN on Sep. 8, 2010, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a translation apparatus and a translation method for translating a character string in a first language included in a document including a plurality of pages into a second language, a computer program for realizing the translation method, and a computer readable recording medium having the computer program for realizing the translation method recorded thereon.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, it has become common to make a presentation while presenting slides to an audience with use of presentation software on an occasion of a business meeting or a presentation at an academic conference. With presentation software which is generally used, each time a speaker presses a key of a computer, a page of slides is switched. This makes it possible for the speaker to present an appropriate page to an audience in accordance with proceedings of a presentation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When a slide is prepared in a foreign language, it is difficult for an audience who do not know the foreign language to understand a content of the slide. Although the content of the slide is translated in advance and the translated content of the slide is displayed in some cases, there can also be a case where there is no time to spare for performing translation again when the content of the slide is changed immediately before a presentation.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 3-163591 discloses a control device for, while a presenter makes a presentation using a large screen display device, receiving an instruction to translate a presentation material which is displayed on the large screen display device from an audience and translating the presentation material.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Now, referring to the drawings, embodiments of the present invention will hereinafter be described in detail. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a functional block diagram of a translation apparatus <b>10</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. The translation apparatus <b>10</b> includes an input portion <b>11</b>, a display portion <b>12</b>, a network interface portion <b>13</b>, a storage portion <b>14</b>, a display image data obtaining portion <b>15</b>, a non-change region detecting portion <b>16</b>, a character recognition portion <b>17</b>, a translation processing portion <b>18</b>, a translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b>, a display control portion <b>20</b>, and a control portion <b>21</b>. Respective function portions are connected to each other via bus <b>22</b>, and delivering/receiving data between the respective function portions are able to be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The input portion <b>11</b> is an input device such as a mouse or a keyboard that receives input from a user, and is provided with a button or the like for the user to operate the translation apparatus <b>10</b>. The display portion <b>12</b> is a display device such as an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display), a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) or a PDP (Plasma Display Panel) that displays characters and images. Note that, the input portion <b>11</b> and the display portion <b>12</b> are assumed to be incorporated in a main body of the translation apparatus <b>10</b> here, however the input portion <b>11</b> and the display portion <b>12</b> may be provided separately from the main body of the translation apparatus <b>10</b> and connected to the main body via a signal line. Furthermore, the input portion <b>11</b> and the display portion <b>12</b> may be comprised of a touch panel or a tablet.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The network interface portion <b>13</b> is a network interface that performs communication with an external apparatus via an IP (Internet Protocol) network such as a LAN (Local Area Network) or a WAN (Wide Area Network).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The storage portion <b>14</b> is a storage device such as a flash ROM (Read Only Memory), an EEPROM (Electrically Erasable and Programmable ROM), or an HD (Hard Disk). The storage portion <b>14</b> stores various data used by the translation apparatus <b>10</b>, such as dictionary data for translation <b>14</b><i>a</i>, slide data <b>14</b><i>b</i>, recognition character data <b>14</b><i>c</i>, translation result data <b>14</b><i>d </i>and display image data <b>14</b><i>e. </i></p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The dictionary data for translation <b>14</b><i>a </i>is data that includes words and collocation in each language and translated words thereof, along with grammar data of each language and data of appearance frequency of each syntax. The slide data <b>14</b><i>b </i>is data of slides comprised of a plurality of pages used by presentation software during presentation. The recognition character data <b>14</b><i>c </i>is data such as a type or a position of each character obtained as a result of character recognition (X-coordinate and Y-coordinate in upper right corner, bottom right corner, upper left corner and bottom left corner respectively in a rectangular region enclosing each character with a minimum area). The translation result data <b>14</b><i>d </i>is data in which a translated word which is obtained as a result of translation is stored in association with a word or a collocation in an original sentence. The display image data <b>14</b><i>e </i>is data of an image displayed on the display portion <b>12</b>, the image including a character string to be translated.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Note that, it is not necessary that data has been stored in the storage portion <b>14</b> in advance. For example, data stored in an external memory may be read out by a driver to be stored in the storage portion <b>14</b>. Further, data may be downloaded from an external apparatus via the network interface portion <b>13</b> to be stored in the storage portion <b>14</b>. For example, data may be downloaded from a personal computer for presentation which is prepared separately from the translation apparatus <b>10</b> so that the data is stored in the storage portion <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The display image data obtaining portion <b>15</b> is a processing portion that obtains data of an image displayed on the display portion <b>12</b>. The display image data obtaining portion <b>15</b> obtains data of an image by using, for example, a means for obtaining a display screen such as corresponding to (similar to) a print screen in terms of a function of a computer.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The non-change region detecting portion <b>16</b> is a processing portion that compares image data obtained at different time points by the display image data obtaining portion <b>15</b>, detects a non-change region in which an image does not change therebetween as a region to be translated, and excludes a region in which an image changes from a region to be translated by means of masking. There is a possibility that a character string in the region in which the image changes may be a character string to be displayed temporarily, and translating such a character string becomes wasteful, therefore the translation of the character string is not performed until there is no change of the image. The load of the translation processing in the translation apparatus <b>10</b> is thereby reduced. Note that, when an area of the changed image region is a predetermined value or less, in order not to detect movement of a small object such as a mouse cursor as the change of the image, the non-change region detecting portion <b>16</b> regards such an image region as the non-change region to be detected as the region to be translated.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The character recognition portion <b>17</b> is a processing portion that recognizes each character included in the non-change region detected by the non-change region detecting portion <b>16</b> to output as character string data. For example, the character recognition portion <b>17</b> analyzes a layout of each character in an image region, extracts a character region, and further perform character recognition of the image of each character in the extracted character region to convert into text information by using the same technology as the character recognition technology which is conventionally used in an OCR (Optical Character Recognition). Furthermore, the character recognition portion <b>17</b> stores coordinates of four corners in a rectangular region enclosing each character with a minimum area in the storage portion <b>14</b> as the recognition character data <b>14</b><i>c </i>along with information of the type of each character which has been recognized.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The translation processing portion <b>18</b> is a processing portion to translate a character string in a first language shown by character string data which is output by the character recognition portion <b>17</b> into a second language word by word or collocation by collocation. The translation processing portion <b>18</b> stores a translation result in the storage portion <b>14</b> as the translation result data <b>14</b><i>d</i>. Since the translation processing portion <b>18</b> performs translation word by word or collocation by collocation, it is possible to prevent a translation error from affecting the entire translation, and also possible to make occurrence of the translation error to be a local one even when there is an error of character input in an original sentence, and even when there is an error of character recognition of an original sentence.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The translated layer generating portion <b>19</b> is a processing portion that generates a translated word layer for displaying a translation result in which a word or a collocation in a first language is translated into a second language. The translated word layer is a layer in which a background is transparent and the translated word layer includes a translated word and an underline showing that the collocation in the original sentence is a discontinuous collocation.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The discontinuous collocation is one in which a different word is included between words in a collocation showing one unified meaning (such as a nominal phrase, a verbal phrase, an idiom and an idiomatic phrase). For example, as the discontinuous collocation in English, an idiom such as &#x201c;take . . . into consideration&#x201d; is included. On the other hand, a continuous collocation is one in which a different word is not included between words in the collocation showing one unified meaning. For example, as the continuous collocation in English, an idiom such as &#x201c;take over&#x201d; is included. The translated word layer is overlapped with an original sentence layer showing the original sentence so as to be displayed with the original sentence.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> generates a translated word layer in which a translated word or collocation corresponding to a word or a collocation in an original sentence is arranged in proximity to the original word or collocation. Thereby a user is able to easily perform confirmation of the correspondence relation between the original sentence and a translation result thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Specifically, the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> calculates a distance between respective lines included in the original sentence. The translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> obtains Y coordinate of an upper end and a lower end of a first character of each line, calculates a distance between the lower end of the first character in one line and the upper end of a first character in a next line so as to calculate a distance between the respective lines.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Further, the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> obtains one of the translated words obtained by the processing of the translation processing portion <b>18</b>, and checks whether or not the translated word is the one obtained as the translation result of the discontinuous collocation. When the translated word is the one obtained as the translation result of the discontinuous collocation, the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> generates a transparent translated word layer, and arranges an underline at a position on the translated word layer which corresponds to the lower portion of the discontinuous collocation in the original sentence.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Further, the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> compares the lengths of a first word included in the discontinuous collocation (in the above-described example, &#x201c;take&#x201d;), a continuous word sequence (&#x201c;into consideration&#x201d;), and a longest word (&#x201c;consideration&#x201d;), and sets the maximum length one among them (&#x201c;into consideration&#x201d;) as a word or a continuous word sequence in proximity to which a translated word is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">When the translated word is not the one obtained as the translation result of the discontinuous collocation, namely, when the translated word is one obtained by the translation result of a word or a continuous collocation, the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> sets the word or the continuous word sequence in the original sentence corresponding to the translated word as the word or the continuous word sequence in proximity to which a translated word is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> then compares the distance between lines of the original sentence with a vertical length of a character of the original sentence. Then, the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b>, when the distance between the lines is less than 40% of the vertical length of the character, sets a vertical length of a font for displaying the translated word to be 40% of the vertical length of the above-described character, and when the distance between the lines exceeds 80% of the vertical length of the character, sets the vertical length of the above-described font to be 80% of the vertical length of the above-described character, and when the distance between the lines is 40% to 80% of the vertical length of the character, sets the vertical length of the above-described font to be the same as the length of the distance between the lines. Note that, a threshold different from 40% and 80% may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Furthermore, the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> sets an X coordinate of a left end of a first character in the word or the continuous word sequence in proximity to which a translated word is displayed as a left end of an arrangement space in which the translated words are arranged, and sets an X coordinate of a right end of a last character in the word or the continuous word sequence in proximity to which a translated word is displayed as a right end of the above-described arrangement space. The translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> then calculates a horizontal length of the arrangement space (namely, a distance between the left end and the right end). On the other hand, the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> multiplies the number of characters of the translated word by a horizontal length of the font for displaying the translated word to calculate a display length of the translated word. Then, the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> checks whether or not the horizontal length of the arrangement space is longer than the display length of the translated word.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">When the horizontal length of the arrangement space is longer than the display length of the translated word, the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> sets a left end position in the arrangement space as a horizontal position where the arrangement of the translated words is started. Furthermore, the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> calculates an average value of the Y coordinates of a lower end of each character included in the word or the continuous word sequence in proximity to which a translated word is displayed, and a position which is displaced downward from the average value by an amount of the vertical length of the font is set as a vertical position at which the translated word is arranged.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">When the horizontal length of the arrangement space is not longer than the display length of the translated word, the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> multiplies a rate of the horizontal length of the arrangement space with respect to the display length of the translated word by a font size of the translated word, so that the translated word is arranged in a font size of a value obtained as a result thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">However, when the above-described rate is smaller than a predetermined threshold, the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> checks whether or not there is a word for which a translated word is not arranged backward and forward of the word or the continuous word sequence in proximity to which a translated word is displayed (for example, &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;the&#x201d; and the like). Then the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> sets, when there is a word for which a translated word is not arranged forward thereof, a position which is displaced backward from a center position of the word placed forward by a predetermined distance as a position at which the arrangement of the translated word is started, and starts to arrange the translated word from the position. The translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> sets, when there is a word for which a translated word is not arranged backward thereof, an X coordinate of a right end of a last character in the word placed backward as a terminal position at which the arrangement of the translated word is completed, and displaces the translated word backward to be arranged so that the arrangement of the translated word is completed at the position. The translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> performs, when there is a word for which a translated word is not arranged forward or backward, either one of the above-described processing.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Furthermore, when there is no word for which a translated word is not arranged backward and forward of the word or the continuous word sequence in proximity to which a translated word is displayed, the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> arranges the translated word of a word or a continuous word sequence to be processed in consideration of the length of the translated words arranged to the words backward and forward thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> are diagrams showing an example of arrangement of translated words. When a translated word (translated word <b>34</b>, in this example) for a word or a continuous word sequence to be processed is arranged, the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> firstly checks whether or not a horizontal length Lb of a translated word of a word placed forward (translated word <b>35</b>) is shorter than a length La which a minimum arrangement interval in which translated words (translated word <b>35</b>, translated word <b>34</b> and translated word <b>36</b>) are arranged is subtracted from a horizontal length <b>30</b> of the word placed forward (&#x201c;Graphics&#x201d;). Then, when the length Lb is shorter than the length La, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> performs processing that moves a position at which the translated word (translated word <b>34</b>) is arranged further forward. Here, the minimum arrangement interval is a minimum value of a horizontal length of a space provided between translated words so that the translated words (translated word <b>35</b>, translated word <b>34</b> and translated word <b>36</b>) are able to be distinguished from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In this case, the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> determines whether or not a value Lc, which is obtained by subtracting the horizontal length Lb of the translated word of the word that is placed forward (translated word <b>35</b>) and the minimum interval between the translated words (translated word <b>35</b>, translated word <b>34</b> and translated word <b>36</b>) from a sum of a horizontal length <b>32</b> of space in which the translated word (translated word <b>34</b>) is to be originally arranged, intervals <b>31</b> between words in a line of an original sentence, and the horizontal length <b>30</b> of the word that is placed forward (&#x201c;Graphics&#x201d;), is larger than a value Ld of a display length of the translated word (translated word <b>34</b>) of the word or the continuous word sequence to be processed.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">When the value Lc is larger than the value Ld, the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> modifies the horizontal length of the arrangement space so that a position locating to the left of the right end of the arrangement space by an amount of the value Ld comes to the left end of the arrangement space, and arranges the translated word (translated word <b>34</b>) from the left end position. When the value Lc is not larger than the value Ld, the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> multiplies a ratio of the value Lc to the value Ld by a font size of the translated word (translated word <b>34</b>) so as to recalculate the display length Ld of the translated word (translated word <b>34</b>) using a modified font size obtained as a result thereof. Then, the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> modifies the horizontal length of the arrangement space so that a position locating to the left of the right end of the arrangement space by an amount of the display length Ld of the recalculated translated word (translated word <b>34</b>) comes to the left end of the arrangement space, and arranges the translated word (translated word <b>34</b>) in the modified font size from the left end position.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, when the length Lb is not shorter than the Length La, the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> checks whether or not a horizontal length Lf of a translated word of a word that is placed backward (translated word <b>38</b>) is smaller than a length Le which is obtained by subtracting a minimum interval between the translated words (translated word <b>37</b>, translated word <b>34</b> and translated word <b>38</b>) from a horizontal length <b>33</b> of a word that is placed backward (&#x201c;vermilion&#x201d;). Then, when the length Lf is smaller than the length Le, the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> performs processing that moves a position at which the translated word of the word that is placed backward (translated word <b>38</b>) further backward.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In this case, the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> determines whether or not a value Lg which is obtained by subtracting the horizontal length Lf of the translated word of the word that is placed backward (translated word <b>38</b>) and the minimum interval between the translated words (translated word <b>37</b>, translated word <b>34</b> and translated word <b>38</b>) from a sum of the horizontal length <b>32</b> of the space in which the translated word (translated word <b>34</b>) is to be originally arranged, the intervals <b>31</b> between words in a line of an original sentence, and the horizontal length <b>33</b> of the word that is placed backward (&#x201c;vermilion&#x201d;) is larger than a value Ld of the display length of the translated word (translated word <b>34</b>) of the word or the continuous word sequence to be processed.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">When the value Lg is larger than the value Ld, the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> modifies the horizontal length of the arrangement space so that a position locating to the right of the left end of the arrangement space by an amount of the value Ld comes to the right end of the arrangement space. Then the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> sets a starting position from which the arrangement of the translated word of the word that is placed backward (translated word <b>38</b>) is started at a position located to the left of the right end of a last character (&#x201c;n&#x201d;) of the word placed backward (&#x201c;vermillion&#x201d;) by an amount of the horizontal length Lf of the translated word of the word that is placed backward (translated word <b>38</b>), and arranges the translated word of the word that is placed backward (translated word <b>38</b>) to the right side from the original position. Then, the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> arranges the translated word (translated word <b>34</b>) of the word or the continuous word sequence to be processed, from the left end of the arrangement space in which the horizontal length is modified.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">When the value Lg is not larger than the value Ld, the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> multiplies the ratio of the value Lg to the value Ld by the font size of the translated word (translated word <b>34</b>) so as to recalculate the display length Ld of the translated word (translated word <b>34</b>) using a modified font size which is obtained as a result thereof. Then, the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> modifies the horizontal length of the arrangement space so that a position locating to the right of the left end of the arrangement space by an amount of the recalculated value Ld comes to the right end of the arrangement space. Further, the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> sets a starting position from which the arrangement of the translated word of the word that is placed backward (translated word <b>38</b>) is started at a position located to the left of the right end of the last character (&#x201c;n&#x201d;) of the word placed backward (&#x201c;vermillion&#x201d;) by an amount of the horizontal length Lf of the translated word of the word placed backward (translated word <b>38</b>), and arranges the translated word of the word that is placed backward (translated word <b>38</b>) to the right side from the original position. Then, the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> arranges the translated word (translated word <b>34</b>) of the word or the continuous word sequence to be processed, in the modified font size from the left end of the arrangement space in which the horizontal length is modified.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The display control portion <b>20</b> is a processing portion that controls information display performed by the display portion <b>12</b>. When the input portion <b>11</b> receives a request for display switching of a page of a slide from a user, the display control portion <b>20</b> performs processing to display a next page on the display portion <b>12</b>. Moreover, the display control portion <b>20</b> performs processing such as laying a translated word layer generated by the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> on an original sentence layer so that an original word or collocation included in the original sentence layer is displayed on the display portion <b>12</b> in association with translation result thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The control portion <b>21</b> is a processing portion that integrally controls the translation apparatus <b>10</b>. The control portion <b>21</b> controls delivering/receiving data between respective function portions. Moreover, when a user makes a presentation using slides comprised of a plurality of pages, the control portion <b>21</b> determines whether or not the input portion <b>11</b> has received a request for switching a page displayed on the display portion <b>12</b> from the user. Then, in a case where the input portion <b>11</b> has received the request for switching the page before the translation result of the page displayed on the displaying portion <b>12</b> is displayed on the display portion <b>12</b>, then in synchronization with the reception of the request for switching the page, the control portion <b>21</b> performs processing of instructing the non-change region detecting portion <b>16</b>, the character recognition portion <b>17</b>, the translation processing portion <b>18</b>, the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b>, and the display control portion <b>20</b> to stop the translation processing of the page which is currently displayed or the display processing of the translation result as well as instructing the display image data obtaining portion <b>15</b> to obtain image data of a switched page to be displayed on the display portion <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The translation processing and the display processing of the translation result are performed with respect to the image data after switching obtained by the control portion <b>21</b> in this way, and thereby it is possible to prevent such a situation that translated words of the previous page are displayed even though the page has been switched so that an inconsistency between the original sentence and the translated words is generated. Furthermore, the wasteful translation processing or display processing is stopped, and thereby a load of the translation apparatus <b>10</b> is reduced so that the translation processing is able to be performed more smoothly in real time following the display screen of the presentation in progress.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Furthermore, the control portion <b>21</b> detects that the input portion <b>11</b> has received a request for display switching a page, then stores in the storage portion <b>14</b> each image data as the display image data <b>14</b><i>e </i>by putting a serial number thereon following the order obtained by the display image data obtaining portion <b>15</b>. By using this image data the translation processing and display processing of each page is able to be performed at a time afterwards. Note that, when there is no necessity to perform translation of each page at a time afterwards, the control portion <b>21</b> may discard the image data of the page before switching.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Next, translation processing according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flowchart of translation processing according to the present embodiment. In the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it is assumed that an image of a first page of slides is already displayed on the display portion <b>12</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the display image data obtaining portion <b>15</b> of the translation apparatus <b>10</b> obtains image data of the image which is displayed on the display portion <b>12</b> (step S<b>101</b>). Then, the control portion <b>21</b> checks whether or not the input portion <b>11</b> has received a request for display switching of a page of a slide from a user (step S<b>102</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In a case where the input portion <b>11</b> has received the request for display switching of the page (in the case of YES at step S<b>102</b>), the control portion <b>21</b> stores in the storage portion <b>14</b> the image data of a page before switching by putting a serial number thereon following the order obtained by the display image data obtaining portion <b>15</b> (step S<b>116</b>). The display control portion <b>20</b> then displays a next page on the display portion <b>12</b> (step S<b>117</b>). Then, the display image data obtaining portion <b>15</b> obtains image data of a page after switching (step S<b>118</b>), and continues processing at and after step S<b>102</b> with respect to the obtained image data.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In a case where the input portion <b>11</b> has not received the request for display switching of the page (in the case of NO at step S<b>102</b>), the non-change region detecting portion <b>16</b> detects a non-change region in which an image does not change in a display image of the page of the slide as a region including a character string to be translated (step S<b>103</b>). For example, when there is a region displaying a moving image on the page of the slide, the non-change region detecting portion <b>16</b> excludes the region, and except for the region, detects a non-change region in which an image does not change as a region including a character string to be translated. This detection processing will be described in detail later.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The control portion <b>21</b> then checks again whether or not the input portion <b>11</b> has received the request for display switching of the page from the user (step S<b>104</b>). In a case where the input portion <b>11</b> has received the request for display switching of the page (in the case of YES at step S<b>104</b>), the control portion <b>21</b> stores in the storage portion <b>14</b> the image data of the page before switching by putting a serial number thereon following the order obtained by the display image data obtaining portion <b>15</b> (step S<b>116</b>), and continues processing at and after step S<b>117</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In a case where the input portion <b>11</b> has not received the request for display switching of the page (in the case of NO at step S<b>104</b>), the character recognition portion <b>17</b> performs character recognition for a character which is included in the non-change region to output the recognized character as text data (step S<b>105</b>). Then, the control portion <b>21</b> checks again whether or not the input portion <b>11</b> has received the request for display switching of the page from the user (step S<b>106</b>). In a case where the input portion <b>11</b> has received the request for display switching of the page (in the case of YES at step S<b>106</b>), the control portion <b>21</b> stores in the storage portion <b>14</b> image data of the page before switching by putting a serial number thereon following the order obtained by the display image data obtaining portion <b>15</b> (step S<b>116</b>), and continues processing at and after step S<b>117</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In a case where the input portion <b>11</b> has not received the request for display switching of the page (in the case of NO at step S<b>106</b>), the translation processing portion <b>18</b> performs translation processing for the text data output by the character recognition portion <b>17</b> (step S<b>107</b>). The control portion <b>21</b> then checks again whether or not the input portion <b>11</b> has received the request for display switching of the page from the user (step S<b>108</b>). In a case where the input portion <b>11</b> has received the request for display switching of the page (in the case of YES at step S<b>108</b>), the control portion <b>21</b> stores in the storage portion <b>14</b> image data of the page before switching by putting a serial number thereon following the order obtained by the display image data obtaining portion <b>15</b> (step S<b>116</b>), and continues processing at and after step S<b>117</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In a case where the input portion <b>11</b> has not received the request for display switching of the page (in the case of NO at step S<b>108</b>), the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> generates a translated word layer in which a translated word is arranged in association with a word or a collocation in an original sentence (step S<b>109</b>). The control portion <b>21</b> then checks again whether or not the input portion <b>11</b> has received the request for display switching of the page from the user (step S<b>110</b>). When the input portion <b>11</b> has received the request for display switching of the page (in the case of YES at step S<b>110</b>), the control portion <b>21</b> stores in the storage portion <b>14</b> image data of the page before switching by putting a serial number thereon following the order obtained by the display image data obtaining portion <b>15</b> (step S<b>116</b>), and continues processing at and after step S<b>117</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In a case where the input portion <b>11</b> has not received the request for display switching of the page (in the case of NO at step S<b>110</b>), the display control portion <b>20</b> displays the translated word on the display portion <b>12</b> in association with the word or the collocation in the original sentence by laying the translated word layer on an original sentence layer (step S<b>111</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The control portion <b>21</b> then checks again whether or not the input portion <b>11</b> has received the request for display switching of the page from the user (step S<b>112</b>).

In a case where the input portion <b>11</b> has not received the request for finishing the translation processing (in the case of NO at step S<b>113</b>), the display image data obtaining portion <b>15</b> obtains again image data of a same page in order to detect a non-change region from a region except for a region which has already been detected as a non-change region as to the same page, and at the time, stands by for a certain period of time to maintain an interval between image data acquisition constant (step S<b>115</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Then, the display image data obtaining portion <b>15</b> obtains again image data of the image which is displayed on the display portion <b>12</b> (step S<b>101</b>), and processing at and after step S<b>102</b> is performed for the obtained image data. In a case where the input portion <b>11</b> has received the request for finishing the translation processing (in the case of YES at step S<b>113</b>), the control portion <b>21</b> stores in the storage portion <b>14</b> image data of a page which has been obtained at the end by putting a serial number thereon following the order obtained by the display image data obtaining portion <b>15</b> (step S<b>114</b>), and finishes this translation processing.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagram showing a display example of a slide generated by translation processing according to an embodiment of the present invention. A slide <b>40</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a moving image region <b>41</b> in which an image changes with time and a non-change region except for the moving image region <b>41</b> in which an image does not change with time. For example, in this moving image region <b>41</b>, it is assumed that change of the image is generated such that a picture of a clock and characters of &#x201c;TIME LIMIT&#x201d; gradually fade away with time and are displayed again, and the like. In such a case, when translation processing according to the embodiment of the present invention is applied thereto, a character string of &#x201c;TIME LIMIT&#x201d; in the moving image region <b>41</b> is not translated while only a character string (&#x201c;TIME LIMIT&#x201d;, &#x201c;We should take the time limit into consideration!&#x201d;) in the non-change region except for the moving image region <b>41</b> is translated. Additionally, in a case where the request for display switching of a page of the slide <b>40</b> has been received from the user before output of a translation result of the character string in the non-change region is finished, translation processing or output processing of the translation result for the page is stopped to start translation processing and output processing for a page to be displayed next.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Next, the non-change region detection processing (step S<b>103</b>) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> will be described in detail. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart of the non-change region detection processing shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the non-change region detecting portion <b>16</b> of the translation apparatus <b>10</b> checks whether or not obtaining processing of image data for the same page which has been performed by the display image data obtaining portion <b>15</b> is the first one (step S<b>201</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">When obtaining of image data for the same page is performed for the first time (in the case of YES at step S<b>201</b>), the display image data obtaining portion <b>15</b> stands by for a certain period of time (step S<b>202</b>) to obtain again image data of the same page which is displayed on the display portion <b>12</b> (step S<b>203</b>). The non-change region detecting portion <b>16</b> then compares the image data obtained for the first time with image data obtained for a second time, detects a non-change region in which an image does not change between these image data and masks a changed image region (step S<b>204</b>). Then, the non-change region detecting portion <b>16</b> sets the detected non-change region as a region which includes a character to be translated (step S<b>206</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Here, the non-change region detecting portion <b>16</b> is able to set a non-change region by designating coordinates. Alternatively, the non-change region detecting portion <b>16</b> masks the region in which the image changes by designating the region with coordinates or by filling the region with a specific color, selects a remaining non-change region as a region including a character to be translated, and is able to set the non-change region.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">When obtaining of image data for the same page is not the first time (in the case of NO at step S<b>201</b>), the non-change region detecting portion <b>16</b> compares the image obtained previous time (for a (j&#x2212;1)-th time) with the image obtained this time (for a j-th time) in a region except for the non-change region which has been detected previous time (for a (j&#x2212;1)-th time where j&#x2267;3) to detect a non-change region again (step S<b>205</b>). Then, the non-change region detecting portion <b>16</b> sets the detected non-change region as a region which includes a character to be translated (step S<b>206</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As to a character which is included in the non-change region detected previous time (for the (j&#x2212;1)-th time), the translation processing portion <b>18</b> has already performed translation to store a translation result in the storage portion as the translation result data <b>14</b><i>d</i>. Therefore, the translated word layer generating portion <b>19</b> generates a translated word layer from a translation result of a character string which is included in a non-change region detected this time (for the j-th time) and a translation result of a character string which is included in the non-change region detected the previous time (for the (j&#x2212;1)-th time). In this way, it is possible to reduce a load of translation processing performed by the translation apparatus <b>10</b> by involving only a character string which is included in a non-change region which has not been translated in the past for the translation and excluding a character string in a non-change region which has been translated in the past from an object of translation processing.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Note that, at step S<b>205</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it is assumed that a range of detecting a non-change region is limited to inside of a region except for the non-change region which has been detected the previous time, however, it may be configured such that a non-change region is detected from inside of all the regions of an image. Whereby even when an image which did not change at the time of detecting the non-change region the previous time changes thereafter, a character string which is included in the image is updated, and the image becomes a non-change image again thereafter, it is possible to appropriately obtain a translated word of an undated character string.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">So far, embodiments of the translation apparatus <b>10</b> and a translation method has been mainly described, however, the present invention is not limited to these embodiments, and the present invention may be implemented as an embodiment as a computer program for realizing a function of the translation apparatus <b>10</b> or an embodiment of a computer readable recording medium having the computer program recorded thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Here, it is possible to employ various forms of recording media such as a disk type (for example, a magnetic disk, an optical disk and the like), a card type (for example, a memory card, an optical card and the like), a semiconductor memory type (for example, a ROM, a non-volatile memory and the like), and a tape type (for example, a magnetic tape, a cassette tape and the like).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">By recording the computer program for realizing a function of the translation apparatus <b>10</b> or the computer program for causing a computer to execute the translation method in the present embodiment described above on these recording media for distribution, it is possible to reduce cost and improve portability or versatility.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In addition, the above-described recoding medium is mounted to a computer, a computer program recorded on the recording medium is read out by the computer and stored in a memory, and the computer program is read out from the memory and executed by a processor (CPU: Central Processing Unit, MPU: Micro Processing Unit) provided in the computer, so that it is possible to realize a function of the translation apparatus <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment and to execute the translation method.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Additionally, the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiments, and various modifications and amendments are possible within a range without departing from the gist of the present invention. For example, in the above-described embodiments, a case where a user makes a presentation while switching slides comprised of a plurality of pages has been described, however, a range of application of the present invention is not limited thereto, and it is possible to apply the present invention also to a case where translation of each page is performed while switching a page as to other documents except for slides.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As described above, according to the present invention, when a request for display switching of a page made by a user is detected, a character string in a first language which is included in a page after switching is translated into a second language and a translation result thereof is output, thus making it possible to improve convenience for the user and obtain translation of an original sentence effectively in real time in accordance with switching of a page.</p>
