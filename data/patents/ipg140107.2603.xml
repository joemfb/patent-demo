<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As required, detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein; however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which can be embodied in various forms. Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention in virtually any appropriately detailed structure. Further, the terms and phrases used herein are not intended to be limiting; but rather, to provide an understandable description of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The terms &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d;, as used herein, are defined as one as or more than one. The term plurality, as used herein, is defined as two as or more than two. Plural and singular terms are the same unless expressly stated otherwise. The term another, as used herein, is defined as at least a second or more. The terms including and/or having, as used herein, are defined as comprising (i.e., open language). The term coupled, as used herein, is defined as connected, although not necessarily directly, and not necessarily mechanically. The terms program, software application, and the like as used herein, are defined as a sequence of instructions designed for execution on a computer system. A program, computer program, or software application may include a subroutine, a function, a procedure, an object method, an object implementation, an executable application, an applet, a servlet, a source code, an object code, a shared library/dynamic load library and/or other sequence of instructions designed for execution on a computer system.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Conventional processes for forming finFET devices are generally expensive or suffer from high complexity processes. For example, SOI (silicon-on-insulator) substrate processes can be expensive due to the high cost of the SOI substrate. Some conventional processes also cannot obtain a uniform fin thickness for both nMOS and pMOS devices. Even further, some conventional processes involve doping the fin, which reduces mobility and increases the radial-distribution function (RDF). Therefore, one or more embodiments of the present invention provide a method for forming finFETs on bulk substrates with robust isolation. As will be discussed in greater detail below, a dummy fin is formed on a bulk semiconductor substrate and removed through a replacement-metal-gate (RMG) type process flow. A punch-through stopper (PTS) is implanted through the cavity left after removing the dummy fin. Since the fin has not been formed at this point, there is no concern with doping the fin. A semiconductor layer is epitaxially grown to form the fins. For stress, Si:Ge can be grown on pMOS devices and Si:C can be grown on nMOS devices. After the epi growth, the fin can be capped with a hard mask (e.g., oxide, nitride, or a composite of oxide and nitride). A dielectric layer surrounding the fins can be removed with a wet etch or isotropic dry etch. The bulk semiconductor substrate is recessed and an oxide (or other insulating material) is deposited thereon. This oxide is then recessed below the fin. The resulting structure is a fin on bulk substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 6</figref> illustrate cross-sectional views of a finFET transistor being formed utilizing a replacement gate process flow according to one embodiment of the present invention. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a semiconductor structure after formation of a dummy fin on a semiconductor substrate according to one embodiment of the present invention. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a semiconductor structure comprising a dummy fin <b>102</b> that has been formed on a bulk semiconductor substrate <b>104</b>. An optional hard mask <b>106</b> can be formed atop the dummy fin <b>102</b> as well. The bulk semiconductor substrate <b>104</b> includes at least one of Si, Ge, SiGe, GaAs, InAs, InP, SiCGe, SiC as well as other III/V or II/VI compound semiconductors and alloys thereof. In one embodiment, the initial structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is formed by depositing a dielectric layer atop the bulk semiconductor substrate <b>104</b>. The dielectric layer can include a dummy dielectric such as, but not limited to crystalline or non-crystalline oxide, polysilicon, amorphous silicon, nitride, oxynitride, a combination thereof, or any other insulating material.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">An optional hard mask layer comprising, for example, a dielectric material composed of a nitride, oxide, oxynitride material, and/or any other suitable dielectric layer can be deposited atop the dielectric layer. The optional hard mask layer may include a single layer of dielectric material or multiple layers of dielectric materials. The optional hard mask layer can be formed by a deposition process, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and/or atomic layer deposition (ALD). Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a deposition process in which a deposited species is formed as a result of chemical reaction between gaseous reactants at greater than room temperature (25&#xb0; C. to 900&#xb0; C.); wherein solid product of the reaction is deposited on the surface on which a film, coating, or layer of the solid product is to be formed. Variations of CVD processes include, but not limited to, Atmospheric Pressure CVD (APCVD), Low Pressure CVD (LPCVD) and Plasma Enhanced CVD (EPCVD), Metal-Organic CVD (MOCVD) and combinations thereof may also be employed. Alternatively, the optional hard mask layer <b>106</b> may be formed using a growth process, such as thermal oxidation or thermal nitridation. Thereafter, the dummy fin <b>102</b> along with the optional hard mask <b>106</b> is formed from the dielectric layer (and any additional layers such as a polysilicon layer) and optional hard mask layer, respectively, using photolithography and etching.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the semiconductor structure after a dielectric layer <b>208</b> has been formed over the dummy fin <b>102</b>, semiconductor substrate <b>104</b>, and the optional hard mask <b>106</b>. For example, after the dummy fin <b>102</b> and optional hard mask <b>106</b> have been formed a dielectric layer <b>208</b> (e.g., a nitride layer) is then formed over the semiconductor substrate <b>104</b>, the dummy fin structure <b>102</b>, and the hard mask <b>106</b>. This dielectric layer <b>208</b> is etched/polished down until the hard mask <b>106</b> (or dummy fin structure <b>102</b> if a hard mask <b>106</b> is not formed).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the semiconductor structure after a fin cavity <b>310</b> has been formed and a punch-through stopper (PTS) <b>312</b> has been implanted into an exposed portion of the semiconductor substrate <b>104</b>. For example, the dummy fin <b>102</b> and optional hard mask <b>106</b> are removed down to the substrate <b>104</b> via selective etching or other conventional techniques. The dummy fin removal process forms a fin cavity <b>310</b>, which exposes a portion of the semiconductor substrate <b>104</b>. A punch-through implantation process is then performed for implanting a punch-through stopper (PTS) <b>312</b> into the semiconductor substrate <b>104</b>, as shown by the arrows <b>311</b>. The PTS <b>312</b> electrically isolates the semiconductor substrate <b>104</b> from a subsequently formed fin <b>518</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). A separate PTS implantation process can be performed for both nMOS and pMOS devices. For example, a p-type PTS dopant can be implanted for an nMOS device while an n-type PTS dopant can be implanted for a pMOS device.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the semiconductor structure after a semiconductor layer <b>414</b> has been formed on the PTS <b>312</b>. For example, after the PTS <b>312</b> has been formed, a semiconductor layer <b>414</b> (e.g., fin layer) is formed on the PTS <b>312</b> and within the fin cavity <b>310</b>. In this embodiment, the semiconductor layer <b>414</b> is formed through an epitaxial growth process. For example, Si:Ge can be epitaxially grown from the PTS <b>312</b> within the semiconductor substrate <b>104</b> for a pMOS device, while Si (or Si:C) can be epitaxially grown from the PTS <b>312</b> within the semiconductor substrate <b>104</b> for an nMOS device. Alternatively, Si can be epitaxially grown for both pMOS and nMOS devices.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one embodiment, the epitaxially grown Si:Ge is under an intrinsic compressive strain that is produced by a lattice mismatch between the larger lattice dimension of the Si:Ge and the smaller lattice dimension of the layer on which the Si:Ge is epitaxially grown. The epitaxially grown Si:Ge produces a compressive strain in a portion of the semiconductor substrate <b>104</b>. In another embodiment, epitaxially grown Si:C (carbon doped silicon) is under an intrinsic tensile strain that is produced by a lattice mismatch between the smaller lattice dimension of the Si:C and the larger lattice dimension of the layer on which the Si:C is epitaxially grown. The epitaxial grown Si:C produces a tensile strain in a portion of the semiconductor substrate <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">It should be noted that a hard mask <b>416</b> can also be formed on the semiconductor layer <b>414</b> that has been formed in the fin cavity <b>310</b>. The hard mask <b>416</b> can include a dielectric material composed of a nitride, oxide, oxynitride material, and/or any other suitable dielectric layer. The hard mask <b>416</b> may include a single layer of dielectric material or multiple layers of dielectric materials. The hard mask <b>416</b> can be formed by a deposition process, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and/or atomic layer deposition (ALD). Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a deposition process in which a deposited species is formed as a result of chemical reaction between gaseous reactants at greater than room temperature (25&#xb0; C. to 900&#xb0; C.); wherein solid product of the reaction is deposited on the surface on which a film, coating, or layer of the solid product is to be formed. Variations of CVD processes include, but not limited to, Atmospheric Pressure CVD (APCVD), Low Pressure CVD (LPCVD) and Plasma Enhanced CVD (EPCVD), Metal-Organic CVD (MOCVD) and combinations thereof may also be employed. Alternatively, the hard mask <b>416</b> may be formed using a growth process, such as thermal oxidation or thermal nitridation.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the semiconductor structure after removing the dielectric layer <b>208</b> and forming a fin structure <b>518</b>. For example, a photoresist mask is formed overlying the hard mask <b>416</b>, in which the portion of the hard mask <b>416</b> and the semiconductor layer <b>414</b> that is underlying the photoresist mask provides the fin structure <b>518</b>. The exposed portions of the dielectric layer <b>208</b> that is not protected by the photoresist mask is removed using a selective etch process. To provide the photoresist mask, a photoresist layer is first positioned on the dielectric <b>208</b> and hard mask <b>416</b>. The photoresist layer may be provided by a blanket layer of photoresist material that is formed utilizing a deposition process such as, for example, CVD, PECVD, evaporation, or spin-on coating. The blanket layer of photoresist material is then patterned to provide the photoresist mask utilizing a lithographic process that may include exposing the photoresist material to a pattern of radiation and developing the exposed photoresist material utilizing a resist developer.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Following the formation of the photoresist mask, an etching process may remove the unprotected dielectric layer <b>208</b> selective to the underlying hard mask <b>416</b> and semiconductor layer <b>414</b>. For example, the transferring of the pattern provided by the photoresist into the underlying structures may include an anisotropic etch. The anisotropic etch may include reactive-ion etching (RIE). Reactive Ion Etching (RIE) is a form of plasma etching in which during etching the surface to be etched is placed on the RF powered electrode. Moreover, during RIE the surface to be etched takes on a potential that accelerates the etching species extracted from plasma toward the surface, in which the chemical etching reaction is taking place in the direction normal to the surface. Other examples of anisotropic etching that can be used at this point include ion beam etching, plasma etching or laser ablation. Also, a hot phosphorus etching process can be used as well. Once the dielectric layer <b>208</b> has been removed, an anneal (such as, but not limited to, an H<sub>2 </sub>anneal) can be performed to repair the sidewalls of the fin structure <b>518</b> and to smoothen the surface thereof. A portion of the bulk semiconductor substrate <b>104</b> is recessed and a dielectric layer <b>519</b> is deposited atop the bulk semiconductor substrate <b>104</b>. This dielectric layer <b>519</b> can be a crystalline or non-crystalline oxide, nitride, oxynitride, or any other insulating material.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the semiconductor structure after forming a gate structure over the fin structure <b>518</b>. For example, the dielectric layer <b>519</b> is recessed forming the dielectric layer <b>619</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In one embodiment the dielectric layer <b>519</b> is recessed below the fin structure (i.e., recessed to at or below the PTS <b>312</b>) exposing the PTS <b>312</b> resulting in the fin structure <b>518</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. As can be seen, the fin structure <b>518</b> includes the semiconductor layer <b>414</b> formed atop the PTS <b>312</b> and a hard mask <b>416</b> formed atop the semiconductor layer <b>414</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A gate <b>620</b> (comprising a gate dielectric <b>621</b> and gate conductor <b>623</b>) with an optional gate hard mask <b>622</b> is then formed over the fin structure <b>518</b> using either a replacement/dummy gate or gate-first process. A gate (dielectric) spacer <b>624</b> is formed around the gate <b>620</b> and optional hard mask <b>622</b>. With respect to the replacement gate process, a replacement (dummy) gate is formed on the fin structure <b>518</b>. The replacement gate is formed using oxide, polysilicon, amorphous silicon, nitride, or a combination thereof. This replacement gate acts as a place holder for a gate stack. Once the replacement gate is formed, an optional hard mask can be formed on top of the replacement gate. The hard mask includes a dielectric material such as a nitride, oxide, oxynitride material, and/or any other suitable dielectric layer. The optional hard mask can be a single layer of dielectric material or multiple layers of dielectric materials, and can be formed by a deposition process such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and/or atomic layer deposition (ALD). Alternatively, the hard mask can be grown, such as through thermal oxidation or thermal nitridation.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The gate (dielectric) spacer <b>624</b> is then formed surrounding the replacement gate by depositing a conformal layer of dielectric material (such as an oxide, nitride, or oxynitride) and then performing an anisotropic etch (such as a reactive ion etch). After the gate spacer <b>624</b> has been formed, source and drain regions <b>626</b>, <b>628</b> may be provided on opposing sides of the channel. For example, dopants may be implanted via ion implantation into each end of the fin structure <b>518</b> to produce n-type conductivity or p-type conductivity dopant regions, i.e., source and drain regions <b>626</b>, <b>628</b>. P-type conductivity dopant regions are produced in fin structures <b>518</b> by doping a portion of the fin structure <b>518</b> with group III-A elements of the periodic table of elements, such as Boron (B). N-type conductivity is produced in the fin structures <b>518</b> by doping the fin structure <b>518</b> with group V elements, such as Phosphorus (P) or Arsenic (As).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">After the source/drain regions <b>626</b>, <b>628</b> have been formed, a dielectric layer (e.g., an oxide layer) is then formed over the fin structure <b>518</b>, the replacement gate, and the hard mask. This dielectric layer is etched down to the upper surface of the hard mask (or the replacement gate in embodiments in which a hard mask is not used). Then the replacement gate and hard mask are removed via selective etching or another conventional technique, as discussed above. This forms a gate cavity that exposes a portion (an upper horizontal surface and vertical walls) of the fin structure <b>518</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A high-k dielectric material is blanket deposited (for example, by CVD, PECVD, or ALD) and then selectively etched using a process such as RIE to form a high-k dielectric layer <b>621</b> on the exposed portion of the fin structure <b>518</b>. In one embodiment, the gate dielectric includes, but is not limited to, an oxide, nitride, oxynitride and/or silicates including metal silicates, aluminates, titanates, and nitrides. In one example, when the gate dielectric includes an oxide, the oxide may be selected from the group including, but not limited to: SiO<sub>2</sub>, HfO<sub>2</sub>, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>, La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, SrTiO<sub>3</sub>, LaAlO<sub>3</sub>, Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and mixture thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">After the high-k dielectric layer <b>621</b> has been formed, a gate conductor material is then deposited over the structure, lithographically patterned, and etched to form a gate conductor <b>623</b>. The gate conductor <b>623</b> fills the remaining portion of the gate cavity. The gate conductor <b>623</b> of this embodiment is a metal gate layer comprising a conductive refractory metal nitride, such as TaN, TiN, WN, TiAlN, TaCN, or an alloy thereof. The conductive material may include polysilicon, SiGe, a silicide, a metal, or a metal-silicon-nitride such as Ta&#x2014;Si&#x2014;N. Examples of metals that can be used as the conductive material include, but are not limited to: Al, W, Cu, Ti, or other like conductive metals. Conventional fabrication steps are then performed to form the remainder of the integrated circuit that includes this transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">With respect to a gate first process, the gate <b>620</b> is formed similar to the process discussed above after the replacement gate has been removed. For example, a gate dielectric layer <b>621</b> is formed contacting the fin structure <b>518</b>. The gate dielectric layer <b>621</b> can be positioned on at least the vertical sidewalls of the fin structure <b>518</b>. The gate dielectric layer <b>621</b> can be formed by a thermal growth process or by a deposition process, as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">After forming the gate dielectric layer <b>621</b>, a blanket layer of a conductive material which forms the gate conductor <b>623</b> of the gate structure <b>620</b> is formed on the gate dielectric utilizing one or more of the processes discussed above. The blanket layer of conductive material may be doped or undoped. If doped, an in-situ doping deposition process may be employed. Alternatively, a doped conductive material can be formed by deposition, ion implantation and annealing. After deposition of at least the gate dielectric and the conductive material, the gate structure <b>620</b> including the gate conductor <b>623</b> and dielectric <b>621</b> is formed, where the gate dielectric <b>621</b> is positioned between the gate conductor <b>623</b> and the fin structure <b>518</b>. In one embodiment, the gate structure <b>620</b> is formed by first providing a patterned mask atop the conductive material by deposition and lithography and then transferring the pattern to the conductive material and the gate dielectric. The etching steps may include one or more etching processes including dry etching, such as RIE. The region of fin structure <b>518</b> in which the gate conductor crosses over is the channel region. The gate spacer <b>624</b> can then be formed around the gate <b>620</b> (and optional mask <b>622</b>) directly contacting the gate <b>620</b> (and optional mask <b>622</b>). In one embodiment, the gate spacer <b>624</b> is formed by depositing a conformal layer of dielectric material, such as oxides, nitrides, or oxynitrides and performing an etching process. One example of an etching process is an anisotropic etching process, such as reactive ion etch. The source and drain regions <b>626</b>, <b>628</b> can then be provided on opposing sides of the channel, as discussed above.
