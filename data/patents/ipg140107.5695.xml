<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Hannaford Bros. Co. of Scarborough, Me., an affiliate of the assignee of the present invention, has developed a system and method to assess and score food products based on nutritional value, which system and method are identified by the Guiding Stars<sup>SM</sup> mark. The system and method are described in detail in the priority application identified herein. The system requires a database of food product nutritional information used in an algorithm to determine a food nutrition score. Any commercially available databases suitable for use in the original development of the algorithm, comprised an insufficient number of products. Further, the required nutritional information had to be extracted manually and arranged in a form suitable for use with the algorithm. As a result of the inadequacy of the available information, the inventors recognized that a new database would be required in order to gather the type of information needed in the form needed for a comprehensive set of food items, including prepared foods.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">While the initial development of the system involved the use of a sufficient number of sets of food nutritional data, it was soon discovered that the existing information available at the time did not: 1) include all food products offered to consumers; 2) include as much nutritional information as desired to fully implement the scoring algorithm; and 3) come in a form suitable for efficient processing through the scoring system. Therefore, what is needed is a food nutritional information gathering and storage system suitable to enable a comprehensive food nutritional value scoring system. Further, what is needed is such a gathering and storage system flexible enough to adapt to changes in nutritional information for any food product, including packaged and prepared foods. Yet further, what is needed is a food nutritional information gathering and storage system arranged to enable easy access to specific information of interest for any application of interest.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an object of the present invention to provide a food nutritional information gathering and storage system suitable to enable a comprehensive food nutritional value scoring system. It is also an object of the present invention to provide such a gathering and storage system flexible enough to adapt to changes in nutritional information for any food product, including packaged and prepared foods. Further, it is an object of the present invention to provide a food nutritional information gathering and storage system arranged to enable easy access to specific information of interest for any application of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">These and other objects of the present invention are achieved through a database configured to organize food information in a format that allows for information updates, information processing and information output controllable by a user. The database is a relational database comprising an expandable set of tables with relationships designed to carry out the goal of scoring food nutritional value for any food product for which nutritional information is available. The tables contain food information including, but not limited to, food nutritional information. The database is arranged to allow for changes in food information, as well as additions and deletions of food items. The database includes access authorization restrictions to ensure that only designated personnel can input or change information. The access to the information contained in the database may be more widespread than access to the information change function.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention further includes computer programming to implement steps associated with accessing the information of the database and producing outputs associated with the performance of the nutritional value algorithm or other functions of interest involving use of the nutritional information of the database. Principal steps include, but are not limited to: 1) establishing a unique product identifier; 2) determining whether it has one or more ingredients and/or is a prepared food; 3) determining whether the product is already stored in the database; 4) determining whether the product has enough calories to be included in the database for nutritional scoring purposes; 5) entering nutritional information for the product either directly from a label or through an ingredient nutritional value determination; 6) running the entered nutritional information through the algorithm to establish a nutritional value; 7) determining for an existing product with changed nutritional information whether the value rating for the product should be changed; 8) auditing the system for new and changed value rating designations; and 9) activating a changed tag process for new and changed products with new value ratings.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention includes a database comprising one or more food product information tables including entities for: identifying one or more food products, each by a unique identifier, listing ingredients of each food product, and listing nutritional information of each food product, and one or more nutritional element mapping tables, each including fields for identifying nutritional value element mapping based on food product nutritional information. The database also includes one or more star rating mapping tables for designating a rating algorithm type for one or more of the one or more food products and a product label table that includes entities for food product super category and category. Additional tables of the database include a recipe table, a nutrition master table, an elements point table, a sub elements table, and an exceptions table, but is not limited thereto. The one or more food product information tables include entities for food base nutrients, vitamins and minerals. The database is arranged to enable a user to selectably display nutritional information and rating information for one or more of the one or more food products based on nutritional rating, company name or other selectable filtering options. The database is also arranged to group the one or more food items based on product state selected from the group consisting of items new to system, items pending for rating, items rated, items flagged do not rate and items ready for rating. The database is arranged to enable a user to modify food product ingredient or nutritional information and recalculate the star rating and to set up a dummy food product type, calculate a star rating for the dummy food product, modify nutritional information for the dummy food product, and recalculate the star rating.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention further includes a memory for storing data for access by an application program being executed on a computer processing system, comprising a data structure stored in the memory, the data structure including information resident in a database used by the application program, the database including one or more food product information tables including entities for: identifying one or more food products, each by a unique identifier, listing ingredients of each food product, and listing nutritional information of each food product, and one or more nutritional value mapping tables, each including fields for identifying nutritional value element mapping based on food product nutritional information. The memory includes the features of the database described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention also contemplates the use of one or more computer-readable media comprising computer-executable instructions that, when executed, direct a computing system to maintain a database comprising: one or more food product information tables including entities for: identifying one or more food products, each by a unique identifier, listing ingredients of the one or more food products, and listing nutritional information of each food product, and a nutritional value mapping function including fields for identifying nutritional value element mapping based on food product nutritional information. The media further include a star rating function for designating a rating algorithm type for each food product and computer-executable instructions to enable a user to selectably display nutritional information and rating information for one or more of the one or more food products based on nutritional rating. Other computer-executable instructions of the media enable the user to selectably display nutritional information and rating information for one or more of the one or more food products based on company name, group the one or more food items based on product state selected from the group consisting of items new to system, items pending for rating, items rated, items flagged do not rate and items ready for rating, calculate a star rating based on product nutritional information, nutritional value mapping and rating algorithm type, modify food product ingredient or nutritional information and recalculate the star rating, or to set up a dummy food product type, calculate a star rating for the dummy food product, modify nutritional information for the dummy food product, and recalculate the star rating.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The invention also includes a method implemented, at least in part, by a computing system, and comprising the steps of maintaining one or more food product information tables, identifying in the one or more tables one or more food products, each by a unique identifier, listing ingredients of the one or more food products, listing nutritional information of the one or more food products, and identifying nutritional value element mapping based on food product nutritional information. The method also includes the steps of designating a rating algorithm type for each food product and determining a nutritional value rating of the food products based on the element mapping and the rating algorithm type. Additionally, the method may include the steps of generating one or more reports displaying nutritional information for one or more of the one or more food products based on selectable nutritional information, generating one or more reports displaying nutritional information and rating information for one or more of the one or more food products based on selectable nutritional rating, generating one or more reports displaying nutritional information and rating information for one or more of the one or more food products based on company name, or grouping the one or more food items based on product state selected from the group consisting of items new to system, items pending for rating, items rated, items flagged do not rate and items ready for rating. Additional steps of the method include, but are not limited to modifying food product ingredient or nutritional information and recalculating nutritional value rating, and setting up a dummy food product in the one or more food product information tables, calculating a star rating for the dummy food product, modifying the nutritional information for the dummy food product, and recalculating the star rating for the dummy food product.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The combination of the relational database and the programming function embodied in software enables a food distributor, food retailer, or any party interested in assessing and evaluating nutritional value information for a wide array of food products in a uniform manner to access that information. This and other advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon review of the following detailed description, the accompanying drawings and the appended claims.</p>

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an information input and processing system <b>200</b> of the present invention includes a plurality of functions embodied in one or more computer programs executable through the computer processor <b>120</b> of the computer system <b>100</b>, wherein signals are exchanged between the functions and the computer processor <b>120</b>, and between the database <b>130</b> and the functions through the computer processor <b>120</b>. Functions of the system <b>200</b> include a local common products information input function <b>210</b>, a remote common products information input function <b>220</b>, a local unique products information input function <b>230</b>, a remote unique products information input function <b>240</b>, a data input reporting function <b>250</b>, a nutritional value designation function <b>260</b>, a remote rating function <b>270</b>, a local rating function <b>280</b> and a tag generation function <b>290</b>. All or a portion of the identified functions may be employed in carrying out steps to calculate and report food nutritional value and rating information.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The local common products information input function <b>210</b> of the system <b>200</b> enables a user to input to the Database <b>130</b> information for food products that are made available through, or are otherwise of interest to, an entity, such as a food products retailer and that may also be available, or of interest, to another party. Cereal from a commercial manufacturer is one instance of a common food product. In the example of the Guiding Stars<sup>SM</sup> program created by the assignee of the present application, Hannaford is a food products retailer offering thousands of food items to consumers. In addition, Hannaford may have an affiliation with another food retailer that is located remote from Hannaford and that remote affiliate may share in common with Hannaford the ability to offer to consumers at least a portion of the total number of food products that are offered by Hannaford. As a primary administrator of the system <b>200</b> with authorization to access and modify the Database <b>130</b>, through programming represented by the local common products information input function <b>210</b>, Hannaford would input food item information into the Database <b>130</b> that it offers that is also available through its affiliate. The local common products input function <b>210</b> permits the user to identify the original provider of the food product information (Hannaford in the example) as well as the names of one or more others that also provide the same product or products. Of course, the local supplier of the information could be a party of any type and is not intended to be limited to food retailers alone. The Database <b>130</b> is arranged to include information designation to tag food products as being of common interest to a plurality of parties.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As with the local common products information input function <b>210</b>, the remote common products information input function <b>220</b> of the system <b>200</b> enables a user to input to the Database <b>130</b> information for food products that are made available through, or are otherwise of interest to, an entity, such as a food products retailer and that may also be available, or of interest, to another party. However, for this function, the originator of the food product information would not be the party that otherwise controls the Database <b>130</b>, but instead a party that has an interest in the use of, and some potentially restricted access to, the Database <b>130</b>. In the example described in the preceding paragraph for the Guiding Stars<sup>SM</sup> program, it would be the Hannaford affiliate that would generate the food product information, which food product information may be of interest to one or more other parties, such as Hannaford, for example. Of course, the remote supplier of the information could be a party of any type and is not intended to be limited to food retailers alone. The system <b>200</b> administrator would obtain the information from the remote information provider and, through programming represented by the remote common products information input function <b>220</b>, would input food item information into the Database <b>130</b> that it also provides or that otherwise is of interest to the Database <b>130</b> administrator. The remote common products input function <b>220</b> permits the user to identify the original provider of the food product information as well as the names of one or more others that also provide the same product or products.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The local unique products information input function <b>230</b> of the system <b>200</b> enables a user to input to the Database <b>130</b> information for food products that are made available only through a single party and not through others. For example, a food retailer may provide prepared foods with their unique recipes that are available only by one retailer, and possibly by only one store of the retailer. The system <b>200</b> administrator associated with the unique food item provider, through programming represented by the local unique products information input function <b>230</b>, would input food item information into the Database <b>130</b> that is offered only by that provider. The local unique products input function <b>230</b> permits the user to identify the original provider of the food product information. Of course, the local provider of the information could be a party of any type and is not intended to be limited to food retailers alone. The Database <b>130</b> is arranged to include information designation to tag food products as being of unique interest to a specific party.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The remote unique products information input function <b>240</b> of the system <b>200</b> enables a user to input to the Database <b>130</b> information for food products that are made available only through a single party and not through others, wherein the single party is not directly associated with the system <b>200</b> administrator. The system <b>200</b> administrator, through programming represented by the remote unique products information input function <b>240</b>, would input food item information into the Database <b>130</b> that is offered only by the remote. The remote unique products input function <b>240</b> permits the system <b>200</b> administrator to identify the original provider of the food product information. Of course, the remote provider of the information could be a party of any type and is not intended to be limited to food retailers alone. Further, it is to be understood that the remote provider may or may not have access to the Database <b>130</b>. If the remote provider does have such access, its access may be limited to a portion of the contents of the Database <b>130</b>. For example, the remote provider may only be able to view information regarding its unique food items and those food items it has in common with others for which it is permitted to gain access to.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The information that is provided to the Database <b>130</b> through the system <b>200</b>, whether obtained locally or remotely or from one party or a plurality of parties, includes at least the minimum of: name of the product, Universal Product Code (UPC) as a unique product identification; source of the information; manufacturer of the product; description of the product; product ingredients; and nutritional information. Additional optional information may include, but not be limited to: any warnings listed about the product; the Nutrition Facts Panel, if available; supplemental product information; food product grouping; and food product subgrouping. The source of the food product information may be the original manufacturer, such as through a Nutrition Facts Panel, if one is required. Other sources of food product information include, but are not limited to: public information sources, such as the United States Department of Agriculture; private information sources, such as the ESHA Genesis SQL nutrient database available through ESHA Research of Salem, Oreg.; a food preparer, such as the deli department of a food retailer. The system <b>200</b> of the presented invention has been arranged to receive food information in a variety of forms from a variety of sources, and organize that information via the Database <b>130</b> into a common format that enables nutritional element valuing and, ultimately, rating of the food product based on the nutritional element valuing. No other food information source provides such functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">With continuing reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the data input reporting function <b>250</b> permits the user to confirm that food product information suitable for nutritional rating has been stored in the Database <b>130</b> in a form suitable for generating the rating. The data reporting function <b>250</b> also flags items for which the information is insufficient to establish a rating. Further, the data input reporting function <b>250</b> includes programming to generate Graphical User Interfaces that enable a user of the system <b>200</b> to observe food product information stored in the Database <b>130</b> and, for those users with authorization to do so, to modify the food product information contained in the Database <b>130</b>. Such a change may be made, for example, when a food product provider has changed the ingredients for a named product already having a designated UPC.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The nutritional value designation function <b>260</b> is configured through programming to activate the algorithm described in the referenced co-pending application to acquire food product information contained in the Database <b>130</b> and perform calculations thereon to generate nutritional value points. The nutritional value designation function <b>260</b> performs in conjunction with the local rating function <b>270</b> and the remote rating function <b>280</b> to produce star rating designations for one or more selected food items contained in the Database <b>130</b>. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize the programming details required to carry out the steps described in the referenced co-pending application to generate the nutritional element valuing and the rating calculations. The nutritional value designation function <b>260</b> and the local rating function <b>270</b> and the remote rating function <b>280</b>, in combination, perform the functions of gathering the necessary food nutritional information and the algorithm. Further, the local rating function <b>270</b> includes a subfunction to enable the reporting of food ratings for one or more food items of interest to the local provider of the food or the information. The remote rating function <b>280</b> includes a subfunction to enable the reporting of food ratings for one or more food items of interest to the remote provider of the food or the information.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The system <b>200</b> may be activated for use periodically, regularly, continuously or sporadically. The food product information may be gathered on a regular or sporadic basis. The check of the quality of the information gathered through the data input reporting function <b>250</b> may be performed regularly or sporadically. The steps associated with performing food nutritional valuing through the nutritional value designation function <b>260</b>, and the food nutritional value rating calculations performed through the local rating function <b>270</b> and/or the remote rating function <b>280</b> may be performed regularly or sporadically. In the example of Hannaford's Guiding Stars<sup>SM</sup> program, system checks for new data inputs are performed twice weekly and final confirmation of ratings to be calculated are performed twice per week. The confirmation calculations are performed prior to undertaking any steps to generate any materials that may be required to present rating information to consumers. All results produced are preferably retained.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">A related optional function of the system <b>200</b> that is implemented as part of the Guiding Stars<sup>SM</sup> program is the tag generation function <b>290</b>. The tag generation function <b>290</b> is an interface between the rating functions <b>270</b>/<b>280</b> and a food provider's display tag system used to present summary information to retail food consumers. Specifically, the tag generation function <b>290</b> generates information on the star rating for each food item for which a first star rating has been generated, or for which a star rating has been changed, such as resulting from a change of food item nutritional information or a change in the algorithm. That information is transferred to a program or function that is engaged to make tags including the rating information. It is to be understood that the tag generation function <b>290</b> may not be required to some types of users of the system <b>200</b>. For example, a party interested in food product nutritional information for research, reporting or purposes other than providing retail consumer food information at the point of sale, would likely have no need to generate information tags.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The system <b>200</b> represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may be embodied in one or more computer programs and one or more computer systems. It may be embodied in software, hardware, firmware or any combination thereof. The functions shown may be performed through the computer processor <b>120</b> as a single computing mechanism, or through a plurality of computer processors represented by processor <b>120</b>. The system <b>200</b> may include one or more embodiments of the Database <b>130</b>, which Database <b>130</b> may be embodied in the computer processor <b>120</b> or in one or more other computer systems in electronic communication with the computer processor <b>120</b>. It is to be noted that information gathered, stored and/or manipulated through the system <b>200</b>, may be used without specific presentation on a graphical user interface of the computer system <b>100</b>. For example, the output of information may be transferred among computer devices, or within a networked computing system, without specific presentation on a display.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As indicated herein, the Database <b>130</b> stores all food nutritional information in original and adjusted form, as well as any information of interest related to the food products for which nutritional information is gathered, and the information output based on implementation of the food nutritional value scoring or such other manipulation of the gathered and stored information. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3D</figref> in combination show a view of an embodiment of a format of the Database <b>130</b> in which each box is a table and each table includes a set of entities or fields. Entities represent data that describe characteristics of a food product. For example, the table PRDT_INFO includes, but is not limited to, entities of product brand name, product generic name, and product weight. <b>12</b></p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Relationships: The lines between tables reflect the relationship between two or more entities. Note that one end of the line can be straight, which means that there is a one-to-one relationship to the particular table, while the other end of the line is a representation of a key, which means a many-to-one relationship. For example, the relationship between the PRDT_INFO table and the RECIPE table. The end of the line connecting to the PRDT_INFO table is straight while its opposing end has a key connecting to the RECIPE table. This means that one set of product information can be used in many recipes. A dashed line means that primary key entities of one table are embodied in data associated with another table to which the dashed line is linked. A solid line means that primary key entities of one table are also primary key entities of another table to which the solid line is linked.</p>

    <li id="ul0001-0010" num="0072">EXCP: This table stores the information of specific exceptions available under the EXCP_MSTR catalog that are associated with a specific product that would render that product not ratable. COMPANY: This table stores the information of different product information providers.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0011" num="0073">PRD_CAT: This table stores the information of all the product categories present in the Database <b>130</b>.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0012" num="0074">SEQ_CNTL: This table is used to store the control designations for sequencing the functions of the tables of the Database <b>130</b> and to determine whether product rating recalculation or new calculation is required.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0075">Tables 1-13 provide details about the entities associated with the tables. Each entity is represented by Type, whether related as a Primary Key and/or a Foreign Key, and a brief description of the information to be included for that entity. The Type is the form of the information, whether an alphabetical character, a numerical character, a fixed character or a variable character. An entity that is a Primary Key entity has one and only one value for its use as part of a particular table. As a first example, the SID_NBR entity for the logical sequence number of a product has a unique value that is consistent throughout the tables. As a second example, the LBL_DSC entity for the product description can have mor e than one value within a table and across tables. An entity that is a Foreign Key links entities, tables or entities and tables together. As an example, the CO_ID&#x2014;CD entity is common among tables PRDT_LBL and PRDT_CAT for table COMPANY.</p>

<p id="p-0078" num="0089">There are three major computer program components used to implement the system and access to and usage of the Database <b>130</b>. They are: 1) the Database <b>130</b> schema; 2) a Graphical User Interface (GUI); and 3) a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) that interfaces between the Database <b>130</b> and the GUI. In one embodiment, the Database <b>130</b> schema is defined in a file established in DB2. In an alternative embodiment, the Database <b>130</b> schema may be defined in a file established in Microsoft SQL Server Transact-SQL code. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that other programming means may be employed to establish the Database <b>130</b> schema represented schematically in the accompanying drawings and associated written description of the Database <b>130</b> design and architecture. The GUI is defined in a file established in Java Server Pages (JSP), Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) code, and JavaScript code. In this embodiment, the majority of the files for the User Interface are written manually and compiled on a server using a JAVA compiler to create HTML pages. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize the specific programming required to generate the GUI as represented in accompanying <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-20</figref>. The present invention is not limited to the specific programming languages identified herein.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0090">The DLL provides a programmatic interface between the Database <b>130</b> and the GUI. The DLL is preferably implemented in JAVA but is not limited thereto. The files of the DLL may be generated manually or they may be compiled using the Java compiler language to examine the other files including, but not limited to, JAVA, which may then be used to generate the JAVA class files. The programming necessary to establish the DLL suitable for linking the Database <b>130</b> to the GUI may be prepared by one of ordinary skill in the art based on the detailed information provided herein for the tables and entities and through the GUI screen captures and associated text also provided herein.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0091">In the Hannaford Guiding Stars<sup>SM</sup> embodiment of the present invention, the system <b>200</b> conducts batch processing of food item information through specific arrangements of the functions identified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The information acquired from external sources and generated by the user are batched for acceptance as part of a first job set. Acquired and any additional information developed are then batched for entry into the Database <b>130</b> as part of a second job set. Processing of gathered information to conduct nutritional value scoring and star ratings are batched together as part of a third job set. Reports of nutritional information and scoring and rating are batched together as part of a fourth job set. Tagging instructions are batched together as part of a fifth job set. Optionally, preparation of gathered and calculated information for the purpose of transfer to external sites is batched together as part of a sixth job set. Details of the functions associated with these example batch job sets are provided herein with respect to GUIs to be observed by users of the system <b>200</b>. More generally, it is to be understood that the particular batching arrangements listed herein with respect to the Hannaford Guiding Stars<sup>SM</sup> program are intended to be example representations. Others of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the data acquisition, storage, manipulation and use may be performed using the same or similar functions in different ways without deviating from the primary concepts of the system <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0092">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-20</figref>, the products information input functions <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>230</b> and <b>240</b> of the system <b>200</b> enable a user to view, input and adjust food product information, and then to have calculated a food nutritional value rating, which information is also viewable and storable in the Database <b>130</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-20</figref> are graphical representations of the screens viewed by the user in the food product nutritional information input, rating calculation and storage process. The system <b>200</b> embodied in a food nutritional value computer program as described herein, is activated or launched by clicking on an icon representing the program, or otherwise initiating application opening through desktop activation methods well known to users of computer programs. Access to the system <b>200</b> and the Database <b>130</b> may be regulated by conventional authentication and access rules, such as by the particular role of the user seeking access to the system <b>200</b>. For example, the system <b>200</b> may be arranged to grant full access for modification of food item nutritional information, element rule mapping modifications and star valuing algorithm adjustments. Alternatively, a user may be granted access solely to observe stored information, and calculate element values and star ratings. Other role types and access restrictions may be established and changed from time to time based on guidelines established by the system <b>200</b> owner.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0093">Upon activating the system <b>200</b>, the computer processor <b>120</b> enables the user to observe on display <b>103</b> a first screen as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The first screen, as with all other screens created through use of the system <b>200</b>, is a GUI, which enables the user to see one or more interactive display representations of tables and entities of the Database <b>130</b>, and to manipulate the content of the Database <b>130</b> through user inputs, generally either with keystrokes of the keyboard <b>101</b>, and/or clicking or clicking and dragging with the mouse <b>102</b> icons, categories, items, elements, formulas, and the like represented on the display <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0094">The initial system access display represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> presents the user with a simple set of choices for entry into the system <b>200</b>, which, when activated, enable the user to choose from an array of paths to view and input food information. The GUI of the initial screen includes an initiation tab set <b>300</b>. The initiation tab set <b>300</b> includes an Items List tab <b>302</b> and a Search tab <b>303</b>. The Item List tab <b>302</b> includes a Product State drop down menu <b>304</b>, which gives the user the choice of categorizing food items for display based upon selectable product state parameters. In one embodiment of the present invention, the selectable product state parameters selectable through the Product State drop down menu <b>304</b> include &#x201c;Items new to system&#x201d;, &#x201c;Items pending for rating,&#x201d; &#x201c;Items rated,&#x201d; &#x201c;Items flagged do not rate,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Items ready for rating.&#x201d; More or fewer selection parameters may be used as desired. The Item List tab <b>302</b> further includes a Company drop down menu <b>306</b>, which gives the user the choice of focusing the search on food items of interest to, or manufactured or sold by, a particular party (designated herein as a Company). Clicking on Show List button <b>308</b> triggers the population of a table comprising a list of items matching the Company and Product State parameters selected by the user and shown in one example form in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0095">A simplified representation of the flow of decision making for the product state designations is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, wherein DNR stands for &#x201c;do not rate.&#x201d; The decision making process carried out by the system <b>200</b> such as through at least functions <b>210</b>-<b>240</b>, involves first determining whether all information required to establish a rating for a food item is available for that item. If not, or if the particular item is the type that should not be rated (including, for example, a non-food item), the item is flagged as do not rate. Such items may either be removed from the Database <b>130</b> or they may be retained for further evaluation of whether required information may be obtained and the status of the item converted to items new to system. Relevant information is entered for the item and a decision is made as to whether the item should be passed along for rating or flagged as pending for rating. Thereafter, the process described herein in additional detail is followed to the point of establishing star ratings for items identified suitable for inclusion in the star rating process.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0096">The &#x201c;Items new to system&#x201d; selection makes available for viewing a listing of food items that have been stored in the Database <b>130</b> for the purpose of entering nutritional information used in rating the nutritional value for such items. Such food items may be manually or automatically entered into the Database <b>130</b>, dependent upon the source of origin for the items. For example, a particular food retailer may have a master company database of all items it offers, including all food items. That master database may be arranged to &#x201c;mark&#x201d; all incoming food items as being of the type of retail item that should be entered into the Database <b>130</b> for subsequent rating through the rating algorithm. Alternatively, the new items that fall within the Items new to system category may come from other sources including, but not limited to, external suppliers.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0097">The Items new to system are likely to enter the Database <b>130</b> without all pertinent nutritional information provided, without changed nutritional information provided, or with incomplete general item information. In other words, additional or corrective information may have to be inserted into the data set for that item. However, the initial item entry is from an external source, which source preferably provides the Universal Product Code (UPC) for each item. Therefore, in the form of the present invention described herein, the system <b>200</b> begins its functions after items have been provided. Relevant information regarding those provided items is then added or changed in the Database <b>130</b>. However, it is to be understood that the system <b>200</b> can function to store item information where the item origin begins with the system <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0098">An aspect of the present invention that addresses a particular omission in any prior databases of food information relates to prepared foods, referred to herein from time to time as recipes. The system <b>200</b> includes through functions <b>210</b>-<b>240</b> the option to include pertinent nutritional information about foods that may be prepared at the point of sale. Whereas prior food nutritional information reporting requirements were limited to manufactured foods sold in packaging with a Nutrition Facts panel, food items that are prepared on site, such as at a local delicatessen shop or food retailer, generally do not come with a Nutrition Facts panel. As a result, the consumer and, in this case, the system <b>200</b>, would not be able to assess nutritional value for such recipes. The GUIs to be described herein enable the user to input pertinent nutritional information for such items by listing all ingredients in a recipe, gathering nutritional information for each ingredient and entering such information into the Database <b>130</b>, and doing so for a specified serving size. The nutritional information for the individual ingredients of the recipe may come from one or more sources, including internal and external sources. As an example, a prepared sandwich comprising ham, cheese, lettuce, mayonnaise and bread can be evaluated for star rating using the system <b>200</b> by gathering the nutritional information for each component. The ham and lettuce information could come from a national source, such as the US Food and Drag Administration, while the cheese, mayonnaise and bread information may come from three separate manufacturers of those products. The present invention therefore enables a complete database of food nutritional information and scoring and rating for any type of food item, including recipes.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0099">The &#x201c;Items pending for rating&#x201d; selection makes available for viewing information about all food items for which all required product information has been entered into the Database <b>130</b> for processing through the algorithm for star rating but that first require verification of the entered information prior to activating the rating algorithm for such item set. This includes newly included items as well as items for which nutritional or other information may have been changed and recalculation of nutritional value is required. The &#x201c;Items rated&#x201d; selection makes available for viewing information about all food items for which star ratings have been generated and made available for public viewing. The &#x201c;Items flagged do not rate&#x201d; selection makes available for viewing information about all food items for which there is not sufficient information available for processing through the algorithm for star rating, or for which there is no interest or need to process for a star rating. The &#x201c;Items ready for rating&#x201d; selection makes available for viewing information about all food items that are ready for star rating after all information for the item has been entered and verified. The number of food items in a particular selection is optionally indicated at <b>368</b>.</p>

The Other Nutrients sheet <b>490</b> includes a window for viewing, adding, changing or removing information about any other nutrients considered to be relevant to the overall nutritional valuation associated with the selected item. In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, other nutrients deemed to be of importance for inclusion in the calculation of a star rating include calories from fat, total fat, polyunsaturated fat, other carbohydrates, protein, Thiamin (Vitamin B11), Riboflavin (Vitamin B2), Niacin (Vitamin B3), Stearic Acid, carbohydrates and trans fatty acids. It is to be understood that the other nutrients may be selected to be a different set of components. The other nutrients information is obtained from the item information supplier including, for example, from a Nutrition Facts panel of a food item.</p>

<p id="p-0112" num="0123">With continuing reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, any information entered in any of the windows may be saved by activating save button <b>466</b>. Alternatively, the information entered in the windows may be erased by activating the reset button <b>468</b>, in which case any information existing prior to entering changes in the windows will remain in the Database <b>130</b>. As with the other product information nutrients GUIs, the user may view a single display of all information for the selected item, including all nutrients information, item name, descriptions, categories and UPC, and nutritional value points and star rating by activating Product Score Card&#x2014;Old link <b>474</b> to display all such information as described with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. After saving any information input changes using the save button <b>466</b>, the user may activate Product Score Card&#x2014;New link <b>476</b> to view an update of the item information and nutritional value and star rating changes, if any, resulting from item information changes that were saved as described with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Since the Other Nutrients details view and input sheet <b>490</b> is intended to be inclusive of all other nutrients considered to be of interest, Add Nutrient tab <b>504</b> is included as part of sheet <b>490</b> to enable the user to introduce additional nutrients of interest. Activating the Add Nutrient tab <b>504</b> produces for each activation an additional Nutrient Name input window generally at <b>506</b>, with corresponding input windows for window sets <b>492</b>, <b>496</b> and <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0124">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref> A and <b>13</b>B, when the user activates the Product Score Card&#x2014;Old link <b>474</b>, a screen display is generated that depicts information about a food item for which a star rating has not been recalculated. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref>, when the user activates the Product Score Card&#x2014;New link <b>476</b>, a screen display is generated that depicts information about a food item for which a star rating has been recalculated. That recalculation may have been performed after specific information about the item has been changed, after nutritional information valuing has been changed, the star rating algorithm has been modified, or any combination of the above. An advantage of the present invention is that the ability to recalculate nutritional values and ratings enables the user to conduct trial evaluations for food items. For example, if a particular food item has received a particular star rating and there is an interest in evaluating what types of changes may be required in the food item to improve its scoring, the user may make test adjustments to nutrient and/or ingredient information and then recalculate the item's rating. In that way, a food provider may be able to efficiently experiment with food ingredient changes by first assessing nutritional impact of contemplated changes using the system <b>200</b>, and then making the changes to assess likeability, shelf life and any other attributes of interest. Alternatively, a contemplated food item may be set up in the system <b>200</b> as a &#x201c;dummy&#x201d; item and assesses for its prospective star rating. Verification and authorization features forming part of the system <b>200</b> minimize the possibility that a food item's star rating will be incorrectly presented to the public based on prospective ingredient changes rather than real ones. This feature of the present invention likely enhances the possibility that food suppliers will work to improve the nutritional qualities of their offerings.</p>

The food item data stored in the Database <b>130</b> may be accessed to generate such selectable reports based on Company (e.g., vendor) name, by particular nutrient components, by particular ingredients&#x2014;including any potential allergens, by nutrient or ingredient limits, by caloric values, by serving sizes, by element point values, by individual element limits, or any other set of parameters of interest to the user. In other words, the arrangement of the Database <b>130</b> allows the user to filter for any information set of interest. This ability to &#x201c;slice and dice&#x201d; the data as desired through the design and structure of the Database <b>130</b> and the system <b>200</b>, allows the user to gather and review broad sets of information as well as very specific sets of information and anything in between. This function of the present invention is a substantial improvement over any food product information database previously available for use as it enables the user to focus in on particular food information, review it, value it, rate it and, as a result, to conveniently make assessments about individual food items and sets of food items. This data filtering capability for a very large food product set is of value to food retailers, food manufacturers, food developers and nutrition researchers.</p>
