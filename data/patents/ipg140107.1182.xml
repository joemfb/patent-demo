<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention is directed to a vehicle seat, particularly a seat in a commercial vehicle, having an oscillatory scissor-type stand and a damper articulated at two parts of the scissor-type stand movable relative to one another, wherein one end of the damper is articulated at a pin that extends in transverse direction of the seat and that extends between two structural parts arranged at a distance from one another in transverse direction of the seat at a part of the scissor-type stand.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a vehicle seat of the type mentioned above, the seat structure may be exposed to torsion so that the point of connection of the damper to the pin in particular can shift slightly in y-direction. If the damper is fixedly clamped in at such a time, it can tilt and be damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to prevent this, the damper can be mounted on an articulated bushing or on a bushing constructed so as to be spherical on the inner side. In this case, a slight rotation perpendicular to the y-axis is possible in order to compensate for a twisting of the seat structure. In this case, the damper may move in y-direction and contact the structural parts.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">DE 10 2008 015 614 B3 discloses a commercial-vehicle seat of the type mentioned above having a damper arranged at a scissor pin of the commercial-vehicle seat by means of a ball joint.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Arrangements of dampers or similarly operating component parts between movable parts are also common in other technical fields. For example, EP 0 893 289 A1 discloses a hydraulic cylinder arranged between a vehicle frame and a steerable rear axle of a forklift. For this purpose, the hydraulic cylinder is mounted on a bushing with a convex surface.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">This can lead to unpleasant noises.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is an object of one embodiment of the invention to provide a vehicle seat of the type mentioned above that avoids these drawbacks, has a simple construction, and is easy to assemble.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to one embodiment of the invention, a bearing bushing is arranged with its axial bushing opening on a pin or on a tubular component part enclosing the pin. The bushing opening has a spherical longitudinal section with the greatest diameters at the two axial ends and the smallest diameter in the middle region of the bushing opening, in that the bearing bushing is enclosed by a bearing ring of the damper having a shorter axial length than the bearing bushing, the bearing ring is arranged on the bearing bushing at an axial distance from the two ends of the bearing bushing so as to be secured against axial displacement, and the bearing bushing is arranged between the structural parts without axial play.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Owing to the spherical longitudinal section of the bushing opening, a slight rotation can be carried out relative to the y-axis without hindrance at the articulation point of the damper, and the damper is reliably prevented from contacting the structural parts and, therefore, from generating unpleasant noises in an axially fixed position of the bearing ring of the damper in a middle position between the structural parts due to the axial distance between the bearing ring and the structural parts.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The bearing bushing can be supported by its front end at the structural parts directly or by spacer elements so that the bearing bushing is arranged between the structural parts without play, and at least one front end of the bearing bushing is supported in an axially resilient manner.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">For this purpose, the bearing bushing can have, at one front end, one or more spring arms directed radially outward and by which the bearing bushing is axially supported at a structural part.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">To prevent tilting of the bearing bushing, the bearing bushing can have a plurality of spring arms arranged so as to be uniformly distributed around its circumference.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In order to have a long operative length of the spring arms and, therefore, a large possible spring deflection, the arms can comprise a first spring arm portion which is directed radially outward and a second spring arm portion extending axial to the longitudinal axis of the bearing bushing, the end of the second spring arm portion remote of the first spring arm portion being connected to the bearing bushing.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In this way, manufacturing tolerances in the bearing parts are reliably bypassed so that the bearing bushing is arranged without axial play.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The spring arms can be constructed integral with the bearing bushing to economize on components parts.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In order to axially define the installation position of the bearing ring in one axial direction, one or more stops can be fixedly arranged in the end region of the bearing bushing having the spring arms, which stops project radially outward from the radially circumferential cylindrical outer lateral surface of the bearing bushing, and one end face of the bearing ring contacts the stops axially, for which purpose the bearing bushing can have a plurality of stops which are arranged so as to be uniformly distributed over its circumference.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">This also results in a construction that economizes on component parts when the stops are constructed integral with the bearing bushing.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A multifunction bearing bushing is achieved in such a way that component parts are spared when the bearing bushing has the spring arms and the stops alternately distributed over its circumference.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">If a second stop that is contacted axially by the second end face of the bearing ring can be arranged at the end region of the bearing bushing opposite the stops, this serves to axially define the installation position of the bearing ring in the other axial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a simple construction for this purpose, the second stop can be a ring can be inserted into an annular groove formed radially circumferentially at the cylindrical outer lateral surface of the bearing bushing, and the ring is preferably a flexible retaining ring.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The tubular component part enclosed by the bearing bushing can have at its one axial end a first spacer element that projects radially outward by which the bearing bushing is supported by one front end or by the spring arms at one of the structural parts.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">To economize on component parts, the spacer element can be a flange.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A cap-shaped second spacer element can be placed on the second axial end of the tubular component part enclosed by the bearing bushing, the bearing bushing is axially supported at the front side of the radially circumferential cap edge of the second spacer element, and the cap base of the second spacer element is supported at the second structural part.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a simple construction, the pin is preferably a screw whose shaft projects through a first axial bore hole in the first structural part, the bushing opening, and a second axial bore hole in the second structural part, and one end of the screw shaft has a screw head which contacts the outer side of one structural part, and the other end of the screw shaft is provided with a thread on which a nut is screwed which contacts the outer side of the other structural part.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The pin is preferably a screw whose screw shaft projects through a first axial bore hole in the first structural part, the tubular component part, a bore hole in the cap base, and a second axial bore hole in the second structural part, one end of the screw shaft has a screw head which contacts the outer side of one structural part, and the other end of the screw shaft is provided with a thread on which is screwed a nut contacting the outer side of the other structural part.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The tubular component part is clamped in between the two structural parts by the firmly tightened nut without play and without impairing the ability of the bearing bushing to swivel freely around the y-axis.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In a simple construction, the damper is a gas spring.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Oscillation, e.g., in z-direction, is made possible in that the scissor-type stand has two pairs of rocker arms arranged at a distance from one another in the transverse direction of the seat, each of which comprises two crossed rocker arms, and the rocker arms of the pair of rocker arms and the two pairs of rocker arms are supported so as to be swivelable around a common scissor axis extending in the transverse direction of the seat.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Arranging the damper in the middle between the pairs of rocker arms in transverse direction of the seat results in a substantially homogeneous loading. Other objects and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. It is to be understood, however, that the drawings are designed solely for purposes of illustration and not as a definition of the limits of the invention, for which reference should be made to the appended claims. It should be further understood that the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale and that, unless otherwise indicated, they are merely intended to conceptually illustrate the structures and procedures described herein.</p>
