<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of provisional application Ser. No. 61/255,926, filed on Oct. 29, 2009, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a denture care composition comprising one or more denture care actives and one or more water insoluble carriers, wherein the composition is not a denture adhesive.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the United States, there are approximately 50 million people who wear dentures. These people have a higher-than-normal need to take care of their breath and to protect any remaining natural teeth. It is known that denture care products can deliver various denture care actives to the surface of the artificial teeth, thus providing both therapeutic and cosmetic benefits to consumers. For example, effervescent denture cleansing tablets, which require soaking the artificial teeth for a period of time, work to remove plaque and debris that have built up on the denture or plate. But such denture care products typically do not maintain the denture care actives in the oral cavity long enough to optimally enhance or prolong the therapeutic, prophylactic and/or cosmetic benefits provided by the actives, or they do not maintain a high concentration of the active against the denture surface.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 6,500,406, issued Dec. 31, 2002 to Rajaiah, et al., the substance of which is incorporated herein by reference, discloses a denture care composition that provides prolonged release of denture care actives. The Rajaiah patent discloses use of polybutene, which, while extremely substantive, can also be difficult to process, difficult and messy for consumers to handle, and expensive. Therefore, there remains a continuing need for easy-to-produce and easy-to-handle denture care compositions that can cheaply deliver denture care actives, such as breath-freshening ingredients or antimicrobials, over prolonged periods of time.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention relates to a denture care composition comprising one or more denture care actives and one or more water insoluble carriers, wherein the composition is bioerodible, not a denture adhesive, and substantially free of polybutene with a molecular weight of about 300 to about 3000 when the composition is not an article, and is applied to dentures.</p>

<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Definitions</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The term &#x201c;dentures&#x201d; as used herein, is meant to include dentures, dental plates, bridges, artificial teeth and other surfaces of dental appliances that are temporarily fixed within the oral cavity and that are typically removed from the oral cavity for cleaning.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The abbreviation &#x201c;cm&#x201d; as used herein, means centimeter. The abbreviation &#x201c;mm&#x201d; as used herein, means millimeter. The abbreviation &#x201c;g&#x201d; as used herein, means gram. The abbreviation &#x201c;P&#x201d; as used herein, Pascal. The abbreviation &#x201c;s&#x201d; as used herein means second. The abbreviation &#x201c;Ps&#x201d; as used herein means Pascal-second. The abbreviation &#x201c;oz&#x201d; as used herein, means ounce.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The term &#x201c;bioerodible&#x201d; as used herein means that the composition, when exposed to excess of water or saliva, will erode over time due to physical and/or chemical action. The time necessary to erode the composition can be any length of time from instantaneous to five days, in one embodiment the time to erode is from about 1 to about 3 days. The composition may erode completely or substantially; however, ultimately the composition will lose its original form and/or integrity. For example, in one embodiment, after application and use for at least about 24 hours in the oral cavity, the composition will not have sufficient product integrity to easily separate or peel, in its original form, from the denture or oral surface. In another embodiment, the composition bioerodes such that no portion of the composition remains on the denture or mouth after the composition has been used in the oral cavity for about 24 hours. In another embodiment some portion or residue from the composition remains on the denture or oral surface after removing the denture from the oral cavity; however, this portion or residue from the composition can be cleaned by brushing away with a toothbrush, but not easily separated from the denture.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The term &#x201c;denture adhesive&#x201d; as used herein, refers to compositions that improve denture retention and comfort. Denture retention may be measured by the maximum incisal bite force recorded about 8 hours after application of the composition onto the denture. Procedures to measure maximum incisal bite force are described in the publication &#x201c;Effect of denture adhesive on the retention and stability of maxillary dentures&#x201d; by Joseph E. Grasso et al. in The Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry October 1994 pages 399-405. This publication also states, &#x201c;The use of an adhesive enabled patients to generate significantly greater levels of incisal bite force 8 hours after application. These increases were on the order of 20 Newtons from approximately 35 N at baseline to a maximum of 54 N at 8 hours after application.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The term &#x201c;safe and effective amount&#x201d; as used herein, means an amount of an agent (e.g., anti-calculus agent) high enough to significantly improve the condition to be treated, but low enough to avoid serious side effects (at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio), within the scope of sound medical/dental judgment. The safe and effective amount of an agent (e.g., anti-calculus agent) may vary with the particular condition being treated, the age and physical condition of the patient being treated, the severity of the condition, the duration of treatment, the nature of concurrent therapy, the specific form of the source employed, and the particular vehicle from which the agent is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The term &#x201c;article&#x201d; as used herein, refers to articles designed to fit, conform and adhere to contoured surfaces, such as a denture. The articles herein are substantially solid prior to use and can be picked up manually in substantially one piece and positioned on the denture.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The term &#x201c;flexible&#x201d; or &#x201c;flexible article&#x201d; as used herein means that a 0.67 mm thick piece of the article may be wrapped 180 degrees around a solid cylinder of 1 cm diameter without cracking upon visual observation.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The term &#x201c;toxicologically-acceptable&#x201d; as used herein, is used to describe materials that are suitable in their toxicity profile for administration to humans and/or animals.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The term &#x201c;non-aqueous&#x201d; as used herein, means that the composition does not contain added water but may contain water that is included in another component as supplied commercially by the manufacturer.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The term &#x201c;water insoluble&#x201d; as used herein refers to a material that, when exposed to an excess of water, does not dissolve, but may disperse to varying degrees. In some embodiments the term &#x201c;water insoluble&#x201d; refers to a material that is less than about 10%, 5%, 2%, or 1% soluble in water.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The term &#x201c;viscosity index improver&#x201d; as used herein refers to a material which makes the viscosity and/or rheology of a material into which it is incorporated more stable as its temperature is increased over a defined range. In the case of denture care products, the defined range is between about 25&#xb0; C. and about 60&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Unless otherwise noted, the term &#x201c;melting point&#x201d; as used herein refers to the Drop Melting Point which is the temperature at which the material becomes sufficiently fluid to drop from the thermometer used in making the determination under prescribed conditions as listed in ASTM D-127. ASTM D-3954 is an alternate way to measure melting point.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Unless otherwise noted, the term &#x201c;derivative&#x201d; as used herein refers to when the primary polymeric backbone is left unchanged, but the side groups/chains and/or end groups are changed.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As used herein, the term &#x201c;silicone&#x201d; refers to siloxane polymers based on a structure of alternate silicon and oxygen atoms with various organic radicals attached to the silicon.</p>

<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Denture Care Composition</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The present invention is a composition that is able to deliver one or more denture care actives over prolonged periods of time to denture wearers when used on the denture in the oral cavity, or to the denture when used outside of the oral cavity. Denture wearers in general can have a higher perceived need for breath freshening, leading to a heightened need for long-acting denture care actives, such as breath fresheners. Partial denture wearers can also have an increased risk of losing adjacent natural teeth and thus have an additional reason to receive long-acting denture care actives, such as antimicrobials. So while these vulnerabilities can put denture wearers at a disadvantage versus dentate people, denture wearers do have at least one advantage in that their dentures provide a built-in platform onto which various actives may be deposited and subsequently released over several hours.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Without being bound by theory, the present invention keys on the insight that denture surfaces are fairly hydrophobic compared to the mucosal surfaces of the mouth. As such, water insoluble materials such as petrolatum, waxes, oils, etc., can adhere well to the denture and resist being eroded in the saliva. Furthermore, if the water insoluble material comprises actives, such as breath-freshening ingredients, coolants, or antimicrobials, these agents can release slowly over time into the mouth, for much longer times than achievable through water soluble products such as mouth rinses and dentifrices.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">To be clear, the present invention is a denture care composition that is not a denture adhesive composition. It is not designed to and does not significantly improve denture retention and comfort in the oral cavity. The surprising discovery of the present invention is that certain water insoluble materials, some even that are typically used as components in traditional denture adhesive compositions, when used even without the mucoadhesive component of denture adhesive compositions, become a different type of composition, a composition that sticks and stays on surfaces that are not wet mucosal surfaces. For example, unlike a denture adhesive, these compositions stick to the denture, but not at all (or minimally) to the wet mucosal tissue. That is, rather than being a composition for adhering one thing to another (a denture to the oral cavity), the composition is cohesive, sustaining itself for extended periods of time.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, the present invention is substantially free of or does not comprise an effective amount of a component or components that would significantly improve the retention of the denture in the oral cavity. In some embodiments, the composition is substantially free of mucoadhesive components, that is, substantially free of any component or components that would adhere to wet mucosal surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Based on the insight discussed above, another surprising and unexpected result discovered by the inventors of the present invention is that extreme substantivity, such as that of a polybutene, is not necessary to achieve long-lasting delivery of denture care actives. Therefore, compositions of the present invention are substantially free of polybutene with a molecular weight of about 300 to about 3000 when the composition is not an article. It is now discovered that many water insoluble materials, such as petrolatum and waxes, even when used without traditional mucoadhesive materials, provide sufficient substantivity to dentures, that is, they will remain cohesive and stick to the dentures for a long enough time to allow better and more effective delivery of denture care actives.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">So while the composition does not significantly improve retention by adhering the denture in or to the oral cavity, the composition itself adheres to the surfaces of the denture for extensive periods of time. While adhering to the surfaces of the denture, the present compositions can release the denture care actives. In some embodiments, the composition will remain in the oral cavity and deliver denture care actives from application to about 1 hour, from application to about 2 hours, from application to about 3 hours, from application to about 4 hours, from application to about 6 hours, from application to about 8 hours, or from application to more than about 8 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The present invention can be a cream, paste, gel, liquid, strip, wafer, article, or any other suitable form.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Denture Care Actives</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The denture care compositions of the present invention may contain a denture care active where, upon directed use, the benefit sought by the wearer is promoted without detriment to the oral cavity or denture. Examples of the dental conditions these actives address include, but are not limited to, appearance and structural changes to teeth, treatment and prevention of plaque, calculus, cavities in remaining natural teeth, inflamed and/or bleeding gums, gingivitis, fungal infections such as candida, mucosal wounds, lesions, ulcers, aphthous ulcers, cold sores, tooth abscesses, and the elimination of mouth malodor resulting from the conditions above and other causes such as microbial proliferation.</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Fluoride ion sources are known for use in denture care compositions as anti-caries agents for remaining natural teeth and may optionally be incorporated within the present invention. Application of fluoride ions to the dental enamel of natural teeth serves to protect those teeth against decay. A wide variety of fluoride ion-yielding materials can be employed as sources of soluble fluoride in the instant compositions. Examples of suitable fluoride ion-yielding materials are found in Briner, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,535,421 and Widder, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,678,154.

The coolant can be any of a wide variety of materials. Included among such materials are carboxamides, menthol, ketals, diols, and mixtures thereof. Preferred coolants in the present compositions are the paramenthan carboxyamide agents such as N-ethyl-p-menthan-3-carboxamide, known commercially as &#x201c;WS-3&#x201d;, N,2,3-trimethyl-2-isopropylbutanamide, known as &#x201c;WS-23,&#x201d; and mixtures thereof. Additional preferred coolants are selected from the group consisting of menthol, 3-1-menthoxypropane-1,2-diol known as TK-10, manufactured by Takasago, menthone glycerol acetal known as MGA manufactured by Haarmann and Reimer, and menthyl lactate known as Frescolat&#xae; manufactured by Haarmann and Reimer. The terms menthol and menthyl as used herein include dextro- and levorotatory isomers of these compounds and racemic mixtures thereof. TK-10 is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,459,425, Amano et al. WS-3 and other agents are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,136,163, Watson, et al. The disclosures of both are herein incorporated by reference. Another preferred coolant is the G-180 coolant, which is chemically N-(4-cyanomethylphenyl)-&#x3c1;-menthanecarboxamide, supplied by Givaudan as a 7.5% solution in flavor oil such as spearmint or peppermint. Addition of calcium ions may elevate the cooling effect of a 75 ppm G-180 formula to that of a 150 ppm G-180 formula, which would enable formulating products with lower levels of coolant. These agents may be present at a level of from about 0% to about 40%, in another embodiment from about 0.05 to about 5%, and in another embodiment from about 0.1 to about 2%, by weight of the composition.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Pigments may be added to the compositions herein to more precisely indicate the locations at which the composition has actually been in contact. Additionally, these substances may be suitable for modifying the color of the denture to satisfy the consumer. These substances comprise particles that when applied on the tooth surface modify that surface in terms of absorption and/or reflection of light. Such particles provide an appearance benefit when a film containing such particles is applied over the surfaces of the denture. Pigments, dyes, colorants, and lakes may also be added to modify the appearance of the compositions herein to render the product more acceptable to the consumer. Appropriate pigment levels are selected for the particular impact that is desirable to the consumer. For example, for dentures that are particularly dark or stained one would typically use pigments in sufficient amounts to lighten the teeth. On the other hand, where individual teeth or spots on the teeth are lighter than other teeth, pigments to darken the denture may be useful. In one embodiment, the levels of pigments and colorants may be in the range of about 0.001% to about 20%, in one embodiment from about 0.01% to about 15%, and in another embodiment from about 0.1% to about 10%, by total weight of the composition. In one embodiment the pigments and colorants are those selected from the group consisting of titanium dioxide, bismuth oxychloride, zinc oxide, Opatint D&#x26;C Red 27, CI 16185:1 Acid 27 Lake E123, CI 14720:1 Carmosoisine Aluminum Lake E122, Red 7 Lake, Red 30 Lake, and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The present invention may further comprise a viscosity modifier that inhibits settling and separation of components or controls settling in a manner that facilitates re-dispersion and may control flow properties. Suitable viscosity modifiers herein include mineral oil, organo-modified clays, petrolatum, silicas, and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment the viscosity modifier is silica. Where incorporated, the viscosity modifier can be present in the composition of the present invention at a level of from about 0.001% to about 99%, in one embodiment from about 0.01% to about 50%, and in another embodiment from about 0.1% to about 25% of the composition.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Additional denture care actives suitable for use in the present invention may include, but are not limited to, insulin, steroids, herbal and other plant derived remedies, and anti-neoplastics. Additionally, anti-gingivitis or gum care agents known in the art may also be included. Components, other than polybutene, which impart a clean feel to the teeth may optionally be included. These components may include, for example, baking soda or Glass-H. Also, it is recognized that in certain forms of therapy, combinations of these above-named agents may be useful in order to obtain an optimal effect. Thus, for example, an anti-microbial and an anti-inflammatory agent may be combined in a single chewing gum or confection piece to provide combined effectiveness.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In some embodiments, the water insoluble carrier itself may be the denture care active. In some embodiments, the water insoluble carrier may be the only denture care active, and in other embodiments, it may be combined with one or more other denture care actives.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Water Insoluble Carriers and Viscosity Index Improvers</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The present composition comprises a water insoluble carrier. The water insoluble carrier offers the benefit of adhering well to the denture and not easily eroded, allowing extended time for it to deliver actives to the oral cavity. It has now further been discovered that a viscosity index improver can increase the beneficial effects of the water insoluble component and has additional benefits standing on its own. Historically, viscosity index improver was a term associated with the lubricant industry. The viscosity of a lubricant is closely related to its ability to reduce friction. The most desirable lubricant is one which will allow the easiest movement of two surfaces while still forcing the two moving surfaces apart, because this results in the lowest friction. However, as the viscosity of liquids tends to decrease as the temperature increases, many lubricants which work at lower temperatures are not thick enough to work at higher temperatures and those that are thick enough at the higher temperatures have a tendency to be too thick to work at the lower temperatures. The best lubricants will not vary much in viscosity over a desired temperature range and therefore will perform well throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In order to better predict the range of temperatures at which a lubricant would work, the Society of Automotive Engineers established the Viscosity Index. The Viscosity Index highlights how a lubricant's viscosity changes with variations in temperature. The Viscosity Index shows the viscosity of materials at an arbitrary &#x201c;low&#x201d; temperature of 100&#xb0; Fahrenheit (40&#xb0; C.) and an arbitrary &#x201c;high&#x201d; temperature of 210&#xb0; F. (100&#xb0; C.).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">After understanding the properties of lubricants over the set temperature ranges, it was discovered that adding certain types of compounds to the lubricants would make the viscosity of the lubricants more consistent through a broader temperature range. Thus, there was less of a decrease in the viscosity of the lubricant at the higher temperatures. Having a higher viscosity at the higher temperature allowed the lubricants to work better at the higher temperatures. The materials added to increase the viscosity at higher temperatures were defined as viscosity index improvers.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">It has surprisingly been discovered that application of that principal also has relevance to denture care compositions. In general, denture care compositions can be made up of a myriad of materials based on the end use. For those which are intended to deliver an active to the oral cavity, they comprise a water insoluble carrier and a denture care active. During use, these compositions can get eroded and lose efficacy. The viscosity of the water insoluble carrier contributes to the speed at which the composition is eroded. Temperature-resistance of the viscosity imparted by the viscosity index improver results in resistance to erosion, which in turn results in the composition and actives being retained over time. This leads to extended and improved performance of the denture care compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The temperature range most relevant for denture care compositions is from room temperature (25&#xb0; C.) which deals with the viscosity of the denture care composition in the dispenser (tube or package, for example) to 40&#xb0; C. which deals with the viscosity of the denture care composition in the mouth. While the temperatures in the mouth can reach upward of 60&#xb0; C. when drinking a hot beverage, looking at the behavior of the compositions at 40&#xb0; C. tends to be a good predictor of having increased beneficial properties at 60&#xb0; C. as well. Thus, viscosity index improvers relevant for denture care compositions will make the viscosity more stable over the range of functional temperatures (i.e. 25&#xb0; C. to 60&#xb0; C.).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Thus, the use of viscosity index improvers alone or in combination with a water insoluble component will improve the erosion characteristics of this denture care composition and/or compatibility with denture care actives and thus provide an improved performance. Viscosity index improvers make the viscosity of the denture care composition more stable over the range of functional temperatures (i.e. about 25&#xb0; C. to about 60&#xb0; C.).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Aside from understanding the general principal of viscosity index improvers, another way to determine whether a material would work as a viscosity index improver in a denture care composition is to look at the instant viscosity ratio. The instant viscosity ratio measures the ratio of the viscosities of the prototype sample at room temperature (25&#xb0; C.) and at an elevated temperature (40&#xb0; C.). Compositions with a viscosity index improver tend to maintain their viscosity better at elevated temperatures than those compositions without a viscosity index improver. This is important because the denture care composition is placed into the mouth of a user which has a temperature generally higher than that of room temperature. Additionally, the temperature of a user's mouth can also be increased when ingesting hot beverages. The ability to maintain a higher viscosity at these higher temperatures contributes to less loss of the denture care composition during use.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The instant viscosity ratio can be measured as outlined below. In one embodiment, the instant viscosity ratio is greater than about 0.03. In another embodiment, the instant viscosity ratio is from about 0.03 to about 1.0. In additional embodiments, the instant viscosity ratio is from about 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.40 to about 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.40, 0.80, 1.00, or any combination thereof. In a further embodiment, the instant viscosity ratio is from about 0.03 to about 0.40. In other embodiments, the instant viscosity ratio is from about 0.04 to about 0.30 or from about 0.05 to about 0.20.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The following describes two samples, a reference sample (RS) and a prototype sample (PS). The reference sample is considered the standard and is made using the standard water insoluble components, which would not include a viscosity index improver, while the prototype sample is made using a viscosity index improver. A general formula is given for a RS and a PS, then formulas of a specific RS and a specific PS are given, along with their instant viscosity ratios for comparison.</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0084">The Reference Sample is prepared using the following procedure:</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0085">Melt the petrolatum in an oven. Melt and make a premix of the flavors in a separate container. Add the flavor premix to the molten petrolatum. Thoroughly mix using a speed-mixer. Fill the sample into a suitable container, such as a foil tube. Allow samples to equilibrate for at least one day at room temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0086">The Prototype sample is prepared using the following procedure:</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0087">Melt and mix the petrolatum and prototype viscosity index improver in an oven. Melt and make a premix of the flavors in a separate container.

Allow samples to equilibrate for at least one day at room temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0088">Whenever possible, the RS and PS are made with the same manufacturing procedure and same optional ingredients. This is done to provide a standard matrix to test the differences between a variety of viscosity index improvers by keeping all other variables the same.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0089">If it is necessary to accommodate any property of the prototype viscosity index improver or viscosity index improver/water insoluble component combination that is not accommodated by the process detailed above, the processing temperature profile can be modified as needed. Additionally, if the above testing formulation gives a PS which is too thick to test for the instant viscosity ratio as described below, then the sample may need to be diluted with additional water insoluble component like mineral oil.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0090">The above process tests for viscosity index improvers at a level of about 10%. It is believed that testing the prototype viscosity index improvers at 10% will help set-up a baseline, meaning that a finding of viscosity index improver properties at a level of 10% is indicative of viscosity index improver properties at high levels. That being said, a prototype viscosity index improver which is tested at 10% and is found not to have viscosity index improver properties at that level may have them at a higher percentage and should be tested at a higher level to confirm.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0091">The above process can also be scaled up and used for general manufacturing at the temperature appropriate for the viscosity index improver and/or water insoluble component of the denture adhesive article.</p>

<p id="p-0092" num="0094">The instant viscosity of the PS at 25&#xb0; C. is 207 Ps and at 40&#xb0; C. is 20 Ps. This gives an instant viscosity ratio for the PS of 0.10. In contrast to this, the RS has an instant viscosity at 25&#xb0; C. of 98 Ps and at 40&#xb0; C. of 2.0 Ps. This gives an instant viscosity ratio for RS of 0.02. The higher instant viscosity ratio of PS shows that it is more temperature resistant than the reference water insoluble component and thus, microcrystalline wax will work as a viscosity index improver in that denture care composition.</p>

<p id="p-0109" num="0111">The denture care compositions of the present invention may also optionally comprise a safe and effective amount of one or more toxicologically-acceptable plasticizers. In one embodiment, the level of the plasticizing agent ranges from about 0.0% to about 40%, in one embodiment from about 0.01% to about 40%, in another embodiment from about 1% to about 10%, in another embodiment from about 2% to about 5%, by weight of the composition. In yet another embodiment the denture care composition does not comprise a plasticizer. In another embodiment the plasticizer is water insoluble.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0112">In one embodiment, the denture care composition, when extruded thermoplastically, does not cure and set as a result of the action of the plasticizer component. In another embodiment the plasticizer component does not solidify the water insoluble component or the denture care composition. In another embodiment the water insoluble thermoplastic component does not cure and set.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0113">Alternatively, in one embodiment the denture care composition may be substantially free of plasticizers. In one embodiment the denture care composition may be substantially free of polyethylmethacrylate, triacetin, phthalic acid derivative, glycerol triacetate, citric acid derivative, phosphoric acid derivative, glycol, glycol derivative, paraffin wax, a pentaerythritol ester of a fatty acid, stearic acid derivative, glycerol monostearate, polyethylene glycol, butyl phthalyl butyl glycolate, butyl phthalyl butyl glycolate, dimethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, triacetin, triethyl citrate, acetyl triethyl citrate, acetyl tributyl citrate, triphenyl phosphate, diethylene glycol, caprylic triglyceride, capric triglyceride, propylene glycol dicaprylate/caprate and/or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Substantivity Agent</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0114">In addition to those components listed above, the denture care composition may additionally include other components. One example of these additional components includes substantivity agents. One group of substantivity agents is organophosphates. Suitable organophosphate compounds have a strong affinity for the tooth surface and have sufficient surface binding propensity to desorb pellicle proteins and remain affixed thereon. The phosphate groups of the organophosphate attach themselves to cations, in particular calcium ions in teeth or some other positively charged sites such as protein residues on the mucosal surface and thus serve to anchor the hydrophobic portion of the molecule onto the surface thereby modifying it to be hydrophobic. The phosphate groups provide ready bonding/binding to cationic and charged surfaces via electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bonding, or complexation, which leads to ready deposition of the organophosphate upon application to form a coating on the treated surface. The strong bond results in longer retention or durability and substantivity of the coating.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0115">Examples of suitable organophosphate compounds are mono-, di- or triesters represented by the following general structure wherein Z<sup>1</sup>, Z<sup>2</sup>, or Z<sup>3 </sup>may be identical or different, at least one being an organic moiety, preferably selected from linear or branched, alkyl or alkenyl group of from 6 to 22 carbon atoms, optionally substituted by one or more phosphate groups; alkoxylated alkyl group or alkoxylated alkenyl group.</p>

<br/>
wherein R<sup>1 </sup>represents a linear or branched, alkyl or alkenyl group of from 6 to 22 carbon atoms, optionally substituted by one or more phosphate groups; n and m, are individually and separately, 2 to 4, and a and b, individually and separately, are 0 to 20; Z<sup>2 </sup>and Z<sup>3 </sup>may be identical or different, each represents hydrogen, alkali metal, ammonium, protonated alkyl amine or protonated functional alkyl amine such as an alkanolamine, or a R<sup>1</sup>&#x2014;(OC<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>)<sub>a</sub>(OC<sub>m</sub>H<sub>2m</sub>)<sub>b</sub>&#x2014; group. Preferably, R<sup>1 </sup>is an alkyl group of at least 10 carbon atoms and a and b are each no more than 10 in order to maintain overall hydrophobic character of the organophosphate and the degree of hydrophobicity imparted to the surface.
</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0118">In one embodiment, the substantivity agent includes mono- di- and tri-alkyl and alkyl (poly)alkoxy phosphates such as dodecyl phosphate, lauryl phosphate; laureth-1 phosphate; laureth-3 phosphate; laureth-9 phosphate; dilaureth-10 phosphate; trilaureth-4 phosphate; C<sub>12-18 </sub>PEG-9 phosphate and salts thereof. Many are commercially available from suppliers including Croda; Rhodia; Nikkol Chemical; Sunjin; Alzo; Huntsman Chemical; Clariant and Cognis. In one embodiment, the substantivity agent comprises monoalkyl phosphate.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">Active</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0119">Another example of an additional component includes actives. Some examples of actives include various fluoride salts for caries prevention and remineralization; gingivitis prevention by the use of antimicrobial agents such as triclosan, cetylpyridinium chloride, stannous fluoride, zinc citrate or essential oils; and hypersensitivity control through the use of ingredients such as strontium chloride, stannous fluoride, or potassium nitrate; pyrophosphate salts can be used as antitartar agents; peroxides can be used for bleaching and antiseptics; and polymeric mineral surface active agents such as phosphorylated polymers, in particular polyphosphates that bind to teeth, or metal ions such as stannous, zinc or copper that form insoluble compounds that deposit onto teeth, can be used for erosion protection or sensitivity protection. These actives can be used alone or in combination.</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">Adhesive Component</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0120">Another example of an additional component includes adhesive components. The present invention may optionally further comprise a safe and effective amount of an adhesive component, generally at a low level just enough to help the composition to adhere to the wet mucosal tissue, but not enough to significantly improve the retention of the denture.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0121">In general, adhesive components are hydrophilic particles that become sticky when activated by moisture or are hydrophilic liquids. In varying embodiments, the adhesive components herein are mucoadhesive, adhesive to the teeth, hydrophilic, water soluble, have the property of swelling upon exposure to moisture, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0122">In one embodiment, the adhesive component is selected from the group consisting of: cellulose, cellulose derivatives (such as methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxy-propylmethylcellulose, corn starch, and mixtures thereof), starch, starch derivatives, saccharide, saccharide derivatives, polyethylene oxides, polyethylene glycols, polyvinyl alcohols, carrageenan, alginates, karaya gums, xanthan gums, guar gums, gelatins, algins, tragacanth, chitosan, acrylamide polymers, carboxypolymethylenes, polyamines, poly quaternary compounds, polyvinylpyrrolidone, AVE/MA, salts of AVE/MA, mixed salts of AVE/MA, polymeric acids, polymeric salts, polyhydroxy compounds, and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">Gellant Agents</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0123">The compositions of the present invention may also optionally comprise a safe and effective amount of one or more toxicologically-acceptable gellants. In one embodiment, the level of the gellant agent ranges from about 0.01% to about 40%, in another embodiment from about 1% to about 10%, in another embodiment from about 2% to about 5%, by weight of the composition.</p>
<p id="h-0021" num="0000">Other Optional Ingredients</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0124">Other suitable ingredients include colorants, preservatives (such as methyl and propyl parabens), thickeners such as silicon dioxide, and polyethylene glycol. Colorants, preservatives, thickeners may be present at levels of from about 0% to about 20%, by weight of the composition, in another embodiment from about 0.1% to about 10%, by weight.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0125">Additionally, the compositions may also comprise one or more solvents. These optional solvents may be miscible with the water insoluble component and/or be capable of being dissipated in-situ. In one embodiment, these solvents may be dissipated in-situ by evaporation, dissolution, dispersion, bio-absorption, or any other suitable means. In another embodiment these solvents may be dissipated in-situ to leave behind a denture care composition. Such solvents may include materials with a viscosity ranging from 0.01, 0.1, 1, 5 centipoise at 20&#xb0; C., to 5, 10, 100, 1000 centipoise at 20&#xb0; C., in any combination of these levels. In one embodiment, these solvents may be silicones, hydrocarbons, iso-dodecane, iso-hexadecane, iso-eicosane, and/or polyisobutene. Suitable grades of solvents include the Permethyl series (sold by Prespers Inc., New Jersey) such as Permethyl 97A, 99A, 101A, 102A, and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="h-0022" num="0000">Method of Preparation</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0126">The denture care composition is suitably made as follows: Combine the water insoluble carrier and any denture care active ingredients into a mixing vessel and mix well with any means known within the art, for example, with a spatula or mixer. Heat the composition, if needed, to facilitate mixing. Continue mixing the composition until homogenous. Where a denture care active is included in solid particulate form, the addition of a viscosity modifier, such as silica, may be appropriate to keep the particulate dispersed and suspended within the composition.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0127">If the composition to be made is an article, the following processes can be used. The articles utilized in accordance with the invention are formed by processes conventional in the arts, e.g. the film-making industries such as casting, coating, calendaring, extrusion. In one embodiment, the separate components of the article are melted and then blended in a mixing tank until a homogeneous mixture is achieved. Thereafter, the melted mixture may be cast to an acceptable thickness, on an appropriate substrate. Examples of such substrates include Mylar, continuous moving stainless steel belt (which may eventually enter a dryer section if needed), release paper, and the like. The articles are then cooled. The articles may then be dried if needed, e.g. in a forced-air oven. The article may then be cut into desired shapes with desired dimensions and then stacked and/or subsequently packaged.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0128">In one embodiment, after processing, the article is then die-cut into desired shapes. These shapes may facilitate application of the article to the dentures.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0129">Another conventional film-making process known in the art is extrusion. This method is possible with films wherein the film-forming ingredient comprises a variety of extrudable materials. The mechanical particulars of the extrusion process, e.g. the particular equipment utilized, the extruding force, the shape and temperature of the orifice and/or dies are considered to be within the skill of the art and can be varied in a known manner to achieve the physical characteristics of the articles described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0130">In one embodiment, the thickness of the denture care composition that is an article is generally from about 0.1 mm to about 2.5 mm, in another embodiment from about 0.4 mm to about 1.5 mm, in another embodiment from about 0.5 mm to about 1 mm. The article may be thicker or thinner depending on the degree of cushioning desired by the user or wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0131">In one embodiment, the denture care composition that is an article may optionally be multiphase or have visually distinct phases. In another embodiment the articles herein may optionally have a release liner.</p>
<p id="h-0023" num="0000">Method of Use</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0132">In using the present denture care composition, the user removes the denture from the oral cavity and applies the denture care composition disclosed herein directly to the surface of the denture. The composition may be applied using a brush, pen applicator, dropper, doe's foot applicator or other application device. The composition may also be applied by manually placing it on the denture, by finger, cotton swab, or dental stick or the like or by dipping the denture into the denture care composition. In some embodiments, after the denture care composition is applied to the surface of a denture, the denture may then be applied to the oral cavity. In some embodiments, the denture care active may be a denture cleanser, in which case, after the denture care composition is applied to the surface of the denture, the denture may be immersed in water.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0133">It is not necessary to prepare the denture before applying the composition of the present invention. For example, the user may or may not choose to brush or cleanse the denture before applying the composition. The surfaces of the denture are neither required to be dried nor to be excessively wet with saliva or water prior to application. However, it is believed that adhesion to the denture surfaces will be improved if the surfaces are drier when the composition is applied.</p>

<p id="p-0154" num="0185">To make the above examples L, M, and N, the petrolatum is heated to about 70&#xb0; C. and the other components are mixed in at the elevated temperature. For all examples, the compositions are allowed to come to room temperature prior to use. After the samples are made, they are placed into a container. The consumer preference for taste is tested by allowing a consumer to dip a disposable lip gloss applicator into the container and tasting the sample. The consumer then picks the sample they prefer. The consumer also rates each sample on a scale of &#x2212;4 to +4 (with &#x2212;4 being &#x201c;Dislike Extremely&#x201d; and +4 being &#x201c;Like Extremely&#x201d;). Each of Samples M and N are directly compared with Sample L, so each consumer tests Sample L versus Sample M, then Sample L versus Sample N.

For all examples, the compositions are allowed to come to room temperature prior to use. After the samples are made, they are placed into a container. The consumer preference for taste is tested by allowing a consumer to dip a disposable lip gloss applicator into the container and tasting the sample. The consumer then picks the sample they prefer. The consumer also rates each sample on a scale of &#x2212;4 to +4 (with &#x2212;4 being &#x201c;Dislike Extremely&#x201d; and +4 being &#x201c;Like Extremely&#x201d;).
