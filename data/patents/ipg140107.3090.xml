<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates to an anti-collision device for a plasma vertical cutting gun and the anti-collision device is a supporting device of a numerical control (NC) plasma cutting machine.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Plasma cutting technique is a technology using high-speed ejected ionized gas blown out of a compressed gas outlet to realize a cutting effect. The principle is that the ionized gas having high-speed, high temperature, high ionizability, and high energy is ejected from the compressed gas outlet to heat the parts to be cut and melt the metal, then the high-speed and high-pressure ionized gas flow mechanically blows the molten metal open, and finally a cutting slot is formed with the moving of the cutting torch.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A plasma cutting machine is composed of five parts, namely, a power supply, a control system, water cooling system, a gas device, and a cutting structure. As an indispensable and important part of the cutting structure of the plasma cutting machine, the design and manufacturing process of a cutting gun's anti-collision device plays a very important role to achieve an excellent safety protection. Especially in the practice, to guarantee a good processing quality and safety protection level, it is required to ensure both excellent stability and protection ability in case of accidents when the cutting torch moves.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Conventional anti-collision devices of cutting guns adopt a rigid connection style, which has a bigger impact on the cutting guns and the protection is insufficient; the response lags when a problem occurs, thus failing to meet the operating requirement.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of the above-described problems, it is one objective of the invention to provide a full-featured and reasonably-structured anti-collision device for a plasma vertical cutting gun to eliminate shortcomings of conventional anti-collision devices and make them to be more flexible, stable, and have excellent safety protection.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To achieve the above objective, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention, there is provided an anti-collision device for a plasma vertical cutting gun comprising:

<p id="p-0025" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, an anti-collision device for a plasma vertical cutting gun comprises a lifting frame of a plasma cutting machine <b>5</b>, a fixing plate of a cutting gun <b>1</b>, a proximity switch <b>4</b>, a connection mechanism <b>3</b> mounted between the lifting frame of the plasma cutting machine <b>5</b> and the fixing plate of the cutting gun <b>1</b>. The fixing plate of the cutting gun <b>1</b> is fixed on the connection mechanism <b>3</b>. The connection mechanism <b>3</b> comprises an isosceles-triangle cushion block <b>3</b><i>a </i>connected with the cutting gun fixing panel <b>1</b>. The upper and lower portions of the isosceles-triangle cushion block <b>3</b><i>a </i>are respectively arranged with a locating pin <b>3</b><i>b</i>. The proximity switch <b>4</b> is mounted on a concave support plate <b>2</b> connecting with the lifting frame of the plasma cutting machine <b>5</b>. A detection head of the proximity switch <b>4</b> aligns with the apical angle of the isosceles-triangle cushion block <b>3</b><i>a</i>. The connection part of the connection mechanism <b>3</b> matches a trapezoid groove <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the concave support plate <b>2</b>, i.e. the apical angle of the isosceles-triangle cushion block <b>3</b><i>a </i>is the same as the inclined angle of the trapezoid groove <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the concave support plate <b>2</b>. One side of a joint plane between the connection mechanism <b>3</b> and the trapezoid groove <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the concave support plate <b>2</b> is of ferromagnetic materials and the other side is provided with a magnet, thereby attracting each other to realize a magnetic connection. The detection range of the proximity switch <b>4</b> is within 3 mm and the proximity switch <b>4</b> will act when the distance between the proximity switch <b>4</b> and the apical angle of the isosceles-triangle ferromagnetic cushion block <b>3</b><i>a </i>is greater than 3 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref>, the isosceles-triangle cushion block <b>3</b><i>a </i>is of ferromagnetic materials. The two magnets <b>2</b><i>d </i>and <b>2</b><i>e </i>are symmetrically fixed to the vertical central parts of two inclined planes of the trapezoid groove <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the concave support plate <b>2</b>, which is of non-ferromagnetic material such as aluminum. The upper and lower portions of the trapezoid groove <b>2</b> corresponding to two waists of the isosceles-triangle cushion block <b>3</b><i>a </i>are respectively arranged with a nonmagnetic stable block <b>2</b><i>b </i>with the same thickness as the magnets <b>2</b><i>d </i>and <b>2</b><i>e</i>, thereby leveling the trapezoid groove <b>2</b> of the concave support plate <b>2</b>. Because too many magnets will cause large magnetic force and natural shedding is hardly to be achieved after a cutting gun <b>6</b> is impacted, thus four nonmagnetic stable blocks <b>2</b><i>b </i>with the same thickness as the magnets <b>2</b><i>d </i>and <b>2</b><i>e </i>are mounted to both reduce the magnetic force and level up the installation plane of the isosceles-triangle cushion block <b>3</b><i>a</i>, thereby further stabilizing the isosceles-triangle cushion block <b>3</b><i>a</i>. The concave support plate <b>2</b> is of non-ferromagnetic materials such as an aluminum alloy.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0036">The upper and lower portions of the isosceles-triangle cushion block <b>3</b><i>a </i>are respectively arranged with the locating pin <b>3</b><i>b</i>, and the corresponding position of the concave support plate <b>2</b> is arranged with a matching locating hole <b>2</b><i>c </i>to keep the relative position unchanged after each installation.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-6</figref>, the connection mechanism <b>3</b> comprises an isosceles-triangle cushion block <b>3</b><i>a </i>connected with the fixing plate of the cutting gun <b>1</b>. The two magnets <b>2</b><i>d </i>and <b>2</b><i>e </i>are symmetrically fixed on the inclined plane of the isosceles-triangle cushion block <b>3</b><i>a</i>. The concave support plate <b>2</b> is ferromagnetic and arranged with a trapezoid groove <b>2</b><i>a</i>, whose inclined angle is the same as the apical angle of the isosceles-triangle cushion block <b>3</b><i>a</i>. The two magnets <b>2</b><i>d </i>and <b>2</b><i>e </i>on the isosceles-triangle cushion block <b>3</b><i>a </i>are attached to the trapezoid groove <b>2</b><i>a </i>to realize a magnetic connection between the concave support plate <b>2</b> and the connection mechanism <b>3</b>. The detection head of the proximity switch <b>4</b> aligns with the apical angle of the isosceles-triangle cushion block <b>3</b><i>a</i>, which is of non-ferromagnetic materials.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0038">The two magnets <b>2</b><i>d </i>and <b>2</b><i>e </i>on the isosceles-triangle cushion block <b>3</b><i>a </i>are symmetrically fixed to the vertical central parts of the two inclined planes of the isosceles-triangle cushion block <b>3</b><i>a</i>. The vertical upper and lower portions of the two inclined planes of the isosceles-triangle cushion block <b>3</b><i>a </i>are respectively arranged with a nonmagnetic stable block <b>2</b><i>b </i>with the same thickness as the magnets <b>2</b><i>d </i>and <b>2</b><i>e</i>, thereby leveling the upper and lower gaps between the isosceles-triangle cushion block <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the concave support plate <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0039">The upper and lower parts of the isosceles-triangle cushion block <b>3</b><i>a </i>are respectively arranged with a locating pin <b>3</b><i>b; </i>the corresponding position of the concave support plate <b>2</b> is arranged with a matching locating hole <b>2</b><i>c </i>to keep the relative position unchanged after each installation.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0040">In use, screws are employed to fix the concave support plate <b>2</b> on the lifting frame of the plasma cutting machine <b>5</b> and thereafter the connection mechanism <b>3</b> is installed. Two locating pins <b>3</b><i>d </i>on the isosceles-triangle cushion block <b>3</b><i>a </i>are aligned with the locating holes <b>2</b><i>c </i>in the concave support plate <b>2</b> so that the connection mechanism <b>3</b> is directly absorbed on the concave support plate <b>2</b>, thereby completing the installation of the anti-collision device. Finally, the cutting gun <b>6</b> is mounted in the hole of the fixing plate of the cutting gun <b>1</b> based on a suitable cutting height and distance.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0041">When the cutting gun <b>6</b> is impacted, both the fixing plate of the cutting gun <b>1</b> and the cutting gun <b>6</b>, together with the isosceles-triangle cushion block <b>3</b><i>a</i>, will detach from the concave support plate <b>2</b>, meanwhile the proximity switch <b>4</b> will acquire a faded signal within the detection distance and send it to a programmable logic controller (PLC), which will shut down the whole equipment immediately to avoid damage.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0042">In the process of plasma cutting, the plasma cutting gun <b>6</b> or other parts of the cutting machine may be damaged because of too large panel deformation or collision between a foreign body and the plasma cutting gun <b>6</b>. This invention has remedied the deficiency by freeing the cutting gun <b>6</b> from the cutting system and changing a rigid connection into a soft connection. When the cutting gun <b>6</b> is impacted, the proximity switch <b>4</b> will immediately acquire a faded signal within the detection distance to protect the cutting gun.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0043">The essence of this invention is that the concave support plate <b>2</b> and the isosceles-triangle cushion block <b>3</b><i>a </i>are connected by magnetic force produced by two circular magnets rather than screws. Consequently, all soft connections between the fixing plate of the cutting gun and the lifting frame of the plasma cutting machine are within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0044">While particular embodiments of the invention have been shown and described, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that changes and modifications may be made without departing from the invention in its broader aspects, and therefore, the aim in the appended claims is to cover all such changes and modifications as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
