<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure is directed generally to multi-gate semiconductor devices and more particularly to FinFETs and methods of forming the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Multi-gate semiconductor devices, such as FinFETs, are being considered for many logic and other applications in the semiconductor manufacturing industry and are integrated into various different types of semiconductor devices. In FinFETs, gates are typically formed over and along the sides of semiconductor fins and take advantage of the increased surface area of the channel and source/drain regions formed in the fins to produce faster, more reliable and better controlled semiconductor transistor devices.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Multi-gate semiconductor devices having multiple voltage threshold (VT) transistors are conventionally formed within a single semiconductor device. While fabricating multi-VT devices, transistors having higher voltage thresholds have shown degraded performance and mobility due to the higher dopant concentrations typically utilized in the channel regions of such devices.</p>

<p id="p-0017" num="0016">An improved multi-gate semiconductor device is described below, with improved device performance for single work function and dual work function multi-voltage threshold (VT) devices. The multi-gate semiconductor device fabrication processes described herein may be performed using any suitable commercially available equipment commonly used in the art to manufacture multi-gate semiconductor devices, or alternatively, using future developed equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Multi-voltage threshold (VT) devices have been observed to control channel-concentration to permit the incorporation of multi-VT devices at a single substrate. However, doping concentration in multi-voltage threshold (VT) devices directly affect a VT device's mobility and performance. The inventors have observed that, for a multi-VT device, optimization of work function metal is an effective mechanism to improve metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) transistor performance especially in VT devices with higher voltage thresholds and that also minimizes the cost and impact on subsequent processing steps.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an isometric view schematic of the formation of a multigate device structure is illustrated showing different cross-section directions for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the multigate device structure includes a semiconductor substrate <b>102</b>, which may be part of an integrated circuit (IC) die, either singulated, or as a part of a wafer <b>100</b>. Semiconductor substrate <b>102</b> may be a bulk silicon substrate, a bulk silicon germanium (SiGe) substrate, a Group III-V compound substrate, or a substrate formed of other suitable materials. Substrate <b>102</b> may be doped with a p-type or an n-type impurity. Isolation regions, such as shallow trench isolation (STI) regions (not shown) may be formed in or over substrate <b>102</b>. Semiconductor fins <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>104</b>-<b>2</b> are formed extending above the substrate <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, fins <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>104</b>-<b>2</b> are formed above a top surface of the STI regions (not shown). Substrate <b>102</b> includes a portion formed in NMOS region <b>10</b> and a portion formed in PMOS region <b>20</b>. As shown, Fins <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>104</b>-<b>2</b> are formed in NMOS region <b>10</b> and PMOS region <b>20</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Semiconductor fins <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>104</b>-<b>2</b> may be formed by any suitable method. In some embodiments, semiconductor fins <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>104</b>-<b>2</b> may be formed by forming STI regions (not shown) first, and then recessing the top surface of STI regions (not shown) to a level lower than the original top surface of substrate <b>20</b>. The remaining portions of substrate <b>102</b> between STI regions (now shown) thus become fins <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>104</b>-<b>2</b>. For example, substrate <b>102</b> may be patterned and etched through a photolithographic process. In some embodiments, semiconductor fins <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>104</b>-<b>2</b> are formed from a material different from that of substrate <b>102</b>. Fins <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>104</b>-<b>2</b> can be formed by recessing top portions of substrate <b>102</b> between neighboring STI regions (not shown) to form recesses, and re-growing a semiconductor material different from that of substrate <b>102</b> in the recesses. Top portions of STI regions (not shown) may then be removed, while bottom portions of STI regions (not shown) are not removed, so that the top portions of the re-grown semiconductor material between neighboring STI regions (not shown) become semiconductor fins. In another embodiment, STI regions (not shown) may be formed by a process including recess formation on substrate <b>102</b>, forming a dielectric film using a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process, then using chemical metal polishing (CMP) to remove extra STI dielectric film. Fins <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>104</b>-<b>2</b> may then be formed and patterned through an epitaxial growth process.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Semiconductor fins <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>104</b>-<b>2</b> have a respective channel region formed therein.

For example, channel region dopants may be introduced through implantations, or through in-situ doping performed simultaneously with the growth of semiconductor fins <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>104</b>-<b>2</b>. The inventors have discovered that by selecting the gate electrode material and channel doping material, an optimum work-function gate material in a multi-VT device can be achieved to improve VT MOS transistor performance and mobility.</p>

As shown, p-type dopants are introduced into channel region <b>212</b> at a first portion of fin <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>. Any suitable p-type dopant may be introduced.

In some embodiments, channel region <b>212</b> may be doped at a concentration between approximately &#x2212;2e<sup>18 </sup>and 1e<sup>18 </sup>charge carriers per cubic centimeter (e.g. between &#x2212;2.1e<sup>18 </sup>and 1.05e<sup>18 </sup>charge carriers per cubic centimeter.) Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, n-type dopants are introduced into channel region <b>262</b> at a second portion of fin <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>. Any suitable n-type dopant may be introduced. For example, a n-type impurity such as arsenic or phosphorous may be implanted into channel region <b>262</b>. In some embodiments, channel region <b>262</b> may be doped at a concentration between approximately &#x2212;2e<sup>18 </sup>and 1e<sup>18 </sup>charge carriers per cubic centimeter (e.g. between &#x2212;2.1e<sup>18 </sup>and 1.05e<sup>18 </sup>charge carriers per cubic centimeter.)

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As identified above, by selecting the gate electrode material suitable for the dopant materials for the respective channel regions of each of the transistors of a multi-gate semiconductor device, improved voltage threshold (VT) MOS transistor performance and mobility can be realized. The inventors have discovered that for a multi-gate semiconductor device, such as a FinFET, low doping concentrations can be maintained in transistors having different voltage thresholds which will improve the transistors' performance and mobility. In some embodiments, channel region dopant concentrations can be maintained between approximately &#x2212;2e<sup>18 </sup>and 1e<sup>18 </sup>charge carriers per cubic centimeter (e.g. between &#x2212;2.1e<sup>18 </sup>and 1.05e<sup>18 </sup>charge carriers per cubic centimeter.) By way of example, such improvements have been observed in high VT transistors (HVT) with voltage thresholds between approximately 0.5 and 0.9V (e.g. 0.45-0.95V) and in standard VT transistors (SVT) between approximately 0.1V and 0.4V (e.g. 0.05-0.45V). In several embodiments, the improved transistor performance and mobility that has been observed includes a significant reduction in the work function difference between transistors having different voltage thresholds in multi-VT devices such as FinFETs.
