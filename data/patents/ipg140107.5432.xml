<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation application of U.S. Ser. No. 13/352,068 filed Jan. 17, 2012, which is a continuation application of U.S. Ser. No. 11/225,518 filed Sep. 12, 2005, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,121,855 issued on Feb. 21, 2012, all of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the provision of online medical records. More particularly, the present invention relates to providing a means for consumers to request their medical records from health care providers, store the medical records, and provide for private communications between the consumers and their health care providers.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Medical and other health information can be particularly sensitive communications. Laws such as the HIPPA Privacy Rule restrict, limit, or place specific conditions on the dissemination of medical records. Laws such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) provide a patient with the right to access to their own medical records.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A health provider, such as a hospital may require a patient to submit to their own privacy practices as a condition for treatment or admittance. A privacy practice statement of the health provider will likely explain that the patient the right to inspect and copy their medical records, but there may be significant procedural hurdles to overcome that burden both the health provider and the patient. For example, the patient would be required to provide a written request, there may be processing delays in receiving copies of the medical or health related records, and additional processing charges resulting from the inconvenience created for the health provider to comply with the procedural hurdles that they put in place to avoid inappropriately disclosing records of their patients.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Of course, privacy concerns regarding a patient's medical records creates other problems for health care providers. For example, suppose a health care provider needs to communicate with a patient over the phone to check on a patient, request additional information regarding a patient's current condition, to schedule a test, report the results of a test, express the need for a return visit, or for other reasons related to providing health care to the patient. The health care provider calls the patient at home or at work and the patient is not available. Instead, the phone is answered by another person who could be a co-worker or family member. Alternatively, the health care provider is provided with the opportunity to leave a voicemail message. The health care provider must be very cautious to avoid inadvertently disclosing private information. Thus, the health care provider may not be able to leave a message with another person or with a voicemail system if doing so would violate the patient's privacy rights or expectations of privacy. Even in cases where the health care provider may be legally authorized to do so via a previously agreed upon privacy policy, doing so may be against the person's wishes as they did not understand what they were consenting to when they consented to the privacy policy or did not understand their rights under the privacy policy. A message for the patient may provide other parties with more information then the patient would want them to know. Even when a health care provider attempts to leave a seemingly innocuous message with a voicemail system or with another individual, more information may be shared then the patient wants to be shared. For example, a message left with another requesting that the patient call a particular doctor may be more than what the patient would want shared with others. For example, suppose it is known or readily determined that the doctor is an obstetrician and the patient is a woman who does not want her significant other to know she is pregnant yet. Suppose it is known or readily determined that the doctor is an oncologist and the patient does not want their co-workers or employer to know that the patient has cancer. Mere knowledge of the doctor's name, in these cases would be sufficient to make an educated guess about the patient's condition or potential condition. A patient may consider this a violation of their privacy. Regardless of whether or not the patient has any legal recourse, this can result in the patient being upset and can have a negative impact on the relationship between the patient and their health care provider.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Of course, instead of leaving a message, a health care provider could simply call back, but this is inconvenient for the health care provider or their staff and may unduly delay the amount of time before the patient receives the message. Thus, private and secure communications would benefit both the health care provider and the patient. The health care provider would not have to worry about disclosing private information to a party who should not have the information. And, the patient would be more likely to receive the communications sooner and could take comfort knowing that their privacy was maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another problem relating to medical records is that where an individual sees multiple health care providers, the inconvenience of requesting medical records is multiplied. Given the inconvenience and the potential delay in obtaining records it is also likely that in such instances the individual does not actually compile a complete medical history. To the extent the individual has their records, the individual must determine a method of storing and organizing them.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Yet another problem relating to medical records is that often times they are most needed at a time when the individual is unable to provide them. For example, in emergency situations it would be desirable for caregivers to know and understand the individual's medical history. Knowledge of specific allergies may be essential to avoid administration of medications that would adversely impact the condition of the individual. Knowledge of pre-existing conditions may be essential to correct diagnosis and treatment. What is desired is a way that relevant medical records could be shared when needed most.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Various attempts have been made to assist consumers with their medical records in different ways. One example of such an attempt is Synchart. Synchart is a web-based service (www.synchart.com) that allows consumers to enter their personal and family health information into a database. Users can enter doctor visits, immunizations, hospital visits, allergies, and other relevant information and generate reports based on the data entered. As part of the services, consumers receive a CD with their medical information data, as well as a wallet card. Because medical data is stored on the Synchart web server, user health information is accessible from any Internet-connected computer, which Synchart claims will allow doctors and other providers to access user information if the user gives them account information.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">One of the problems with a service such as Synchart is that it requires users to enter information about their health histories into a database, a time consuming and cumbersome process which is inconvenient and sometimes difficult. These issues are further magnified if an individual does not have a complete understanding of their medical records. Another problem of such a system is that clerical errors by the user can result in inaccurate information. A further problem is that medical information is not immediately available if the individual does not immediately enter the information. Such a problem is exacerbated by the fact that often times when an individual is frequently seeing health care providers they are ill or injured and it is particularly inconvenient to update their medical records. Finally, such a system does not address issues of obtaining the medical records from the health care provider.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Redi-Records is another example of a system that assists consumers with obtaining access to their medical records. For a fee, Redi-Records will gather all of a subscriber's medical records from different doctors and hospitals. Once the records are gathered, Redi-Records will digitize them and put them onto two mini-CDs. Users can carry 1 mini-CD in their wallet and keep one at home. For an additional cost, the company will update a user's records every 180 or 90 days. Such a service is marketed with the promise that having records on a mini-CD will make it easier for you to receive proper treatment in the event of a medical emergency. One of the problems with such an approach is that the records are not necessarily current. Another problem with such an approach is that a third party is involved so that complex forms will need to be completed by the consumer and the consumer's providers in order to grant the third party access to the medical records which could cause delay in gathering information. Due to the third party involvement, there is a chain of human handling of the documents that could compromise the privacy of the documents. In addition, as the mini-CDs may not be secured or password protected, or the information about how to access them readily available. Where the mini-CDs are not secured or password protected, unauthorized individuals could access a person's medical records.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another prior art approach is HeartRecord (www.heartcenteronline.com). This service focuses on cardiac patients. Users pay a subscription fee and are able to enter information about their medical history, doctors, and prescriptions into a database that is accessible using the Internet with a secured password. As a result, important information is available in the event of a medical emergency or when users visit a doctor. HeartRecord also allows users to upload their EKGs and other vital images to their account either from a computer, or by e-mailing, faxing or mailing the image to the company. HeartRecord has several inherent problems. HeartRecord's system places the onus of entering data and uploading images completely on the user. Another problem with such as service is that it is limited in scope. A further problem with such as system is that it does not create a private communications link between a doctor and patient.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another prior art approach is demonstrated by Personal MD. This product (www.personalmd.com) uses a fax-based technology to allow users to store records that can be accessed via the Internet. Personal MD also offers a feature where users can file the most critical information in a folder marked &#x201c;Emergency&#x201d;, which can be printed out by personnel via fax in the event of a medical crisis. Personal MD also offers medication reminders and other calendar features, and the site includes syndicated health information content. One of the problems with this approach is ease of use. For example with Personal MD, a non-dedicated number is used thus the person sending a fax must enter a PIN before sending the fax. This can create an unacceptable inconvenience for a busy doctor's office and can cause frustration. Moreover, it also creates an additional opportunity for human error in that use of the wrong pin number may direct the fax to a wrong destination. Such a system is not focused on providing a private communications link between a patient and their health care provider.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another prior art approach is Web MD Health Manager offered by WebMD (www.webmd.com). This system allows users to enter data about their personal health such as health conditions, blood pressure, cholesterol level and other metrics. This system will then run those numbers against a database to provide a personal &#x201c;self-assessment&#x201d; and provide tips on better health. Such a system does not provide for storage of medical records or a private communications links between a health care provider and patient.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another prior art approach is available from iHealthRecord.org. This service provides an interactive data entry screen that allows users to enter their personal and family health histories. This information can then be printed out on a wallet card. One of the problems with such an approach is that it requires users to enter information on their medical records into a database, a time consuming and cumbersome task which can also result in inaccuracies. In addition, this approach does not provide a secure communications link between a health care provider and their patient or offer storage and management of personal health and medical records.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Thus, despite the advancements in these areas, problems remain. In particular, there is a general lack of recognition of the need to provide secure and private communications between a health care provider and their patient and to do so in a manner that is convenient to both the health care provider and the patient. There is also a general lack of recognition of the problems for an individual to exercise their rights to receive access to their health care records and be able to store and maintain those records in one secured, password protected account that allows for files to be categorized, annotated, sorted and viewed based on date, type of record, doctor, or user.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The present invention provides for a convenient method for individuals to collect and store their private medical information and to provide private communications between the individual and their health care providers. One of the ways that the present invention collects and stores private medical information and facilitates private communications is through use of a LIFELINE which is a dedicated toll-free number for fax and voice communications. This dedicated toll-free number provides direct and private communications between a health care provider and their patient so that a health care provider can be assured that they are maintaining patient communications in secret and to avoid violating applicable privacy laws or patient expectations regarding privacy.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram illustrating one embodiment of a system <b>100</b> of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a consumer or patient <b>102</b> is shown. A health care provider <b>104</b> is also shown as well as a fax/voice server <b>106</b>. A web server <b>108</b> is operatively connected to the fax/voice server <b>106</b>. The health care provider <b>104</b> uses the phone <b>110</b> to communicate private voicemail messages through a toll-free dedicated phone number to the fax/voice server <b>106</b>. In addition, the health care provider faxes health or medical records <b>112</b> to the fax/voice server <b>106</b> using the toll-free dedicated phone number. The medical record <b>112</b> preferably has a sticker <b>114</b> present on the medical record <b>112</b>. The sticker <b>114</b> indicates or instructs the health care provider or their staff to fax the information to the toll-free dedicated phone number. In addition, the sticker <b>114</b> provides an indication of clear consent from the patient to the health care provider <b>104</b> to the toll-free dedicated phone number. Thus, it becomes a simple process for a consumer or patient <b>102</b> to provide their health care provider <b>104</b> with instructions to fax health records, a simple process for the health care provider to obtain permission to fulfill a request for health care records, and a simple process for the health care provider to do so in a secure and convenient manner as the fax is going directly to a toll-free dedicated phone number associated with the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The web server <b>108</b> is operatively connected to the fax/voice server <b>106</b> such as over a network or otherwise. A patient <b>102</b> or their proxy can communicate directly with the web server <b>108</b> through a computing device <b>109</b> or the fax/voice server <b>106</b> using a phone <b>117</b>. The patient <b>102</b> can use a LIFELINE card <b>116</b> that contains access information to log on to the web server <b>108</b> associated with a web site of the present invention, or as a reminder of their tollfree dedicated phone number which they can call to access voicemail messages, listen to text-to-speech conversion of emails, or otherwise access information.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The present invention also allows a patient <b>102</b> to upload files using a computing device <b>109</b> to the web server <b>108</b>. In addition, the patient <b>102</b> can use the computing device <b>109</b> to interact with the web server <b>108</b> to specify that a prescription or other personal health record is faxed via the fax/voice server <b>106</b> to a health care provider <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a sticker <b>114</b> for a patient to give to their healthcare provider to request or instruct their health care provider to fax medical records to the tollfree dedicated phone number associated with the patient. Although it is preferred that a sticker <b>114</b> be used because of the added convenience provided by being able to permanently or semi-permanently attach to a paper medical record, the present invention contemplates that other types of documents could be used. The sticker <b>114</b> includes the LIFELINE phone number <b>120</b> which is the tollfree dedicated phone number associated with the patient. Note that there is no pin number required which greatly simplifies the process of faxing documents. In addition, the name <b>122</b> of the patient is shown. There is also a written request <b>124</b> on the sticker <b>114</b> that instructs the health care provider to fax the records and explicitly gives permission to fax the health care record. The language of the written request may vary as necessary to comply with any applicable laws. It should be appreciated that the sticker <b>114</b> provides great convenience to both an individual who wants to instruct their health care provider to give them access to their medical records as well as to the health care provider who can now easily provide the individual with access to their medical records. The present invention further contemplates that medical alert information can also be placed on the sticker <b>114</b>. The types of medical alert information includes, without limitation, blood type information (i.e. ABO and Rhesus information), allergies to drugs, presence of a pacemaker, diabetes, epilepsy, or other conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrate one embodiment of a LIFELINE card <b>116</b>. The LIFELINE card has a front side <b>130</b> and an opposite back side <b>132</b>. The card <b>116</b> includes the name of the individual <b>122</b>, a URL for a web site <b>136</b> which stores medical records for the individual. In addition there is access information <b>134</b> such a username and password. The card <b>116</b> also includes the tollfree dedicated phone number <b>120</b> associated with the individual. On the back side <b>132</b> of the card <b>116</b> as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, medical alert information <b>139</b> is provided. The medical alert information <b>139</b> can include allergies which the individual has, medical conditions such as diabetes or epilepsy, the presence of a pacemaker, or other medical information that may be of great importance in evaluating or treating the individual in the case of a medical emergency. The medical alert information can further include blood type information (i.e. ABO and Rhesus information). Also, instructions <b>138</b> are provided on the card <b>116</b> to indicate how one could access complete medical records or information about the individual.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The present invention contemplates including the sticker <b>114</b> (or other permission/request document) and the LIFELINE card <b>116</b> in a welcome kit when an individual or family subscribes or signs-up for the service. In addition, from the web site associated with the service, preferably addition stickers and/or additional cards can be printed and information can be updated as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a system of the present invention. Preferably such a system is implemented using equipment from Prairie Systems, Inc. of Omaha, Nebr., although the present invention contemplates that other vendors may be used. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the system <b>200</b> includes a fax/voice server <b>202</b>. The fax/voice server <b>202</b> is accessible by a fax machine <b>204</b> or a phone <b>208</b> through using a dedicated phone number. Preferably, the phone number <b>206</b> is toll-free as this increases the accessibility and convenience of the system which is very important. However, the phone number could also be a direct dial phone number. When the fax/voice server <b>202</b> receives a call, determination is made in step <b>210</b> as to whether the call is a voice call or a fax call. Where the call is a voice call, an interactive voice response (IVR) system is used to determine who the caller is, the purpose of the call, or other information, and then stores any voicemail message in voice storage <b>212</b>. The system is adapted notify the individual that there is a voicemail message through an email notification in step <b>214</b> and/or other types of notification in step <b>216</b>. Other types of notification can include, but are not limited to text messages to a cell phone or pager. Thus, a health care provider can call the LIFELINE number <b>206</b> and leave a voicemail message for the individual and know that the communication is a private communication. Thus, the health care provider can leave private and confidential information, such as the results of a test, or the need to schedule a new appointment, or other information. The individual is alerted to the presence of the voicemail message and can then call-in to the fax/voice server to check messages.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Where documents are faxed, fax images are collected and converted to portable document format (PDF) documents <b>218</b>. Although, the PDF format is preferred, the present invention contemplates that other types of document conversions can be done as may be appropriate in a particular implementation of the present invention. Based on the dedicated phone number used to send the documents, the faxed documents are assigned to a user account and stored in step <b>220</b>. The individual is alerted via email that the documents have been sent in step <b>224</b>. Alternatively, the individual is alerted via text messaging in step <b>222</b> that a fax has been sent.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The web site of the present invention provides a convenient location to collect and store health care records and provide secure access to the records. It also provides a convenient way to enroll in a service for providing online access to health records. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> provides one embodiment of an enrollment process In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, a user <b>250</b> accesses a home page <b>252</b> for a medical records web site. In step <b>254</b>, a determination is made as to whether the user <b>250</b> is an existing member. If the member is, then in step <b>256</b> the user is provided access to their user interface as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. If not, then in step <b>258</b> a determination is made as to whether the user <b>250</b> agrees to terms and conditions of service. If not, then in step <b>260</b> the user is thanked for their interest but not allowed to continue. The user is also given the option or encouraged to output the terms and conditions to a printer in step <b>262</b> so that they can review them closely and maintain a copy for their records if they wish. If in step <b>260</b>, the user agrees to the terms and conditions of service then in step <b>264</b> the system collects user data. User data <b>266</b> can include last name, first name, address information, city, state, zip code, phone number, email/pager/mobile device information, emergency contact name, emergency contact phone number, primary care physician phone number, insurance information, allergies and medications, and/or other information. If all fields are received in step <b>268</b>, then in step <b>272</b> the system assigns a user name and password. It is to be understood that the user may also request a particular username and/or set their own password. Where a user selects their own password, then in step <b>270</b>, a determination is made as to whether the password meets security requirements. For example, there may be a minimum number of characters required, or there must be at least one numeric character, or other requirements. Where the user is allowed to select their own name, in step <b>274</b>, a username database is searched and in step <b>276</b> a determination is made as to whether or not the name is available. If it is, then in <b>278</b> the user is permitted to create a personal identification number (PIN). In step <b>280</b>, a rule such as one requiring a particular number of digits or a particular minimum digits is applied. In step <b>282</b> the PIN is validated and the enrollment process proceeds to billing options in step <b>284</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the user is allowed to choose a plan in step <b>286</b>. The individual could, for example, choose an individual or family plan from the plan options <b>288</b>. In step <b>290</b>, the user enters credit card information <b>292</b> which may include a credit card number, billing address, and CVV number. This information is then submitted to a payment processor <b>294</b>. In step <b>298</b>, a determination is made as to whether the credit card information can be authorized for payment. If not, then the number of retries is determined in step <b>296</b> and the user is allowed to re-enter their credit card information in step <b>290</b>. If there have already been two tries to validate credit card information, then in step <b>300</b> the individual is told that they can not enroll at this time and should try again later. If payment is authorized in step <b>298</b> then in step <b>302</b> a dedicated tollfree phone number is assigned and an IP address associated with the user is registered. In step <b>304</b> a user account is created. In step <b>306</b> an email notification confirming registration is sent to the user. In step <b>308</b> the user can begin to setup their personal web site such as their database of doctors, family members, calendar, and otherwise configure their web site.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">After registration, the user can access the user interface of the web site. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates one embodiment of the user interface <b>256</b>. The user <b>250</b> can access the homepage <b>252</b>. In step <b>400</b>, a determination is made as to whether the system recognizes the ip address being used by the user as being associated with the user. If the ip address is not recognized then extra security measures are taken beginning in step <b>414</b>. In step <b>414</b> a username and a double level of password log-in is required. If a valid log-in <b>416</b>, then the process proceeds to step <b>424</b>. If not, then in step <b>418</b>, the number of invalid log-in attempts or tries is monitored and if it is three, then in step <b>420</b> the account is frozen. Returning to step <b>400</b>, if the ip address is recognized as being associated with the user, then in step <b>402</b> a username and a single level of password log-in is required. In step <b>412</b> a determination is made as to whether or not the password is valid. If a valid password, then the process proceeds to step <b>424</b>. If not, then in step <b>404</b> a determination is made as to the number of invalid attempts. After three invalid attempts, in step <b>406</b> the account is frozen and in step <b>408</b> an email is sent to the individual who may, in step <b>410</b>, implement procedures to change the password and re-open the account.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Returning to step <b>424</b>, a determination is made as to whether the account is associated with an individual or a family. If the account is associated with a family, then in step <b>426</b>, the user can select the family member and access the family database <b>428</b>. If, in step <b>424</b> the account is not a family account, then in step <b>430</b> the user can view their mailbox showing new PDF files and voice files. Preferably, these new files include date and time stamps so that the user can see when the files were received.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In step <b>432</b>, the user is allowed to annotate the messages to better identify the messages in a manner that is convenient for the user. In step <b>434</b>, the user can play the voicemail messages. In step <b>436</b>, the user can choose to save the messages to voice storage <b>438</b> or to send the message to the trash <b>440</b>. In step <b>442</b>, the user can select a doctor to associate with the voicemail messages. For example, the doctor from which the voicemail or imaged document was received. Preferably the doctor is within the doctor database <b>444</b>. If not, then in step <b>460</b>, the user can update the doctor database <b>444</b> to include the doctor. The user can then organize the voicemail or document according to the user's preference into one or more file folders. Examples of file folders include RX <b>446</b>, XRAYS <b>448</b>, LABS <b>450</b>, EXAM NOTES <b>452</b>, OTHER <b>454</b>. The user can make new file folders such as file folder <b>456</b> and identify it appropriately. The user interface offers functions <b>458</b> such as movement of files between folders, drag and drop, cut and paste, and/or other functions that will assist the user in organizing their records.</p>

<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates one embodiment of using the health-related information collected to provide additional benefits to a consumer. For example, the present invention allows for a system <b>600</b> that includes a personal health records database <b>602</b> and a drug interactions database <b>604</b> operatively connected to an analysis system <b>606</b>. The analysis system <b>606</b> is operatively connected to a drug interaction reporting component <b>608</b>. The personal health records includes information regarding which prescription drugs are being taken by the user. The drug interactions database <b>604</b> includes information regarding known interactions between different drugs. The analysis system <b>606</b> analyzes the prescription drugs taken by the user to determine if there is any known interaction that may be adverse in any way to the user. Based on the results of this analysis, the drug interaction reporting component <b>608</b> reports the results to the user, their pharmacist, doctor, or other health care provider as appropriate. The present invention contemplates that drug interaction reporting can be reported in different ways to different people based on factors such as user preferences regarding the drug interacting reporting, the severity or certainty of a determined adverse drug interaction, or otherwise. The present invention contemplates that in addition to drug interaction analysis and reporting, other types of analysis and reporting can be performed on the personal health records. One of the advantages of the present invention is that it allows for a convenient method to build and maintain complete and up-to-date health records, thus allowing the personal health records to be analyzed in any number of ways.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The present invention provides for numerous other features and advantages. For example, the web site can provide reminders for doctor appointments, prescription refills, or other events through email reminders or text messaging reminders. In addition, the web site allows the user to select the option of sending information via fax to a care provider. For example, a user can fax a prescription to their pharmacy of choice. In addition, the user can fax their medical records received from one health care provider to another health care provider.</p>
