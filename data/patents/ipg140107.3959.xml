<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a system and method for verification of media content synchronization, in particular, verifying the synchronization between video and audio streams included in media content.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Media content may include multiple types of data streams, for example, video, audio, closed captioning, and/or other types of streams. For any single program of media content, it may be necessary to verify that each of the data streams included in the program are in synchronization with each other. For example, for programs such as movies, television shows and the like, it may be necessary to make sure that the video stream is synchronized with the audio stream. This type of synchronization may be referred to as lip synchronization, i.e., matching the motions of a speaker's lips recorded in the video stream with the audible sounds spoken by the speaker recorded in the audio stream. More generally, lip synchronization refers to the matching of the video stream with the audio stream, and is not limited to matching a speaker's lips with the spoken words. Lip synchronization is generally verified through a manual process in which a person testing synchronization views and listens to the program in real-time and determines if the video and audio streams are synchronized. By such a manual verification process, a master copy having a known good synchronization between the various data streams may be identified and/or stored.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Programs including video, audio and/or other types of data streams may be copied, converted to different file types and packaged differently for distribution when copies of a single program are to be delivered to multiple different consumers and/or types of output devices, such as for example, televisions, computers, cellular phones, and/or other devices. Examples of file type conversion may include MPEG compression of a video stream and/or Dolby AC3 compression of an audio stream. An example of packaging may include an MPEG transport stream in which video and audio files are wrapped for transmission and delivery. However, during the copying, conversion and/or packaging of copies of a program, the synchronization between the various data streams may be altered. For example, the audio stream may be delayed or advanced with respect to the video stream, such that audible sounds do not correctly match the corresponding visible motions/actions. If delivered, such copies having synchronization errors may create a poor viewing experience for consumers, and therefore, it may be necessary to include an additional process prior to delivery to prevent such errors from reaching consumers. Thus, a manual process for verification of synchronization, similar to the manual verification process previously completed for the known good master copy, may be required for each subsequent copy before delivering any copies of programs to consumers. Accordingly, a person testing synchronization may be required to view and listen to each of the copies of a program in real-time in order to determine if the video and audio streams are synchronized.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The manual verification process is time-consuming because it requires an individual to view and listen to each copy of a program in real-time. If many copies are created for delivery to multiple output devices and consumers, each of these copies must be manually viewed and listened to in real-time, thereby adding time and cost to the overall process.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, because the manual verification process relies on humans to determine whether synchronization between data streams is acceptable, the manual verification process necessarily lacks consistency. For example, one individual viewing a copy may find the synchronization to be acceptable, whereas another individual viewing the same copy may find the synchronization to be unacceptable. Moreover, even a single human may lack consistency over time. For example, an individual viewing a copy may find the synchronization to be acceptable after one viewing, but, if that same individual were to view the same copy again, that individual may determine that the synchronization is unacceptable during the second viewing. Furthermore, multiple other factors may affect the performance of each person testing synchronization at any point in time, such as for example, fatigue, mood, stress, general attentiveness, outside distractions and/or other factors. Thus, the manual verification process lacks consistency due to a number of factors. Moreover, the manual verification process also lacks an objective measure by which to consistently determine whether the synchronization between data streams, such as between video and audio streams, is acceptable.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As an alternative to the manual process for verification of synchronization, measurable markers, e.g., a test signal, may be embedded in the various data streams of a program in order to determine the synchronization. For example, one or more measurable markers may be embedded at particular time points in a video stream, and corresponding measurable marker(s) may be embedded at the same particular time points in an audio stream. Thereafter, when a copy of the program including the measurable markers is created, converted and/or packaged, it can be determined whether the measurable markers embedded in the various data streams of the copy remain aligned with each other, thereby verifying that the synchronization has been maintained. However, this process requires altering the various data streams of an original program by embedding measurable markers, including the additional process steps of embedding those markers into each of the various data streams of the program and recovering those markers during playback. In addition, this process requires real-time playback of the media content in order to accurately capture the measurable markers embedded in the various data streams.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Example embodiments of the present invention provide for verification of media content synchronization using a process that can be completed faster than the real-time viewing of the media content. The process may also provide a consistent and objective method by which to accurately and quickly verify the synchronization of media content. Further, the process may allow for verification of synchronization without altering the program itself.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an example embodiment of the present invention, a master program may include two components, whose synchronization has been confirmed. The two components may be, for example, a video component and an audio component. The audio and video components may have a length measurable in units of time, where each portion of the respective component would be played back in such units of time. The audio and video components of a synchronized master program have running times. Each of the audio and video components can be divided into a plurality of segments over its running time, in which each segment of the audio component matches a corresponding segment of the video component over a same segment of their running times, such that each of the corresponding segments of audio and video components form a pair of corresponding segments. In an example embodiment, for each of at least one, e.g., a plurality of, pair(s) of corresponding segments of the two components, a processor generates a fingerprint of each segment of the pair. For each such pair of fingerprints, the processor generates a signature formed by a combination of the fingerprints. Then, the complete sequence of the generated signatures over the running time of the synchronized master program may be stored as a representation of the synchronization of the two components, e.g., a synchronization of the video and audio components, because a shift in time of the audio component relative to the video component would produce different signatures, as there would be a different combination of audio and video per sampled segment. The fingerprints may be produced such that slightly different fingerprints would be generated for different sampled segments that are slightly offset in time from each other (e.g., where the shift occurs at a point corresponding to a subtle change in content, for example, where the shift is due to the removal of several video frames).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">For a copy of the master program, e.g., whose production includes a processing rendering the program suitable for a particular output device, the system may similarly generate fingerprints and a sequence of one or more signatures over the running time of the copy.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The system may compare the sequence of one or more signatures of the copy to the sequence of one or more signatures of the synchronized master program. Such comparison may be performed prior to playback of the copy and may be performed in a short processing time, substantially faster than the time required for playback of the content. Based on the comparison, the system may generate a similarity score. Since the fingerprinting is content based, such that slight variations in the content produce slightly different fingerprints, therefore the resulting signatures may also be such that slight offsets in time between the two program components, e.g., the audio and video, produce slightly different signatures. Accordingly, the system may generate a score whose value depends on the difference between the compared signatures, where the greater the difference, the lower the score.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an example embodiment, the system may compare a plurality of the signatures of the copy to a corresponding plurality of signatures of the master program, and the score may be dependent on the number of compared signatures that do not match, regardless of a degree of difference between any of the mismatching signatures.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an alternative example embodiment, the score may be based on a combination of the comparisons of the plurality of signatures, where the degree of difference between each compared pair of signatures is considered. For example, the system may compute an average score based on a plurality of individual scores of the individual compared pairs of signatures, where the individual scores depend on the degree of difference between the two signatures of the respective signature pairs.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an alternative example embodiment, a single pair of signatures may be compared to determine whether there is an exact match, and the copy may be discarded where there is not an exact match.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one example variant of this embodiment, the comparison is performed prior to playback and in a processing time that is less than a time required for playback of the media content versions.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to an example embodiment of the present invention, it may not be necessary to initially provide a master program having verified synchronization of data streams. Instead, a plurality of copies of a program having various data streams may be provided. For example, for a program having a video component and an audio component for which synchronization is to be verified, each of the plurality of copies may be processed to determine at least one fingerprint of the video component and at least one fingerprint of the audio components. Then, each of the pairs of video and audio fingerprints corresponding to a same segment of each copy's running time may be processed to determine a signature for that segment of the copy's running time. Following the fingerprint and signature generation process, each of the plurality of copies will have at least one, e.g., a sequence of, signature(s) for corresponding segments in time of the overall running time. The signatures of each of the plurality of copies of the program may be stored for further processing.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Then, the signatures of each copy of the program may be compared to the signatures of each of the other copies of the program. Based on the degree of similarity between the signatures of the compared copies, a similarity score for the compared copies may be determined. In this manner, similarity scores for each copy with respect to each of the other copies are determined. The copies having similarity scores that meet or exceed a defined threshold for similarity with each other are determined to be equal with respect to the relationships of their audio and video streams. If one or more similarity scores for a copy does not meet or exceed the defined threshold for similarity, these copies are determined to be not equal to the other copies, with respect to the relationship of their audio and video streams, for which the similarity scores were calculated.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Following the determination of the similarity scores for the plurality of copies, all of the copies that are determined to be equal with respect to the relationships of their audio and video streams will have similarity scores that meet or exceed a defined threshold for similarity with the other copies. Each copy that is determined to be not equal to all other copies, with respect to their respective relationships of their respective audio and video streams, is quickly rejected as not having synchronized media content.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">From the plurality of copies that are determined to be equal, with respect to their respective relationships of their respective audio and video streams, to each of the other copies, a single copy is chosen for verification of media content synchronization. For example, the single chosen copy can be manually verified for media content synchronization by having a person testing synchronization view and listen to the audio and video streams of the single chosen copy. If the person testing synchronization verifies that the single chosen copy has synchronized media content, then the plurality of copies that are determined to be equal with respect to the relationships of their audio and video streams are verified as having synchronized media content.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to an example embodiment of the present invention, a computer-implemented method of verification of media content synchronization may provide for determining, by a computer processor, at least one similarity score of a first copy of a program based on a comparison of at least one signature of the first copy with at least one signature of a second copy of the program.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an exemplary system <b>10</b> for verification of media content synchronization according to an example embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The system <b>10</b> may include a processor <b>11</b>, and one or more databases <b>12</b>. The database <b>12</b> may store a master program <b>13</b>, a copy <b>14</b> of the master program <b>13</b>, signatures <b>15</b> of the master program <b>13</b>, signatures <b>16</b> of the copy <b>14</b>, a threshold level <b>17</b> for synchronization verification, and similarity scores <b>18</b> for the copy <b>14</b>. As schematically illustrated by the dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, one or more databases <b>12</b> may store one or more of the above sets of data.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The master program <b>13</b> may be a program that includes multiple types of data streams such as, for example, a video stream and an audio stream. The master program <b>13</b> may be a known good copy of the program, i.e., the video stream and the audio stream are known to be synchronized. In this regard, the master program <b>13</b> may be received from a trusted source such that no additional verification of synchronization need be performed. Alternatively, the master program <b>13</b> may be manually checked by a person who views and listens to the master program <b>13</b> in real-time in order to ensure correct synchronization between the video and audio streams. Although the below discussion describes the synchronization of video and audio streams, the example system and method may also be applied to synchronizing other additional types of data streams.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The copy <b>14</b> of the master program may be a copy that is converted, packaged, and/or otherwise processed for distribution to particular output devices. For example, output devices may include televisions, computers, cellular phones, and/or other devices, of which one or more may require that the copy <b>14</b> be converted, packaged and/or processed in order to be output on the respective device. Additional processing may include data compression, file type conversion, and others. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates only a single copy <b>14</b> for simplicity of discussion, it is understood that the database <b>12</b> may include many different copies <b>14</b> that have been processed for a plurality of different output devices.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The database <b>12</b> may also store signatures <b>15</b> of the master program <b>13</b> and signatures <b>16</b> of the copy <b>14</b>. The signatures <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> may be digital representations of segments of a program, in which the digital representations uniquely identify the corresponding segments. For example, the signatures <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> may be digital representations of segments of the combined video and audio streams. Accordingly, the signatures <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> may be stored in the database <b>12</b> as file-based data corresponding to the actual video and audio streams of a program. The generation of the signatures <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> will be further discussed herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The database <b>12</b> may also store a threshold level <b>17</b> for synchronization verification, which defines an acceptable level of synchronization of a copy <b>14</b> as compared to a master program <b>13</b>. The threshold level <b>17</b> may be a level related to an acceptable variance between the video and audio streams of the copy <b>14</b>, for example. In addition, the threshold level <b>17</b> may be adjusted depending on the relative shift between the video and audio streams of the copy <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">For example, in an example embodiment of the present invention, in order to determine whether an audio stream is leading or lagging behind the video stream, an additional comparison of the signatures of the copy <b>14</b> to sample signatures having either a very premature audio stream or a very delayed audio stream may be performed. If it is determined that the signatures of the copy <b>14</b> are more similar to the sample signatures having a very premature audio stream as opposed to the sample signatures having a very delayed audio stream, then the audio stream is determined to lead the video stream, and the system can accordingly adjust the threshold level <b>17</b> to a higher value, such that very little to no degree of the audio stream leading the video stream is allowed. As a result, signatures of the copy <b>14</b> would need to meet or exceed the higher threshold value <b>17</b> in order to be determined equal in relationship to the signatures of the master program <b>13</b>. Alternatively, if it is determined that the signatures of the copy <b>14</b> are more similar to the sample signatures having a very delayed audio stream as opposed to the sample signatures having a very premature audio stream, then the audio stream lags behind the video stream, and the system can accordingly adjust the threshold level <b>17</b> to a lower value, such that a larger degree of lagging of the audio stream as compared to the video stream is allowed. As a result, signatures of the copy <b>14</b> would need to meet or exceed the lower threshold value <b>17</b> in order to be determined equal in relationship to the signatures of the master program <b>13</b>. The threshold level <b>17</b> for synchronization verification will be further discussed herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The database <b>12</b> may also store similarity scores <b>18</b> for a copy <b>14</b>. The scores <b>18</b> may be calculated based on a comparison between the signatures <b>15</b> of the master program <b>13</b> and the signatures <b>16</b> of the copy <b>14</b>. For example, the scores <b>18</b> may be a measure related to a variance between the video and audio streams of the copy <b>14</b> as compared to the known synchronized video and audio streams of the master program <b>13</b>. The scores <b>18</b> may then be compared with the threshold level <b>17</b> in order to determine whether the copy <b>14</b> is acceptable for delivery to an end user. The similarity scores <b>18</b> will be further discussed herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an exemplary method <b>20</b> of verification of media content synchronization according to an example embodiment of the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> illustrate an example of generating fingerprints and signatures for verification of media content synchronization according to an example embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, at step <b>21</b>, a master program <b>13</b> having a known synchronization of video and audio streams may be provided. At step <b>22</b>, if required, the master program <b>13</b> may be processed to an uncompressed format. Step <b>22</b> may not be required if the master program <b>13</b> is already in an uncompressed format. In an alternative example embodiment, the generation of the fingerprints and signatures may be performed in a format other than the uncompressed format.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">At step <b>23</b>, fingerprints of the master program <b>13</b> may be generated using known fingerprinting processes. The fingerprints of the master program <b>13</b> may include at least one video fingerprint of the video stream and at least one audio fingerprint of the audio stream. The fingerprints may be generated for corresponding segments in time of each of the video stream and audio stream. That is, each video fingerprint may have a corresponding audio fingerprint over a matching segment in time of the video/audio streams. At step <b>24</b>, signatures <b>15</b> of the master program <b>13</b> may be generated based on the combined fingerprints of the video and audio streams that correspond to the same segments in time. At step <b>25</b>, the signatures <b>15</b> of the master program <b>13</b>, and optionally the fingerprints, may be stored in the database <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The fingerprints and signatures <b>15</b> may be generated faster than a time required for real-time playback. The length of the sample segments and the relative spacing between segments may be determined, for example, based on the length of the master program <b>13</b> and/or the number of signatures needed to reliably determine synchronization between the video and audio streams.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">By completing steps <b>21</b> to <b>25</b>, signatures <b>15</b> of a master program <b>13</b> having known good synchronization between the video and audio streams may be stored in the database <b>12</b>. Then, the signatures <b>15</b> of the master program <b>13</b> may be compared to signatures of copies <b>14</b> of the master program <b>13</b> in order to determine whether such copies <b>14</b> have maintained the synchronization between the video and audio streams.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Accordingly, at step <b>31</b>, a copy <b>14</b> of the master program <b>13</b> may be provided. As explained above, due to conversion, packaging, and/or other processing during the creation of a copy <b>14</b>, the data streams of the copy <b>14</b> may be altered with respect to each other, i.e., the synchronization between data streams may be altered. In order to prevent the distribution to end users of copies having synchronization errors, it may be desirable to check the synchronization of the copy <b>14</b> by comparison to the known good synchronization of the master program <b>13</b>. Thus, at step <b>32</b>, if required, the copy <b>14</b> may be processed to an uncompressed format. Step <b>32</b> may not be required if the copy <b>14</b> is already in an uncompressed format, or if the method is completed with a copy <b>14</b> in a format other than an uncompressed format. It may be advantageous that the copy <b>14</b> be in the same format as the master program <b>13</b> in order to more accurately determine the relative synchronization of the copy <b>14</b> as compared to the master program <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">At steps <b>33</b> and <b>34</b>, fingerprints and signatures <b>16</b> of the copy <b>14</b> may be generated using known fingerprinting processes, using a process similar to that described above with respect to the generation of fingerprints and signatures <b>15</b> of the master program <b>13</b>. Further, the fingerprints and signatures <b>16</b> of the copy <b>14</b> may be generated using segments in time corresponding to those that were used in the generation of the fingerprints and signatures <b>15</b> of the master program <b>13</b>. The generation of the fingerprints and signatures <b>16</b> of the copy <b>14</b> will be discussed in more detail herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. At step <b>35</b>, the signatures <b>16</b> of the copy <b>14</b>, and optionally the fingerprints, may be stored in the database <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The fingerprints and signatures <b>16</b> of the copy <b>14</b> may be generated faster than real-time. That is, the entirety of the copy <b>14</b> need not be output in real-time to create the signatures <b>16</b>. It may be advantageous to use sample segments in time for the generation of signatures <b>16</b> of the copy <b>14</b> that are the same as those used for the generation of signatures <b>15</b> of the master program <b>13</b>, such that a direct comparison between the signatures <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> may be possible. By completing steps <b>31</b> to <b>35</b>, signatures <b>16</b> of a copy <b>14</b> having an unknown synchronization between the video and audio streams may be stored in the database <b>12</b>. In addition, for a plurality of copies <b>14</b> of a program, the fingerprint generation and signature generation processes can be parallel-processed faster than real-time, thereby resulting in further time savings.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">At step <b>26</b>, the signatures <b>15</b> of the master program <b>13</b> and the signatures <b>16</b> of the copy <b>14</b> stored in the database <b>12</b> may be compared to determine the level of synchronization of the video and audio streams of the copy <b>14</b>. Because the signatures <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> of each of the master program <b>13</b> and the copy <b>14</b> may be generated over corresponding segments in time of the video and audio streams, it may be possible to directly compare signatures <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> and quickly determine the degree of similarity/dissimilarity. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, signature <b>15</b><i>a </i>of the master program <b>13</b> may be compared directly with signature <b>16</b><i>a </i>of the copy <b>14</b> because each of these signatures <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>a </i>was generated over the same sample period of time Ta. For the same reasons, signature <b>15</b><i>b </i>and signature <b>16</b><i>b </i>over sample period of time Tb may be directly compared, signature <b>15</b><i>c </i>and signature <b>16</b><i>c </i>over sample period of time Tc may be directly compared, etc. Further, the comparison of the signatures <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> may be completed as a file-based comparison without requiring a real-time playback of the video/audio streams of either the master program <b>13</b> or the copy <b>14</b>. Thus, it may be possible to quickly and simply compare the signatures <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> faster than real-time, without requiring playback of the copy.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In an example embodiment of the present invention, the comparison of each pair of signatures <b>15</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>a </i>(<b>15</b><i>b </i>and <b>16</b><i>b</i>, etc.) results in a similarity score for each such pair of signatures. The similarity scores may be a measure related to a variance between each signature <b>16</b> of the copy <b>14</b> as compared to each known, corresponding synchronized signature <b>15</b> of the master program <b>13</b>. For example, the similarity scores may be expressed as a percentage of matching between each pair of signatures <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, 100% denoting an exact match between the signatures and 0% denoting a complete mismatch between the signatures. Alternatively, the similarity scores may be based on any other scoring method that provides a range between an exact match and a complete mismatch.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">At step <b>27</b>, each similarity score <b>18</b> of each pair of signatures <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> may be compared against a threshold level <b>17</b>. The threshold level <b>17</b> for synchronization verification may define an acceptable level of synchronization of a copy <b>14</b> to a master program <b>13</b>. For example, the threshold level <b>17</b> may be a level related to an acceptable variance between the signatures <b>16</b> of the copy <b>14</b> and the signatures <b>15</b> of the master program <b>13</b>. In the case in which the similarity scores <b>18</b> are expressed as percentages, for example, the threshold level <b>17</b> may also be expressed as a percentage, at and/or above which the level of synchronization may be considered acceptable for end users.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">If all similarity scores <b>18</b> for signatures <b>16</b> of a copy <b>14</b> meet and/or exceed the threshold level <b>17</b> for synchronization verification with signatures <b>15</b> of a master program <b>13</b>, then at step <b>28</b>, the copy may be determined to be acceptable for distribution to end users. On the other hand, if one or more of the similarity scores <b>18</b> of a copy <b>14</b> do not meet the threshold level <b>17</b> for synchronization verification, then at step <b>29</b>, the copy <b>14</b> may undergo processing to fix the synchronization errors, or the copy <b>14</b> may be discarded and a new copy created and verified for media content synchronization. Alternatively, a combined score may be generated based on the individual scores of the individual signature comparisons, which combined score may be compared to a threshold. Alternatively, a single pair of signatures may be compared to produce a single score compared to a threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">According to the example embodiments of the present invention, verification of media content synchronization may be completed faster than real-time. For example, the generation of fingerprints and/or signatures of the master program and copies may be completed faster than real-time by sampling segments of the master program and copies. Further, the comparison of the signatures of a master program and the signatures of the copies is performed based on the signatures stored as files in a database, for example. Thus, the comparison may also be performed faster than real-time, since it is again not necessary to linearly output in real-time either an entire master program or any of its copies in order to perform the comparison.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Moreover, by the use of similarity scores based on a comparison between signatures and by the use of a threshold level for such similarity scores, a consistent and objective level of verification of media content synchronization may be provided that is not dependent on outside factors such as human errors, fatigue, stress and others. Therefore, a consistent end user experience may be ensured by eliminating the high number of variables associated with manual verification of synchronization performed by humans, as described above. The threshold level with which the system is programmed, and which is applied to all copies of a master program may be set to provide an improved end user experience, and/or reduce the number of false negatives, i.e., programs that, although rejected as having synchronization errors, are actually acceptable because the errors are not ascertainable by end users. Further, since no test signals or data are added to the video and/or audio streams of the master program or copies, there is no additional risk of detrimentally affecting the end user experience by the transmission of such added test signals or data to end users.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating another exemplary system <b>30</b> for verification of media content synchronization according to an example embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Similar to the system <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the system <b>30</b> includes a processor <b>11</b>, and one or more databases <b>12</b>. The database <b>12</b> store a plurality of copies <b>14</b> of a program, e.g., copy A and copy B, signatures <b>16</b> of the plurality of copies <b>14</b>, a threshold level <b>17</b> for synchronization verification, and similarity scores <b>18</b> for the plurality of copies <b>14</b>. As schematically illustrated by the dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, one or more databases <b>12</b> may store one or more of the above sets of data.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The plurality of copies <b>14</b> of the program may be converted, packaged, and/or otherwise processed for distribution to particular output devices, as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates only two copies, i.e., copy A and copy B, for simplicity of discussion, it is understood that the database <b>12</b> may include a plurality of, e.g., more than two, copies <b>14</b> that have been processed for a plurality of different output devices.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The database <b>12</b> may also store signatures <b>16</b> of each of the plurality of copies <b>14</b>, as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The generation of the signatures <b>16</b> will be further discussed herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The database <b>12</b> can also store a threshold level <b>17</b> for synchronization verification, as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which defines an acceptable level of synchronization of a copy <b>14</b> as compared to another copy <b>14</b>. The threshold level <b>17</b> for synchronization verification will be further discussed herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The database <b>12</b> may also store similarity scores <b>18</b> for each of the plurality of copies <b>14</b>, as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. According to an example embodiment, the scores <b>18</b> may be calculated based on a comparison between the signatures <b>16</b> of a copy <b>14</b> and the signatures <b>16</b> of another copy <b>14</b>.

The similarity scores <b>18</b> will be further discussed herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an exemplary method <b>40</b> of verification of media content synchronization according to another example embodiment of the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an example of generating fingerprints and signatures for verification of media content synchronization according to an example embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, at step <b>41</b>, a plurality of copies <b>14</b>, e.g., at least two copies, Copy A and Copy B, of a program having video and audio streams may be provided. As explained above, due to conversion, packaging, and/or other processing during the creation of each of the plurality of copies <b>14</b>, the data streams of each copy <b>14</b> might be altered with respect to those of other copies <b>14</b>, i.e., the synchronization between data streams may be altered. At step <b>42</b>, if required, each of the plurality of copies <b>14</b> may be processed to an uncompressed format. Step <b>42</b> might not be required if each of the plurality of copies <b>14</b> is already in an uncompressed format. In an alternative example embodiment, the generation of the fingerprints and signatures can be performed in a format other than the uncompressed format.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">At step <b>43</b>, fingerprints of each of the plurality of copies <b>14</b> may be generated using known fingerprinting processes. The fingerprints of each of the plurality of copies <b>14</b> may include at least one video fingerprint of the video stream and at least one audio fingerprint of the audio stream. The fingerprints may be generated for corresponding segments in time of each of the video stream and audio stream. That is, each video fingerprint may have a corresponding audio fingerprint over a matching segment in time of the video/audio streams. At step <b>44</b>, signatures <b>16</b> of each of the plurality of copies <b>14</b> are generated based on the combined fingerprints of the video and audio streams that correspond to the same segments in time. At step <b>45</b>, the signatures <b>16</b> of each of the plurality of copies <b>14</b>, and optionally the fingerprints, may be stored in the database <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The fingerprints and signatures <b>16</b> can be generated faster than a time required for real-time playback. The length of the sample segments and the relative spacing between segments may be determined, for example, based on the length of each of the plurality of copies <b>14</b> and/or the number of signatures needed to reliably determine synchronization between the video and audio streams.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The fingerprints and signatures <b>16</b> of each of the plurality of copies <b>14</b> can be generated faster than real-time. That is, the entirety of each copy <b>14</b> need not be output in real-time to create the signatures <b>16</b>. It is advantageous to use sample segments in time for the generation of signatures <b>16</b> of each copy <b>14</b> that are the same as those used for the generation of signatures <b>16</b> of each of the other copies, such that a direct comparison between the signatures <b>16</b> of each copy <b>14</b> may be possible. In addition, for a plurality of copies <b>14</b> of a program, the fingerprint generation and signature generation processes can be parallel-processed faster than real-time, thereby resulting in further time savings.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">By completing steps <b>41</b> to <b>45</b>, signatures <b>16</b> of each of the plurality of copies <b>14</b> having video and audio streams can be stored in the database <b>12</b>. At step <b>46</b>, the signatures <b>16</b> of each of the plurality of copies <b>14</b> are compared to signatures of others of the plurality of copies <b>14</b> in order to determine whether such copies <b>14</b> are equal, or not equal, with respect to the relationships between their respective video and audio streams.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Because the signatures <b>16</b> of each of the plurality of copies <b>14</b> may be generated over corresponding segments in time of the video and audio streams, it is possible to directly compare signatures <b>16</b> and quickly determine the degree of similarity/dissimilarity. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, signature <b>16</b><i>a </i>of each copy <b>14</b> can be compared directly with signature <b>16</b><i>a </i>of each of the other copies <b>14</b> because each of these signatures <b>16</b><i>a </i>is generated over the same sample period of time Ta. For the same reasons, signatures <b>16</b><i>b </i>of the plurality of copies <b>14</b> over sample period of time Tb can be directly compared, signatures <b>16</b><i>c </i>of the plurality of copies <b>14</b> over sample period of time Tc can be directly compared, etc. Further, the comparison of the signatures <b>16</b> can be completed as a file-based comparison without requiring a real-time playback of the video/audio streams of any of the plurality of copies <b>14</b>. Thus, it may be possible to quickly and simply compare the signatures <b>16</b> faster than real-time, without requiring playback of the plurality of copies.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The comparison of each pair of signatures <b>16</b><i>a </i>(<b>16</b><i>b</i>, <b>16</b><i>c</i>, etc.) results in a similarity score for each pair of signatures. In an example embodiment, the similarity scores are measures related to a variance between each signature <b>16</b> of each of the plurality of copies <b>14</b> as compared to each signature <b>16</b> of each of the other of the plurality of copies <b>14</b>. For example, the similarity scores may be expressed as a percentage of matching between each pair of signatures <b>16</b>, 100% denoting an exact match between the signatures and 0% denoting a complete mismatch between the signatures. Alternatively, the similarity scores can be based on any other scoring method that provides a range between an exact match and a complete mismatch.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">At step <b>47</b>, each similarity score <b>18</b> of each pair of signatures <b>16</b> is compared against a threshold level <b>17</b>. The threshold level <b>17</b> for synchronization verification may define an acceptable level of similarity between compared copies <b>14</b>. For example, the threshold level <b>17</b> may be a level related to an acceptable variance between the signatures <b>16</b> of each of the plurality of copies <b>14</b>. In the case in which the similarity scores <b>18</b> are expressed as percentages, for example, the threshold level <b>17</b> may also be expressed as a percentage, at and/or above which the compared copies <b>14</b> may be considered to be equal in relationship between their video and audio streams.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">If the similarity scores <b>18</b> for signatures <b>16</b> of a copy <b>14</b> meet and/or exceed the threshold level <b>17</b> for synchronization verification with signatures <b>16</b> of each of the others of the plurality of copies <b>14</b>, then such copies <b>14</b> are determined to constitute a group of copies <b>14</b> that are equal in relationship between their video and audio streams. All copies <b>14</b> within the group determined to be equal in relationship should have similarity scores within a tight tolerance. Any copy for which there is a variance outside the tight tolerance, i.e., a copy that is not equal in relationship with all the other copies of the group, is not included in the group. Then at step <b>48</b>, a verification, for example, a manual verification, of the synchronization of the group of copies <b>14</b> determined to be equal in relationship between their video and audio streams may be performed by choosing a single copy <b>14</b> from the group for verification. The chosen copy <b>14</b> may then be manually verified for media content synchronization by a person testing synchronization who views and listens to the chosen copy <b>14</b> to verify the synchronization. Alternatively, other methods of verification of media content synchronization of the chosen copy <b>14</b> may be used. If the chosen copy <b>14</b> is verified as having good synchronization, then at step <b>50</b>, the group of copies <b>14</b> that have previously been determined to be equal in relationship between their video and audio streams to the chosen copy <b>14</b> may be determined to be acceptable for distribution to end users.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">On the other hand, if the similarity scores <b>18</b> for signatures <b>16</b> of a copy <b>14</b> do not meet the threshold level <b>17</b> for synchronization verification with signatures <b>16</b> of at least one of the others of the plurality of copies <b>14</b>, then at step <b>49</b>, the copy <b>14</b> may undergo processing to fix the synchronization errors, or the copy <b>14</b> may be discarded and a new copy created, which is to be verified for media content synchronization.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Alternatively, a combined score may be generated based on the individual scores of the individual signature comparisons, which combined score may be compared to a threshold. Alternatively, a single pair of signatures may be compared to produce a single score compared to a threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">According to the example embodiments of the present invention, verification of media content synchronization may be completed faster than real-time. For example, the generation of fingerprints and/or signatures of the plurality of copies may be completed faster than real-time by sampling segments of the plurality of copies. Further, the comparison of the signatures of the plurality of copies is performed based on the signatures stored as files in a database, for example. Thus, the comparison may also be performed faster than real-time, since it is again not necessary to linearly output in real-time any of the plurality of copies in order to perform the comparison.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Moreover, by the use of similarity scores based on a comparison between signatures and by the use of a threshold level for such similarity scores, a consistent and objective level of verification of media content synchronization may be provided that is not dependent on outside factors such as human error, fatigue, stress and others. Therefore, a consistent end user experience may be ensured by eliminating the high number of variables associated with manual verification of synchronization performed by humans, as described above. The threshold level with which the system is programmed, and which is applied to the plurality of copies of a program may be set to provide an improved end user experience, and/or reduce the number of false negatives, i.e., programs that, although rejected as having synchronization errors, are actually acceptable because the errors are not ascertainable by end users. Further, since no test signals or data are added to the video and/or audio streams of the plurality of copies, there is no additional risk of detrimentally affecting the end user experience by the transmission of such added test signals or data to end users.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the generation of the fingerprints and signatures <b>15</b> of the master program <b>13</b> will be discussed in more detail. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> schematically illustrates a portion of a video stream <b>13</b>V and a portion of an audio stream <b>13</b>A of the master program <b>13</b>.

Each of the video stream <b>13</b>V and the audio stream <b>13</b>A of the master program <b>13</b> is sampled during sequential time segments Ta, Tb, Tc, . . . , Tn. For each time segment, a video fingerprint and an audio fingerprint, a, b, c, . . . , n, may be generated. For example, for a time segment Ta, a video fingerprint a and an audio fingerprint a may be generated; for a time segment Tb, a video fingerprint b and an audio fingerprint b may be generated; etc. Further, for each pair of video and audio fingerprints in a single time segment, a signature may be generated. Thus, for example, for a time segment Ta, a signature <b>15</b><i>a </i>may be generated from the combination of the video fingerprint a and the audio fingerprint a; for a time segment Tb, a signature <b>15</b><i>b </i>may be generated from the combination of the video fingerprint b and the audio fingerprint b; etc. Each of the signatures <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, <b>15</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>15</b><i>n </i>may be stored in the database <b>12</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, similar to the above discussion with respect to the generation of fingerprints and signatures <b>15</b> of the master program <b>13</b>, the generation of the fingerprints and signatures <b>16</b> of the copy <b>14</b> will be discussed in more detail. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> schematically illustrates a portion of a video stream <b>14</b>V and a portion of an audio stream <b>14</b>A of the copy <b>14</b>.
