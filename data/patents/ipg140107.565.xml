<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Computer microprocessors are increasingly characterized by the existence of multiple silicon dies within a single package. This design makes possible certain performance gains, space savings, and other advantages. Yet multi-core architectures require strict power management in order to achieve good performance per watt. Currently, voltage regulator elements are typically placed on the mother board and a series of decoupling capacitors supply the power until the voltage regulator is able to respond, but this approach is already seen as being unable to provide appropriate power management in future processor technology generations. Some strategies to enable fine-grain power management and to decrease mother board- and package-associated parasitics involve placing the voltage regulator closer to the load, such as by integrating the voltage regulator into the substrate. An important step toward integrated voltage regulators is the construction of high-inductance, small-footprint inductors.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one embodiment of the invention, a method of manufacturing an inductor for a microelectronic device comprises providing a substrate, forming a first plurality of inductor windings over the substrate, forming a magnetic inductor core over the first plurality of inductor windings, and forming a second plurality of inductor windings over the magnetic inductor core. In another embodiment, the method comprises forming the inductor on a sacrificial substrate such that the inductor can subsequently be mounted onto a carrier tape. In yet another embodiment, a method of manufacturing a substrate for a microelectronic device comprises forming an inductor within a build-up layer of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Accordingly, embodiments of the invention permit the integration of high density inductors onto a package substrate, a capability that does not currently exist. Additionally, embodiments of the invention enable the formation of inductors having high inductances and high quality factors with small footprints, for example by the integration of a magnetic core, and provide a process flow for such formation in a high volume manufacturing environment. As suggested above, embodiments of the invention allow for both embedded and discrete inductor manufacturing.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a package substrate <b>100</b> for a microelectronic device according to an embodiment of the invention. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, package substrate <b>100</b> comprises a build-up layer <b>101</b>, a plurality of inductor windings <b>111</b> in build-up layer <b>101</b>, a magnetic inductor core <b>112</b> over plurality of inductor windings <b>111</b>, a plurality of inductor windings <b>113</b> over magnetic inductor core <b>112</b>, and a top layer <b>120</b> over build-up layer <b>101</b>. Package substrate <b>100</b> further comprises an electrically insulating layer <b>114</b> between magnetic inductor core <b>112</b> and inductor windings <b>111</b> and <b>113</b>. Inductor windings <b>111</b>, magnetic inductor core <b>112</b>, inductor windings <b>113</b>, and electrically insulating layer <b>114</b>, taken together, form an inductor <b>110</b> embedded in package substrate <b>100</b> (within build-up layer <b>101</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the illustrated embodiment, package substrate <b>100</b> further comprises a core <b>130</b> containing a plated through hole (PTH) <b>131</b>, an additional die-side build-up layer <b>102</b> (build-up layer <b>101</b> is also a die-side build-up layer), socket-side build-up layers <b>103</b> and <b>104</b>, and an electrically conductive pathway <b>140</b> that includes a solder bump <b>141</b>, conductive traces <b>142</b>, and vias <b>143</b>. (Only some of the conductive traces and vias are labeled with reference numerals in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.) Notwithstanding the presence of a core in the illustrated package substrate, it should be understood that alternative (non-illustrated) package substrates according to other embodiments of the invention may have no core, and that embodiments of the invention encompass all packaging substrates of whatever kind.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It should be noted that inductor <b>110</b> could alternatively be located within any of build-up layers <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, and <b>104</b>, rather than in build-up layer <b>101</b> where it is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, or within any of additional, non-illustrated, build-up layers that may exist in package substrate <b>100</b> or other substrates according to embodiments of the invention. Furthermore, one or more other inductors in addition to inductor <b>110</b> may also be embedded in package substrate <b>100</b>, and these may be located in any of the illustrated or non-illustrated build-up layers. Build-up layer <b>103</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts one such additional inductor (not labeled with a reference numeral).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As an example, build-up layer <b>101</b> can comprise a dielectric material&#x2014;possibly a low-k dielectric material such as silicon dioxide doped with fluorine or carbon, porous silicon dioxide, or the like. Organic dielectric materials such as polymer-based epoxies and the like are also possibilities for build-up layer <b>101</b>, and are perhaps more typical of current technologies. As used herein, references to a &#x201c;low-k dielectric material&#x201d; (or a material described using similar terminology) are references to a material having a dielectric constant that is no greater than approximately 3.5 (the dielectric constant of unaltered silicon dioxide is approximately 4.0-4.2) and in some cases as low as 2.0 or even lower. It should be understood, however, that (as alluded to above) build-up layer <b>101</b> need not necessarily be a low-k material but need only be an electrical insulating material, of whatever kind As another example, the additional build-up layers of package substrate <b>100</b>, including build-up layers <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, and <b>104</b>, can be similar to build-up layer <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As another example, inductor windings <b>111</b> and <b>113</b> can comprise electrically conductive lines made of copper or the like, while top layer <b>120</b> can comprise a surface resist layer or the like. As yet another example, magnetic inductor core <b>112</b> can comprise a magnetic material such as iron or the like, or it can comprise a nano-composite ink containing a plurality of magnetic particles such as iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), Co&#x2014;Co oxide, ferrites of various kinds, or the like. In one embodiment, each one of the magnetic particles has a largest dimension of less than approximately 1 micron.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cutaway perspective view of an inductor <b>200</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective view of inductor <b>200</b> according to an embodiment of the invention. As an example, inductor <b>200</b> can be similar to inductor <b>110</b> that is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, inductor <b>200</b> comprises lower inductor windings <b>211</b>, a magnetic inductor core <b>212</b>, and upper inductor windings <b>213</b>. As an example, lower inductor windings <b>211</b>, magnetic inductor core <b>212</b>, and upper inductor windings <b>213</b> can be similar to, respectively, plurality of inductor windings <b>111</b>, magnetic inductor core <b>112</b>, and plurality of inductor windings <b>113</b>, all of which are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">It should be noted that lower inductor windings <b>211</b> and upper inductor windings <b>213</b> are connected to each other such that they form a continuous inductor coil around magnetic inductor core <b>212</b>. Contiguous pairs of inductor windings&#x2014;one lower inductor winding paired with one upper inductor winding&#x2014;will be referred to herein as a &#x201c;winding turn.&#x201d; The continuous inductor coil mentioned above may thus be thought of as being made of up one or more winding turns. One reason the upper and lower inductor windings are referred to separately, with individual reference numerals, is that they may be formed and handled separately, as will be further described below.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the illustrated embodiment, inductor <b>200</b> further comprises an electrically insulating layer <b>220</b> located between magnetic inductor core <b>212</b> and the inductor coil. (As suggested above, the (unlabeled) inductor coil is made up of all or at least substantially all of the winding turns, i.e., all of the upper and lower inductor windings.) In one embodiment, electrically insulating layer <b>220</b> comprises a first electrically insulating material (not labeled with a separate reference numeral in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) between lower inductor windings <b>211</b> and magnetic inductor core <b>212</b> and a second electrically insulating material (also not labeled with a separate reference numeral in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) between magnetic inductor core <b>212</b> and upper inductor windings <b>213</b>. Electrically insulating layer <b>220</b> is necessary only when magnetic inductor core <b>212</b> is made of an electrically conductive magnetic material, such as permalloy or other plateable magnetic alloys containing Fe, nickel (Ni), or Co as the main magnetic element (as opposed to an electrically insulating magnetic material such as doped iron oxides and the like), and may thus be omitted from embodiments having no electrically conductive magnetic inductor core. As an example, electrically insulating layer <b>220</b> can be a photoresist that can be spun, sprayed, printed, or laminated on the surface of magnetic inductor core <b>212</b>. As another example, electrically insulating layer <b>220</b> could be an inorganic dielectric material such as silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>). (In the latter example, the inorganic dielectric may require additional patterning for selective removal.) As another example, the first electrically insulating material and second electrically insulating material may each have a thickness no greater than approximately 10 microns. It should be noted here that electrically insulating layer <b>114</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) can be similar to electrically insulating layer <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one embodiment, magnetic inductor core <b>212</b> has a width between approximately 5 micrometers (hereinafter &#x201c;microns&#x201d; or &#x3bc;m) and approximately 140 microns, a height between approximately 2 microns and approximately 140 microns, and a diameter or other thickness as great as approximately 20 microns. In the same or another embodiment, and referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each inductor winding has a width <b>310</b> of between approximately 5 microns and approximately 50 microns, with gaps between windings having a width <b>320</b> of between approximately 5 microns and approximately 50 microns. It should be noted that at least in certain embodiments it is desirable to make width <b>320</b> as small as possible&#x2014;e.g., as small as the lithography process will allow&#x2014;because doing so increases the inductance per unit length of inductor <b>200</b> and also decreases losses for a given frequency range.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the same or another embodiment, inductor <b>200</b> can comprise between approximately 3 and approximately 30 windings for a total length <b>330</b> (in the given embodiment) of between approximately 40 microns and approximately 3200 microns. The number of windings may depend on, among other things, the required inductance of a particular voltage regulator design, the space available, and the maximum resistance that can be allowed. A width <b>340</b> of inductor <b>200</b> may be between approximately 10 microns and approximately 150 microns. The proposed variations of the trace line thicknesses, widths, spacing, and other parameters may allow the resistance value of the coil to be adjusted in order to achieve the range needed for a variety of applications.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> illustrate examples of what are referred to herein as &#x201c;open-loop&#x201d; inductors: inductors having an open-ended magnetic inductor core. A solenoid-type inductor is an example of an open-loop inductor. Also contemplated according to various embodiments of the invention are what are referred to herein as &#x201c;closed-loop&#x201d; inductors: inductors having a magnetic inductor core that closes back on itself to form a continuous ring, loop, or other closed path. One example of a closed-loop inductor is a toroid inductor such as that shown in perspective view according to an embodiment of the invention in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an inductor <b>400</b> comprises lower inductor windings <b>411</b>, a magnetic inductor core <b>412</b>, upper inductor windings <b>413</b>, and an electrically insulating layer <b>420</b> located between magnetic inductor core <b>412</b> and lower and upper inductor windings <b>411</b> and <b>413</b> (i.e., the inductor coil). As an example, inductor <b>400</b> can be similar to inductor <b>110</b> that is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As another example, lower inductor windings <b>411</b>, magnetic inductor core <b>412</b>, and upper inductor windings <b>413</b> can be similar to, respectively, plurality of inductor windings <b>111</b>, magnetic inductor core <b>112</b>, and plurality of inductor windings <b>113</b>, all of which are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As another example, electrically insulating layer <b>420</b> can be similar to electrically insulating layer <b>220</b> that is first shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As illustrated, magnetic inductor core <b>412</b> of inductor <b>400</b> is a closed-loop magnetic inductor core having a substantially circular (toroidal) shape with a diameter <b>430</b> of between approximately 30 microns and approximately 900 microns. It should be noted that a toroid shape gives a higher inductance than a solenoid shape for the same number of windings.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method <b>500</b> of manufacturing an inductor for a microelectronic device according to an embodiment of the invention. A step <b>510</b> of method <b>500</b> is to provide a substrate. This substrate can be anything that may serve as a bottom or foundation layer for the inductor, including, for example, a core, a build-up layer (either die-side and socket side), or a top surface of a finished package substrate, or the like. It may be seen that with the former two of the listed options the inductor would be an embedded inductor, while with the latter listed option it would be a surface-mounted inductor. As an example, the substrate can be similar to build-up layer <b>101</b> that is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As another example, the substrate can be similar to a substrate <b>610</b> first shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, which is a cross-sectional view of a structure <b>600</b> at a particular point in its manufacturing process according to an embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A step <b>520</b> of method <b>500</b> is to form a first plurality of inductor windings over the substrate. As an example, the first plurality of inductor windings can be similar to inductor windings <b>111</b> that are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As another example, the first plurality of inductor windings can be similar to inductor windings <b>620</b> that are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Inductor windings <b>620</b> are also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, which is a top view of structure <b>600</b> according to an embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one embodiment, step <b>520</b> comprises depositing a metallic seed layer on the substrate, patterning the metallic seed layer in order to define a plating region on the metallic seed layer, and plating an electrically conductive material onto the metallic seed layer such that the electrically conductive material is located only in the plating region. As an example, the metallic seed layer could be made of, among other things, copper, titanium-copper, tungsten, titanium, tungsten-copper, or the like. Tungsten and titanium, for example, adhere well to many surfaces. As another example, the metallic seed layer can be similar to a metallic seed layer <b>630</b> that is first shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. As another example, the metallic seed layer can be patterned, and the plating region defined, using a photoresist <b>640</b> that is also first shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A step <b>530</b> of method <b>500</b> is to form a magnetic inductor core over the first plurality of inductor windings. As an example, the magnetic inductor core can be similar to magnetic inductor core <b>112</b> that is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As another example, the magnetic inductor core can be similar to a magnetic inductor core <b>810</b> that is first shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, which is a cross-sectional view of structure <b>600</b> at a different point in its manufacturing process according to an embodiment of the invention. Magnetic inductor core <b>810</b> is also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, which is a top view of structure <b>600</b> according to an embodiment of the invention at the same point in the manufacturing process of structure <b>600</b> that is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one embodiment, step <b>530</b> comprises depositing a magnetic material, patterning the magnetic material in order to define a core region, and shaping the magnetic material such that it is confined to the core region. As an example, the magnetic material may be deposited by sputtering, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), evaporation, radio frequency (RF)-sputtering, atomic layer deposition (ALD), soft chemistry methods such as sol-gel, chemical reduction, and oxide co-precipitation, or the like. In one embodiment, patterning the magnetic material comprises depositing a photoresist mask on the magnetic material and thermally treating the photoresist mask such that the photoresist mask assumes a rounded shape. In another embodiment, patterning the magnetic material comprises depositing a photoresist mask on the magnetic material using an ink-jet spraying procedure to deposit the photoresist mask with a rounded shape. In either embodiment, or in other embodiments, shaping the magnetic material can comprise conformally etching the magnetic material such that the magnetic material also assumes a rounded shape. As an example, this rounded shape can exist at both hemispheres of the magnetic inductor core, such that the magnetic inductor core assumes a cylindrical shape, at only a single hemisphere, such that the magnetic inductor core assumes a semi-circular cross section, or at some other portion of the magnetic inductor core.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In another embodiment, step <b>530</b> comprises using an ink-jet spraying procedure to deposit a nano-composite ink over the first plurality of inductor windings and transforming the nano-composite ink into a magnetic material having a rounded shape. The &#x201c;transforming&#x201d; step might include the drying/solidification of nano-composite into a continuous magnetic film and also any tempering/sintering steps necessary for the formation of a ceramic magnetic material. Compared to the embodiment described in the previous paragraph, in which the magnetic inductor core is formed with depositing, patterning, and shaping steps, this latter embodiment tends to be simpler (e.g., does not require vacuum equipment or subsequent patterning steps) and more cost efficient, but tends to produce a slightly lower-quality (lower density) core.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A step <b>540</b> of method <b>500</b> is to form a second plurality of inductor windings over the magnetic inductor core. As an example, the second plurality of inductor windings can be similar to inductor windings <b>113</b> that are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As another example, the second plurality of inductor windings can be similar to inductor windings <b>1010</b> that are first shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, which is a cross-sectional view of structure <b>600</b> at a different point in its manufacturing process according to an embodiment of the invention. Inductor windings <b>1010</b> are also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, which is a top view of structure <b>600</b> according to an embodiment of the invention at the same point in the manufacturing process of structure <b>600</b> that is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one embodiment, step <b>540</b> comprises forming a metallic seed layer, patterning the metallic seed layer in order to define a plating region on the metallic seed layer, and plating an electrically conductive material onto the metallic seed layer such that the electrically conductive material is located only in the plating region.

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In certain embodiments, such as where the magnetic inductor core is electrically conductive, method <b>500</b> further comprises a step <b>550</b>, which is to deposit a first electrically insulating material between the first plurality of inductor windings and the magnetic inductor core and a second electrically insulating material between the magnetic inductor core and the second plurality of inductor windings. As an example, the first electrically insulating material and the second electrically insulating material can each be similar to the electrically insulating materials making up electrically insulating layer <b>220</b>.

Method <b>1400</b> results in an inductor that is embedded within a build-up layer of a substrate, such as the inductor illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A characteristic of this method is that the substrates will have the inductors already placed in them and there would be no need for additional assembly process steps: the inductor manufacturing process steps will be embedded into the manufacture of the substrate build up layers. In various embodiments, the lowest-level and next-lowest-level build-up layers (i.e., the 1F and 2F layers) are particular well suited as the location for such embedded inductors, but depending on factors such as layer count and substrate type the inductor can be embedded into or in-between any of the buildup layers.</p>

Method <b>1500</b> results in an inductor manufactured separately from a substrate (or other final destination) such that the inductor may subsequently be placed at its final destination. A characteristic of method <b>1500</b> is that it would require no changes to existing substrate assembly process flows and thus no added cost in the substrate manufacturing process. Furthermore, the packaging substrate itself would not be exposed to the inductor manufacturing process flow, thus allowing rework due to faulty inductors to take place. Method <b>1500</b> will be discussed in more detail in the paragraphs below, with references to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, which is a cross-sectional view of a structure <b>1600</b> according to an embodiment of the invention at a particular point in a manufacturing process.
