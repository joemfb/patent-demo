<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The gaming system disclosed herein changes the focal point of a display device at different points in time to assist the player in focusing on different simultaneously or concurrently played games at different points in time. Specifically, the gaming system displays a plurality of simultaneously or concurrently played games on a display device. In response to a designated event occurring in association with a specific one of the plurality of simultaneously or concurrently played games, the gaming system changes the focal point of the display device to draw the player's focus or attention to that specific one of the simultaneously or concurrently played games. Put differently, the gaming system dynamically allocates and/or indicates different portions of a display device to different simultaneously or concurrently played games at different points in time to account for different events occurring in such simultaneously or concurrently played games.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains or may contain material which is subject to copyright protection.

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Gaming machines which provide players awards in primary or base games are well known. Gaming machines generally require the player to place or make a wager to activate a primary or base game. Certain known gaming machines enable a player to wager on and play a plurality of primary or base games simultaneously. In many of these gaming machines, the award for each played primary game is based on the player obtaining a winning symbol or symbol combination and on the amount of the wager placed on that primary game (e.g., the higher the wager, the higher the award). Generally, symbols or symbol combinations which are less likely to occur usually provide higher awards.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Gaming machines which provide secondary or bonus games are also known. The secondary or bonus games usually provide an additional award, such as a bonus award, to the player. Secondary or bonus games usually do not require an additional wager by the player to be activated. Instead, secondary or bonus games are generally activated or triggered upon an occurrence of a designated triggering symbol or triggering symbol combination in a primary or base game. For instance, a bonus symbol occurring on the payline on the third reel of a three reel slot machine may trigger a secondary bonus game. When a secondary or bonus game is triggered, the gaming machine generally indicates this triggering to the player through one or more visual and/or audio output devices, such as the reels, lights, speakers, video screens, etc. Part of the enjoyment and excitement of playing certain gaming machines is the occurrence or triggering of the secondary or bonus game (even before the player knows how much the bonus award will be).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Certain known gaming machines display each played primary game and any bonus or secondary games on a primary display. Other known gaming machines display each played primary game on the primary display and any bonus or secondary games on a secondary display. In these known gaming machines, when a plurality of primary games and/or secondary games are simultaneously displayed to the player at one time on one display device, the total amount of information displayed in association with these multiple displayed games confuses certain players. Moreover, because different events may or may not be occurring in the different simultaneously played games at different points in time, certain players are unsure of where to look and worry about missing one or more displayed events in one or more of the displayed games.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, there is a continuing need to provide new and different gaming machines and gaming systems as well as new and different ways to display games including primary games and secondary games.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure relates generally to gaming systems, gaming devices, and methods for displaying multiple concurrent games using dynamic focal points.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In various embodiments, the gaming system, gaming device and method disclosed herein changes the focal point of a display device at different points in time to assist the player in focusing on different simultaneously or concurrently played games at different points in time. Specifically, the gaming system displays a plurality of simultaneously, concurrently or overlapping played games on a display device. In response to a designated event occurring in association with a specific one of the plurality of simultaneously or concurrently played games, the gaming system changes the focal point of the display device to draw the players focus or attention to that specific one of the simultaneously or concurrently played games. Put differently, the gaming system and method disclosed herein dynamically allocates and/or indicates different portions of a display device to different simultaneously or concurrently played games at different points in time to account for different events occurring in such simultaneously or concurrently played games. Such a configuration increases a player's enjoyment and excitement by aiding or otherwise assisting the player in determining which of the plurality of simultaneously or concurrently played games to view or otherwise focus on at different points in time.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, the gaming system concurrently or substantially concurrently displays a plurality of plays of a plurality of games to a player utilizing a display device, such as a primary display device. In one such embodiment, the plurality of displayed games have different game cycle times. For example, one of the displayed games is an individual slot game having a first game cycle of a first amount of time while another of the displayed games is a community card game having a different, second game cycle of a second, different amount of time. Such different game cycle amounts of time provides that different events which require the player's attention are occurring in the different games at different points in time.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The gaming system monitors the plurality of concurrently played games to determine if a display reconfiguration event occurs in association with any of the played games. In one such embodiment, a display reconfiguration event occurs when an input is required by a player in one of the games, such as when the player is required to take an action in a community card game. In another such embodiment, a display reconfiguration event occurs when an outcome is displayed in one of the games, such as when all of a plurality of reels stop spinning to display a symbol combination in an individual slot game.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Upon an occurrence of a display reconfiguration event, the gaming system determines whether the current configuration of how the plurality of concurrently played games are displayed corresponds with the display reconfiguration event which occurred. That is, the gaming system determines whether the current configuration of how the game display area of the display device is utilized to simultaneously display the plurality of games adequately draws the player's focus or attention to the event or events occurring in a specific one of the plurality of games played.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">If the current configuration of how the plurality of concurrently played games are displayed corresponds with the display reconfiguration event which occurred, the gaming system does not modify or alter how any of the plurality of concurrently played games are displayed. For example, if the display reconfiguration event is a display of a symbol combination in a play of a slot game and the current configuration of the display device is already such that the slot game is the focal point of the display device (e.g., the slot game is displayed as a larger game than the other concurrently played games), the gaming system does not modify or alter how the slot game or the other concurrently played games are displayed to the player.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">On the other hand, if the current configuration of how the plurality of concurrently played games are displayed does not correspond with the display reconfiguration event which occurred, the gaming system reconfigures or modifies how one or more of the concurrently displayed games are displayed to the player. In one such embodiment, the gaming system reconfigures or modifies how one or more of the displayed games are displayed to the player by scaling the displayed size of the plurality of concurrently played games. In this embodiment, the gaming system modifies which of such games are allocated a first portion of the game display area (i.e., the available space of the display device) and which of such games are allocated a second, smaller portion of the game display area. For example, if the display reconfiguration event is a need for a player's input in a bonus game triggered in association with a play of a slot game and the current configuration of the display device is that a community card game is the focal point of the display device (e.g., the community card game is displayed as a larger game than the individual slot game, thus drawing the player's attention to the community card game), the gaming system modifies or alters how the concurrently played games are displayed by scaling the slot game and the community card game such that the slot game is displayed as a larger game than the community card game. In this example, such scaling of at least the slot game and the community card game is configured to draw the player's attention to the slot game to focus the player on the required input in the triggered bonus game.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">After reconfiguring or modifying how one or more of the concurrently displayed games are displayed to the player, the gaming system continues monitoring the plurality of concurrently played games for any subsequent display reconfiguration events and proceeds with possibly reconfiguring how such concurrently played games are displayed to the player.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Accordingly, such a gaming system provides that at a first point in time and in response to an event occurring in association with a first one of a plurality of concurrently played games, the gaming system allocates a first portion of a game play area of a display device to the first one of the concurrently played games and allocates a second, different sized portion of the game play area of the display device to a second one of the concurrently played game. Such a gaming system further provides that at a second, subsequent point in time and in response to an event occurring in association with the second one of a plurality of concurrently played games, the gaming system allocates the first portion of the game play area of the display device to the second one of the concurrently played games and allocates the second, different sized portion of the game play area of the display device to the first one of the concurrently played game. This variable allocation of displaying the different games concurrently being played effectively changes the focal point for the player at different points in time. Such different focal points aid or assist the player in focusing on different games in association with different events occurring in such games which reduces the confusion suffered by certain players to increase the amount of enjoyment and excitement of these players.</p>

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one embodiment, the gaming device awards prizes after the reels of the primary game stop spinning if specified types and/or configurations of indicia or symbols occur on an active payline or otherwise occur in a winning pattern, occur on the requisite number of adjacent reels and/or occur in a scatter pay arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In an alternative embodiment, rather than determining any outcome to provide to the player by analyzing the symbols generated on any wagered upon paylines as described above, the gaming device determines any outcome to provide to the player based on the number of associated symbols which are generated in active symbol display positions on the requisite number of adjacent reels (i.e., not on paylines passing through any displayed winning symbol combinations). In this embodiment, if a winning symbol combination is generated on the reels, the gaming device provides the player one award for that occurrence of the generated winning symbol combination. For example, if one winning symbol combination is generated on the reels, the gaming device will provide a single award to the player for that winning symbol combination (i.e., not based on the number of paylines that would have passed through that winning symbol combination). It should be appreciated that because a gaming device that enables wagering on ways to win provides the player one award for a single occurrence of a winning symbol combination and a gaming device with paylines may provide the player more than one award for the same occurrence of a single winning symbol combination (i.e., if a plurality of paylines each pass through the same winning symbol combination), it is possible to provide a player at a ways to win gaming device with more ways to win for an equivalent bet or wager on a traditional slot gaming device with paylines.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In one embodiment, the total number of ways to win is determined by multiplying the number of symbols generated in active symbol display positions on a first reel by the number of symbols generated in active symbol display positions on a second reel by the number of symbols generated in active symbol display positions on a third reel and so on for each reel of the gaming device with at least one symbol generated in an active symbol display position. For example, a three reel gaming device with three symbols generated in active symbol display positions on each reel includes 27 ways to win (i.e., 3 symbols on the first reel&#xd7;3 symbols on the second reel&#xd7;3 symbols on the third reel). A four reel gaming device with three symbols generated in active symbol display positions on each reel includes 81 ways to win (i.e., 3 symbols on the first reel&#xd7;3 symbols on the second reel&#xd7;3 symbols on the third reel&#xd7;3 symbols on the fourth reel). A five reel gaming device with three symbols generated in active symbol display positions on each reel includes 243 ways to win (i.e., 3 symbols on the first reel&#xd7;3 symbols on the second reel&#xd7;3 symbols on the third reel&#xd7;3 symbols on the fourth reel&#xd7;3 symbols on the fifth reel). It should be appreciated that modifying the number of generated symbols by either modifying the number of reels or modifying the number of symbols generated in active symbol display positions by one or more of the reels modifies the number of ways to win.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In another embodiment, the gaming device enables a player to wager on and thus activate symbol display positions. In one such embodiment, the symbol display positions are on the reels. In this embodiment, if based on the player's wager, a reel is activated, then each of the symbol display positions of that reel will be activated and each of the active symbol display positions will be part of one or more of the ways to win. In one embodiment, if based on the player's wager, a reel is not activated, then a designated number of default symbol display positions, such as a single symbol display position of the middle row of the reel, will be activated and the default symbol display position(s) will be part of one or more of the ways to win. This type of gaming machine enables a player to wager on one, more than one or all of the reels and the processor of the gaming device uses the number of wagered on reels to determine the active symbol display positions and the number of possible ways to win. In alternative embodiments, (1) no symbols are displayed as generated at any of the inactive symbol display positions, or (2) any symbols generated at any inactive symbol display positions may be displayed to the player but suitably shaded or otherwise designated as inactive.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In one embodiment wherein a player wagers on one or more reels, a player's wager of one credit may activate each of the three symbol display positions on a first reel, wherein one default symbol display position is activated on each of the remaining four reels. In this example, as described above, the gaming device provides the player three ways to win (i.e., 3 symbols on the first reel&#xd7;1 symbol on the second reel&#xd7;1 symbol on the third reel&#xd7;1 symbol on the fourth reel&#xd7;1 symbol on the fifth reel). In another example, a player's wager of nine credits may activate each of the three symbol display positions on a first reel, each of the three symbol display positions on a second reel and each of the three symbol display positions on a third reel wherein one default symbol display position is activated on each of the remaining two reels. In this example, as described above, the gaming device provides the player twenty-seven ways to win (i.e., 3 symbols on the first reel&#xd7;3 symbols on the second reel&#xd7;3 symbols on the third reel&#xd7;1 symbol on the fourth reel&#xd7;1 symbol on the fifth reel).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In one embodiment, to determine any award(s) to provide to the player based on the generated symbols, the gaming device individually determines if a symbol generated in an active symbol display position on a first reel forms part of a winning symbol combination with or is otherwise suitably related to a symbol generated in an active symbol display position on a second reel. In this embodiment, the gaming device classifies each pair of symbols which form part of a winning symbol combination (i.e., each pair of related symbols) as a string of related symbols. For example, if active symbol display positions include a first cherry symbol generated in the top row of a first reel and a second cherry symbol generated in the bottom row of a second reel, the gaming device classifies the two cherry symbols as a string of related symbols because the two cherry symbols form part of a winning symbol combination.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">After determining if any strings of related symbols are formed between the symbols on the first reel and the symbols on the second reel, the gaming device determines if any of the symbols from the next adjacent reel should be added to any of the formed strings of related symbols. In this embodiment, for a first of the classified strings of related symbols, the gaming device determines if any of the symbols generated by the next adjacent reel form part of a winning symbol combination or are otherwise related to the symbols of the first string of related symbols. If the gaming device determines that a symbol generated on the next adjacent reel is related to the symbols of the first string of related symbols, that symbol is subsequently added to the first string of related symbols. For example, if the first string of related symbols is the string of related cherry symbols and a related cherry symbol is generated in the middle row of the third reel, the gaming device adds the related cherry symbol generated on the third reel to the previously classified string of cherry symbols.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">On the other hand, if the gaming device determines that no symbols generated on the next adjacent reel are related to the symbols of the first string of related symbols, the gaming device marks or flags such string of related symbols as complete. For example, if the first string of related symbols is the string of related cherry symbols and none of the symbols of the third reel are related to the cherry symbols of the previously classified string of cherry symbols, the gaming device marks or flags the string of two cherry symbols as complete.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">After either adding a related symbol to the first string of related symbols or marking the first string of related symbols as complete, the gaming device proceeds as described above for each of the remaining classified strings of related symbols which were previously classified or formed from related symbols on the first and second reels.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">After analyzing each of the remaining strings of related symbols, the gaming device determines, for each remaining pending or incomplete string of related symbols, if any of the symbols from the next adjacent reel, if any, should be added to any of the previously classified strings of related symbols. This process continues until either each string of related symbols is complete or there are no more adjacent reels of symbols to analyze. In this embodiment, where there are no more adjacent reels of symbols to analyze, the gaming device marks each of the remaining pending strings of related symbols as complete.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">When each of the strings of related symbols is marked complete, the gaming device compares each of the strings of related symbols to an appropriate paytable and provides the player any award associated with each of the completed strings of symbols. It should be appreciated that the player is provided one award, if any, for each string of related symbols generated in active symbol display positions (i.e., as opposed to a quantity of awards being based on how many paylines that would have passed through each of the strings of related symbols in active symbol display positions).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In one embodiment, a base or primary game may be a poker game wherein the gaming device enables the player to play a conventional game of video draw poker and initially deals five cards all face up from a virtual deck of fifty-two cards. Cards may be dealt as in a traditional game of cards or in the case of the gaming device, the cards may be randomly selected from a predetermined number of cards. If the player wishes to draw, the player selects the cards to hold via one or more input devices, such as by pressing related hold buttons or via the touch screen. The player then presses the deal button and the unwanted or discarded cards are removed from the display and the gaming machine deals the replacement cards from the remaining cards in the deck. This results in a final five-card hand. The gaming device compares the final five-card hand to a payout table which utilizes conventional poker hand rankings to determine the winning hands. The gaming device provides the player with an award based on a winning hand and the number of credits the player wagered.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In another embodiment, the base or primary game may be a multi-hand version of video poker. In this embodiment, the gaming device deals the player at least two hands of cards. In one such embodiment, the cards are the same cards. In one embodiment each hand of cards is associated with its own deck of cards. The player chooses the cards to hold in a primary hand. The held cards in the primary hand are also held in the other hands of cards. The remaining non-held cards are removed from each hand displayed and for each hand replacement cards are randomly dealt into that hand. Since the replacement cards are randomly dealt independently for each hand, the replacement cards for each hand will usually be different. The poker hand rankings are then determined hand by hand against a payout table and awards are provided to the player.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In one embodiment, a base or primary game may be a keno game wherein the gaming device displays a plurality of selectable indicia or numbers on at least one of the display devices. In this embodiment, the player selects at least one bit potentially a plurality of the selectable indicia or numbers via an input device such as a touch screen. The gaming device then displays a series of drawn numbers and determine an amount of matches, if any, between the player's selected numbers and the gaming device's drawn numbers. The player is provided an award based on the amount of matches, if any, based on the amount of determined matches and the number of numbers drawn.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In one embodiment, in addition to winning credits or other awards in a base or primary game, the gaming device may also give players the opportunity to win credits in a bonus or secondary game or in a bonus or secondary round. In one embodiment, the disclosed multi-dimensional cascading symbol game is implemented as a bonus or secondary game. The bonus or secondary game enables the player to obtain a prize or payout in addition to the prize or payout, if any, obtained from the base or primary game. In general, a bonus or secondary game produces a significantly higher level of player excitement than the base or primary game because it provides a greater expectation of winning than the base or primary game, and is accompanied with more attractive or unusual features than the base or primary game. In one embodiment, the bonus or secondary game may be any type of suitable game, either similar to or completely different from the base or primary game.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In one embodiment, the triggering event or qualifying condition may be a selected outcome in the primary game or a particular arrangement of one or more indicia on a display device in the primary game, such as the number seven appearing on three adjacent reels along a payline in the primary slot game embodiment seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>. In other embodiments, the triggering event or qualifying condition occurs based on exceeding a certain amount of game play (such as number of games, number of credits, amount of time), or reaching a specified number of points earned during game play.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In another embodiment, the gaming device processor <b>12</b> or central controller <b>56</b> randomly provides the player one or more plays of one or more secondary games. In one such embodiment, the gaming device does not provide any apparent reason to the player for qualifying to play a secondary or bonus game. In this embodiment, qualifying for a bonus game is not triggered by an event in or based specifically on any of the plays of any primary game. That is, the gaming device may simply qualify a player to play a secondary game without any explanation or alternatively with simple explanations. In another embodiment, the gaming device (or central server) qualifies a player for a secondary game at least partially based on a game triggered or symbol triggered event, such as at least partially based on the play of a primary game.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In one embodiment, the gaming device includes a program which will automatically begin a bonus round after the player has achieved a triggering event or qualifying condition in the base or primary game. In another embodiment, after a player has qualified for a bonus game, the player may subsequently enhance his/her bonus game participation through continued play on the base or primary game. Thus, for each bonus qualifying event, such as a bonus symbol, that the player obtains, a given number of bonus game wagering points or credits may be accumulated in a &#x201c;bonus meter&#x201d; programmed to accrue the bonus wagering credits or entries toward eventual participation in a bonus game. The occurrence of multiple such bonus qualifying events in the primary game may result in an arithmetic or exponential increase in the number of bonus wagering credits awarded. In one embodiment, the player may redeem extra bonus wagering credits during the bonus game to extend play of the bonus game.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In one embodiment, no separate entry fee or buy-in for a bonus game is needed. That is, a player may not purchase entry into a bonus game; rather they must win or earn entry through play of the primary game, thus encouraging play of the primary game. In another embodiment, qualification of the bonus or secondary game is accomplished through a simple &#x201c;buy-in&#x201d; by the player&#x2014;for example, if the player has been unsuccessful at qualifying through other specified activities. In another embodiment, the player must make a separate side-wager on the bonus game or wager a designated amount in the primary game to qualify for the secondary game. In this embodiment, the secondary game triggering event must occur and the side-wager (or designated primary game wager amount) must have been placed to trigger the secondary game.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In one embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, one or more of the gaming devices <b>10</b> are in communication with each other and/or at least one central controller <b>56</b> through a data network or remote communication link <b>58</b>.

It should be further appreciated that one, more or each of the functions of one or more gaming device processors as disclosed herein may be performed by the central controller, central server or remote host.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In one embodiment, the game outcome provided to the player is determined by a central server or controller and provided to the player at the gaming device. In this embodiment, each of a plurality of such gaming devices are in communication with the central server or controller. Upon a player initiating game play at one of the gaming devices, the initiated gaming device communicates a game outcome request to the central server or controller.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In one embodiment, the central server or controller receives the game outcome request and randomly generates a game outcome for the primary game based on probability data. In another embodiment, the central server or controller randomly generates a game outcome for the secondary game based on probability data. In another embodiment, the central server or controller randomly generates a game outcome for both the primary game and the secondary game based on probability data. In this embodiment, the central server or controller is capable of storing and utilizing program code or other data similar to the processor and memory device of the gaming device.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In an alternative embodiment, the central server or controller maintains one or more predetermined pools or sets of predetermined game outcomes. In this embodiment, the central server or controller receives the game outcome request and independently selects a predetermined game outcome from a set or pool of game outcomes. The central server or controller flags or marks the selected game outcome as used. Once a game outcome is flagged as used, it is prevented from further selection from the set or pool and cannot be selected by the central controller or server upon another wager. The provided game outcome can include a primary game outcome, a secondary game outcome, primary and secondary game outcomes, or a series of game outcomes such as free games.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The central server or controller communicates the generated or selected game outcome to the initiated gaming device. The gaming device receives the generated or selected game outcome and provides the game outcome to the player. In an alternative embodiment, how the generated or selected game outcome is to be presented or displayed to the player, such as a reel symbol combination of a slot machine or a hand of cards dealt in a card game, is also determined by the central server or controller and communicated to the initiated gaming device to be presented or displayed to the player. Central production or control can assist a gaming establishment or other entity in maintaining appropriate records, controlling gaming, reducing and preventing cheating or electronic or other errors, reducing or eliminating win-loss volatility, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In another embodiment, a predetermined game outcome value is determined for each of a plurality of linked or networked gaming devices based on the results of a bingo, keno, or lottery game. In this embodiment, each individual gaming device utilizes one or more bingo, keno, or lottery games to determine the predetermined game outcome value provided to the player for the interactive game played at that gaming device. In one embodiment, the bingo, keno, or lottery game is displayed to the player. In another embodiment, the bingo, keno or lottery game is not displayed to the player, but the results of the bingo, keno, or lottery game determine the predetermined game outcome value for the primary or secondary game.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the various bingo embodiments, as each gaming device is enrolled in the bingo game, such as upon an appropriate wager or engaging an input device, the enrolled gaming device is provided or associated with a different bingo card. Each bingo card consists of a matrix or array of elements, wherein each element is designated with a separate indicia, such as a number. It should be appreciated that each different bingo card includes a different combination of elements. For example, if four bingo cards are provided to four enrolled gaming devices, the same element may be present on all four of the bingo cards while another element may solely be present on one of the bingo cards.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In operation of these embodiments, upon providing or associating a different bingo card with each of a plurality of enrolled gaming devices, the central controller randomly selects or draws, one at a time, a plurality of the elements. As each element is selected, a determination is made for each gaming device as to whether the selected element is present on the bingo card provided to that enrolled gaming device. This determination can be made by the central controller, the gaming device, a combination of the two, or in any other suitable manner. If the selected element is present on the bingo card provided to that enrolled gaming device, that selected element on the provided bingo card is marked or flagged. This process of selecting elements and marking any selected elements on the provided bingo cards continues until one or more predetermined patterns are marked on one or more of the provided bingo cards. It should be appreciated that in one embodiment, the gaming device requires the player to engage a daub button (not shown) to initiate the process of the gaming device marking or flagging any selected elements.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">After one or more predetermined patterns are marked on one or more of the provided bingo cards, a game outcome is determined for each of the enrolled gaming devices based, at least in part, on the selected elements on the provided bingo cards. As described above, the game outcome determined for each gaming device enrolled in the bingo game is utilized by that gaming device to determine the predetermined game outcome provided to the player. For example, a first gaming device to have selected elements marked in a predetermined pattern is provided a first outcome of win $10 which will be provided to a first player regardless of how the first player plays in a first game, and a second gaming device to have selected elements marked in a different predetermined pattern is provided a second outcome of win $2 which will be provided to a second player regardless of how the second player plays a second game. It should be appreciated that as the process of marking selected elements continues until one or more predetermined patterns are marked, this embodiment ensures that at least one bingo card will win the bingo game and thus at least one enrolled gaming device will provide a predetermined winning game outcome to a player. It should be appreciated that other suitable methods for selecting or determining one or more predetermined game outcomes may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In one example of the above-described embodiment, the predetermined game outcome may be based on a supplemental award in addition to any award provided for winning the bingo game as described above. In this embodiment, if one or more elements are marked in supplemental patterns within a designated number of drawn elements, a supplemental or intermittent award or value associated with the marked supplemental pattern is provided to the player as part of the predetermined game outcome. For example, if the four corners of a bingo card are marked within the first twenty selected elements, a supplemental award of $10 is provided to the player as part of the predetermined game outcome. It should be appreciated that in this embodiment, the player of a gaming device may be provided a supplemental or intermittent award regardless of whether the enrolled gaming device's provided bingo card wins or does not win the bingo game as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In another embodiment, one or more of the gaming devices are in communication with a central server or controller for monitoring purposes only.

In another embodiment, a central server (or the progressive gaming system host site computer) determines when a progressive award win is triggered. In another embodiment, an individual gaming machine and a central controller (or progressive gaming system host site computer) work in conjunction with each other to determine when a progressive win is triggered, for example through an individual gaming machine meeting a predetermined requirement established by the central controller.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In one embodiment, a progressive award win is triggered based on one or more game play events, such as a symbol-driven trigger. In other embodiments, the progressive award triggering event or qualifying condition may be achieved by exceeding a certain amount of game play (such as number of games, number of credits, or amount of time), or reaching a specified number of points earned during game play. In another embodiment, a gaming device is randomly or apparently randomly selected to provide a player of that gaming device one or more progressive awards. In one such embodiment, the gaming device does not provide any apparent reasons to the player for winning a progressive award, wherein winning the progressive award is not triggered by an event in or based specifically on any of the plays of any primary game. That is, a player is provided a progressive award without any explanation or alternatively with simple explanations. In another embodiment, a player is provided a progressive award at least partially based on a game triggered or symbol triggered event, such as at least partially based on the play of a primary game.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In one embodiment, one or more of the progressive awards are each funded via a side bet or side wager. In this embodiment, a player must place or wager a side bet to be eligible to win the progressive award associated with the side bet. In one embodiment, the player must place the maximum bet and the side bet to be eligible to win one of the progressive awards. In another embodiment, if the player places or wagers the required side bet, the player may wager at any credit amount during the primary game (i.e., the player need not place the maximum bet and the side bet to be eligible to win one of the progressive awards). In one such embodiment, the greater the player's wager (in addition to the placed side bet), the greater the odds or probability that the player will win one of the progressive awards. It should be appreciated that one or more of the progressive awards may each be funded, at least in part, based on the wagers placed on the primary games of the gaming machines in the gaming system, via a gaming establishment or via any suitable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In another embodiment, one or more of the progressive awards are partially funded via a side-bet or side-wager which the player may make (and which may be tracked via a side-bet meter). In one embodiment, one or more of the progressive awards are funded with only side-bets or side-wagers placed. In another embodiment, one or more of the progressive awards are funded based on player's wagers as described above as well as any side-bets or side-wagers placed.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In one alternative embodiment, a minimum wager level is required for a gaming device to qualify to be selected to obtain one of the progressive awards. In one embodiment, this minimum wager level is the maximum wager level for the primary game in the gaming machine. In another embodiment, no minimum wager level is required for a gaming machine to qualify to be selected to obtain one of the progressive awards.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In another embodiment, a plurality of players at a plurality of linked gaming devices in a gaming system participate in a group gaming environment. In one embodiment, for a group or community cooperation game, a plurality of players at a plurality of linked gaming devices work in conjunction with one another, such as by playing together as a team or group, to win one or more awards. In one such embodiment, any award won by the group is shared, either equally or based on any suitable criteria, amongst the different players of the group. In another embodiment, for a group or community competition game, a plurality of players at a plurality of linked gaming devices compete against one another for one or more awards. In one such embodiment, a plurality of players at a plurality of linked gaming devices participate in a gaming tournament for one or more awards. In another embodiment, a plurality of players at a plurality of linked gaming devices play for one or more awards wherein an outcome generated by one gaming device affects the outcomes generated by one or more linked gaming devices.</p>

<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a flowchart of an example embodiment of a process for operating a gaming system, a gaming server or a gaming device disclosed herein is illustrated. In one embodiment, this process is embodied in one or more software programs stored in one or more memories and executed by one or more processors or one or more servers. Although this process is described with reference to the flowchart illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it should be appreciated that many other methods of performing the acts associated with this process may be used. For example, the order of certain steps described may be changed, or certain steps described may be optional.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In various embodiments, after initiating a plurality of games for the player to simultaneously play or participate in, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the gaming system and method disclosed herein causes a display device to display a first configuration of the plurality of simultaneously played games as indicated in block <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In one embodiment, the first configuration of the plurality of games displayed to the player includes causing each of the plurality of games to be allocated an equal (or substantially equal) amount of the displayed game play area. In another embodiment, the first configuration of the plurality of games displayed to the player includes causing each of the plurality of games to be allocated different amounts of the displayed game play area. For example, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, after a player has selected to a play a slot game <b>150</b><i>a </i>and selected to participate in a community poker game <b>150</b><i>b</i>, the gaming system displays the play of these two games in a first configuration in which the slot game is allocated a greater portion of the displayed game play area. In this illustrated example, the gaming system provides appropriate messages such as &#x201c;WHILE OTHER PLAYER'S JOIN THE COMMUNITY POKER GAME, LET'S SEE HOW YOU DID IN YOUR WAGERED ON PLAY OF THE SLOT GAME&#x201d; and &#x201c;CONGRATULATIONS, YOUR CHERRY-CHERRY-CHERRY SYMBOL COMBINATION WON YOU $20&#x201d; to the player visually, or through suitable audio or audiovisual displays.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In one embodiment, the gaming system accounts for the different types of games being simultaneously played in determining and displaying a first configuration of the plurality of simultaneously played games. Specifically, the gaming system determines that, based on the characteristics or features of the games being simultaneously played by the player, one or more display reconfiguration events are more likely to occur in certain of the plurality of games. In this embodiment, in anticipation of having to modify the configuration of how the plurality of games are displayed to the player, the gaming system utilizes a first configuration to try and minimize such subsequent modifications. For example, expanding on the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the gaming system determines that, based on the slot game having a significantly quicker play cycle than the community poker game, the slot game is allocated a greater area or portion of the displayed game play area to (and the community poker game is allocated a lesser area or portion of the displayed game play area). In this example, because the illustrated slot game is completed, on average, within three seconds and the illustrated community poker game is completed, on average, within three minutes (i.e., one-hundred-eighty seconds), the gaming system determines that the player's attention should be predominantly directed to the slot game to repeatedly place wagers, view generated outcome and view any provided awards. Put differently, since sixty slot games are completed, on average, in the amount of time it takes, on average, to complete one community poker game, compared to the community poker game, a greater quantity of events that require the player's attention will occur in the slot game during the time period it takes to complete one community poker game and thus, to focus the player's attention on the slot game, the gaming system determines to allocate a greater portion of the displayed game play area to the slot game.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In addition to displaying the plurality of simultaneously, concurrently or overlapping played games, the gaming system monitors the plays of the plurality of simultaneously played games and determines, as indicated in diamond <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, if one of a plurality of display reconfiguration events has occurred. In one embodiment, a display reconfiguration event occurs in association with one or more the displayed events which occur in one of the simultaneously played games. In this embodiment, the gaming system designates one or more displayed events or outcomes which occur in association with one or more of the displayed games as display reconfiguration events.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In one embodiment, each display reconfiguration event is associated with a configuration of how the plurality of games are to be displayed on the display device. That is, one display reconfiguration event is associated with a configuration of how the plurality of games are to be displayed on the display device when that display reconfiguration event occurs and another display reconfiguration event is associated with another, possibly different configuration of how the plurality of games are to be displayed on the display device when that display reconfiguration event occurs. Specifically, each display reconfiguration event is associated with a configuration of one or more of: a location which each of the plurality of simultaneously played games are to be displayed at, a size which each of the plurality of simultaneously played games are to be displayed as, a color which each of the plurality of simultaneously played games are to be displayed as, a brightness or dimming which each of the plurality of simultaneously played games are to be displayed as, and/or any displayed indicators, displayed characteristics or displayed features associated with each of the plurality of simultaneously played games.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">If the gaming system determines that a display reconfiguration event has not occurred, the gaming system returns to diamond <b>104</b> and continues monitoring the plays of the simultaneously played games to determine if one of the plurality of display reconfiguration events has occurred. That is, if the gaming system determines that no event has occurred in any of the games that requires the player's specific attention, the gaming system continues displaying the plurality of games as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">On the other hand, if the gaming system determines that a display reconfiguration event has occurred, the gaming system determines whether the current configuration of how the plurality of simultaneously played games are displayed to the player corresponds to the configuration associated with the display reconfiguration event which occurred as indicated in diamond <b>106</b>. That is, if the gaming system determines that an event has occurred in at least one of the games that requires the player's attention, the gaming system determines whether the current display configuration of the displayed game play area of the display device is one that already draws the player's attention to the event that occurred.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">If the gaming system determines that the current configuration of how the plurality of simultaneously played games are displayed to the player corresponds to the configuration associated with the display reconfiguration event which occurred, the gaming system returns to diamond <b>104</b> and continues monitoring the plays of the simultaneously played games to determine if another one of the plurality of display reconfiguration events has occurred. For example, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, if the gaming system determines that a display reconfiguration event of a generation of a symbol combination in the simultaneously played slot game occurs and the gaming system further determines that the configuration of how the plurality of simultaneously played games are displayed to the player matches the way the plurality of simultaneously played games are currently displayed to the player, the gaming system does not modify the configuration of the display device. Rather, the gaming system continues displaying the plays of the slot game and the community poker game to the player and awaits another display reconfiguration event.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">On the other hand, if the gaming system determines that the current configuration of how the plurality of simultaneously played games are displayed to the player does not correspond to the configuration associated with the display reconfiguration event which occurred, the gaming system modifies the configuration of how the plurality of simultaneously played games are displayed to correspond to the configuration associated with the display reconfiguration event which occurred as indicated in block <b>108</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. That is, if the gaming system determines that the current configuration of how the plurality of simultaneously played games are displayed does not adequately focus the player's attention to a specific one of the games, the gaming system reconfigures how the plurality of simultaneously played games are displayed to focus the player's attention to the specific one of the games. Put differently, by either increasing the display resources attributable to one game and/or decreasing the display resources attributable to the remaining simultaneously played games, the gaming system disclosed herein modifies how such games are displayed to the player in an attempt to increase a player's awareness of one or more events occurring in one game while decreasing the player's awareness of one or more events occurring in the remaining simultaneously played games.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">For example, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, after determining that a display reconfiguration event associated with a turn or opportunity for the player to raise the bet, call the bet or fold occurred in the community poker game, the gaming system modified, altered or otherwise reconfigured the display device by reallocating a greater area of the game play area to the community poker game. That is, the gaming system modified how the slot game and the community poker game are displayed to the player such that the community poker game became the focal point of the display device. In this illustrated example, the gaming system provides appropriate messages such as &#x201c;WHILE THE REELS SPIN, IT IS TIME TO FOCUS ON THE COMMUNITY POKER GAME&#x201d; and &#x201c;DO YOU WANT TO FOLD, CALL OR RAISE?&#x201d; to the player visually, or through suitable audio or audiovisual displays.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In one embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the gaming system modifies how the plurality of simultaneously played games are displayed to the player by scaling the respective sizes of the plurality of simultaneously played games. In this embodiment, the gaming system causes the game or games which require the player's attention to become larger (while also causing the game or games which do not require the players attention to become smaller). In one embodiment, the gaming system preserves or maintains the aspect ratio of the displayed games when scaling the size of one or more of the games played. In another embodiment, the gaming system disregards the aspect ratio of the displayed games when scaling the size of one or more of the games played.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In another embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the gaming system modifies how the plurality of simultaneously played games are displayed to the player by moving the location of the plurality of simultaneously played games. In this embodiment, the gaming system causes the game or games which require the player's attention to move to one location, such as the top portion of the displayed game play area (while also causing the game or games which do not require the player's attention to move to another location, such as a bottom portion of the displayed game play area).</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In another embodiment, the gaming system modifies how the plurality of simultaneously played games are displayed to the player by indicating one or more games to the player while not indicating one or more other games. In one such embodiment, the gaming system highlights or otherwise displays a border around the game or games which require the player's attention (while not highlighting the games that do not require the player's attention). In another such embodiment, the gaming system flashes the game or games which require the player's attention (while not flashing the games that do not require the player's attention). In another such embodiment, the gaming system brightens the game or games which require the player's attention (while not brightening the games that do not require the player's attention). It should be appreciated that such indications of one or more simultaneously played games may be utilized when a plurality of the games each need the player's attention. For example, if, after the gaming system increases the size of a first game (and decreases the size of a second game) to draw the player's attention to the requirement that the player make a selection in the first game, a display reconfiguration event occurs for a second game that requires the player's attention for the second game, the gaming system retains the sizes of both the first and second games and utilizes an alternative indicator to also draw the player's attention to the second game, such as a flashing of the second game.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In another embodiment, the gaming system modifies how the plurality of simultaneously played games are displayed to the player by removing the player's focus from one or more of the plurality of simultaneously played games. In one such embodiment, the gaming system cause the game or games which do not require the player's attention to be grayed out or blurred (while also causing the game or games which require the player's attention to remain in focus). It should be appreciated that in one embodiment, removing focus is used if the player is waiting on that game. For example if the player is waiting in a game lobby for a communal poker table to fill up, that communal poker game is blurred out while the player is waiting and the community poker game is then maximized when the table is full and the game is ready to continue.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">After modifying the configuration of how the plurality of simultaneously played games are displayed to the player, the gaming system returns to diamond <b>104</b> and continues monitoring the plays of the simultaneously played games to determine if another one of the plurality of display reconfiguration events has occurred.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In one embodiment, the plurality of simultaneously played games displayed to the player include a plurality of wagered on primary or base games. For example, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the plurality of simultaneously played games include two slot games <b>150</b><i>a </i>and <b>150</b><i>c </i>and one community poker game <b>150</b><i>b</i>. In another example, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the plurality of simultaneously played games include one slot game <b>150</b><i>a </i>and two community poker games <b>150</b><i>c </i>and <b>150</b><i>d</i>. In another embodiment, the plurality of simultaneously played games displayed to the player include a plurality of triggered secondary or bonus games. In another embodiment, the plurality of simultaneously played games displayed to the player include at least one wagered on primary game and at least one triggered secondary game.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Any suitable game, type of game or quantity of games may be implemented as one or more of the simultaneously played games disclosed herein. In different embodiments, one or more of the simultaneously played games include, but are not limited to: any suitable slot game, any suitable free spins or free activations game, any suitable wheel game, any suitable card game, any suitable keno game, any suitable bingo game, any suitable die or dice game, any suitable virtual horse racing game; any suitable offer and acceptance game, any suitable award ladder game, any suitable puzzle-type game, any suitable persistence game, any suitable selection game, any suitable cascading symbols game, any suitable ways to win game, any suitable scatter pay game, any suitable elimination game, any suitable group or community cooperation game, any suitable group or community competition game, or any other suitable type of game. It should be appreciated that regardless of which games or types of games are simultaneously played, as described above, each displayed game includes a displayed generation of an outcome for that game and the displaying of any award associated with the generated outcome for that game.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In one embodiment, the display device which displays the plurality of simultaneously played games to the player includes a single display device, such as primary or central display device <b>16</b>. In another embodiment, the display device which displays the plurality of simultaneously played games to the player includes a plurality of display devices which are linked or otherwise configured to function as a single display device. In this embodiment, while the game play area is caused to be displayed by a plurality of display devices, each of the plurality of simultaneously played games are still displayed in the single game play area.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In one embodiment, each simultaneously played game is associated with one or more display reconfiguration events. In one such embodiment, the plurality of display reconfiguration events associated with an individual game have the same configuration of how the plurality of simultaneously played games are displayed to the player. For example, both: (i) the display reconfiguration event of an elapsed amount of time since the completion of a play of a slot game without the player placing a wager on another play of the slot game, and (ii) the display reconfiguration event of a displayed generation of a symbol combination in the play of the slot game; have the same configuration of how the plurality of simultaneously played games are displayed to the player. In this example, regardless of if the amount of time has elapsed since the completion of a play of a slot game without the player placing a wager on another play of the slot game, or if a symbol combination is generated in the play of the slot game, the gaming system allocates the same portion of the displayed game play area to the slot game.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In another such embodiment, the plurality of display reconfiguration events associated with an individual game have different configurations of how the plurality of simultaneously played games are displayed to the player. For example, the display reconfiguration event of a first elapsed amount of time since the gaming system requested the player to make a wager or fold a hand in a community card game has a first configuration of how the plurality of simultaneously played games are displayed to the player, and the display reconfiguration event of a second elapsed amount of time since the gaming system requested the player to make a wager or fold a hand in a community card game has a second configuration of how the plurality of simultaneously played games are displayed to the player. In this example, the first configuration is associated with allocating a first portion of the displayed game play area to the community card game and the second configuration is associated with allocating a second, greater portion of the displayed game play area to the community card game (i.e., the more time that elapses without the player making the required inputs for the play of the community card game, the larger portion of the game play area is dedicated to the displaying the community card game).</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In different embodiments, the display reconfiguration event includes, but is not limited to:

</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0175">In another embodiment, the gaming system dynamically configures the input devices to be associated with whichever game is currently displayed to draw the player's attention. For example, if at a first point in time, the configuration of the display device is that a blackjack game is displayed to draw the player's attention (i.e., the blackjack game is highlighted or displayed as a larger game relative to the other simultaneously played game), the gaming system configures the input devices to be associated with the blackjack game. In this example, if at a second, subsequent point in time, the configuration of the display device is that a keno game is displayed to draw the player's attention (i.e., the keno game is highlighted or displayed as a larger game relative to the other simultaneously played game), the gaming system configures the input devices to be associated with the keno game.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0176">In another embodiment, the gaming system utilizes one or more secondary device management applications to configure one or more secondary devices. In one such embodiment, the gaming system dynamically configures one or more secondary devices, such as any light rings or top boxes to be associated with whichever game is currently displayed to draw the player's attention. For example, if at a first point in time, the configuration of the display device is that a bingo game is displayed to draw the player's attention (i.e., the bingo game is highlighted or displayed as a larger game relative to the other simultaneously played game), the gaming system configures one or more secondary devices to be associated with the bingo game. In this example, if at a second, subsequent point in time, the configuration of the display device is that a triggered secondary game is displayed to draw the player's attention (i.e., the triggered secondary game is highlighted or displayed as a larger game relative to the other simultaneously played game), the gaming system configures one or more of the secondary devices to be associated with the triggered secondary game. It should be appreciated that various resources, such as video, sound, buttons, memory, processors and/or memory storage, can be shared when multiple games are simultaneously played.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0177">In another embodiment, independent of any display reconfiguration event, the gaming system enables a player to select which of the plurality of simultaneously played games will be allocated a greater portion of the displayed game play area. For example, if a first game is currently minimized but the player wants to view the first game in more detail, the gaming system enables the player to touch an area of the display device associated with the first game to increase the size of the first game (and decrease the size of one or more other games that are currently occupying a greater portion of the game play area). In another embodiment, independent of any display reconfiguration event, the central server communicates information or messages to redefine or reconfigure the game play area of the display device.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0178">In another embodiment, the gaming system prioritizes the display reconfiguration events to determine the configuration of the display device when two or more display reconfiguration events occur simultaneously or substantially simultaneously. In one embodiment, the gaming system enables the player to input or select the priority of the display reconfiguration event. In one such embodiment, the gaming system saves or stores the player's inputted priority information in association with the player tracking system described above. In these embodiments, the gaming system enables the player to rank the events into a hierarchy followed by the gaming system to prioritize the display reconfiguration events to determine how the plurality of simultaneously played games will be displayed to the player. For example, if two display reconfiguration events overlap and each display reconfiguration event is associated with a different simultaneously played game being allocated an increased portion of the displayed game play area, the gaming system determines that, based on one or more stored priorities, the simultaneously played game associated with the larger wager amount is allocated the increased portion of the displayed game play area.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0179">In another embodiment, the gaming system enables a player to selectively disable the reconfiguration of how the plurality of simultaneously played games are displayed to the player. In another embodiment, the gaming system enables a player to disable the reconfiguration of how the plurality of simultaneously played games are displayed for one or more display reconfiguration events and enable the reconfiguration of how the plurality of simultaneously played games are displayed for one or more other display reconfiguration events. In one such embodiment, the gaming system utilizes an override button to enable the player to disable or override a reconfiguration of how the plurality of games are displayed (in response to a display reconfiguration event occurring). In another such embodiment, the gaming system enables a player to prioritize which display reconfiguration events the gaming system should reconfigure how the plurality of games are displayed (when such display reconfiguration events occur) and which display reconfiguration events the gaming system should not reconfigure how the plurality of games are displayed (when such display reconfiguration events occur). In this embodiment, the gaming system saves or stores the player's inputted enable/disable display reconfiguration event information in association with the player tracking system described above. For example, the gaming system enables the player to: (i) designate that any display reconfiguration events of winning an award over a designated amount are enabled (i.e., the gaming system will cause a reconfiguration of how the plurality of games are displayed to the player in response to this display reconfiguration event occurring) and (ii) designate that any display reconfiguration events of winning an award less than the designated amount are disabled (i.e., the gaming system will not cause a reconfiguration of how the plurality of games are displayed to the player in response to this display reconfiguration event occurring).</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0180">In another embodiment, if a display reconfiguration event occurs, the gaming system reconfigures how the plurality of simultaneously played games are displayed to the player for a designated period of time and then reverts back to how the games were displayed to the player prior to the occurrence of the display reconfiguration event. That is, if an event occurs in the play of one of the games that requires the player's attention or focus, the gaming system temporarily reconfigures how the games are displayed to the player to draw the player's attention or focus to that one game. For example, if the gaming system is currently displaying a community poker game as the predominate game on the displayed game play area (i.e., the community poker game is allocated a larger portion of the displayed game play area than any other game being played) and a winning outcome is generated in a play of a slot game, the gaming system will: (i) reallocate a larger portion of the displayed game play area to the slot game (and thus reallocate a smaller portion of the displayed game play area to the community poker game) for a designated period of time, such as three seconds, and then (ii) reallocate the larger portion of the displayed game play area back to the community poker game (and thus reallocate a smaller portion of the displayed game play area back to the slot game).</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0181">In another embodiment, a display reconfiguration event occurs independent of any displayed event in any play of any of the displayed games. That is, the gaming system designates one or more events which are not displayed in any plays of any games (i.e., a mystery event) as display reconfiguration events. In another embodiment, a display reconfiguration event occurs at least partially based on a game triggered event, such as at least partially based on a play of one of the displayed games.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0182">In another embodiment, rather than utilizing only one display device as described above, the gaming system utilizes a plurality of display devices and varies which game (or other aspects associated with which game) is displayed on which display device based on which game has a slow game cycle and which game has a fast game cycle. For example, a first, slow playing game, such as a slot game, takes 3 seconds to play while a second, slow playing game, such as a racing game, takes 90 seconds to play. In this example, the gaming system displays the slow playing game on the top or secondary display device while the primary or bottom display device switches between displaying the fast playing game and the betting controls of the slow playing game. This provides that the player only interacts with the primary or bottom display device which is easier for the player to reach (compared to the top or secondary display device). This further provides that only the primary or bottom display device is required to be associated with a touch screen as described herein.</p>
