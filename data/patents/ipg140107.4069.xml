The user terminal <b>1</b> has a user identification function of acquiring user identification information used to uniquely specify a user. Further, the user terminal <b>1</b> may execute user authentication using an authentication function of the print server <b>2</b>. In this embodiment, it is assumed that the user terminal <b>1</b> acquires the user identification information when the user terminal <b>1</b> instructs at least the PULL print.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The user terminal <b>1</b> operates a printer driver program (hereinafter, referred to as a printer driver) for the PULL print in response to a print instruction from the user. The user terminal <b>1</b> generates the print job (print data) indicating the print contents instructed by the user, when a processor executes the printer driver. The user terminal <b>1</b> attaches the user identification information regarding a sender to the print job. Further, when the user terminal <b>1</b> permits the user other than the sender to execute printing based on the print job, the user terminal <b>1</b> attaches information indicating identification information or a group of the users who are able to execute the printing to the print job. The user terminal <b>1</b> transmits the generated print job to the print server <b>2</b>.</p>

After the print server <b>2</b> stores the print job in the folder of User <b>2</b>, the print server <b>2</b> manages the print job stored in the folder of User <b>2</b> by the management function <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">On the other hand, User <b>2</b> notified of the registration of the print job can execute the print job in any image forming apparatus (MFP) <b>3</b> connected to the print server <b>2</b>. For example, the authentication information acquisition unit <b>39</b> of the MFP <b>3</b> in which User <b>2</b> logs in acquires the authentication information from User <b>2</b>. The authentication information may be information read from an IC card carried by User <b>2</b> or may be information input from the operation unit by User <b>2</b>. The MFP <b>3</b> transits the acquired authentication information along with the authentication request to the print server <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The print server <b>2</b> executes the user authentication process based on the authentication information transmitted along with the authentication request from the MFP <b>3</b>.

The print server <b>2</b> transmits the authentication result obtained through the user authentication process to the image forming apparatus. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it is assumed that the print server <b>2</b> notifies the MFP <b>3</b> of the fact that the authentication of User <b>2</b> succeeds.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The MFP <b>3</b> notified of the fact that the authentication succeeds by the print server <b>2</b> requests the print server <b>2</b> to transmit the list of the print jobs that User <b>2</b> is able to execute as the PULL print in response to an operation of User <b>2</b>. The list of the print jobs may be the list of the print jobs that User <b>2</b> is able to execute as an individual or may be the list of the print jobs that the group of User <b>2</b> is able to execute.

For example, the user terminal <b>1</b> acquires the user ID of the user as an operator in the log-in process. When the user executes the PULL print, the user gives a printing instruction through the operation unit <b>17</b> when the image data (or document data) to be printed is designated. If the processor <b>11</b> receives the printing instruction, the processor <b>11</b> operates the printer driver (ACT <b>12</b>).</p>

For example, the processor <b>11</b> displays, on the display unit <b>16</b>, the print setting screen for the PULL print that includes input keys used to instruct setting of a destination (printing executor), setting of a password, or other print settings.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">If the processor <b>11</b> receives an instruction to set the destination on the print setting screen for the PULL print (YES in ACT <b>16</b>), the processor <b>11</b> displays a destination setting screen used to designate the user (a receiver, a destination) that is able to execute the print job as the PULL print (ACT <b>17</b>). The destination setting screen is a screen used to set the user who executes the print job. In this embodiment, the user other than the sender that sends (registers) the print job of the PULL print can execute the print job. The user (sender) setting the print job is assumed to set (transmit) the user who is able to execute the print job. That is, the user sets the user serving as the destination (executable user) other than himself or herself on the setting screen of the PULL print. If the destination other than himself or herself is designated on the destination setting screen (YES in ACT <b>18</b>), the processor <b>11</b> sets the destination designated as the user (receiver) that is able to execute the print job (ACT <b>19</b>).</p>

The setting field <b>60</b> for the subject user is a setting field used set whether the user himself or herself (the subject user) is permitted to execute the print job. The setting field <b>61</b> for other users is a setting field used to set whether others is permitted to execute the print job. The password setting field <b>62</b> is a setting field used to set existence or non-existence of a password. The mode setting field <b>63</b> is a setting field used to set the color mode. The cancel button <b>64</b> is a button used to instruct cancellation of the destination setting.

<p id="p-0092" num="0091">When the user sets the setting field <b>61</b> for other users so that other users can execute the print job, the display unit <b>16</b> further displays a candidate list <b>66</b>, an addition button <b>67</b>, a deletion button <b>68</b>, and a setting user list <b>69</b>. The candidate list <b>66</b> is a list of candidates (users and groups) who can be selected (set) as other users who are able to execute the print jobs.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The user operates the operation unit <b>17</b> to select an individual user or a group that is able to execute the print job from the candidates displayed in the candidate list <b>66</b>. For example, the user can select the candidate displayed in the candidate list <b>66</b> by touching a display portion on a touch panel serving as the operation unit <b>17</b>. When the candidate displayed in the candidate list <b>66</b> is selected and the addition button <b>67</b> is instructed, the selected candidate is added to the setting user list <b>69</b> as a setting user.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The user can operate the operation unit <b>17</b> to select an individual user or a group from the setting user displayed in the setting user list <b>69</b>.

<p id="p-0096" num="0095">When the destination is designated on the destination setting screen (YES in ACT <b>18</b>), the processor <b>11</b> sets the destination designated as the user (receiver) that is able to execute the print job (ACT <b>19</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">If the setting of a password is instructed on the destination setting screen (YES in ACT <b>20</b>), the processor <b>11</b> displays the password input screen on the display unit <b>16</b> (ACT <b>21</b>). The password input screen is a screen used to input the password necessary to execute the print job. When the user operates the operation unit <b>17</b> to input the password on the password input screen, the processor <b>11</b> sets the input password (ACT <b>22</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Each user is notified of the set password separately from the registration notification for the print job from the print server <b>2</b> described below. The password may be information determined in advance between the users or in the group.</p>

The data indicating the print job is configured by the PJL data, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. When the data indicating the print job is generated, the processor <b>11</b> transmits the PJL data of the print job to the print server <b>2</b> (ACT <b>27</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">According to the above-described processes, the user terminal sets the print job that the user other than the sender designated by the sender is able to execute and can register the print job to the print server. Further, the user terminal can suggest the list of the users or the groups that is able to execute the print job and can register the print job, in which the user or the group selected from the list is designated as the executor (receiver) of the print job, in the print server. That is, the user can supply, as the print job, a print product that the user desires to send to other users.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Next, a process of registering the print job for the PULL print in the print server <b>2</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an example of a process of registering a job of the PULL print in the print server <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The network interface <b>25</b> of the print server <b>2</b> receives the PJL data of the print job of the PULL print from the user terminal <b>1</b> via the network <b>5</b> (ACT <b>31</b>). The processor <b>21</b> temporarily stores the PJL data of the print job received from the user terminal <b>1</b> in the spooler <b>42</b> (ACT <b>32</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The processor <b>21</b> of the print server <b>2</b> determines whether the executor (called a destination, a receiver, a user or the like that is able to execute the print job) of the received print job is designated as the group or as the individual user (ACT <b>33</b>). For example, when the PJL data of the print job has the same configuration as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the processor <b>21</b> determines whether the receiver is a group name or an individual name in the received PJL data.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">If the executor of the print job is designated as the individual user (NO in ACT <b>33</b>), the processor <b>21</b> stores the print job of each designated individual user (ACT <b>35</b>). For example, the processor <b>21</b> stores the PJL data of the print job in the folder (for example, a folder with an individual name) generated for each individual user. When there is no folder of the designated user, the processor <b>21</b> generates the folder of the user and stores the PJL data of the print job in the generated folder.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">If the executor of the print job is designated as the group (YES in ACT <b>33</b>), the processor <b>21</b> determines whether the print job is stored for each individual user or each group in accordance with the storage form of the print job in the print server <b>2</b> (ACT <b>34</b>). If the processor <b>21</b> determines whether the print job is stored not for each group but for each individual user (YES in ACT <b>34</b>), the processor <b>21</b> stores the print job of each of all the users belonging to the group (ACT <b>35</b>). For example, the processor <b>21</b> stores the PJL data of the print data in the folder (for example, a folder with an individual name) of each of the users belonging to the group.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">On the other hand, if the processor <b>21</b> determines whether the print job is stored for each group (NO in ACT <b>34</b>), the processor <b>21</b> stores the print job of each group (ACT <b>35</b>). For example, as the storage of each group, the processor <b>21</b> stores the PJL data of the print data in the folder (for example, a folder with a group name) generated for each group. When there is no folder of the designated group, the processor <b>21</b> generates the folder of this group and stores the PJL data of the print job in the generated folder.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">When the processor <b>21</b> stores the print job of each group, the processor <b>21</b> generates the management information so that each user belonging to the group can manage the execution state or the like of the print job (ACT <b>37</b>) and stores the generated management information (ACT <b>38</b>). The management information regarding the print job is information that is necessary for the plurality of users belonging to the group to execute the print job. For example, the management information regarding the print job includes information used to count the execution number of the print job or information indicating the condition or the like that the print job is executed. The processor <b>21</b> stores a file (for example, a JobManager file, a JobCount file, a JobRole file, or the like) including the management information together with the print job in the folder of the group.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">When the print jobs are distributed to the executors and are stored, the processor <b>21</b> determines whether to notify each user serving as the executor of the print job of the fact that the print job is stored in the print server <b>2</b> (ACT <b>39</b>). For example, when the executors of the print jobs include the user other than the sender of the print job, the processor <b>21</b> determines to notify the user other than the sender of the fact that the print job is stored. Further, when the executor of the print job is designated as the individual user, the processor <b>21</b> notifies each designated user of the fact that the print job is stored. When the executor of the print job is designated as the group, the processor <b>21</b> determines to notify each of the users belonging to the designated group.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">If the processor <b>21</b> notifies each user who is able to execute the print job of the fact that the print job is stored in the print server <b>2</b> (YES in ACT <b>39</b>), the processor <b>21</b> executes notification setting to notify each user of the fact that the print job is stored in the print server <b>2</b> (ACT <b>40</b>). For example, when the notification for the print job is given by a mail, the processor <b>21</b> starts the notification by generating a message of the mail and setting the mail address of each user in the generated mail. When the notification setting is completed, the processor <b>21</b> notifies each individual user of the fact that the print job is stored in the print server <b>2</b> (ACT <b>41</b>) and ends the registration process.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Next, the storage form of the print job in the print server <b>2</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a diagram illustrating a first storage form of the print job in the print server <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, all the print jobs are distributed to the respective users and are stored. In the first storage form shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, all the print jobs are stored for the respective users. Therefore, when the user (receiver) who is able to execute the print job is designated as the group, the print job (with the PJL data) is stored in each of the folders of all the users belonging to the designated group. In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the print job may be deleted from the folder of the user whenever each user executes the print job.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a diagram illustrating a second storage form of the print job in the print server <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the print job designating the individual user as the receiver is stored for each user and the print job designating the group as the receiver is stored for each group. In the second storage form shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a folder group of each individual user and a folder group of each group are provided as the storage region where the print jobs for the PULL print are stored.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">When the user (receiver) who is able to execute the print job is designated as the group, the print job (with the PJL data) is stored in the folder of the designated group. In the second storage form, however, since one print job is stored in the file of each group, it is necessary to manage the execution state of the print job of each user. Therefore, in the second storage form shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a JobManager file is generated for each group and is stored together with the print job (with the PJL data) in the folder of each group. Further, a RoleManager file is stored in the upper level of the folder group of each group.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> are diagrams illustrating examples of the structure of the JobManager file.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In the examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, the JobManager file stores &#x201c;Title&#x201d;, &#x201c;Role&#x201d;, &#x201c;Count&#x201d;, and &#x201c;Time&#x201d; for each print job in each group. The &#x201c;Title&#x201d; is an arbitrary character string used to identify the print job. The &#x201c;Count&#x201d; indicates the remaining number of times by which the print job is executed in the group. The initial value of the &#x201c;Count&#x201d; is set to the number of users belonging to the group. The value of the &#x201c;Count&#x201d; is counted down whenever the user belonging to the group executes the print job. Accordingly, the value of the &#x201c;Count&#x201d; becomes &#x201c;0&#x201d; when the print job is executed by the number of users belonging to the group. When the value of the &#x201c;Count&#x201d; becomes &#x201c;0&#x201d;, the print job is deleted from the folder of the group.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The value of the &#x201c;Time&#x201d; is a value indicating the storage period of the print job. The value of the &#x201c;Time&#x201d; may be a default value or the user terminal <b>1</b> may set the value when setting the print job. When the storage period defined in &#x201c;Time&#x201d; expires, the print job is deleted from the folder of the group. The &#x201c;Role&#x201d; indicates the option setting contents in the printing based on the print job. The details of the &#x201c;Role&#x201d; are designated in the RoleManager file.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of the structure of the RoleManager file.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the RoleManager file stores &#x201c;ColorMode&#x201d;, &#x201c;Duplex&#x201d;, and &#x201c;Nin<b>1</b>&#x201d; as one piece of role information. The &#x201c;ColorMode&#x201d; is generated or selected with a unique title as one piece of role information. The &#x201c;Duplex&#x201d; indicates both-side printing setting. For example, when the &#x201c;Duplex&#x201d; is &#x201c;0&#x201d;, the &#x201c;Duplex&#x201d; indicates single-side printing setting. When the &#x201c;Duplex&#x201d; is &#x201c;1&#x201d;, the &#x201c;Duplex&#x201d; indicates both-side printing setting. The &#x201c;Nin<b>1</b>&#x201d; indicates setting in which the images corresponding to N pages are printed on one surface of the sheet. For example, when the &#x201c;Nin<b>1</b>&#x201d; is &#x201c;1&#x201d;, the &#x201c;Nin<b>1</b>&#x201d; indicates setting of 1 in 1 (setting in which the image corresponding one page is printed on one surface). When the &#x201c;Nin<b>1</b>&#x201d; is &#x201c;2&#x201d;, the &#x201c;Nin<b>1</b>&#x201d; indicates setting of 2 in 1 (setting in which the images corresponding two pages are printed on one surface).</p>

<p id="p-0126" num="0125">That is, in the third storage form shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the JobCount file stores the condition that the print job is deleted from the folder of the group and the JobRole file stores information indicating the setting contents when the user of the group executes the print job. The number of JobRole files may be two or more in each group. For example, the JobRole file may be provided for each user. When the JobRole file is provided for each user, the setting contents of the case of executing the printing job for each user can be designated. For example, the user who executes the print job in accordance with first setting contents and the user who executes the print job in accordance with second setting contents can be designated even in the same group.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In the JobRole file, the &#x201c;Role&#x201d; newly generated in the print setting from the user terminal <b>1</b> may be stored.

<p id="p-0139" num="0138">If the processor <b>21</b> may not acquire the password from the image forming apparatus <b>3</b> (NO in ACT <b>58</b>) or if the password acquired from the image forming apparatus <b>3</b> is not identical (NO in ACT <b>59</b>), the processor <b>21</b> transmits an error notification to the image forming apparatus <b>3</b> (ACT <b>66</b>) and stops transmitting the print job instructed to be executed.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">If the passwords are identical to each other (YES in ACT <b>59</b>), the processor <b>21</b> reads the print job instructed to be executed from the JOB storage region <b>46</b><i>a </i>by the management function <b>46</b> and transmits the print job instructed to be executed to the image forming apparatus <b>3</b> (ACT <b>61</b>). After the processor <b>21</b> transmits the print job, the processor <b>21</b> determines whether the print job is deleted (ACT <b>62</b>). If the processor <b>21</b> determines that the print job is deleted (YES in ACT <b>62</b>), the processor <b>21</b> deletes the print job transmitted to the image forming apparatus <b>3</b> (ACT <b>63</b>) and ends the process.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">For example, when each individual user can execute the print job only once and the transmitted print job is the print job read from the individual user, the processor <b>21</b> deletes the print job from the folder of the individual user. When the transmitted print job is the print job read from the folder of the group, the processor <b>21</b> updates the JobManager file, the JobCount file, or the Users file managing the execution state of the print jobs in each group, as described above, and determines whether to delete the print job from the folder of the group.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">For example, when the storage form of the print jobs is the second storage form shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the processor <b>21</b> decreases the value of the &#x201c;Count&#x201d; in the JobManager file by &#x201c;1&#x201d; and determines whether to delete the print job depending on whether the value of the &#x201c;Count&#x201d; is &#x201c;0&#x201d;. Further, when the storage form of the print jobs is the third storage form shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the processor <b>21</b> decreases the value of the &#x201c;Count&#x201d; in the JobCount file by &#x201c;1&#x201d; and determines whether to delete the print job depending on whether the value of the &#x201c;Count&#x201d; is &#x201c;0&#x201d;. Furthermore, when the storage form of the print jobs is the fourth storage form shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the processor <b>21</b> updates the Print Out tag of the user into &#x201c;1&#x201d; (where the execution ends) in the Users file and determines whether to delete the print job depending on whether the tags of all the users of the print jobs completely ends.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Next, the execution process of the print job in the image forming apparatus <b>3</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an execution process of the print job in the image forming apparatus <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">The image forming apparatus <b>3</b> can gain access to the print server <b>2</b> executing the processes shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> via the network <b>5</b> at any timing. Here, when the user starts operating the image forming apparatus <b>3</b> (or starts the PULL print), it is assumed that the processor <b>31</b> of the image forming apparatus <b>3</b> executes user authentication as a log-in process of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">That is, the processor <b>31</b> of the image forming apparatus <b>3</b> acquires the user ID, the authentication information, and the like input to log in the image forming apparatus <b>3</b> by the user (ACT <b>71</b>). The authentication information may be information read from an IC card of the user by an IC card reader serving as the authentication information acquisition unit <b>39</b> or may be authentication information such as a password input through the operation unit <b>37</b> by the user. When the processor <b>31</b> acquires the user ID and the authentication information, the processor <b>31</b> transmits an authentication request to the print server <b>2</b> (ACT <b>72</b>). After the processor <b>31</b> transmits the authentication request, the processor <b>31</b> receives the authentication result from the print server <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">If the processor <b>31</b> receives a notification for user authentication success from the print server <b>2</b> (YES in ACT <b>73</b>), the processor <b>31</b> displays a menu screen (ACT <b>74</b>) and receives a selection of the PULL print as one of the print functions. If the PULL print is selected (YES in ACT <b>75</b>), the processor <b>31</b> requests the print server <b>2</b> to transmit the list of the print jobs of each individual user or the list of the print jobs of each group in response to the operation from the user.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">For example, if the processor <b>31</b> requests the print server <b>2</b> to transmit the list of the print jobs of the individual user (YES in ACT <b>76</b>), the processor <b>31</b> requests the print server <b>2</b> to transmit the list of the print jobs designating the users succeeding in the authentication (ACT <b>77</b>). The print server <b>2</b> generates the list of the print jobs of the designated users and transmits the list of the print jobs of the designated users to the image forming apparatus <b>3</b>. The processor <b>31</b> of the image forming apparatus <b>3</b> displays the list of the print jobs of the respective users received from the print server <b>2</b> on the display unit <b>36</b> (ACT <b>78</b>). For example, the display unit <b>36</b> displays the list of the print jobs of the respective users as a print job selection screen used for the user to select a specific print job.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">If the processor <b>31</b> requests the print server <b>2</b> to transmit the list of the print jobs of the respective groups (YES in ACT <b>79</b>), the processor <b>31</b> requests the print server <b>2</b> to transmit the list of the print jobs designating the group to which the users succeeding in the authentication belong (ACT <b>80</b>). The print server <b>2</b> generates the list of the print jobs of the designated groups and transmits the list of the print jobs of the designated groups to the image forming apparatus <b>3</b>. The processor <b>31</b> of the image forming apparatus <b>3</b> displays the list of the print jobs of the respective groups received from the print server <b>2</b> on the display unit <b>36</b> (ACT <b>81</b>). For example, the display unit <b>36</b> displays the list of the print jobs of the respective users as a print job selection screen used for the user to select a specific print job.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a diagram illustrating a display example of the print job selection screen including the list of the print jobs of the respective users. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is a diagram illustrating a display example of the print job selection screen including the list of the print jobs of the respective group.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</figref>, the display examples are switched in response to the input of tabs <b>71</b> and <b>72</b>. The tab <b>71</b>, the tab <b>72</b>, a list <b>73</b> (or <b>74</b>), a deletion button <b>75</b>, a clear button <b>76</b>, an all selection button <b>77</b>, and a print button <b>78</b> are displayed on the print job selection screen shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The tab <b>71</b> instructs the display of the list of the print jobs of the respective users. The tab <b>72</b> instructs the display of the list of the print jobs of the respective users. The list <b>73</b> is an example of the list of the print jobs of the respective users displayed when the tab <b>71</b> is selected. The list <b>74</b> is an example of the list of the print jobs of the respective groups displayed when the tab <b>72</b> is selected. The deletion button <b>75</b> is a button used to instruct the deletion of the selected print jobs. The clear button <b>76</b> is a button used to instruct clearing of the selection contents or the like. The all selection button <b>77</b> is a button used to instruct all the print jobs displayed in the list so as to be selected. The print button <b>78</b> is a button used to instruct the execution of the printing by the selected print jobs.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">That is, when the tab <b>71</b> displayed as &#x201c;User&#x201d; is selected, the display unit <b>36</b> displays the list <b>73</b> of the print jobs (the list of the print jobs in which a user A is designated) of the individual users, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. Further, when the tab <b>72</b> displayed as &#x201c;Group&#x201d; is selected, the display unit <b>36</b> displays the list <b>74</b> of the print jobs (the list of the print jobs in which a group A is designated) of the respective groups, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">In the display example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the user (sender) of the transmission source of each print job is displayed. When the sender is the user himself or herself, the print job means that the print job is sent by the user himself or herself. For example, in the display example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the print job of the sender User A is the print job that the User A himself or herself transmits (sets). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, by displaying the senders in correspondence with the respective print jobs, it is possible to easily recognize whether each print job is the print job that the user himself or herself transmits or the transmit job that another user transmits.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">In the display example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the group is displayed as the executor for each print job. For example, in the display example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the print job in which Group A is designated and the print job in which Group A and Group C are designated are displayed. By displaying the groups that are able to execute the print jobs, the user can recognize that each print job is the print job permitted to be executed in a given group, and thus can predict the kinds of print jobs.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The user can select one print job and instructs the execution of the print job on the print job selection screen including the list of the print jobs of the respective users and the list of the print jobs of the respective groups. If the processor <b>21</b> receives an instruction for the execution of the selected one print job (YES in ACT <b>82</b>), the processor <b>21</b> determines whether a password is set in the print job (ACT <b>83</b>). If the password is set (YES in ACT <b>83</b>), the processor <b>21</b> displays the password input screen on the display unit <b>36</b> (ACT <b>84</b>) and prompts the user to input the password.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">When the user inputs the password, the processor <b>31</b> requests the print server <b>2</b> to combine the password input for the print server <b>2</b> and the password set for the print job (ACT <b>85</b>). When the image forming apparatus holds the password set for the print job, the password input by the processor <b>31</b> may be combined with the password for the print job.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">If the combination of the passwords fails (NO in ACT <b>86</b>), the processor <b>31</b> displays an error notification on the display unit <b>36</b> (ACT <b>87</b>) and stops this process. Even if the combination of the passwords fails, the input of the password may be received again up to a predetermined number of times and the process may be executed from ACT <b>84</b> described above.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">If the combination of the passwords succeeds (YES in ACT <b>86</b>), the processor <b>31</b> receives the print job from the print server <b>2</b> (ACT <b>88</b>). After the processor <b>31</b> receives the print job, the processor <b>31</b> allows the printer <b>38</b> to execute the printing based on the print job (ACT <b>89</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">In the image forming system, as described above, the print server registers the print job designated by the other users other than the sender set as the executor and the MFP executes the print job registered in the print server in response to the operation of the executor other than the sender. According to the image forming system, the print data can be exchanged with the other users other than the user himself or herself without actually printing the print data on a recording medium. Further, since each user designated as the executor of the print job can select whether to execute the printing by himself or herself, unnecessary printing can thus be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">When the print job designating the other users other than the sender as the executor is registered, the print server notifies each user set as the executor of the print job of the fact that the print job is registered. According to the image forming system, the other users can inform each user of the executable print job registered in the print server.</p>
