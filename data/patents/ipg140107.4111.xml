<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an image processing apparatus handling composite images each comprising a plurality of images, control method of an image processing apparatus, program, and storage medium.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, as a result of the popularization of digital cameras, opportunities to view image data shot by a digital camera at home on a personal computer, television receiving machine, etc., are increasing. In this case, as a viewing method, there is proposed displaying a single image data selected by a user, or displaying a slideshow display of a plurality of image data which are successively shown and switched at a predetermined time.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, recently, there is proposed displaying a slideshow display having complicated display functions such as simultaneously displaying, switching, superimposing, etc., a plurality of image data as a method of displaying image data in a slideshow display. In Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2003-196283, there is disclosed an invention relating to an image forming program in which it is possible to display an image data and partial image data resulting from extraction of one part of the image data, and perform printing. However, in this invention disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2003-196283, an image data region that does not change and is fixed is specified, and the region is displayed on a display apparatus or recorded in a printing medium.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, in the case that a plurality of image data is simultaneously displayed, there is already proposed specifying image data in a still state and displaying or printing the image data.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a slideshow display having complicated display functions such as simultaneously displaying, switching, superimposing, etc., a plurality of image data as a method of displaying image data in a slideshow display, it is desirable that it is possible to specify and display specific image data, and print the image data. That is, specifying images to be printed is made easier even when a user is in the middle of executing a slideshow display, if it is possible to display or print a particular image data by specifying the image data from among a plurality of image data included in the slideshow display. In this case, convenience to a user is increased if it is possible to specify an image data even when the image data is changing dynamically.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide a system which makes it possible to specify a particular image data from a composite image data comprising a plurality of image data, and to enable displaying and printing of the specified particular image data.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided an image processing apparatus, comprising: a display control unit configured to display on the display apparatus a composite image comprising a plurality of images while dynamically changing the plurality of images; an receiving unit configured to receive output commands during displaying of the composite image on the display apparatus by the display control unit; and a selection unit configured to display, so that a user can select as an image to be output, either the composite image at a timing before or after a timing at which the output command has been received by the receiving unit.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a control method of an image processing apparatus, comprising: controlling step of controlling a composite image comprising a plurality of images by displaying on a display apparatus while dynamically changing the plurality of images; receiving step of receiving an output command from a user while displaying the composite image on the display apparatus by the controlling step; and selecting step of displaying the composite images at a timing before and after the timing at which the output command has been received by the receiving step so that a user can select either one of the composite images as an image to be output.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In order to achieve the above object of the present invention, still another embodiment of the present invention provides a computer-executable program describing a processing procedure of a control method of the image processing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In order to achieve the above object of the present invention, yet another embodiment of the present invention provides a computer-readable storage medium in which a program describing a processing procedure of a method of controlling the image processing apparatus is stored.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention enables specifying a particular image data from a composite image data comprising a plurality of image data, and to enable displaying and printing of the specified particular image data.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.</p>

Then, the display control unit controls the graphic control unit <b>109</b>, the display superimposing control section <b>108</b>, and the slideshow display.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> are display data tables in which are described image data to be displayed and display information, control information, and print setting information during slideshow display. The display data table of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> includes a common display information <b>601</b> of a slideshow display, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> includes an individual display information <b>602</b> of each image data. The common display information <b>601</b> comprises the following five items: image display format, display interval, display order, transition effect and print mode. In these items are reflected the contents set by the user using the remote control apparatus <b>150</b> before the start of displaying a slideshow.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Besides displaying a normal slideshow in which one image per one screen is successively displayed, other slideshow display formats are possible, such as displaying a strip-shaped type slideshow with two or four images per one screen. Displaying a strip-shaped type slideshow means randomly extracting one image data, and lining up in a strip-shaped form and displaying the extracted image data as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">According to a first embodiment of the present invention, as in a display state <b>703</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref> described below, the display screen of the display unit <b>110</b> is divided vertically into four, and images are displayed in order starting with image A. Described below is the case of performing operations to display a strip-shaped type slideshow so that, when all four images have been displayed, the next image overlaps the first image. A randomly superimposing type slideshow display is a display format in which, as in a display state <b>803</b> described below and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8C and 8D</figref>, a plurality of images are strewn across the entire screen and displayed. The display position of each image is randomly computed and decided by the slideshow display control unit <b>502</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In addition, these display intervals are time intervals until starting display of the next image in a slideshow display. During these time intervals, the display is in a pause state. The display interval is set according to user preferences. According to the embodiment of the present invention, the time interval is set to 3 seconds. The display order of images desired to be in the slideshow display can be selected from among file name order, shooting date order, and random.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A transition effect is a manner in which an image appears when displaying the next image after the present image. According to the embodiment of the present invention, transition effects such as slide-in, dissolve, and wipe are available.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">A print mode is a setting mode for automatically selecting print candidate images when performing print bookmarking for printing in a slide show display. It is possible to select from among three print modes: print candidate selection mode <b>1</b>, print candidate selection mode <b>2</b>, and direct print mode.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Here, the print candidate selection mode <b>1</b> is based on the assumption that the image which the user wishes to print is among the images displayed while the print bookmark button is being pressed. And, during print bookmarking, if the slideshow display is not dynamically changing, each image comprising that composite image, as well as the entire slideshow, becomes a print candidate. In addition, if the slideshow display is dynamically changing, each image comprising each slideshow display before and after change, as well as the entire slideshow (composite image) becomes a print candidate. That is, a composite image including images that have been newly added and displayed by a dynamic change, and a composite image before the dynamic change and do not include this added image are included as print candidates.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The print candidate selection mode <b>2</b> is based on the assumption that, in addition to the above print candidate selection mode <b>1</b>, when print bookmarking, there is at least one of each image which comprises the display in an entire slideshow display other than the current slideshow display. That is, all other slideshow displays in which each &#x201c;currently viewable&#x201d; image at the time the print bookmark button (which is an output command) is pressed are print candidates. In this case, not only slideshow display images before the time the print bookmark button is pressed is considered to be a print candidate. That is, after the time at which the print bookmark button has been pressed, and the slideshow display has advanced, slideshow display images up until the time that all images that were displayed until the time of print bookmarking are &#x201c;hidden and cannot be seen, or disappeared&#x201d; are also print candidates.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The direct print mode is a mode of performing printing, at the time a bookmark key has been pressed, by pausing displaying of a slideshow, making the image immediately before and the image included in it a print candidate, and starting a print menu screen.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">On the other hand, as an individual information of each individual image of a display data table, there is described for each image, as shown in reference numeral <b>602</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, image file name, storage location, display order of each individual image, extraction location, extraction size, overlap with other images when displaying, display location, image rotation angle, and magnification ratio. These settings have been computed by the slideshow display control unit <b>502</b>, before starting a slideshow display, based on settings of display state input by a user using the remote control apparatus <b>150</b> as well as images selected to be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> is a display state table <b>702</b> in the case of a strip-shaped type slideshow display. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref> is the display state <b>703</b> of a display screen. The display state table <b>702</b> describes images (all images other than those images which are below the other images and which are not displayed) related to the present display inside the individual display information <b>602</b> as well as their state. As a result, to the display state table <b>702</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> is added the items of display change and display state. One image of the slideshow display is generated according to the display state table <b>702</b>. In addition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> is a common display information <b>701</b> of the slideshow display.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the display state table <b>702</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, display change indicates whether the display is in the middle of change. A value of &#x201c;C&#x201d; for display change indicates that the &#x201c;display is in the middle of change&#x201d;. &#x201c;Display is in the middle of change&#x201d; is the case of &#x201c;about to display from where there are no images&#x201d;, &#x201c;viewable images are about to be deleted&#x201d;, or &#x201c;viewable images are about to become invisible by being overlapped by display of other images&#x201d;. In addition, if the value of display change is &#x201c;F&#x201d;, this indicates that the &#x201c;display is not changing&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Further, the display state determines whether an individual image which comprises composite images of a slideshow display are displayed on a screen, using the standards below. That is, if the display state is &#x201c;V&#x201d;, the individual image is in a &#x201c;viewable&#x201d; state. This &#x201c;viewable&#x201d; state in a display screen (when in a display state, a display screen at the time of finishing the change operation) based on the display state table <b>702</b> is as indicated below. That is, determination is made based on the standard above a certain level (above 20% according to the present embodiment) of the face portion of an image is shown, or above a certain level (above 50% according to the present embodiment) of the entire image is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In addition, if the display state has a value of &#x201c;H&#x201d;, the image is in a &#x201c;hidden and cannot be seen, or cannot be seen because disappeared&#x201d; state, and indicates cases other than the above &#x201c;viewable&#x201d; case.</p>

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Next, a buffer memory related to a table used in the present embodiment will be described. A print candidate buffer is for temporarily storing a display state table which has the possibility of being a print candidate, and is generated in the memory unit <b>105</b> by the slideshow display control unit <b>502</b>. In addition, a display image list is a list for registering individual images (those with display state &#x201c;V&#x201d;), namely, print candidate images, determined to be the &#x201c;viewable&#x201d; images inside slideshow display images. These are generated in the data accumulation unit <b>113</b> as required when a print bookmark button has been pressed, and are used together with a print candidate list at the time of displaying print candidate images. Further, a print candidate list is for selecting and storing, from a print candidate buffer, a display state table including images which are print candidates, by the print candidate generation unit <b>503</b>. The print candidate list is generated in the data accumulation unit <b>113</b> and is used when printing.</p>

<p id="p-0088" num="0087">After a user has set, using the remote control apparatus <b>150</b>, the image data and the parameters such as the display format of the slideshow display, transition mode, and display interval, slideshow display is executed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows the operation flow of control of a slideshow display.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">After starting processing, the slideshow display control unit <b>502</b> confirms a setting value at Step S<b>1301</b>, and generates a display data table at Step S<b>1302</b>. At Step S<b>1302</b>, a display state table for display control is generated based on the generated display data table, and at Step S<b>1303</b> a determination is made as to whether it is a rewritten timing based on a display interval in the common display information <b>701</b>. If it is a timing at which rewriting occurs, the process advances to Step S<b>1304</b> and rewriting occurs. If not at a timing at which rewriting occurs, waiting occurs until it is at a timing at which rewriting occurs. Therefore, during this interval, dynamic display is in a pause state.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Next, at Step S<b>1305</b>, the rewritten display state table checks the state of &#x201c;display change&#x201d; and, if &#x201c;there is no display change&#x201d;, that is, if the display state table is comprised by &#x201c;display change &#x2018;F&#x2019; state&#x201d;, the process advances to Step S<b>1306</b>. Then, the display state table is also stored in the print candidate buffer. However, if there is a display change, that is, if there is even one &#x201c;display change &#x2018;C&#x2019;&#x201d;, storage to the print candidate buffer is not performed. After storing the display state table in the print candidate buffer, the process advances to Step S<b>1307</b>, and a determination is made as to whether a slideshow display ends. If not, the process returns to Step S<b>1302</b>, the next timing at which the display is rewritten is determined, and rewriting to the &#x201c;next display state table&#x201d; is performed at Step S<b>1304</b>. Then, at Step S<b>1306</b>, the &#x201c;next display state table&#x201d; is additionally stored in the print candidate buffer. This processing sequence is performed until slideshow display is finished.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In displaying a slideshow, a display control unit within another control unit <b>505</b> detects that a display state table has been rewritten, and, based on the display state table, performs display control and performs slideshow display.</p>

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Here, when a user who is viewing a slideshow presses the print bookmark button (for example, red key <b>157</b>R of the remote control apparatus <b>150</b>) to perform print image registration, this is received as an output command. Then, the print candidate generation unit <b>503</b> confirms the setting value of the slideshow display at Step S<b>1402</b>. And, if at Step S<b>1403</b> the print mode is determined to be a print candidate selection mode <b>1</b>, the newest display state table registered in the print buffer at Step S<b>1404</b> is registered in the print candidate list. Next, the process advances to Step S<b>1405</b>, and whether the current display state is in the middle of &#x201c;display change&#x201d; is checked. If in the middle of a &#x201c;display change&#x201d;, the process advances to Step S<b>1406</b>, at which there is waiting for generation of storage operations to the print buffer from the display state table. Here, if a storage operation is generated, the process advances to Step S<b>1407</b>, and the stored display state table is registered in the print candidate list. After registration, the process advances to Step S<b>1408</b>, and whether displaying of the slideshow is finished is confirmed.

<p id="p-0094" num="0093">At Step S<b>1405</b>, in the case of not being in the middle of a &#x201c;display change&#x201d;, the process advances to Step S<b>1408</b>, and it is confirmed whether slideshow display is finished.

In addition, by the determination at Step S<b>1403</b>, if the case is not print candidate selection mode <b>1</b>, the process advances to Step S<b>1409</b>, and processing of a different mode is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In addition, in the case where the print bookmark button has been pressed at a timing other than Step S<b>1401</b> of this operation routine, the process at any time returns to Step S<b>1401</b>, and restarts operations.

<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is an operation flow of the operation routine when performing printing. Slideshow display is finished after finishing selection of images desired to be printed, and the user, in order to print images that have been print bookmarked using the slideshow display, uses the remote control apparatus <b>150</b> to open the menu screen at Step S<b>1501</b> and displays the print menu. Further, when a button to display a list of print candidates is pressed, the process advances to Step S<b>1502</b>, and display of the list of print candidates is performed. Then, further, the process advances to Step S<b>1503</b>, at which there is a check of print state table by the print candidate list, and the print candidate image is determined.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Here, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9D</figref> will be referenced in describing the determination of the print candidate when the print bookmark button is pressed at a plurality of timings.</p>

The images containing the &#x2605; mark on the right side of D<b>4</b>, D<b>5</b> and D<b>9</b> are slideshow display images at a timing at which the print bookmark button has been pressed. An X mark, added for description purposes, are composite images that are not print candidate images.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As described before, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> shows the case in which the print bookmark button has been pressed at the D<b>4</b> time point of FIG.

In this case, the content (the display state table <b>702</b> at the D<b>4</b> time point of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>) of the newest print candidate buffer at the D<b>4</b> time point is stored in the print candidate list. This D<b>4</b> time point is a timing at which there is no display change. Therefore, the individual images (image A and image B) inside the display state table <b>702</b> at the D<b>4</b> time point, and the composite image of image A and image B of the slideshow display, comprising the display state table <b>702</b>, become print candidates without waiting for the print candidate buffer to be stored again.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In this case, if the composite image of the slideshow display is to be made the print candidates without change, it becomes the image on the right with the X mark.

This D<b>5</b> time point is a timing of display changing, so storage to the print candidate buffer of the display state table <b>702</b> at the next D<b>6</b> time point is awaited, and the stored newest print candidate buffer content (the display state table of the D<b>6</b> time point of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>) is also registered in the print candidate image list.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref> shows a print candidate image corresponding to the D<b>6</b> time point, and the print candidate image of the D<b>5</b> time point of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref> is an image included in either the print candidate image at the D<b>4</b> time point, or at the D<b>6</b> time point.

<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</figref> is a print candidate image in the case of pressing the print bookmark button at the D<b>9</b> time point of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>. In this case, in the same way as described above, the composite image of the slideshow display at the timing of pressing the print bookmark does not become a print candidate, and instead the composite image of the slideshow display which does not change at the display timing of before and after D<b>8</b> and D<b>10</b>, as well as the individual images comprising the composite image, become the print candidate.</p>

<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In this way, at Step S<b>1502</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the decided print candidate image is made to be a selection option of an image to be output, and is displayed in a list so that it can be selected by a user. From here, the process advances to Step S<b>1503</b>, and the print candidate image and the number to be printed is selected. After the print images are decided in this way, the red key <b>157</b>R of the remote control apparatus <b>150</b> assigned to the print start button is pressed, and printing at Step S<b>1504</b> is performed.

<p id="p-0106" num="0105">&#x3c;Second Embodiment&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In the first embodiment, print candidate images were set to be individual images &#x201c;viewable&#x201d; at the time of pressing the print bookmark button, or individual images &#x201c;viewable&#x201d; at the time of pressing the print bookmark button and slideshow displays before and after the time of pressing the print bookmark button. However, in the second embodiment, the case of applying the print candidate selection mode <b>2</b> when displaying a randomly superimposing type slideshow display shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref>, will be described together with the flow of the process of operation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The operation of the second embodiment is an example of making all images of other slideshow displays included in &#x201c;viewable&#x201d; individual images at the time of pressing the print bookmark button, as print candidates.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In this case, not only before the pressing of a print button, but also after pressing of the print button and the slideshow display is advanced further, images of a slideshow display until all individual images immediately after the print button is pressed and which are &#x201c;viewable&#x201d; become &#x201c;hidden and not viewable, or disappeared&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">First, the slideshow display advances, and, at some time point, the user presses the print bookmark button using the remote control apparatus <b>150</b>. After starting processing, when pressing of the print bookmark button is detected at Step S<b>1601</b>, the setting content of the slideshow display is confirmed at Step S<b>1602</b>. Subsequently, the process advances to Step S<b>1603</b>, at which step the selection mode of the determination of print candidates is checked. If the selection mode of the determination of the print candidate is print candidate selection mode <b>2</b>, the process advances to Step S<b>1604</b>, and the newest display state table of the print candidate buffer is registered in the print list. However, if not a print candidate selection mode <b>2</b>, other processing is performed at Step S<b>1611</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In the case of print candidate selection mode <b>2</b>, after performing registration processing at Step S<b>1604</b>, the process advances to Step S<b>1605</b>. Then, by the display state table, the &#x201c;viewable&#x201d; individual images are checked, and registered in the display image list. Further, at Step S<b>1606</b>, it is checked whether individual images registered in the display image list is in a &#x201c;viewable&#x201d; state in a slideshow display image generated by all by all other display state tables in the print candidate buffer. Any display state table with at least one image in a &#x201c;viewable&#x201d; state is registered in the print candidate buffer.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Next, the process advances to Step S<b>1607</b>, where it is checked if the present slideshow display is in the &#x201c;display is in the middle of change&#x201d; state. If &#x201c;display is in the middle of change&#x201d;, it is investigated at Step S<b>1612</b> whether there has been storage to the print candidate buffer by the slideshow display control unit <b>502</b>. Then, in the case where there has been storage, the process advances to Step S<b>1613</b>, and the newest display state table stored in the print buffer is added to the print candidate list. The process then advances to Step S<b>1614</b>, &#x201c;viewable&#x201d; individual images are detected, and the individual images are additionally registered in the display image list. Then, after this, whether there has been storage to the print candidate buffer is checked at Step S<b>1608</b>, and, if there has been storage, the process advances to Step S<b>1609</b>. At Step S<b>1609</b>, it is determined whether there is displayed in the newest display state table stored in the print candidate buffer, &#x201c;viewable&#x201d; individual images in the display image list. And, if there is any &#x201c;viewable&#x201d; individual image, the process advances to Step S<b>1615</b>, and added to the print candidate buffer. At Step S<b>1607</b>, in the case of not being in a &#x201c;display is in the middle of change&#x201d; state, the same operation as described above is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Then, the process returns to Step S<b>1608</b>, and re-storage to the print candidate buffer is awaited. When individual images are no longer detected in the display state table, it is checked at Step S<b>1610</b> whether slideshow display is finished or not. If not finished, the process returns to Step S<b>1601</b> of detecting the print bookmark button.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In addition, if the print bookmark button is again pressed in the middle of the operation routine of the randomly superimposing type slideshow display, the process is canceled, and operation from Step S<b>1601</b> is again performed.

<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In addition, if finished in the middle of operation of the randomly superimposing type slideshow display, the display is finished at that time point, storage to the print image buffer is also finished, and generation of a print candidate list is also finished at this point. In this way, when slideshow display viewing is finished, operation is performed according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, as in the first embodiment. That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, after starting processing, the user first selects the print button from the print menu displayed at Step S<b>1501</b>, and selects the print candidate button. Then, the process advances to Step S<b>1502</b>, where the state image of the slideshow display based on the &#x201c;viewable&#x201d; individual images from the display image list, and the display state table from the print candidate list is reproduced, and displayed as a print candidate image.</p>
