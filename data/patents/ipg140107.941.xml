<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention is directed to a method for influencing the temperature of an electromechanical component and to a device for carrying out the method.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">German Patent Document DE 33 43 076 A1 discusses a device which is provided for cooling an electric motor, which is provided as a drive motor in a motor vehicle, as well as for heating the passenger compartment of a motor vehicle. Fresh air or circulating air may be supplied to the passenger compartment of the motor vehicle as well as to the electric motor. For separating the two air circuits, a heat exchanger is provided which separates cooling of the electric motor from heating the passenger compartment of the motor vehicle. The electric motor may be cooled independently from the heating of the passenger compartment and the passenger compartment may be heated to the extent to which heat is output by the electric motor.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">European Patent Document EP 596 000 B1 discusses a cooling circuit for a hybrid vehicle which contains an internal combustion engine, an electric motor, as well as a control circuit for the electric motor. After the start of the motor vehicle, the vehicle may be exclusively driven by the electric motor. The energy dissipation occurring in the control circuit and in the electric motor is used for heating the internal combustion engine for the purpose of shortening the cold-start phase of the internal combustion engine as much as possible. The cooling circuit contains a cooler which prevents an unacceptably high rise in the temperature in the cooling circuit. The cooling circuit contains a conventional coolant of the internal combustion engine as the heat carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">German Patent Document DE 199 51 735 A1 discusses a retarder system for supporting the brake of utility vehicles in which a retarder cooling circuit is provided for dissipating the heat generated in the retarder, the retarder cooling circuit containing transmission oil as the heat carrier. The transmission oil flow rate quantity may be increased or decreased independently from the transmission's operating conditions as a function of the mechanical load on the retarder for increasing the cooling performance and at the same time for lowering the temperature of the transmission oil.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A fluid-cooled internal combustion engine, which is situated in a motor vehicle for driving it, for example, is generally cooled by a coolant mixture of water and glycol, for example; the setpoint operating temperature of the internal combustion engine may be in a range of 90&#xb0; C. to 110&#xb0; C., for example.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Automatic transmissions in particular generally contain an oil pump in order to operate the actuators in the transmission via oil pressure and to ensure the lubrication of the transmission. A transmission oil cooling circuit may be provided due to the possible higher heat losses of automatic transmissions compared to normal manual transmissions. The operating temperature of a transmission is between 60&#xb0; C. and 90&#xb0; C., for example.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An object of the exemplary embodiment and/or exemplary method of the present invention is to provide a method for influencing the temperature of an electromechanical component as well as a device for carrying out the method which make a high efficiency possible.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The object may be achieved by the features described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The method according to the present invention for influencing the temperature of at least one electromechanical component situated in a motor vehicle, in which a transmission situated in the motor vehicle is cooled using transmission oil which flows in a transmission cooling circuit, in which a cooling circuit branch for influencing the temperature of the electromechanical component is also provided, in which the transmission oil also flows as a heat carrier, provides that the flow rate of the transmission oil in the cooling circuit branch for influencing the temperature of the electromechanical component is influenced as a function of the setpoint operating temperature and/or the actual operating temperature of the electromechanical component.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The setpoint operating temperature is not only considered as an entirely defined temperature, but it rather generally relates to a predefined setpoint temperature range which is also referred to in the following as the setpoint operating temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The method according to the present invention makes reaching the setpoint operating temperature of the electromechanical component as well as maintaining the setpoint operating temperature in continuous operation possible. This ensures that the electromechanical component is operated with the greatest possible efficiency which occurs at the setpoint operating temperature. In particular, the method according to the present invention makes it possible that the actual operating temperature of the electromechanical component is limited upward.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A further advantage of the method according to the present invention arises from a reduction of the necessary expenses for implementing the cooling circuits by partial use of the existing transmission cooling circuit components by the cooling circuit branch.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The method according to the present invention makes cooling as well as heating of the electromechanical component possible as a function of the temperature of the transmission oil used as the heat carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Advantageous refinements and embodiments of the method according to the present invention arise from further features described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">One embodiment provides that the flow rate of the transmission oil in the cooling circuit branch is regulated to the setpoint operating temperature of the electromechanical component. Due to this measure, maintaining the setpoint operating temperature in continuous operation is ensured. In particular, sufficient cooling of the electromechanical component may always be achieved using this measure.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">One embodiment, which results in component savings, provides that the transmission oil flowing in the cooling circuit branch is withdrawn from the transmission cooling circuit. This reduces the expenses for pipes and/or hoses in particular.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">One embodiment provides that the flow rate of the transmission oil in the cooling circuit branch is influenced independently from the flow rate in the transmission cooling circuit. Using this measure, the options for influencing the temperature of the transmission on the one hand and of the electromechanical component on the other hand are separated from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Another embodiment provides that the flow rate of the transmission oil in the cooling circuit branch is influenced as a function of the difference between the actual temperature of the electromechanical component and the transmission oil temperature. This measure ensures that, at a transmission oil temperature which is too high, the electromechanical component is not heated to a temperature above the setpoint operating temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">One embodiment provides that the transmission oil heated by the transmission is used for increasing the temperature of an electromechanical component which has an optimum degree of efficiency at a higher setpoint operating temperature compared to the ambient temperature. It is generally to be assumed that heating of the transmission has priority so that this embodiment advantageously becomes relevant only when the transmission setpoint operating temperature has already been reached or even a decrease of the temperature of the transmission oil is necessary. The heat loss occurring in the transmission may then be used to bring the electromechanical component to its setpoint operating temperature as quickly as possible and thus into the temperature range of the highest degree of efficiency. If heating of the electromechanical component due to its heat loss takes place quicker than heating of the transmission, a corresponding increase in the temperature in the transmission to the transmission setpoint operating temperature using the heat loss of the electromechanical component is already ensured due to the connection of the two cooling circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The device according to the present invention for carrying out the method initially concerns a control unit which is designed for carrying out the method. The control unit may contain at least one electrical memory in which the method steps are stored as a computer program.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">An advantageous embodiment of the device according to the present invention provides that the electromechanical component is at least one electric motor. The electric motor may be used as a drive motor in a motor vehicle, for example. In particular, a hybrid vehicle which contains at least one internal combustion engine in addition to the at least one electric motor may be operated with a high degree of efficiency using the approach according to the exemplary embodiment and/or exemplary method of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">One embodiment provides that the electric motor drives at least one oil pump for the transmission oil in the cooling circuit branch and/or in the transmission cooling circuit for providing the flow rate. Using this measure, a separate drive for sustaining the flow rate is dispensed with.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Simple implementation of the device according to the present invention is made possible by the fact that a control valve which influences the flow rate in the cooling circuit branch as a function of the actual temperature of the electromechanical component is situated in the transmission cooling circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">An alternative embodiment provides that the cooling circuit branch contains a separate oil pump with which the flow rate in the cooling circuit branch may be influenced independently from the flow rate in the transmission cooling circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A further embodiment provides the use of at least one oil cooler which possibly has a bypass. Sufficient cooling performance of both the transmission cooling circuit and the cooling circuit branch may be ensured through this measure in particular.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Additional advantageous refinements and embodiments of the approach according to the present invention arise from the additional features described herein and from the following description.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a transmission cooling circuit <b>10</b> and a cooling circuit branch <b>11</b>. Transmission cooling circuit <b>10</b> is provided for influencing the temperature of a transmission <b>12</b> and cooling circuit branch <b>11</b> is provided for influencing the temperature of an electromechanical component <b>13</b>. Both cooling circuits <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> contain transmission oil <b>14</b> as a heat carrier which is collected in an oil sump <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A first oil pump <b>16</b>, which intakes transmission oil <b>14</b> via an intake line <b>17</b> and conveys it to a valve <b>18</b>, is provided for making a flow rate of transmission oil <b>14</b> available in both cooling circuits <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>. Valve <b>18</b>, operated by an actuator <b>19</b>, conveys the transmission oil to a control valve <b>22</b> via an oil cooler <b>20</b> and/or via a bypass <b>21</b> bypassing oil cooler <b>20</b>. Control valve <b>22</b>, operated by a second actuator <b>23</b>, divides the transmission oil between transmission cooling circuit <b>10</b> and cooling circuit branch <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Line <b>24</b>, between electromechanical component <b>13</b> and control valve <b>22</b>, symbolizes a thermal connection between electromechanical component <b>13</b> and control valve <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Electromechanical component <b>13</b> is connected to a load (not shown in detail) to be operated or driven by electromechanical component <b>13</b> via a first clutch <b>25</b> and mechanically connected to a first oil pump <b>16</b> via a second clutch <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The temperature of electromechanical component <b>13</b> is detected by a first temperature sensor <b>30</b>, the temperature of transmission oil <b>14</b> in oil sump <b>15</b> is detected by a second temperature sensor <b>31</b>, and the temperature upstream from control valve <b>22</b> and downstream from oil cooler <b>20</b> is detected by a third temperature sensor <b>32</b>. Temperature sensors <b>30</b> through <b>32</b> are connected to control unit <b>33</b> which emits a first actuating signal <b>34</b> to first actuator <b>19</b> and a second actuating signal <b>35</b> to second actuator <b>23</b>.</p>

The essential difference between the exemplary embodiments is the fact that cooling circuit branch <b>11</b> of the second exemplary embodiment has a separate oil pump <b>40</b>. Moreover, first oil pump <b>16</b> is driven by an oil pump drive <b>41</b> which receives a control signal <b>42</b> provided by control unit <b>33</b>. In contrast to the first exemplary embodiment, control valve <b>22</b> is omitted. The second mechanical clutch connects electromechanical component <b>13</b> to separate oil pump <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a flow chart of the method according to the present invention which starts according to a first function block <b>50</b> with a detection of actual temperature T_actual of electromechanical component <b>13</b>. In a first query <b>51</b> it is checked whether actual operating temperature T_actual of electromechanical component <b>13</b> is lower than its setpoint operating temperature T_setpoint.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">If this is the case, it is checked in a second query <b>52</b> whether transmission oil temperature T_oil_nK&#xfc; downstream from oil cooler <b>20</b> is higher than actual operating temperature T_actual of electronic component <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">If this not the case, the program jumps to a second function block <b>53</b> according to which the flow rate in cooling circuit branch <b>11</b> is reduced. If this is the case, the program jumps to a third function block <b>54</b> according to which the flow rate in cooling circuit branch <b>11</b> is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">If it is ascertained in first query <b>51</b> that actual operating temperature T_actual is not lower than setpoint operating temperature T_setpoint, it is ascertained in a third query <b>55</b> whether actual operating temperature T_actual is higher than setpoint operating temperature T_setpoint. If this is not the case, the flow rate in cooling circuit branch <b>11</b> remains unchanged according to a fourth function block <b>56</b>. If this is the case, it is checked in a fourth query <b>57</b> whether transmission oil temperature T_oil_nK&#xfc; downstream from oil cooler <b>20</b> is lower than actual operating temperature T_actual. If this is not the case, the program branches to second function block <b>53</b>. At the same time, measures provided in a fifth function block <b>58</b> are taken for lowering transmission oil temperature T_oil_nK&#xfc; downstream from oil cooler <b>20</b>. If transmission oil temperature T_oil_nK&#xfc; downstream from oil cooler <b>20</b> is lower than actual operating temperature T_actual, the program jumps to third function block <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The method according to the present invention works as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Transmission oil cooling circuit <b>10</b> is provided for influencing the temperature of transmission <b>12</b>. Transmission oil cooling circuit <b>10</b> is provided in particular for cooling transmission <b>12</b> in order to hold transmission <b>12</b> in continuous operation at a transmission setpoint operating temperature which is between 60&#xb0; C. and 90&#xb0; C., for example. Transmission cooling circuit <b>10</b> contains intake line <b>17</b> which aspires transmission oil <b>14</b> which is collected in oil sump <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Transmission oil <b>14</b> flowing in intake line <b>17</b> may be cooled in oil cooler <b>20</b>. Oil cooler <b>20</b> is a heat exchanger, for example, which dissipates the heat into the ambient air. Oil cooler <b>20</b> may be a heat exchanger which dissipates the heat to another coolant such as the coolant of an internal combustion engine (not shown in detail).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to one refinement it may be provided that transmission oil <b>14</b> bypasses oil cooler <b>20</b> via bypass <b>21</b> at low temperatures. The division of transmission oil <b>14</b> between oil cooler <b>20</b> and/or bypass <b>21</b> is carried out by valve <b>18</b> which is actuated by first actuator <b>19</b> which is controlled by first control signal <b>34</b> which is provided by control unit <b>33</b> as a function of, in particular, transmission oil temperature T_oil_nK&#xfc; downstream from oil cooler <b>20</b> detected by third temperature sensor <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Via control valve <b>22</b>, transmission oil <b>14</b> reaches transmission <b>12</b> whose temperature is to be influenced, in particular to be lowered. For example, control valve <b>22</b> is actuated as a function of second control signal <b>35</b>, second control signal <b>35</b> being a function of the temperature of electromechanical component <b>13</b> in particular which is detected by first temperature sensor <b>30</b>, for example. Instead of measuring the temperature of electromechanical component <b>13</b>, the operating temperature of electromechanical component <b>13</b> may be estimated in control unit <b>33</b> as a function of electrical operating parameters and/or the operating time of electromechanical component <b>13</b> and/or the ambient temperature and/or additional variables known to control unit <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Second actuator <b>23</b> is omitted according to one advantageous embodiment. Control valve <b>22</b> may be designed as a thermovalve, for example, which is thermally connected to electromechanical component <b>13</b>. The thermal connection is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> with line <b>24</b>. Due to the thermal connection, control valve <b>22</b> divides transmission oil <b>14</b> between transmission <b>20</b> and electromechanical component <b>13</b> as a function of actual temperature T_actual of electromechanical component <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The flow rate in cooling circuit branch <b>11</b> may be regulated in such a way that the predefined setpoint operating temperature T_setpoint of electromechanical component <b>13</b> is maintained in order to keep electromechanical component <b>13</b> in continuous operation in the range of its optimum degree of efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">If the temperature of electromechanical component <b>13</b> is below setpoint operating temperature T_setpoint and the transmission oil temperature is higher, it may be provided according to one embodiment that transmission oil <b>14</b>, flowing in cooling circuit branch <b>11</b>, is used for quickly heating electromechanical component <b>13</b> to setpoint operating temperature T_setpoint. This measure may be provided in particular when the transmission setpoint operating temperature has already been reached. For this purpose, control valve <b>22</b> is operated in particular as a function of the difference between the transmission oil temperature and actual temperature T_actual and as a function of setpoint operating temperature T_setpoint.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In first query <b>51</b> it is ascertained whether actual operating temperature T_actual is lower than setpoint operating temperature T_setpoint. If this is the case, it is checked in second query <b>52</b> whether transmission oil temperature T_oil_nK&#xfc; downstream from oil cooler <b>20</b> is higher than actual operating temperature T_actual. If this is not the case, the program branches to second function block <b>53</b> according to which the flow rate in cooling circuit branch <b>11</b> is reduced in order to not cool down electromechanical component <b>13</b> to an unnecessary extent. However, if this is the case, the flow-through in cooling circuit branch <b>11</b> may be increased according to third function block <b>54</b> in order to increase the temperature of electromechanical component <b>13</b> to setpoint operating temperature T_setpoint as quickly as possible. As mentioned earlier, this measure is only meaningful when the transmission setpoint operating temperature has already been reached and additional heat energy is available.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">If it is ascertained in first query <b>51</b> that actual operating temperature T_actual is not lower than setpoint operating temperature T_setpoint, it is furthermore checked in third query <b>55</b> whether actual operating temperature T_actual is higher than setpoint operating temperature T_setpoint. This check is particularly appropriate when setpoint operating temperature T_setpoint corresponds to a predefined setpoint temperature range, so that there may be a larger range in which actual operating temperature T_actual is equal to setpoint operating temperature T_setpoint. If this is the case, the program branches to fourth function block <b>56</b> according to which the flow rate in the cooling circuit branch remains unchanged since electromechanical component <b>13</b> has reached and should continue to maintain its setpoint operating temperature T_setpoint.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">However, if it is ascertained in third query <b>55</b> that actual operating temperature T_actual is higher than setpoint operating temperature T_setpoint, it is checked in fourth query <b>57</b> whether transmission oil temperature T_oil_nK&#xfc; downstream from oil cooler <b>20</b> is lower than actual operating temperature T_actual. If this not the case, the program branches back to function block <b>53</b> according to which the flow rate in cooling circuit branch <b>11</b> is reduced in order to not further increase actual operating temperature T_actual which is already too high. However, if it is ascertained in fourth query <b>57</b> that transmission oil temperature T_oil_nK&#xfc; downstream from oil cooler <b>20</b> is lower than actual operating temperature T_actual, the program branches to second function block <b>54</b> according to which an increase in the flow rate in cooling circuit branch <b>11</b> is provided for cooling electromechanical component <b>13</b> down to setpoint operating temperature T_setpoint.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Based on a measurement or at least an estimation of actual operating temperature T_actual of electromechanical component <b>13</b> and/or possibly the transmission oil temperature in oil sump <b>15</b> and possibly transmission oil temperature T_oil_nK&#xfc; downstream from oil cooler <b>20</b>, setpoint operating temperature T_setpoint of electromechanical component <b>13</b> may be regulated instead of being controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">According to an exemplary embodiment, at least one electric motor is provided as electromechanical component <b>13</b> which may be used as a drive motor in a motor vehicle. This makes it possible to design the motor vehicle as a hybrid motor vehicle which contains in addition to the at least one drive electric motor at least one internal combustion engine which may, on the one hand, provide drive power and, on the other hand, electrical power for charging a battery. The use of electromechanical component <b>13</b> for driving a motor vehicle is symbolically indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> by first mechanical clutch <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to one embodiment it is provided that electromechanical component <b>13</b>, designed as an electric motor, drives first oil pump <b>16</b> via second mechanical clutch <b>26</b>, so that a separate drive for first oil pump <b>16</b> may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">If actual temperature T_actual of electromechanical component <b>13</b> to be cooled is already in the range of its setpoint temperature T_setpoint, but the temperature of transmission <b>12</b> is still below the transmission setpoint operating temperature, transmission cooling circuit <b>10</b> may then be used in a targeted manner for increasing the temperature of transmission <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, cooling circuit branch <b>11</b> contains separate oil pump <b>40</b> which may be operated independently from first oil pump <b>16</b>. While in this exemplary embodiment separate oil pump <b>40</b> may be driven via second mechanical clutch <b>26</b> of electromechanical component <b>13</b> designed as an electric motor, oil pump drive <b>41</b>, an electric motor for example, may be provided for driving first oil pump <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Also in this exemplary embodiment, regulation of setpoint operating temperature T_setpoint may be provided in which actual operating temperature T_actual is either measured or at least estimated using first temperature sensor <b>30</b>. In addition, the temperature of transmission oil <b>14</b> in oil sump <b>15</b> and in particular transmission oil temperature T_oil_nK&#xfc; downstream from oil cooler <b>20</b> which may be either measured or at least estimated using third temperature sensor <b>32</b> may be taken into account.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Due to separate oil pump <b>40</b>, control valve <b>22</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is omitted. The essential advantage obtained thereby is that the flow rate in cooling circuit branch <b>11</b> may be set independently from the flow rate in transmission cooling circuit <b>10</b>. Control and regulation to setpoint operating temperature T_setpoint of electromechanical component <b>13</b> according to the second exemplary embodiment corresponds again to control and regulation to setpoint operating temperature T_setpoint explained based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, so that in this exemplary embodiment also either cooling or possibly heating of the transmission as well as of electromechanical component <b>13</b> is possible.</p>
