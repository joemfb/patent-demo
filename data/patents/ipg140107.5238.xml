<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/913,562, filed Apr. 24, 2007, which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The various embodiments of the present invention relate generally to a method and computer program product for distinguishing and sorting seeds that contain genetic elements of interest from seeds that do not. More specifically, embodiments of the present invention are capable of distinguishing and sorting the seeds containing the genetic elements of interest by detecting the presence of one or more discernable markers that are linked to one or more corresponding genetic elements of interest.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Genetic engineering involves inserting new genetic information into existing cells of an organism to create a new genotype in order to modify the organism for the purpose of changing one or more of its characteristics. A living organism may be genetically engineered for a variety of reasons, including incorporating novel and/or beneficial traits into the organism. With regard to crop plants, this may include genetically engineering seeds so that plants that grow from the seeds include one or more beneficial traits. Such genetic engineering may include, but is not limited to, inserting genes encoding a discernable marker or genes conferring resistance to herbicidal compounds. The progeny of individual genetically modified organisms may also contain a genetic element of interest such that researchers may wish to segregate and/or identify organisms (including seeds) that contain such genetic elements of interest from a bulk sample.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional genetic techniques may also be used to combine traits from at least two organisms to produce novel and/or beneficial traits in a &#x201c;genetic cross&#x201d; and/or hybrid organism.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is often difficult to determine whether a particular seed contains a genetic element of interest, especially when mixed with seeds that have not been so modified. Using previous techniques, a particular seed would have to be germinated and then the resulting plant sampled to determine whether the seed might contain the genetic element of interest. Alternatively, the seed itself would have to be sampled.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There are advantages, however, in distinguishing a set of seeds containing a genetic element of interest before the respective plants are germinated, especially in the plant research discipline, where research plot space, personnel for sorting, and time are often limited. In maize and other wind-pollinated crops, plants are frequently hand-pollinated, wherein pollen is manually transferred from the tassel to the silk, and the silk is covered by a shoot bag to prevent pollinated by other plants. This hand pollination process requires significant labor and a tassel bag and shoot bag. The prior elimination of undesired plants (i.e. plants that do not contain a genetic element of interest) by sorting seed may eliminate the need for this labor and time-intensive activity. Additionally, researchers may be interested in the yield potential of the plants germinated from seeds containing the genetic element of interest. Thus, it is important that a statistically-significant number of plants germinate from seeds containing the genetic element of interest in a defined space (i.e. a research plot). Furthermore, researchers desire accuracy and often cannot afford to wait or guess to determine whether plants contain a particular genetic element of interest. Additionally, seed and/or seed tissue sampling is a delicate art. For example, if too much tissue is removed from a particular seed for sampling, there is a risk that the seed may not germinate or produce a viable plant.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Some processes have been disclosed for visualizing green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in transgenic plants in order to select transgenic seeds as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,947,144 to Kim et al. In particular, the Kim reference describes a system for separating seeds transformed with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) that includes a light source 5&#x2032; filtered through a bandpass filter 6&#x2032;. The light source 5&#x2032; is positioned above and at a 45&#xb0; angle from plant samples traveling on a conveyor belt 3&#x2032;. A CCD camera 9&#x2032; is also positioned above the conveyor belt 3&#x2032;, directly above the examined plant sample 4&#x2032;. The CCD camera 9&#x2032; detects light generated from a portion of the surface area of the plant sample through a filter 7&#x2032;. See, e.g., the Kim reference, FIG. 9.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, the system disclosed by the Kim reference suffers from several insufficiencies. For example, there are a number of different traits, including the expression of fluorescent proteins, for which the accurate measurement of a seed in more than a portion of the surface area of the seed may be important. In some instances, the expression of a fluorescent protein may not be uniform across entire surface area of a seed. Thus, if a localized area of the seed expresses the fluorescent protein and that area is facing downward (such as against the conveyor belt in the Kim reference) the CCD camera will not detect the fluorescent protein and the seed will not be correctly sorted.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, the use of GFP for identification and/or selection of transgenic plant material presents several technical challenges. First of all, the excitation and emission wavelengths for GFP visualization are on the fringes of the visible spectrum, and are therefore not easily visible to the eye (or to many conventional visualization systems) using normal &#x201c;white&#x201d; light that is present in conventional research and/or manufacturing environments. Furthermore, it has been noted that GFP may result in protein aggregation in vivo in plant material that has been tagged with GFP. It is well-known that unchecked protein aggregation may not only produce adverse effects in seed product, but may also produce unwanted environmental effects if GFP-tagged seeds are introduced into an agricultural environment that interacts with external ecological systems (such as forests and/or wetlands adjacent to an agricultural research plot).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As a result, there is a need for a method and computer program product for distinguishing seeds that contain a marker associated with a selected genotype from a bulk sample of seeds. The method and computer program product should permit a bulk sample to be sorted based on the presence of the marker or the absence of the marker, and should provide a level of convenience, accuracy, speed and environmental safety that is not available using conventional techniques. Additionally, the method and computer program product should provide the ability to accurately sort a bulk sample of seeds based on the presence or absence of markers associated with a selected genotype using commercially-available high-speed sorting equipment with minimal modifications.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The embodiments of the present invention satisfy the needs listed above and provide other advantages as described below. Some embodiments of the present invention may include a method for distinguishing seeds containing a genetic element of interest from a bulk sample by associating a discernable marker with at least some of the seeds containing a genetic element of interest of the bulk sample, evaluating at least some of the seeds of the bulk sample for the presence or absence of the marker using an evaluating device, and sorting the seeds containing a genetic element of interest based on the presence or absence of the marker.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments the seeds are excited using an electromagnetic energy emitting device configured to excite a majority of the surface area of the seeds. In some embodiments, exciting the seeds using an electromagnetic energy emitting device comprises exciting the seeds using at least one illuminating device configured to illuminate a majority of the surface area of the seeds. In some embodiments, exciting the seeds using at least one illuminating device further comprises using two or more illuminating devices arranged to collectively illuminate a majority of the surface area of the seeds. In some embodiments, evaluating at least some of the seeds of the bulk comprises evaluating at least some of the seeds of the bulk sample using at least one image sensing device arranged to receive emissions from a majority of the surface area of the seeds. In some embodiments, evaluating at least some of the seeds of the bulk sample further comprises using two or more image sensing devices arranged to collectively receive emissions from a majority of the surface area of the seeds.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Other embodiments of the present invention may include a method and computer program product for distinguishing seeds containing a genetic element of interest from a bulk sample by associating a discernable red fluorescent protein (RFP) marker with at least some of the seeds containing a genetic element of interest of the bulk sample, evaluating at least some of the seeds of the bulk sample for the presence or absence of the RFP marker using an evaluating device, and sorting the seeds containing a genetic element of interest based on the presence or absence of the RFP marker.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the RFP marker is discernable when excited by a certain energy having a wavelength ranging from substantially about 500 nm to substantially about 580 nm. In some such embodiments, the certain energy may have a peak at substantially about 550 nm. In other embodiments, the evaluating step comprises exciting the seeds containing a genetic element of interest with the certain energy; and detecting an emission resulting at least in part from the exciting step. In some such embodiments, the resulting emission may have a wavelength ranging from substantially about 500 nm to substantially about 600 nm. Furthermore, the emission may have a peak at substantially about 580 nm. In some embodiments, the evaluating device may further comprise at least one filter disposed substantially between the image sensing device and the seeds containing a genetic element of interest. The filter may be configured for passing the emission from the red fluorescent protein marker to the image sensing device.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Some embodiments may further comprise associating a plurality of supplemental markers with at least some of the seeds containing a corresponding plurality of additional genetic elements of interest of the bulk sample. Such embodiments may further comprise steps for evaluating at least one of the seeds of the bulk sample for the presence or absence of the plurality of supplemental markers using the evaluating device, and sorting the seeds containing the plurality of additional genetic elements of interest based on the presence or absence of the a plurality of supplemental markers. In such embodiments, the supplemental markers may include, but are not limited to: yellow fluorescent proteins; yellow/orange fluorescent proteins; orange fluorescent proteins; orange/red fluorescent proteins; red/orange fluorescent proteins; red fluorescent proteins; cyan fluorescent proteins; and combinations of such supplemental markers.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, the evaluating device may be a seed color sorter. In other embodiments, the image sensing device may be a charge-coupled device (CCD device) or a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) device. In other embodiments, the evaluating step comprises evaluating seeds for the presence of a RFP marker using at least one image sensing device configured to differentiate between a range of normal seed emissions and the discernable RFP marker. In other embodiments, the sorting step may comprise dispensing the sorted individual seeds into at least one container, the container including only seeds having the RFP marker present or only seeds in which the RFP marker is absent.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Other embodiments further comprise steps for singulating individual seeds from the bulk sample using a singulating device. In some embodiments, the singulating step comprises singulating seeds using a plurality of elongate hollow structures operatively connected to a vacuum source. In other embodiments, the singulating step comprises receiving the bulk sample in a hopper and vibrating the hopper so as to propel individual seeds along an inclined spiral ramp and through a gap configured to permit the passage of one seed at a time. In other embodiments, the singulating step comprises receiving the bulk sample in a hopper, feeding seeds from the hopper to a rotatable disk, and rotating the rotatable disk so as to distribute the seeds to a periphery of the rotatable disk by application of centrifugal force. In other embodiments, the singulating step comprises receiving the bulk sample in a hopper, vibrating the bulk sample such that seeds tend to move towards an opening in the hopper, distributing seeds from the opening in the hopper to a sloped device that includes at least one groove such that a line of individual seeds is formed in the groove, and depositing individual seeds by gravity force from the sloped device onto a conveying device.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Thus the various embodiments of distinguishing seeds containing a genetic element of interest of the present invention provide many advantages that may include, but are not limited to: providing a method and computer program product capable of permitting a bulk sample of seeds to be sorted based on the presence or absence of a marker or multiple RFP markers, associated with a selected genotype, or multiple selected genotypes. The present invention provides a level of convenience, speed, accuracy, and environmental safety that is not available using conventional techniques. Additionally, the present invention provides additional processing of the sorted seeds, including dispensing the sorted seeds into containers.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all embodiments of the invention are shown. Indeed, this invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Under current methods, it is difficult to distinguish, prior to germination, seeds that contain a genetic element of interest from seeds that do not contain such elements. To address this concern, various embodiments of the present invention provide a method and computer program product that sorts seeds based at least in part on the relationship between a discernable marker and one or more seeds containing a genetic element of interest. For the purposes of the current specification and the appended claims, the term &#x201c;discernable&#x201d; refers to an ability to recognize a marker when excited by certain energy. In various embodiments, this may include the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, as well as Ultraviolet and Infrared spectrums.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a flowchart illustrating a method <b>10</b> for distinguishing seeds containing a genetic element of interest from a bulk sample. In step <b>12</b>, a marker is associated with at least a portion of seeds containing a genetic element of interest from the bulk sample. In various embodiments, associating a marker with at least a portion of seeds containing a genetic element of interest may comprise a variety of techniques used to mark a desired genotype. In an exemplary embodiment, associating a marker with at least a portion of seeds containing a genetic element of interest comprises attaching DNA sequences that code for red fluorescent protein (RFP) to a desired trait DNA sequence that is inserted into a seed or a group of seeds. It should be noted that although the exemplary embodiment described below associates an RFP marker with a desired trait, in other embodiments multiple fluorescent protein (FP) markers may be associated with a desired trait DNA sequence or multiple desired trait DNA sequences in the same seed. Such additional FP markers may include, but are not limited to: yellow; yellow/orange; orange; orange/red, red/orange; red (including the RFP described herein); and cyan. In other embodiments, the marker may comprise phenotypic markers such as &#x3b2;-galactosidase and fluorescent proteins such as cyan florescent protein (CYP) (Bolte et al. (2004) <i>J. Cell Science </i>117:943-54 and Kato et al. (2002) <i>Plant Physiol </i>129:913-42), and yellow florescent protein (PhiYFP&#x2122; from Evrogen, see, Bolte et al. (2004) <i>J. Cell Science </i>117:943-54). For additional selectable markers, see generally, Yarranton (1992) <i>Curr. Opin. Biotech. </i>3:506-511; Christopherson et al. (1992) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In other embodiments, the marker may also comprise a selectable marker gene for the selection of transformed cells.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The above lists are not meant to be limiting. Any desired trait and marker may be used in the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In various embodiments, the desired trait DNA sequence may correspond substantially to any trait desired to be inserted into a plant genome.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one exemplary embodiment, the marker associated with at least a portion of seeds containing a genetic element of interest from the bulk sample in step <b>12</b> may comprise a RFP marker such as the DsRed and/or DsRed2 RFP markers from the Living Colors&#x2122; line of novel fluorescent proteins (NFP) commercially available from Clontech Laboratories, Inc. of Mountain View, Calif. The use of RFP as the marker may provide several advantages over other fluorescent protein markers (such as green fluorescent protein (GFP)). For example, unlike GFP, RFP excitation and emission wavelengths are closer to a center of the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Therefore, RFP-expressing seed may be visible to the eye (and unassisted and/or unmodified cameras or other sensor devices) in &#x2018;normal&#x2019; ambient white light. Thus, seed sorting (step <b>16</b>, for example) may be accomplished in such embodiments without the need for specialized UV light sources and/or detectors. Furthermore, many commercially available and industry-proven high-speed sorting devices operate most effectively in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Again as above, since RFP excitation and emission wavelengths are predominantly centered in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum, sorting (step <b>16</b>) may be accomplished using existing and readily-available equipment as an add-on to the current use for more standard quality sorting procedures. Furthermore, RFP (and specifically DsRed2) markers are optimized for minimal protein aggregation, such that the marker may avoid issues with in vivo protein aggregation that may affect product performance (i.e. seed viability and/or yield) as well as produce potentially negative environmental effects that run counter to principles of product stewardship.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Step <b>12</b> may comprise, in some embodiments, associating the RFP marker with one or more desired trait DNA sequences that may be inserted into a seed or a group of seeds. For example, genetically engineered plants and/or seeds may contain beneficial traits of interest such as one or more genes expressing peptides with pesticidal and/or insecticidal activity, such as Bt toxic proteins (described in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,277,905; 5,366,892; 5,747,450; 5,723,756; 5,859,336; 5,593,881; 5,625,136; 5,689,052; 5,691,308; 5,188,960; 6,180,774; 6,023,013; 6,218,188; 6,342,660; 6,114,608; and 7,030,295; US Publication Nos: US20040199939 and US20060085870; WO2004086868; and Geiser et al. (1986) <i>Gene </i>48:109) and Bt crystal proteins of the Cry34 and Cry35 classes (see, e.g., Schnepf et al. (2005) <i>Appl. Environ. Microbiol. </i>71:1765-1774), and vegetative insecticidal proteins (for example, members of the VIP1, VIP2, or VIP3 classes, see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,849,870; 5,877,012; 5,889,174; 5,990,383; 6,107,279; 6,137,033; 6,291,156; 6,429,360; as well as U.S. Pat. App. Publication Nos: US20050210545; US20040133942; and US20020078473), lectins (Van Damme et al. (1994) <i>Plant Mol. Biol. </i>24:825, pentin (described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,981,722), lipases (lipid acyl hydrolases, see, e.g., those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,657,046 and 5,743,477), cholesterol oxidases from <i>Streptomyces</i>, and pesticidal proteins derived from <i>Xenorhabdus </i>and <i>Photorhabdus </i>bacteria species, <i>Bacillus laterosporus </i>species, and <i>Bacillus sphaericus </i>species, and the like. Also contemplated is the use of chimeric (hybrid) toxins (see, e.g., Bosch et al. (1994) <i>Bio/Technology </i>12:915-918).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Genetically engineered plants and/or seeds thereof can also contain one or more genes with a variety of desired trait combinations including, but not limited to, traits desirable for animal feed such as high oil genes (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,232,529); balanced amino acids (e.g., hordothionins (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,990,389; 5,885,801; 5,885,802; and 5,703,049); barley high lysine (Williamson et al. (1987) <i>Eur. J. Biochem. </i>165:99-106; and WO 98/20122) and high methionine proteins (Pedersen et al. (1986) <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>261:6279; Kirihara et al. (1988) <i>Gene </i>71:359; and Musumura et al. (1989) <i>Plant Mol. Biol. </i>12:123)); increased digestibility (e.g., modified storage proteins (U.S. Pat. No. 6,858,778); and thioredoxins (U.S. Pat. No. 7,009,087)). Such plants can also contain one or more genes resulting in traits desirable for disease resistance (e.g., fumonisin detoxification genes (U.S. Pat. No. 5,792,931); avirulence and disease resistance genes (Jones et al. (1994) <i>Science </i>266:789; Martin et al. (1993) <i>Science </i>262:1432; Mindrinos et al. (1994) <i>Cell </i>78:1089).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Genetically modified plants may further contain one or more genes encoding one or more forms of herbicide resistance, for example, to glyphosate-N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine (including the isopropylamine salt form of such herbicide). Exemplary herbicide resistance genes include glyphosate N-acetyltransferase (GAT) and 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), including those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Application Publication Nos: US20040082770, also WO02/36782 and WO03/092360). Herbicide resistance genes generally code for a modified target protein insensitive to the herbicide or for an enzyme that degrades or detoxifies the herbicide in the plant before it can act. See, e.g., DeBlock et al. (1987) <i>EMBO J. </i>6:2513; DeBlock et al. (1989) <i>Plant Physiol. </i>91:691; Fromm et al. (1990) <i>BioTechnology </i>8:833; Gordon-Kamm et al. (1990) <i>Plant Cell </i>2:603; and Frisch et al. (1995) <i>Plant Mol. Biol. </i>27:405-9. For example, resistance to glyphosate or sulfonylurea herbicides has been obtained using genes coding for the mutant target enzymes, EPSPS and acetolactate synthase (ALS). Resistance to glufosinate ammonium, bromoxynil, and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate (2,4-D) have been obtained by using bacterial genes encoding phosphinothricin acetyltransferase, a nitrilase, or a 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate monooxygenase, which detoxify the respective herbicides. Also contemplated are inhibitors of glutamine synthase such as phosphinothricin or basta (e.g., bar gene).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Transgenic plants and/or seeds may also contain one or more genes resulting in traits desirable for processing or process products such as modified oils (e.g., fatty acid desaturase genes (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,952,544; 6,372,965)); modified starches (e.g., ADPG pyrophosphorylases (AGPase), starch synthases (SS), starch branching enzymes (SBE), and starch debranching enzymes (SDBE)); and polymers or bioplastics (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,602,321; beta-ketothiolase, polyhydroxybutyrate synthase, and acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (Schubert et al. (1988) <i>J. Bacteriol. </i>170:5837-5847)). Such plants could also contain one or more genes providing agronomic traits such as male sterility (e.g., see U.S. Pat. No. 5,583,210), stalk strength, flowering time, or transformation technology traits such as cell cycle regulation or gene targeting (e.g., WO 99/61619, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,518,487 and 6,187,994).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In step <b>14</b>, the seeds from the bulk sample are evaluated for the presence or absence of the RFP marker. In various embodiments, this step <b>14</b> may comprise visually determining whether the RFP marker is present or absent in a seed or a group of seeds. In an exemplary embodiment, step <b>14</b> comprises exciting seeds from the bulk sample with a certain energy and then determining whether the RFP marker is present.

In the exemplary embodiment, the vision system <b>54</b> comprises an illuminating device, at least one sensing device, and a controller configured to control the illuminating and sensing devices.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the exemplary embodiment, the illuminating device comprises a light source that uses a bulb configured to emit electromagnetic radiation at a wavelength spectrum that illuminates the RFP marker. In other embodiments, the light source may be any light source that permits the image sensing device to discern the RFP marker.

The exemplary embodiment includes multiple CCD cameras with filters (i.e. red band-pass filters) configured to enhance the illumination and to aid in discerning the presence of the RFP marker. Although other embodiments may use fewer cameras, the exemplary embodiment allows seeds falling past the vision system <b>54</b> to be viewed from the front and back.

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Step <b>16</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> relates to sorting the seeds containing a genetic element of interest based on the presence or absence of the marker.

Seeds exhibiting the RFP marker are sorted into containers <b>56</b>, identified in the figure with a &#x201c;+&#x201d; symbol. Seeds that do not contain the marker fall into containers <b>58</b>, identified in the figure with a &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; symbol.

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The above described method allows the processing of a large quantity of seeds, a portion of which include a marker that is associated with a genetically transformed seed including a desired trait.

Although the exemplary embodiment described above may accommodate these situations, in other instances it may be advantageous to evaluate seeds on a seed-by-seed basis. As a result, in various embodiments, the present invention contemplates singulating seeds from a bulk sample prior to evaluating the seeds for the presence or absence of a marker or a group of markers associated with a desired trait or group of traits.</p>

Specifically, the system <b>100</b> of the exemplary embodiment includes a hopper <b>102</b> into which a bulk sample A of seeds may be placed. A rotating drum <b>104</b> is positioned adjacent the hopper <b>102</b>. The rotating drum <b>104</b> includes a plurality of elongate hollow structures <b>106</b> that extend into a substantially hollow interior of the drum <b>104</b>, which is connected to a vacuum source (not shown). The vacuum source creates a zone of negative pressure within the interior of the drum <b>104</b>, and as a result, distal ends of the elongate hollow structures <b>106</b> create discrete areas of negative pressure. As shown in the figure, the drum <b>104</b> rotates adjacent an open end of the hopper <b>102</b>. The hopper <b>102</b> is configured such that seeds are urged toward the open end and adjacent the rotating drum <b>104</b>. The drum <b>104</b> rotates in the direction shown such that the elongate hollow structures <b>106</b> pass through a portion of the seeds of the bulk sample A adjacent the drum <b>104</b>. As the elongate hollow structures <b>106</b> rotate through the bulk sample A, the discrete areas of negative pressure located at the distal ends of the elongate hollow structures <b>106</b> attract individual seeds <b>101</b>. The size of the distal ends of each of the elongate hollow structures <b>106</b> is configured such the discrete area of negative pressure at the distal end of each of the hollow structures <b>106</b> attracts a single seed <b>101</b>.

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The following Experimental Example is provided only by way of example, and not by way of limitation.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Experimental Example</heading>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Introduction</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Fluorescent protein (FP) marked seed are being produced for use in sterility systems and for evaluating the impact of one or more inserted genes on yield. It is a laborious process to separate a segregating population of seed into those containing (+) and those not containing (&#x2212;) a genetic element of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">A project was initiated to develop an automated sorting routine that may be capable of efficiently separating FP+ from FP&#x2212; seed using a vibratory feeder similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref></p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Results</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">A vibratory feeder (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, for example) was evaluated with the Satake ScanMaster&#xae; system to assess sorting speed and accuracy in some embodiments of the present invention. It is known that it takes approximately 30 minutes to sort 3500 kernels by hand. The FP-discerning ScanMaster&#xae; (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, for example) equipped with a vibratory feeder (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, for example) for singulation, was shown to be capable of sorting the same sample in about 2 to 3 minutes. Thus, the substantially automated method embodiments of the present invention reduced sorting time by approximately 90%. Unfortunately, the ScanMaster&#xae; color sorter was only able to remove 90 to 95% of the FP seed from a 50:50 mixture in a single pass. During this process a significant number of FP&#x2212; seed were comingled with FP+ seed in what should be a pure FP+ sample. This level of performance then suggests that some manual sorting may be required in some method embodiments to achieve a desired level of purity.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">For example, if a typical yield trial sample contained 4000 kernels (50% FP&#x2212; and 50% FP+) it would require about 40 minutes to sort the FP seed. This is a sorting rate of 50 seeds/minute. If the same sample were sorted using substantially automated embodiments of the present invention, it would require less than 30 seconds to generate a 95% pure sample of FP+ seed. For a 2000 kernel FP+ sample, there would be about 100 FP&#x2212; kernels that would need to be manually removed. If the manual sorting rate is 50 seeds/minute, the actual time to achieve a nearly 100% pure sample of FP+ seed will be about 2 minutes. Furthermore, if a sample is manually sorted while another is being sorted using the FP Sorter the actual sorting time for a sample would be about 2 minutes. This results in a fifteen-fold reduction in time required for separating FP+ seed from FP&#x2212; seed.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">If an automatic re-sort function (i.e. re-routing the sample back through the sorting procedure for one or more additional passes) is used, it may be possible to recover 99% of the FP+ seed from the initial sample without having to manually re-sort the FP&#x2212; fraction. Such a re-sort process extends the cycle time by 15 seconds for a 500 gram seed sample. Given that it will take 2 minutes to sort the FP+ fraction it may be advantageous to routinely re-sort samples, especially small ones, to recover as much of the FP+ seed as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As noted above, the expression of fluorescent proteins may be non-uniform across the surface area of seeds. As a result, the present invention also provides a method for distinguishing seeds containing a marker associated with genetic element of interest from a bulk sample by using an electromagnetic energy emitting device that is configured to excite a majority of the surface area of the seeds and/or by using an evaluating device that is configured receive emissions from a majority of the surface area of the seeds. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a non-limiting schematic of a system incorporating a vacuum drum singulating device, an electromagnetic energy emitting device, and an evaluating device in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a system <b>500</b> that includes an exemplary embodiment of a singulating device comprising a plurality of elongate hollow structures operatively connected to a vacuum source used to singulate seeds from a bulk sample. Specifically, the system <b>500</b> of the exemplary embodiment includes a hopper <b>502</b> into which a bulk sample A of seeds may be placed. A rotating drum <b>504</b> is positioned adjacent the hopper <b>502</b>. The rotating drum <b>504</b> includes a plurality of elongate hollow structures <b>506</b> that extend into a substantially hollow interior of the drum <b>504</b>, which is connected to a vacuum source (not shown). The vacuum source creates a zone of negative pressure within the interior of the drum <b>504</b>, and as a result, distal ends of the elongate hollow structures <b>506</b> create discrete areas of negative pressure. As shown in the figure, the drum <b>504</b> rotates adjacent an open end of the hopper <b>502</b>. The hopper <b>502</b> is configured such that seeds are urged toward the open end and adjacent the rotating drum <b>504</b>. The drum <b>504</b> rotates in the direction shown such that the elongate hollow structures <b>506</b> pass through a portion of the seeds of the bulk sample A adjacent the drum <b>504</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As the elongate hollow structures <b>506</b> rotate through the bulk sample A, the discrete areas of negative pressure located at the distal ends of the elongate hollow structures <b>506</b> attract individual seeds <b>501</b>. The size of the distal ends of each of the elongate hollow structures <b>506</b> is configured such the discrete area of negative pressure at the distal end of each of the hollow structures <b>506</b> attracts a single seed <b>501</b>. As shown in the figure, as the elongate hollow structures <b>506</b> rotate through the open end of the hopper <b>502</b>, individual seeds <b>501</b> attach to the distal ends of the elongate hollow structures <b>506</b>. As the drum <b>504</b> continues to rotate in the direction shown, a deflector plate <b>508</b> (or alternatively, in some embodiments, a compressed air source configured for detaching individual seeds from the elongate hollow structures <b>506</b>) deflects the seeds <b>501</b> from the distal ends of the elongate hollow structures <b>506</b> and onto the conveyor belt <b>510</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, the deflector plate <b>508</b> contacts between the distal ends of the elongate hollow structures <b>506</b> and the seeds <b>501</b> carried by them so that the area of negative pressure is temporarily blocked, effectively releasing the seeds <b>501</b> from the distal ends of the elongate hollow structures <b>506</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As shown generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the system <b>500</b> may also include a specialized vision system <b>554</b> which, in some embodiments, may comprise: (1) an electromagnetic energy emitting device, such as an illuminating device <b>554</b><i>a </i>that emits electromagnetic energy at a particular frequency chosen to illuminate and thereby &#x201c;excite&#x201d; a marker, and (2) an evaluating device, such as an image sensing device <b>554</b><i>c </i>that may discern seeds expressing the marker. In various embodiments, the present invention may include an electronmagnetic energy emitting device that is configured to excite a majority of the surface area of the seeds and/or an evaluating device that is configured to receive emissions from a majority of the surface area of the seeds.

In such a manner, the image sensing device <b>554</b><i>c </i>may evaluate a majority of the surface area of the seeds to determine the presence or absence of a marker.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the depicted embodiment, image sensing device <b>554</b><i>c </i>may be further configured for translating the emission into substantially &#x201c;white&#x201d; light.
