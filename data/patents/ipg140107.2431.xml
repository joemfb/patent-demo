<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to photoconductors and, for example, to organic photoconductors and a treatment for enhancing crack resistance thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Various types of organic photoconductors are known. Most organic photoconductors are susceptible to attack by organic solvents of the type used in liquid toner electrophotography and are therefore unsuitable for such applications. These photoconductors include those which dissolve in the solvents and others which are caused to crack as the result of exposure thereto when they are under stress, especially under tension.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">U.S. Pat. No. 5,240,532 describes a process for treating a flexible electrostatographic imaging web including a base layer and a layer including a thermoplastic polymer matrix. The process comprises forming a at least a segment of the web with the base layer of the web facing inwardly into an arc having a curvature between about 10 millimeters and about 25 millimeters, heating at least the polymer matrix in the segment to at least the glass transition temperature of the polymer matrix and cooling the imaging member to a temperature below the glass transition temperature of the polymer matrix while maintaining the segment of the web in the shape of the arc.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 6,165,570 discloses a method of treating an electrostatographic imaging member web that includes a support substrate and at least one imaging layer formed; over the support substrate. The electrostatographic imaging member web can optionally include no anti-curling back layer. The web is bent into an arcuate shape and heated to a temperature above the glass transition temperature of the imaging layer, The imaging layer is then cooled while in the arcuate shape to a temperature below the glass transition temperature, forming a substantially stress-free imaging layer when conforming to the arcuate shape.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 6,232,028 describes a method of processing a photoconductor by bending the photoconductor with the photoconductive layer facing outward without subjecting the photoconductor to substantial external stress other by virtue of said bending; heat treating the bend; and allowing the bend to cool.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a typical organic photoconductor sheet useful in the embodiments. This sheet photoconductor is useful e.g. in liquid toners systems in which the sheet is mounted on a drum. In such systems untreated photoconductors are susceptible to cracking when they are used with liquid toner, especially those utilizing a hydrocarbon carrier liquid such as Isopar&#xae; (a trademark of EXXON MOBIL Corp.). An example of such a system can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,376,491 and 5,508,790. However, cracking occurs also in other systems, and liquid toner systems are only illustrative for the systems with which the present photoconductors can be used. It must also be noted that the present photoconductors are not restricted to organic photoconductors, inorganic photoconductors and mixed inorganic and organic photoconductors can be used as well.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an photoconductor sheet <b>100</b> according to some embodiments comprises a base layer <b>102</b> which in some embodiments is formed of aluminized polyethylene terephthalate (PET) commercially available e.g. under the trademark Mylar&#xae; from E. I. du Pont de Nemours &#x26; Company. The base layer in some embodiments may be about 75 to 80 microns in thickness and has a melting point of about 250&#xb0; C. Other resins, such as other polyesters, polycarbonates, polyamides, polyurethanes, polysulfones, and the like which are thin flexible webs, may be used for the base layer. Thicknesses of less than 50 microns and up to e.g. 175 microns, in some embodiments of about 65 to about 150 microns, and in some other embodiments of about 75 microns to about 100 microns may be used in the base layer. Furthermore, metals other than aluminum can be used for the conductive coating of the resin layer, such as zirconium, niob, tantalum, vanadium and titanium, and the like, as well as conductive non-metallic materials, e.g. indium tin oxide.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Disposed above the base layer there may be provided an optional undercharge layer <b>104</b> which may be formed of, but without being limited thereto, polyester, polycarbonate, toluenesulfonamide-formaldehyde resin and polyamide having a thickness of 0.05 to 3 microns, particularly a thickness of about 0.2 microns. The undercharge layer <b>104</b> serves to bind the base layer <b>102</b> to the layer above the undercharge layer <b>104</b>, i.e. the charge generating layer <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The charge generating layer <b>106</b> in an organic photoconductor may be formed of a hydroxysquarylium dye and toluenesulfonamide resin having a thickness of about 0.2 to about 0.3 microns. However, any charge generating layer <b>106</b> can be used in embodiments of the present photoconductors, such as e.g. selenium and selenium alloys, and other organic photoconductive particles including various phthalocyanine pigments. The binders include thermoplastic and thermosetting resins, such as polycarbonates, polyesters, polyamides, polyurethanes and the like. The thickness of the charge generating layer <b>106</b> may range from about 0.1 microns to about 5.0 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Disposed above the charge generating layer <b>106</b> is a charge transport layer <b>108</b> which in some embodiments may be formed of polyester, polycarbonate yellow dye, 4-[N, N-diethylamino]benzaldehydediphenylhydrazone and poylsiloxane in a minor proportion, having a thickness of about 18 microns. Other aromatic amine compounds may be used, as well as other inactive matrix resin binders. Alternatively, the chare transport layer <b>108</b> may include electrically active resin materials, e.g. polymeric arylamine compounds, instead of mixtures of inactive resin materials with activating compounds. The thickness of the charge transport layer may be of from about 10 to about 50 micrometers. The charge transport layer <b>108</b> may also be sandwiched between the undercharge layer <b>104</b> or base layer <b>102</b> and the charge generating layer <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Charge transport layer <b>108</b> and charge generating layer <b>106</b> together define the photoconductive layer referred to above.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A photoconductor suitable for use with liquid toner is commercially available from IBM Corporation under the trade name Emerald.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In embodiments the photoconductor is subjected to a treatment for enhancing crack resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in one embodiment, a photoconductor sheet <b>146</b> that may have dimensions of 410&#xd7;1220 mm or 410&#xd7;650 mm or smaller is bent into a tube shape <b>140</b> with the photoconductive layer (<b>106</b>, <b>108</b>) facing outward having a length <b>1</b> corresponding to the width of the photoconductor sheet <b>146</b>. The outer diameter d of the tube <b>140</b> may vary widely, and is normally equal to or smaller than the drum onto which it will eventually be mounted. The outer diameter may range from about 28 mm to about 36 mm. In at least one embodiment, the tube of the photoconductor has an outer diameter of about 26 to about 36 mm and the cylinder has a diameter of about 28 mm to about 38 mm. The bending into the tube <b>140</b> may be accomplished by means of a roller <b>142</b> around which the photoconductor sheet <b>146</b> is wrapped. In at least one embodiment, the bending is accomplished by means of a roller remaining in the tube of the photoconductor until the combination of the roller and the tube has been inserted into the cylinder, whereupon the roller is removed from the tube. The tube of the photoconductor has a outer diameter of about 26 to about 38 mm and the cylinder has a diameter of about 28 mm to about 36 mm the cylinder being made of PC-ABS; and the treating is at about 70&#xb0; C. to 75&#xb0; C. for a period of time of from about 15 minutes to about 30 minutes and subsequently at about room temperature for up to about 4 months.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment a protective sheet, shown as <b>144</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, is overlaid over the photoconductive layer of the photoconductor sheet <b>146</b>. The protective sheet <b>144</b> has the same length as the photoconductor sheet <b>146</b> or a length slightly shorter, e.g. by 10 to 50 mm. The width of the protective sheet <b>144</b> is usually a little greater than the width of the photoconductor sheet <b>146</b>, e.g. by 10 to 50 mm. The protective sheet is overlaid over the photoconductor sheet <b>146</b> in registration. The protective sheet <b>144</b> may be made of e.g. Tyvek&#x2122; (a fleece like material made of high density polyethylene fibers sold by Du Pont) or coated black paper; however, other materials are also conceivable. The protective sheet <b>144</b> normally has a textured surface so as to prevent &#x201c;clinging&#x201d; to the photoconductive layer of the photoconductor sheet <b>146</b>. The combination of photoconductor sheet <b>146</b> and protective sheet <b>144</b> is then bent into a tube <b>140</b> with the protective sheet <b>144</b> over the photoconductive layer of the photoconductor sheet <b>146</b> facing outward. This bending may be assisted by means of a roller <b>142</b> around which the combination of photoconductor sheet <b>146</b> and protective sheet <b>144</b> is wrapped.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The advantage of having a protective sheet is that marks on the photoconductive layer that may originate from the leading and trailing end of the photoconductor sheet are minimized. This sheet also prevents any possible interactions between the inner wall of the cylinder and the photoconductive layer. Furthermore, by using a protective sheet, a unique stamp can be imprinted on the photoconductor sheet at a predetermined position.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The tube <b>140</b> with or without the protective sheet <b>144</b> is then inserted into a cylinder <b>120</b>, shown in a perspective view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, having an inner diameter d&#x2032; of slightly greater than the outer diameter d of the tube <b>140</b>, e.g. in some embodiments about 28 mm to about 38 mm. The tube <b>140</b> may be inserted while still wrapped around the roller <b>142</b>, which is removed once the tube has been inserted into the cylinder. The cylinder has at least a length <b>1</b>&#x2032; corresponding to the length <b>1</b> of the photoconductor tube. The cylinder may be injection molded using of a relatively high-melting-point plastic material such as PC-ABS. Alternatively, the cylinder may be made of a metal such as aluminium. In some embodiments, the cylinder is made of a plastic material, including PC-ABS, having a melting point of above 110&#xb0; C., and has a slot along its entire length.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in the perspective view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a cylinder <b>120</b> may have a slot <b>124</b>, which extends along its entire length. The inner wall <b>122</b> of the cylinder <b>120</b> is very smooth. The tube <b>140</b>, when introduced into the cylinder <b>120</b>, is expanding slightly against the inner wall <b>122</b> of the cylinder <b>120</b> by which it is hold in its place.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The photoconductor tube <b>140</b> with or without the protective sheet is then treated by being maintained in the cylinder <b>120</b> at a temperature of from room temperature to an elevated temperature. By &#x201c;room temperature&#x201d; a temperature between about 20 and about 30&#xb0; C. is meant, by &#x201c;elevated temperature&#x201d; a temperature of from about 30&#xb0; C. to 100&#xb0; C. or higher is meant. The higher the temperature is, the shorter is the treatment. At room temperature the treatment may be up to about 4 months, and at a temperature of 100&#xb0; C. the treatment may be as short as 1 second or less. In some embodiments, the temperature of the treatment is from about room temperature to below the glass transition temperature Tg of the photoconductive layer. This treatment may be conducted at from room temperature to an elevated temperature for about 4 months to about 1 second. In some embodiments, this treatment may be conducted at from about room temperature to below the glass transition temperature Tg of the photoconductive layer for about 4 months to about 5 minutes. In at least one embodiment, this treatment may be conducted at about room temperature for a period of about 3 months to about 4 months. In some embodiments, the temperature of the treatment is from about room temperature to slightly below the glass transition temperature Tg of the photoconductive layer, or more precisely its polymer matrix, which may be about 75 to 80&#xb0; C. In this case the time of treatment may be from up to about 4 months at about room temperature to about 5 minutes at slightly below the glass transition temperature after a warming-up period to reach this temperature. In one embodiment the photoconductor tube <b>140</b> with or without the protective sheet <b>144</b> in the cylinder <b>120</b> is heated to a temperature of about 70 to about 75&#xb0; C. within about 40 minutes, at which temperature it is then maintained for a period of about 15 minutes to about 30 minutes, particularly about 20 minutes. In at least one embodiment, this treatment is conducted at about 70&#xb0; C. to 75&#xb0; C. for a period of time of from about 15 minutes to about 30 minutes after a warming-up period of about 40 minutes and subsequently at about room temperature for up to about 4 months. Then the cylinder <b>120</b> and the tube <b>140</b> are allowed to return to room temperature where they are left up to 4 months or until the photoconductor is used.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The result of such a treatment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. With an applied stress (&#x3c3;) of about 22 MPa the time until cracking occurs is about 25 minutes. This compares favourably to the value of prior art (U.S. Pat. No. 6,232,028) of about 19 minutes and is much better than the value of the raw photoconductor material of about 2 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In another embodiment the photoconductor tube <b>140</b> with or without the protective sheet <b>144</b> is left in the cylinder <b>120</b> at room temperature for about 3 to about 4 months.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Already after 18 days inside the cylinder at room temperature the time until an organic photoconductor (OPC) cracks is about 25 minutes at a stress (&#x3c3;) of about 17 MPa. After 120 days the time until cracking at a stress of about 18 MPa is about 29 minutes, whereas the time until cracking of the OPC as it is (untreated) is about 8 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">During the treatment both ends of the cylinder may be sealed by a suitable means, such as a metal foil or cap or a plastic closing means. The slot may also be covered by a similar means. The possibility of not having to work in an externally clean environment by creating the clean environment inside the cylinder is a great advantage over the prior art where a clean external environment is always required.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A further embodiment comprises overlaying a protective sheet <b>144</b> on a photoconductive layer of a photoconductor <b>146</b> as described above and bending the combination of the photoconductor sheet and the protective sheet at least partially into a tube <b>140</b> after which the tube is treated as described above with reference to the embodiments involving the cylinder. In this case the tube has to be held together by a fastening means such as a ribbon or a tape. The protective sheet minimizes the marks imprinted into the photoconductive layer by the ribbon or tape. This embodiment is advantageous when a clean external environment, but no cylinder is available.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">All the specific embodiments described above with respect to temperature and time of treatment also apply to this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In all of the above embodiments the photoconductor sheet after the treatment has a defined curvature which makes it suited to be mounted on a drum.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The photoconductor may be cut to the desired size after the treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Another embodiment is a method of imaging wherein the photoconductor treated according to the embodiment involving the cylinder is used for forming an electrostatic image thereon. The method may further comprise mounting the photoconductor on a drum, and after the electrostatic image has been formed, developing the electrostatic image with a liquid toner to form the developed image, and transferring the image to a final substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The drum may have a diameter equal to or greater than the treated photoconductor.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">All publications and existing systems mentioned in this specification are herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Although certain methods in accordance with the teaching of the invention have been described herein, the scope of the specification and the appended claims is not limited thereto. On the contrary, all embodiments of the teachings of the invention fairly falling within the scope of the appended claims either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents are intended to be covered.</p>
