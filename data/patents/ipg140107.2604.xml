<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to semiconductor structures and, more particularly, to trench isolation structures and methods of manufacturing the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">MOSFETs use embedded silicon germanium (eSiGe) or embedded silicon carbon (eSiC) as the source/drain stressor for PMOS or NMOS, respectively. These embedded stressors are grown epitaxially after a recess etch into the source/drain regions is performed. For a source/drain region bounded by a shallow trench isolation (STI) structure, the outer edge of the source/drain region includes the STI material (e.g., oxide) rather than the substrate material. This leads to a faceted growth of the embedded stressor material.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The faceted growth can be severe enough such that the final, grown source/drain thickness is thinner than in unbound regions (i.e., bound only by substrate material along the source/drain periphery). This leads to a greater proximity between the source/drain junction and the contact material which, in turn, leads to high junction leakage. Also, the reduced volume resulting from the faceted growth leads to reduced stress, which reduces device performance.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to circumvent these penalties, an STI edge can be tucked under an adjacent dummy gate. This dummy gate effectively serves as a spacer to mask some substrate material adjacent to the STI edge during the source/drain recess etch, such that subsequent epitaxial growth is bound by substrate material on all sides (leading to the desired epitaxial growth). In this approach, though, the dummy gate imposes an additional parasitic capacitance to the source/drain regions, which increases circuit delay and dynamic power consumption. Moreover, a layout area penalty is imposed, since the active region spacing is linked to the gate pitch. Also, this approach is a 1-D solution in that it only resolves the faceting issue in the length direction (i.e., in the direction perpendicular to the gate) but not the width direction.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, there exists a need in the art to overcome the deficiencies and limitations described hereinabove.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The invention relates to semiconductor structures and, more particularly, to trench isolation structures and methods of manufacturing the same. More specifically, the present invention is directed to trench isolation (STI) structures that include an overhang, in order to preserve substrate material near the STI structure during source and drain etching processes. Advantageously, by using the overhang, source and drain etching processes will not remove all of the substrate material, near the STI structure. The substrate material, in turn, provides a seed layer for stressor material which forms epitaxial source and drain regions. The epitaxial source and drain regions can be raised source and drain regions. Accordingly, the invention offers a means of minimizing the faceted epitaxial growth in all directions, while eliminating the parasitic capacitance and reducing or eliminating the layout area penalty associated with the active-tuck-under-dummy-gate solution.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">More specifically, in the present invention a shallow STI recess is formed within the substrate. The sidewalls of the STI recess are lined with a spacer sidewall material, e.g., nitride spacers, which can be engineered to narrow a window (e.g., recess) for subsequent STI etching processes. A subsequent etch is performed within the substrate (through the window) to form the remaining STI trench. The STI trench is then filled with insulator material, resulting in a T-shaped STI structure (e.g., a combination of insulator material within the STI trench and the spacer sidewall material). Thus, in this approach, the length and thickness of an overhang region (which forms the T shape) is defined, respectively, by the STI spacers and shallow STI etch, respectively. The result is an STI edge that is underlapped by the top STI overhang region. This achieves a structure whereby the substrate material remains along the majority of the STI sidewall, without the need to tuck the STI region under a dummy gate.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In other words, the present invention effectively eliminates the need for tucking the STI region under a dummy gate, thereby avoiding a layout area penalty. Instead, the STI region is effectively tucked under itself. Also, the present invention reduces junction leakage and increases the stress component in the source/drain regions compared to conventional structures which, in turn increases device performance.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a structure and respective processing steps in accordance with aspects of the present invention. In particular, the structure <b>10</b> includes a substrate <b>12</b>. In embodiments, the substrate can be, for example, BULK Si. An insulator layer <b>14</b> is formed on the substrate <b>12</b>. In embodiments, the insulator layer <b>14</b> can be oxide, which is thermally grown on the substrate <b>12</b>. The insulator layer <b>14</b> can be grown to a thickness of about 2 nm to about 5 nm; although other dimensions are also contemplated by the present invention (to form a raised STI structure as discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). A hardmask <b>16</b> is formed on the insulator layer <b>14</b>. The hardmask <b>16</b> can be, for example, nitride; although other materials are also contemplated by the present invention. In embodiments, additional materials can be formed on the hardmask <b>16</b> to act as an etch mask during formation of an STI structure.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an opening <b>18</b> is formed through the hardmask <b>16</b> and the insulator layer <b>14</b>. The opening <b>18</b> can be formed using conventional lithographic and etching processes, to define an STI region. For example, a resist can be formed on the hardmask <b>16</b> and exposed to light to form a pattern (i.e., opening). A reactive ion etching (RIE) can be performed to form the opening <b>18</b>. The resist can be removed using a conventional ashing process. In embodiments, the opening <b>18</b> can be about 40 nm to about 100 nm in cross section; although other dimensions are also contemplated by the present invention depending on the technology node and other design variables such as, for example, a required processing window for subsequent STI etching processes.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a structure and additional processing steps in accordance with aspects of the present invention. More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an etching process to form a shallow recess <b>20</b> in the substrate <b>12</b>. In embodiments, the shallow recess <b>20</b> can be about 10 nm. In embodiments, the recess <b>20</b> can be formed by a timed etching process. For example, in embodiments, the exposed substrate <b>12</b> can be implanted with an N-type dopant such as phosphorus, arsenic, or antimony. The structure can then undergo an annealing process at about 900&#xb0; C. to about 1100&#xb0; C. for a specified time, e.g., a millisecond to about 1 or more seconds (depending on the anneal tool). After annealing, the recess <b>20</b> can be selectively etched using, for example, chlorine chemistries.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In embodiments, the initial recess etch will define a facet of a source/drain epitaxial growth. For example, a PMOS embedded stressor (e.g., SiGe or SiC) region extends about 30 nm to about 50 nm into the substrate <b>12</b> (depending on the desired stressor material shape). With a conventional STI process flow, there will be very little stressor material grown along the STI sidewall (where no Si exists to act as a seed layer). Thus, the stressor facet extending from the STI edge will begin at the bottom of the stressor region. The thickness of the stressor material along the STI sidewall will therefore not be 30 nm to 50 nm; but instead defined by the growth rate of stressor material along the facet. In the illustrative example shown herein, a 10 nm recess etch would result in the stressor faceting starting at 10 nm below the surface rather than at the 30 nm to 50 nm depth defined by the stressor recess etch, thus increasing the stressor material thickness along the STI edge by about 20 nm to 40 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a structure and additional processing steps in accordance with aspects of the present invention. More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the formation of STI spacer sidewalls <b>24</b> which extends into the recess <b>20</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> also shows an optional insulator liner <b>22</b> formed within the recess <b>20</b>. In embodiments, the optional insulator liner <b>22</b> is an oxide, which can be grown on exposed surfaces of the substrate <b>12</b> within the recess <b>20</b>. The insulator liner <b>22</b> will improve the interface of a P-N junction, e.g., reduce diode leakage due to broken bonds at the interface STI boundary. In embodiments, the insulator liner <b>22</b> is about 2 nm to about 5 nm; although other dimensions are contemplated by the present invention. In additional embodiments, a liner can be formed on the hardmask <b>16</b>. The liner can be an oxidized nitride formed from the liner oxide growth.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The STI spacer sidewalls <b>24</b> can be formed by conventional deposition methods such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes. The STI spacer sidewalls <b>24</b> can be nitride, oxide or other insulator materials, e.g., amorphous carbon, which has very high etch selectivity over silicon, nitride, and oxide and so would be subject to a smaller lateral etch during the STI etch, thus increasing the process window.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The thickness of the STI spacer sidewalls <b>24</b> will define the dimensions of the overhang <b>34</b> of a T-shaped STI structure <b>35</b>. In embodiments, the thickness of the STI spacer sidewalls <b>24</b> can range from about 10 nm to about 20 nm; although other dimensions are contemplated by the present invention as described below. The STI spacer sidewalls <b>24</b> can be engineered to narrow a window (e.g., recess) for subsequent STI etching processes, and can also be used to adjust a length of an overhang of the STI structure.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">It should be understood by those of skill in the art that the STI spacer sidewalls <b>24</b> will reduce the remaining STI length. Thus, the initial STI length may need to be increased to account for this effect. In an illustrative, non-limiting example, minimum STI length is about 70 nm (perpendicular to the gate). By adding the STI spacer sidewalls <b>24</b>, this length is reduced by about 14 nm on each side, i.e., to about 42 nm. In the other direction (i.e., parallel to the gate), the minimum STI length is about 50 nm, which means the STI length is reduced to about 20 nm. In an SRAM cell, as another illustrative, non-limiting example, the minimum STI length is about 40 nm, which means the STI length is reduced from about 40 nm to about 12 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a deep trench <b>26</b> is etched into the substrate <b>12</b>, through the processing window formed by the STI spacer sidewalls <b>24</b>. In embodiments, the deep trench <b>26</b> can be formed by conventional etching processes (RIE), which also removes the liner on the hardmask <b>16</b>. The deep trench <b>26</b> can be about 200 nm deep with a cross section of about 20 nm to about 60 nm to achieve a desired final STI depth and cross section. It should be understood by those of skill in the art that other dimensions are also contemplated by the present invention depending on the technology node, substrate material and other design factors.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an optional insulator liner <b>28</b> is grown on the sidewalls of the deep trench <b>26</b>. In embodiments, the insulator liner <b>28</b> is an oxide, grown to about 2 nm to about 5 nm; although other dimensions are contemplated by the present invention. As noted above, the insulator liner <b>28</b> will improve the interface of a P-N junction, e.g., reduce diode leakage due to broken bonds at the interface STI boundary.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The trench <b>26</b> is filled with an insulator material <b>30</b> such as oxide to form an STI structure <b>35</b>. The insulator material <b>30</b> can be deposited within the trench <b>26</b> using a CVD process. The structure also includes an oxidized nitride layer <b>32</b>, formed during the deposition of the insulator material <b>30</b>. As a further alternative, the present invention contemplates the nitride surface being oxidized during the growth of the liner <b>28</b>, and then a blanket, conformal deposition of layer <b>30</b>. In embodiments, the insulator material <b>30</b> and layer <b>32</b> are planarized using a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). In embodiments, the CMP may completely remove the layer <b>32</b>, exposing a surface of the hardmask <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, any remaining oxidized nitride is removed, permitting the removal of the hardmask layer <b>16</b>. The hardmask layer <b>16</b> can be removed using a CMP process. In embodiments, CMP process will also remove the insulator layer <b>14</b>, and portions of the STI sidewall spacers, leaving behind an overhang <b>34</b> of the STI structure <b>35</b>. The remaining spacers (i.e., overhang <b>34</b>) are now planar with the substrate <b>12</b> (or the insulator layer <b>14</b>, if not previously removed). Accordingly, after planarization processes, an STI structure <b>35</b> is formed, with a &#x201c;T&#x201d; shape (i.e., overhang <b>34</b> forming a horizontal branch of the T shape). Substrate material is provided under the overhang <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an additional structure with respective processing steps in accordance with aspects of the present invention. More specifically, a conventional gate stack <b>38</b> is formed on the insulator layer <b>14</b>. In embodiments, the gate stack <b>38</b> can be formed using a gate first process or a gate last process, known to those of skill in the art. For example, in the gate first process, gate stack material is deposited on the insulator layer <b>14</b>. The gate stack material is then patterned using conventional patterning processes, to form the gate stack <b>38</b>. Sidewall spacers <b>38</b><i>a </i>can then be deposited on the sidewalls of the gate stack <b>38</b> using conventional materials, e.g., nitride, and processes, e.g., CVD. In a gate last process, a poly dummy gate can be first formed, then removed (later in the process flow) using conventional etchants (RIE). The gate stack <b>38</b> can then be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, source and drain recesses <b>40</b> are formed using etching processes. More specifically, in embodiments, the source and drain recesses <b>40</b> are formed using a sigma etch to define a faceted recesses <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b</i>. In embodiments, the etchant can be a wet chemistry such as ammonium hydroxide which will stop etching on the 111 crystal plane to provide the sigma (faceted) shape. The faceted shape includes a portion <b>40</b><i>a </i>under the gate stack <b>38</b> and a portion <b>40</b><i>b </i>under the overhang <b>34</b> of the STI structure <b>35</b>. As shown, though, substrate material <b>12</b><i>a </i>remains on the side of the STI structure <b>35</b> and under the overhang <b>34</b>. In alternative embodiments, the source and drain recesses <b>40</b> are formed using conventional etching processes. In embodiments, the etching can be an anisotropic etch. In any etching scenario, substrate material <b>12</b><i>a </i>will be remain under the overhang <b>34</b>, which will act as a seed layer for subsequent stressor material growth.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As should be understood, the STI spacer thickness is large enough to account for the lateral sigma etch (if one is performed) for forming embedded source/drain stressors, plus any lateral etch that takes place during the final STI etch, in order to preserve some amount of substrate <b>12</b><i>a </i>adjacent to the STI structure <b>35</b> under the T-shape, i.e. overhang <b>34</b>. The initial STI recess etch effectively defines the point at which epi faceting will occur. Thus, the shallower the etch, the higher up the faceting takes place and the more the epitaxial source/drain region will resemble an epitaxial source/drain region placed between two gate electrodes (i.e., the ideal source/drain shape).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In embodiments, if the PMOS embedded SiGe (or other stressor material) region has a &#x201c;sigma&#x201d; (e.g., faceted) shape, then the SiGe recess etch is followed by an additional etch to form the sigma shape. This additional etch undercuts the gate sidewall spacer and is optimized to place the sigma tip in a specific location. Likewise, this etch will also undercut the substrate <b>12</b> under a top of the T-shaped STI. Accordingly, if the STI spacer sidewalls <b>24</b> are not thick enough, the sigma etch for the SiGe process will expose the STI sidewall, thus eliminating the seed layer that may exist along the sidewall (formed by the &#x201c;protected&#x201d; substrate material <b>12</b>). Thus, the STI spacer sidewalls <b>24</b> should be equal in thickness to the gate sidewall spacers, plus some extra thickness to account for lateral etching during the remaining STI etch. In an example, the gate sidewall spacer thickness can be about 10 nm when the SiGe regions are defined, and the sigma tip has a target gate overlap of about 1 nm; meaning the total lateral etch is about 11 nm. Also, the target lateral nitride etch during the STI etch is about 3 nm. Thus, in the example shown, the STI spacer sidewalls <b>24</b> can have a target thickness of about 14 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the faceted recesses <b>40</b> are filled with stressor material <b>42</b>. The stressor material <b>42</b> can be used to create a epitaxial source/drain stressors. In embodiments, the stressor material <b>42</b> can be grown SiGe or SiC. Advantageously, the substrate material <b>12</b><i>a </i>between the faceted recesses <b>40</b> and the STI structure <b>36</b>, will act as a seed layer for the stressor material <b>42</b>. This will decrease junction leakage, improve stress imposed in the source/drain regions, and decrease any layout penalties.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows an alternate structure in accordance with aspects of the present invention. More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a raised STI structure <b>35</b>&#x2032;. The raised STI structure <b>35</b>&#x2032; can be manufactured by making the insulator layer <b>14</b> thicker, and then continuing with the remaining processing steps shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref>. Alternatively, the recess <b>20</b> can be made deeper in order to form larger sidewall spacers <b>24</b> (which form the overhang <b>34</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and continuing with the remaining processes shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-8</figref>. In still another alternative approach, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a selective etchant can be used to remove Si (e.g., substrate material <b>12</b>), which would not substantially affect the sidewall spacers <b>24</b> or other materials. In this way, the sidewall spacers <b>24</b> will not be etched away, or substantially etched away, thus providing a raised STI structure <b>35</b>&#x2032;, after the substrate etch. The processes would then continue with the processing steps shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a flow diagram of a design process used in semiconductor design, manufacture, and/or test. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a block diagram of an exemplary design flow <b>900</b> used for example, in semiconductor IC logic design, simulation, test, layout, and manufacture.
