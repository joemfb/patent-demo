<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of International Application No. PCT/CN2009/071384, filed on Apr. 21, 2009, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of communications technologies, and in particular, to a carrier aggregation method and a carrier aggregation device.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the field of communications technologies, with the daily increase of radio services, the requirement for the radio data transmission rate becomes higher and higher. The technology demands of International Mobile Telecommunication-Advanced (IMT-Advanced) specify that the future radio communication system needs to be capable of supporting a higher data rate. In order to support high-speed data transmission, the following technical means may be used. On one hand, the frequency spectrum utilization may be improved, for example, the frequency spectrum utilization in the conventional bandwidth may be improved by using high order modulation, a multi-antenna technology, and an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) technology; on the other hand, the transmission bandwidth of the system may be increased. Taking an LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) system as an example, the maximum transmission bandwidth of the system is 20 MHz, and in order to meet a greater bandwidth demand and be compatible with the conventional third Generation mobile communication system or Long Term Evolution (LTE), many manufacturers propose that a carrier aggregation technology is used in new systems such as LTE-A, so as to meet the requirement of high-speed data transmission. The carrier aggregation technology is to aggregate multiple carriers together in a conventional system, so as to form a higher transmission bandwidth, thereby improving the data transmission rate.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The currently proposed carrier aggregation solutions include continuous carrier aggregation and discontinuous carrier aggregation. In the continuous carrier aggregation, multiple aggregated carriers aggregated together are continuous; and in the discontinuous carrier aggregation, the aggregated carriers are discontinuous. The bandwidths of the multiple aggregated carriers participating in the aggregation may be the same or different, and the bandwidths of the aggregated carriers are all conventional carrier bandwidths of the system. The minimum working bandwidth of the conventional carrier in the system is 1.4 MHz, and the maximum working bandwidth may be up to 20 MHz.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The conventional carrier aggregation technology has at least the following problems. Because each of the multiple aggregated carriers participating in the aggregation has its own synchronization channel, broadcast channel, and baseband processing unit, not only the spectrum resources are consumed, but also the complexity for implementing the system is increased.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments of the present invention provide a carrier aggregation method and a carrier aggregation device, so as to effectively utilize the spectrum resources and decrease the system complexity on the basis of implementing the carrier aggregation.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0031">The technical solutions of the present invention are described in detail in the following with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be noted that the following embodiments are only a part rather than all of the embodiments of the present invention. All other embodiments obtained by persons of ordinary skill in the art based on the embodiments of the present invention without creative efforts shall fall within the protection scope of the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic flow chart of a carrier aggregation method according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention. The carrier aggregation process may include:</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0033">Step S<b>11</b>: Acquire information of available spectrum resources.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0034">Step S<b>12</b>: Select an available frequency band less than a maximum design bandwidth and greater than or equal to a minimum design bandwidth as a base frequency band when the available frequency band exists in the available spectrum resources.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0035">Step S<b>13</b>: Determine a frequency band with a width being the maximum design bandwidth, where the frequency band with the width being the maximum design bandwidth has a center frequency which is an integral multiple of a minimum channel raster and is the closest to a center of the base frequency band.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0036">Step S<b>14</b>: Determine an aggregated carrier by using the frequency band with the width being the maximum design bandwidth.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0037">In this embodiment, a frequency band is extended by using the frequency band that is less than the maximum design bandwidth and greater than or equal to the minimum design bandwidth in the available spectrum resources as the base frequency band, to determine carrier aggregation, so as to reduce the required number of the synchronization channels, the broadcast channels, and the baseband processing units, lower the system complexity, and effectively utilize the spectrum resources, and meanwhile, meet the requirement of high-speed data transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0038">Further, the embodiment may further include: determining whether all the already determined aggregated carriers reach a preset criterion, if all the already determined aggregated carriers reach the preset criterion, the carrier aggregation process is stopped; and if all the determined aggregated carriers do not reach the preset criterion, the carrier aggregation process is repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0039">According to the embodiment of the present invention, the multiple aggregated carriers may be aggregated into a higher frequency band, so that the aggregated carrier reaches the preset criterion. The determining whether all the already determined aggregated carriers reach the preset criterion includes: determining whether a sum of the bandwidths of all the already determined aggregated carriers meets a requirement for aggregating bandwidths, and/or whether the number of all the already determined aggregated carriers reaches the maximum carrier number. After multiple times of carrier aggregation, the carrier aggregation process may be stopped when it is determined that the sum of the bandwidths of the multiple determined aggregated carriers meets the requirement for aggregating the bandwidths. It can be understood that, the carrier aggregation process may also be terminated when it is determined that the number of the multiple determined aggregated carrier reaches the maximum carrier number. For example, a total bandwidth demand of a system is 1 GHz, and the supportable maximum carrier number is 6, if a sum of total available bandwidths of the aggregated carriers is greater than or equal to 1 GHz, or the number of the aggregated carrier is 6, the carrier aggregation process is stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0040">Much further, the determining the aggregated carrier by using the frequency band with the width being the maximum design bandwidth may include: directly determining the frequency band with the width being the maximum design bandwidth as the aggregated carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0041">Alternatively, in another implementation, an available frequency, which is the farthest from the center frequency, is found in the frequency band with the width being the maximum design bandwidth; a width between the center frequency and the available frequency, which is the farthest from the center frequency, is determined; and an aggregated carrier with a bandwidth being 2 times of the determined width, where a carrier center frequency of the aggregated carrier is the center frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0042">In the method embodiment, some of the spectrum resources are available frequency bands, and others are unavailable frequency bands. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic diagram showing availability of spectrum resources according to an embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, frequency bands K<b>1</b>, K<b>2</b>, and K<b>3</b> are available frequency bands, and K<b>4</b>, K<b>5</b>, and K<b>6</b> are unavailable frequency bands. The available frequency band refers to a frequency band adopted by the current system, for example, an idle frequency band that is not used by other adjacent systems, and is greater than or equal to a certain width. The unavailable frequency band refers to a frequency band that cannot be adopted by the current system, for example, a frequency band used by other adjacent systems, or an idle frequency band with a width less than a certain width, for example, an idle frequency band that is less than 200 KHz may be considered as an unavailable frequency band in the system.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0043">In a conventional carrier aggregation technology, multiple available frequency bands are aggregated as separate aggregated carriers, and each aggregated carrier needs to be allocated with its own synchronization channel, broadcast channel, and baseband processing unit, and the implementation is complex; in contrast, in the technical solution according to the embodiment of the present invention, a frequency band is divided from the selected available frequency band with a frequency bandwidth between the maximum design bandwidth and the minimum design bandwidth, to determine the carrier aggregation, and the aggregated carrier may include multiple available frequency bands. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic diagram of an aggregated carrier including multiple available frequency bands according to an embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an aggregated carrier K<b>7</b> includes available frequency bands K<b>8</b> and K<b>9</b>, and an unavailable frequency band K<b>10</b>, and a bandwidth of the aggregated carrier, which is divided based on the available frequency band K<b>9</b>, is W<b>1</b>. Because the aggregated carrier K<b>7</b> needs only one synchronization channel, one broadcast channel, and one baseband processing unit, it is unnecessary to allocate a synchronization channel, a broadcast channel, and a baseband processing unit to each of the available frequency bands, thereby saving resources. The aggregated carrier K<b>7</b> includes available and unavailable frequency bands, after the carrier aggregation is completed, if data transmission needs to be performed in the aggregated carrier K<b>7</b>, transmission and scheduling of data may be performed in the available frequency bands, and transmission and scheduling of data may not be performed in the unavailable frequency band.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0044">In the conventional carrier aggregation technology, the aggregated carrier is a conventional carrier in the system, and a frequency band that is less than a minimum working bandwidth cannot be effectively used; in the method according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention, multiple available frequency bands including the frequency band that is less than the minimum working bandwidth in the aggregated carrier can be used, so as to improve the frequency spectrum utilization.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0045">In this embodiment, the maximum design bandwidth may be the maximum working bandwidth of the system; and the minimum design bandwidth may be the minimum working bandwidth of the system. The frequency band with a width being the maximum working bandwidth is determined as the aggregated carrier by using the available frequency band, which is less than the maximum working bandwidth and greater than or equal to the minimum working bandwidth, as the base frequency band, where the frequency band with the width being the maximum design bandwidth has a center frequency which is an integral multiple of a minimum channel raster and is the closest to a center of the base frequency band, so that the bandwidth of the carriers participating in aggregation is maximized, so as to further reduce the number of the aggregated carriers, and save the resources. It can be understood by those skilled in the art that, the maximum design bandwidth may also be other values that are less than the maximum working bandwidth, and the minimum design bandwidth may also be other values that are greater than the minimum working bandwidth. However, an optimal choice is generally to use the maximum working bandwidth as the maximum design bandwidth, and use the minimum working bandwidth as the minimum design bandwidth, but the embodiment of the present invention is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0046">In an implementation, when an available frequency band less than the maximum design bandwidth and greater than or equal to the minimum design bandwidth exists in the available spectrum resources, the process of selecting the available frequency band as the base frequency band may specifically include: selecting an available frequency band closest to an already determined aggregated carrier from the multiple available frequency bands as a base frequency band when the multiple available frequency bands, which are less than the maximum design bandwidth and greater than or equal to the minimum design bandwidth, exist in the available spectrum resources; or selecting an available frequency with the width being the maximum width in the multiple available frequency bands as a base frequency band.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic diagram of selecting an available frequency band closest to an already determined aggregated carrier as a base frequency band from multiple available frequency bands in carrier aggregation according to an embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, available frequency bands M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>, and M<b>3</b>, unavailable frequency bands M<b>4</b>, and M<b>5</b>, and an already determined aggregated carrier M<b>6</b> exist, and the available frequency band M<b>3</b> that is the closest to M<b>6</b> is selected from the three available frequency bands as the base frequency band, so that the aggregated carriers are as continuous as possible. A new aggregated carrier determined based on the available frequency band M<b>3</b> may be overlapped with the originally determined aggregated carrier M<b>6</b>, and as shown in FIG. <b>4</b>, an overlapped part of the new aggregated carrier and the already determined aggregated carrier M<b>6</b> is W<b>0</b>. It can be understood that, when data is transmitted in the aggregated carriers, the overlapped part W<b>0</b> of the new aggregated carrier and the already determined aggregated carrier M<b>6</b> cannot be repeatedly used. For example, if the overlapped part W<b>0</b> is an available frequency band in the aggregated carrier M<b>6</b>, the frequency band W<b>0</b> is treated as an unavailable frequency band in the aggregated carrier based on the band M<b>3</b>; or if the frequency band W<b>0</b> is used when the new aggregated carrier is used to transmit data, the frequency band W<b>0</b> of the already determined aggregated carrier M<b>6</b> cannot be repeatedly used when the determined aggregated carrier M<b>6</b> is used to transmit data.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic diagram of selecting an available frequency band with a maximum width as a base frequency band from multiple available frequency bands in carrier aggregation according to an embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, three available frequency bands N<b>1</b>, N<b>2</b>, and N<b>3</b> exist, where the bandwidth of N<b>3</b> is maximum, and accordingly, N<b>3</b> may be used as a base frequency band for subsequent carrier aggregation.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0049">In another implementation, when available frequency bands less than the maximum design bandwidth and greater than or equal to the minimum design bandwidth exist in the available spectrum resources, the process of selecting the available frequency band as the base frequency band may specifically include: using multiple available frequency bands less than the maximum design bandwidth and greater than or equal to the minimum design bandwidth as the base frequency bands when the multiple available frequency bands exist in the available spectrum resources.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0050">Correspondingly, the determining the frequency band with the width being the maximum design bandwidth, where the frequency band with the width being the maximum design bandwidth has a center frequency which is an integral multiple of a minimum channel raster and is the closest to a center of the base frequency band includes: finding multiple frequency bands with the width being the maximum design bandwidth, where the frequency bands with the width being the maximum design bandwidth respectively have a center frequency which is an integral multiple of the minimum channel raster and the frequency bands with the width being the maximum design bandwidth are the closest to the center of the base frequency band; comparing the sums of the widths of available frequency bands in each one of the multiple frequency bands with the width being the maximum design bandwidth respectively; and determining the frequency band with a maximum sum in the multiple frequency bands with the width being the maximum design bandwidth as the aggregated carrier. In the implementation, the sums of the widths of the available frequency bands in each base frequency band of the multiple base frequency bands are compared, and the frequency band with the maximum sum of the widths of the available frequency bands is determined as the aggregated carrier, so as to maximize the bandwidth of the available frequency bands in the aggregated carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0051">Further, the carrier aggregation process may further include identifying the already determined aggregated carrier as an unavailable frequency band before determining a new aggregated carrier of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0052">Further, the carrier aggregation process may further include: selecting a frequency band equal to the maximum design bandwidth from available frequency bands greater than or equal to the maximum design bandwidth as the aggregated carrier, when the available frequency bands exist in the available spectrum resources. The process of selecting the aggregated carrier may specifically include: selecting a frequency band being the closest to the already determined aggregated carrier and equal to the maximum design bandwidth from the available frequency bands as the aggregated carrier; or selecting a frequency band being the closest to the unavailable frequency band and equal to the maximum design bandwidth from the available frequency bands as the aggregated carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a schematic diagram of a type of aggregated carrier selection according to an embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, available frequency band A<b>1</b> greater than or equal to the maximum design bandwidth, and unavailable frequency bands A<b>2</b> and A<b>3</b> exist. A frequency band equal to the maximum design bandwidth W<b>1</b> may be selected from A<b>1</b> as the aggregated carrier. In the selection, the maximum design bandwidth W<b>1</b> is selected to be close with the unavailable frequency band A<b>2</b> or A<b>3</b> (taking A<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> as an example), so as to maximize the remaining available frequency band W<b>2</b>, and bring convenience for subsequent carrier aggregation.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a schematic diagram of another type of aggregated carrier selection according to an embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an already determined aggregated carrier B<b>1</b>, unavailable frequency bands B<b>2</b> and B<b>3</b>, and available frequency bands B<b>4</b> and B<b>5</b> exist. Compared with the band B<b>5</b>, the available frequency band B<b>4</b> is the closest to the already determined aggregated carrier B<b>1</b>, so that a frequency band W<b>1</b> equal to the maximum design bandwidth is selected in the available frequency band B<b>4</b> as an aggregated carrier, and the already determined aggregated carrier is to be close to the aggregated carrier as much as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a schematic diagram of determining an aggregated carrier based on a base frequency band according to an embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in the available spectrum resources, an available frequency band C<b>1</b> less than the maximum design bandwidth and greater than or equal to the minimum design bandwidth exists, and the available spectrum resources further include other available frequency bands C<b>2</b> and C<b>3</b>, and unavailable frequency bands C<b>4</b> and C<b>5</b>. With the available frequency band C<b>1</b> as the base frequency band, a frequency f<b>1</b> being the closest to a central position of the available frequency band C<b>1</b> and being an integral multiple of the minimum channel raster is found as the center frequency, and a frequency band is determined as the aggregated carrier whose width is the maximum design bandwidth W<b>1</b>. It can be seen that, the determined aggregated carrier includes a part of each one of the other available frequency bands C<b>2</b> and C<b>3</b>, that is, available frequency bands a and b. After the carrier aggregation is completed, in data transmission and resource scheduling, data transmission may be achieved in the available frequency bands C<b>1</b>, a and b of the determined aggregated carrier. Further, an adequate guard band can be reserved when data transmission is performed in the available frequency bands C<b>1</b>, a, and b, so as to prevent interference to users of the unavailable frequency band.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0056">Specific description is made with 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) as an example, the minimum channel raster of the 3GPP carrier frequency is 100 KHz, which requires that the center frequency of the system carrier is an integral multiple of 100 KHz, and a frequency being the closest to the center of the available frequency band C<b>1</b> and being an integral multiple of 100 KHz can be found as the center frequency of the determined aggregated carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a schematic diagram of selecting an aggregated carrier according to an embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, available frequency bands F<b>1</b>, F<b>2</b>, and F<b>3</b>, and unavailable frequency bands F<b>4</b>, F<b>5</b>, F<b>6</b>, and F<b>7</b> are included. Based on each available frequency band as the base frequency band, 3 frequency bands with the width being the maximum design bandwidth W<b>1</b> are determined respectively. The sum of the bandwidths of the available frequency bands in the frequency band W<b>1</b>, which is determined based on F<b>2</b> as a base frequency band, is maximum, and accordingly F<b>2</b> is selected as the aggregated carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0058">As described in foregoing embodiments, in the process of determining the aggregated carrier, the frequency band with the width being the maximum design bandwidth may be directly used as the aggregated carrier; if an edge part of the aggregated carrier is an unavailable frequency band, the bandwidth of the aggregated carrier may be further reduced, so as to reduce the unavailable frequency band of the edge part of the aggregated carrier, and save resources. In an optimized implementation, an available frequency that is the farthest from the center frequency is found in the frequency band with the width being the maximum design bandwidth; a width between the center frequency and the available frequency that is the farthest from the center frequency is determined; and the aggregated carrier with a bandwidth being 2 times of the determined width, where a center frequency of the aggregated carrier is the center frequency. Specific description is made with reference to an accompanying drawing below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a schematic diagram of determining an aggregated carrier from a frequency band with a width being a maximum design bandwidth according to an embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a frequency band W<b>1</b> with a center frequency f<b>2</b> and with a width being the maximum design bandwidth is determined, and the frequency band W<b>1</b> includes available frequency bands D<b>1</b>, D<b>2</b>, and D<b>3</b>, and unavailable frequency bands D<b>4</b>, D<b>5</b>, D<b>6</b>, and D<b>7</b>. An available frequency that is the farthest from the center frequency f<b>2</b> is the frequency f<b>3</b>. If the distance from f<b>3</b> to f<b>2</b> is x, 2x may be used as a bandwidth of an aggregated carrier, to determine the aggregated carrier. The efficiency for determining the aggregated carrier by using the solution is higher than the efficiency for directly using the maximum design bandwidth W<b>1</b> as the aggregated carrier. In this solution, the determined aggregated carrier does not include unavailable frequency bands y and z, so that the number of the unavailable frequency bands in the aggregated carrier is decreased, thereby reducing signaling that is required when the aggregated carrier is used to transmit data, and saving resources.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0059">The available frequency band in the embodiment may be a consecutive available frequency band whose width is greater than a certain width. For ease of description, description is made with reference to a Long Term Evolution (LTE) system in 3GPP as an example below.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0060">Every 12 continuous sub-carriers in the LTE system form a Resource Block (RB). A minimum resource allocation unit is 1 RB, and an interval between the sub-carriers of LTE is generally 15 KHz, so that a frequency band occupied by the minimum resource allocation unit of the LTE system is generally 180 KHz. Some frequency bands in the spectrum resources of LTE may be occupied by other systems such as a GSM system, and the occupied frequency bands become unavailable frequency bands. In practical application, a certain guard band may exist between the frequency bands. The width of the guard band is selected to be 320 KHz in this embodiment, and therefore the minimum available bandwidth by calculation is 500 KHz. An idle frequency band is considered as an available frequency band only when the idle frequency band is higher than 500 KHz. When acquiring the information of the available spectrum resources, idle frequency bands that are greater than or equal to the 500 KHz bandwidth are found, and are considered as available frequency bands of the LTE system.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0061">Alternatively, the minimum working bandwidth is used as the minimum available bandwidth, and a consecutive available frequency band that is greater than or equal to the minimum working bandwidth of the system is used as an available frequency band of the system. For example, the minimum working bandwidth of the LTE system is 1.4 MHz, idle frequency bands that are greater than or equal to the 1.4 MHz bandwidth are found, and the idle frequency bands are considered as the available frequency bands of the LTE system.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0062">Alternatively, in the LTE system, when the working bandwidth is 20 MHz, and a minimum resource allocation unit of type 0 is 4 RBs, then the minimum available bandwidth of the system may be determined as the bandwidth of 4 RBs plus a certain guard band, for example, be determined as 1 MHz.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0063">The aggregated carrier determined by using the forgoing method embodiment may include multiple available frequency bands, and the minimum available bandwidth of the available frequency bands may be set. In view of maximizing the frequency resource utilization, the smaller the minimum available bandwidth, the better, for example, the frequency band, which is occupied by the minimum resource allocation unit supported by the system, plus the guard band is selected; and in view of simplifying the design, the higher the minimum available bandwidth, the better, for example, the minimum working bandwidth supported by the system is selected. The idle frequency band may be specified herein as follows. After signals transmitted by other systems with a specific power in the idle frequency band reach a current system node, other system nodes' signal energy received by the current system node should be less than a certain value; alternatively, after a signal transmitted by the current system node with a specific power in the idle frequency band reaches other system nodes, the current system node's signal energy received by other system nodes should be less than a certain value, where the nodes refer to all wireless communication equipment in the system, including, but not limited to, base stations, and terminals.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Embodiment 2</heading>
<p id="p-0064" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a schematic flow chart of a carrier aggregation method according to Embodiment 2 of the present invention. The method is an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, but is not intended to limit the present invention. The method includes the following.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0065">Step S<b>21</b>: Acquire information of available spectrum resources, and perform step S<b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0066">In this step, the aggregated carriers already determined by the system may be identified as unavailable frequency bands.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0067">Step S<b>22</b>: Determine, according to the information of the available spectrum resources, whether there is an available frequency band greater than or equal to a maximum working bandwidth in the available spectrum resources. If there is an available frequency band greater than or equal to the maximum working bandwidth in the available spectrum resources, perform step S<b>23</b>; if there is no available frequency band greater than or equal to the maximum working bandwidth in the available spectrum resources, perform step S<b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0068">Step S<b>23</b>: Select a frequency band equal to the maximum working bandwidth from the available frequency bands as an aggregated carrier, and perform step S<b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0069">With 3GPP LTE as an example, a maximum working bandwidth of the system is 20 MHz, and a minimum working bandwidth is 1.4 MHz. When a frequency band greater than or equal to 20 MHz exists in the available spectrum resources, a frequency band equal to 20 MHz is selected from the available frequency bands greater than or equal to 20 MHz as the aggregated carrier. Preferably, a 20 MHz frequency band being the closest to an already determined aggregated carrier may be selected from the available frequency bands as the aggregated carrier; or a 20 MHz frequency band being the closest to an unavailable frequency band may be selected from the available frequency bands as the aggregated carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0070">Step S<b>24</b>: Select an available frequency band less than the maximum working bandwidth and greater than or equal to a minimum working bandwidth as a base frequency band, if the available frequency band exists in the available spectrum resources, and perform step S<b>25</b>. If the available frequency band greater than or equal to the minimum working bandwidth does not exist, the carrier aggregation process is terminated.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0071">If the available frequency band greater than or equal to 20 MHz does not exist in the spectrum resources of the 3GPP LTE system, the frequency band that is less than 20 MHz and greater than 1.4 MHz is further found in the spectrum resources, and the aggregated carrier may be selected by using the frequency band as a reference.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0072">Step S<b>25</b>: Determine a frequency band with a width being the maximum working bandwidth, where the frequency band with the width being the maximum design bandwidth has a center frequency which is an integral multiple of a minimum channel raster and is the closest to a center of the base frequency band, and perform step S<b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0073">In the 3GPP LTE system, the minimum channel raster of the center carrier frequency is 100 KHz, and a 20 MHz frequency band may be determined as the aggregated carrier and the frequency band has a center frequency which is the closest to the center of the base frequency band and is an integral multiple of 100 KHz, and the aggregated carrier may include available frequency bands or unavailable frequency bands. In this step, aggregated carriers which are already determined by the system may be identified as unavailable frequency bands.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0074">Step S<b>26</b>: Determine whether all the already determined aggregated carriers reach a preset criterion. If all the determined aggregated carriers reach the preset criterion, terminate the carrier aggregation process; if all the determined aggregated carriers do not reach the preset criterion, re-perform step S<b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0075">In step S<b>26</b>, if a sum of bandwidths of all the determined aggregated carriers meets a requirement for aggregating bandwidths, and/or the number of all the determined aggregated carriers reaches the maximum carrier number, the carrier aggregation process is terminated; if the sum of bandwidths of all the determined aggregated carriers does not meet the requirement for aggregating bandwidths, and/or the number of all the determined aggregated carriers does not reach the maximum carrier number, it is proved that the aggregated carriers still cannot meet the preset requirement, and the aggregation process needs to be continued, and then step S<b>21</b> and the carrier aggregation process following step S<b>21</b> are repeated. For example, if a 60 MHz bandwidth needs to be used in high-speed communication, multiple aggregated carriers less than or equal to 20 MHz may be aggregated to form a 60 MHz bandwidth. After multiple times of aggregation, a total bandwidth of the aggregated carriers is up to 60 MHz, and then the aggregation process may be terminated; and if the total bandwidth of the aggregated carriers does not reach 60 MHz, the carrier aggregation process needs to be continued. The determining whether all the determined aggregated carriers reach the preset criterion may be implemented by other methods, and this embodiment is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0076">According to this embodiment, the aggregated carrier is selected from the available frequency bands that is greater than the maximum working bandwidth to implement the carrier aggregation. When the available frequency bands that are greater than the maximum working bandwidth do not exist, the carrier aggregation is performed. In the aggregation, an available frequency band less than the maximum working bandwidth and greater than or equal to the minimum working bandwidth is selected as a reference, and a frequency equal to an integral multiple of the minimum channel raster is selected as the center frequency. The determined aggregated carrier may include multiple available or unavailable available frequency bands, and not each available frequency band needs to be configured with a synchronization channel, a broadcast channel, and a baseband processing unit as a separate carrier, so as to save the resources and decrease the system complexity. Even if an available frequency band less than the minimum working bandwidth exists in the aggregated carrier determined by the method according to the embodiment, the available frequency band can also be used, so as to improve the frequency spectrum utilization.</p>
