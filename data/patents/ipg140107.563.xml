<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Apparatus and Method of use for an improved lock nut type of fastener. On a threaded rod, a set of one or two cavity locknuts are used with a sleeve like ferrule to lock a nut in a set position on the rod. For example a nut that is clamping a workpiece can be held in place (resisting if not preventing loosening) by suitable application of the ferrule and cavity locknut. The cavity locknut has a tapered funnel-like cavity in a nut face around the nut's threaded hole. Locking is accomplished by immobilizing the ferrule on the rod and against the nut to be held, orienting the cavity side of the cavity locknut toward the ferrule, and forcefully torquing the cavity nut against and around the ferrule so that it is crimped against the threaded rod by the tapered cavity in the nut.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to mechanical fasteners and, more particularly to vibration resistant fasteners.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A machine screw-threaded rod (straight, constant diameter, not tapered like a wood screw) and mating threaded nuts are widely used to fasten together or hold one or more objects (workpieces) to form a joint. At least one of the objects has a hole, a loop, a hook, or other means for positioning a sufficient portion of it around the rod and under an inside face of a nut, thereby clamping the object(s) when the nut is tightened. On the other side of the workpiece joint from the nut, the threaded rod has a radially extending portion that is fixed relative to the threaded rod. Typically this portion is either a bolt head or an object (e.g., a second object in the joint) to which the threaded rod is fixed to make a threaded stud extending outward from the object, preferably normal to a locally planar surface. The fixed element (head) serves the purpose of immobilizing any object that is advanced on the rod until it is stopped against the head and other intermediate objects, if any.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For the sake of convenience, the present disclosure may use terms interchangeably when referring to elements that are substantially functionally equivalent in the context being described. Such interchangeable equivalence should be readily apparent from the context of use, and furthermore is usually specifically stated herein. Therefore the use of one equivalent term should be considered as representing the same use of the other equivalent terms. For example, a threaded rod, rod (with threads), stud, bolt or bolt threads are used interchangeably. For example, a bolt head is considered equivalent to a radially extending portion of anything that is fixed relative to the threaded rod (e.g., an object's surface away from which an un-rotatable threaded stud extends).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Because there are so many uses for a simple removable fastener, it is often required to hold under various degrees of vibration and shock. Thus there is a great need for a threaded rod and nut type of fastener that will hold (lock) a joint together at a desired joint pressure (holding force, clamping force) even when subjected to vibration and/or shock loads. Vibration acts like a series of small shocks that, over time, can gradually &#x201c;ratchet&#x201d; the nut in an unscrewing direction to make the joint loosen (less joint pressure). Joint pressure is typically indirectly determined and specified in terms of an amount of torque that is required to tighten the nut enough to achieve the desired joint pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For use with a single nut on a bolt or rod, there are a variety of well known &#x201c;lock washers&#x201d; in the prior art. One of the more effective versions is a Nord-Lock&#xae; Bolt Securing System washer set (NORD-LOCK Inc., 1051 Cambridge Drive, Elk Grove Village, Ill. 60007; www.nord-lock.com). In a typical example, this comprises two washers with interlocking ramps on one face of each, and a non-directional type of radial serrations on the other face of each. The two washers are placed between the nut and a work surface of the outermost object, with the ramped faces against each other. Then the nut is tightened enough to both achieve the desired clamping/joint force and to at least partially embed the serrations in both the working surface and the inside face of the nut. Given this, the interlocking ramps prevent relative rotation between the washers, and therefor between the work surface and the nut (because the serrations are frictionally binding adjacent surfaces to the respective washer). Thus torsional friction holds the nut in place on the threaded rod, and such friction is proportional to the axial load, i.e., the joint pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Unfortunately the Nord-Lock type of lock washer is relatively expensive, as well as adding extra parts to a joint. Furthermore, they lose effectiveness when either the nut face or the working surface is too slippery due to, for example, a hardened surface that doesn't allow sufficient embedding of the serrations.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As is well known, there are many other designs for lock washers, none of which are very effective in holding a joint under vibration or shock.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A different approach to maintaining the joint pressure of nut on a threaded rod/bolt is to use &#x201c;locknuts.&#x201d; In its simplest form, a first (inner) nut is tightened on the bolt against the fastened work surfaces to a desired torque, which is indicative of an axial force (joint pressure, clamping force) that is desired for holding the fastened joint together. Then a second (outer) nut, designated as s &#x201c;locknut&#x201d; or &#x201c;locking nut&#x201d;, is tightened down against the first nut until a lock nut torsion spec is met, thereby increasing the friction (due to joint pressure) between the two adjacent nut faces to a level considered sufficient to keep the second nut from unscrewing relative to the first. Obviously the nut-nut joint pressure is accompanied by an equivalent axial reaction force that acts on the nut threads against the mating rod threads&#x2014;in effect slightly stretching the threaded rod and/or distorting the mated threads within the first nut away from the same rod's threads that are mated with the threads inside the second nut.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">There are now two effects acting to lock the nut(s) in place on the bolt, thereby maintaining a constant nut-to-work-surface joint pressure. Firstly, since vibration will generally be applied to the work pieces being held together by the nut and bolt, therefore the primary ratcheting effect will occur at the work surface-to-first nut interface, thereby attempting to unscrew the first nut. However, unscrewing the first nut acts in the direction of increasing the joint pressure between the two nuts, and increasing that pressure increases the friction between the nuts while also further distorting the bolt and nut threads. Secondly, although increased friction between nuts can make them act like a single nut effectively glued together, any unscrewing action must overcome resistance due to the thread distortions that reverse direction at the nut-nut interface. The result is that attempting to torque the two nuts as one is like trying to unscrew a nut over mashed or otherwise damaged threads.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Regardless of the theory, neither lock washers nor lock nuts are universally effective, particularly when vibration is a factor. For example, the vibration can cause the locked-together nuts to unscrew together for a small distance before returning to the screwed-on position; however, since the screwing/unscrewing actions are driven by the first nut which is against the work pieces, the nuts may slip against each other on the return, with the first nut being pulled away from the second nut. Even though this is a miniscule effect at first, long term vibration can repeat this step enough times to ratchet the nuts apart sufficient to reduce the nut-to-nut pressure to the point that the countervailing axial forces between nuts and thus the thread distortions are effectively eliminated. At that point the two nuts are no longer locked and can be rather easily unscrewed together, to unfasten the joint.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another problem is that, to date, the more effective locking devices for fasteners tend to be more expensive and/or more difficult to use properly, often requiring special tools and time consuming extra work. Thus there is still an unmet, long-felt need for a more vibration resistant locking device for nut and bolt fasteners, preferably less expensive and simpler to use in a consistent and reliable way.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Additionally, there is a desire to have such a bolt locking device that can be removed at will, without having to destroy the fastener (e.g., cutting or breaking the bolt, e.g., stripping the threads of the nut(s) and/or bolt). After all, a nut and bolt fastener is often used instead of a rivet when the joint is intended to be un-fastenable at a later time, i.e., the fastener should be removable.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is an object of the present work to provide a fastening method and device that satisfies the long-felt needs for a more vibration resistant, removable fastener.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to the invention a method is disclosed of resisting movement of a nut away from a set position on a threaded rod, the method comprising the steps of: obtaining a nut that has threads mated to the threads of the rod; obtaining a ferrule having an inside diameter defined by a lengthwise bore that permits the ferrule to be positioned on a threaded lengthwise portion of the rod; provided further that the nut has a tapered cavity extending axially inward from a face of the nut, and tapering from a larger opening down to the diameter of a threaded portion of the nut; provided further that a maximum inside diameter of the tapered cavity of the nut is greater than an outside diameter of a lengthwise end of the ferrule; positioning the ferrule on a threaded lengthwise portion of the rod; threading the nut onto the threaded rod so that the tapered cavity of the nut is facing the end of the ferrule; positioning the nut so that the tapered cavity of the nut contacts the end of the ferrule; and torquing the nut with sufficient force to crimp the ferrule against the threads of the threaded rod, thereby resisting movement of the nut away from a set position.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the invention the method uses a ferrule wherein the bore has threads mated to the threads of the rod.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the invention the method uses a ferrule that is immobilized by an immobilizing component at the other, lengthwise distal end of the ferrule. A further method step is positioning one or more workpieces for clamping between the immobilizing component and the ferrule. A further method step is countersinking a tapered cavity into an inside face of a workpiece facing the ferrule.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Further according to the method of the invention: before the step of positioning the ferrule on the rod, a first nut that has threads mated to the threads of the rod is threaded onto the threaded rod; then: the ferrule is positioned on a threaded lengthwise portion of the rod such that a first end of the ferrule is facing an inside face of the first nut; a second nut is threaded onto the threaded rod so that an inside face of the second nut is facing a second end of the ferrule that is distal to the first end; the first nut, the ferrule, and the second nut are positioned on a threaded lengthwise portion of the rod such that the first and second nuts contact the first and second ferrule ends, respectively; and the first and second nuts are torqued together with sufficient force to crimp the ferrule against the threads of the threaded rod. Furthermore, either one of the first and second nuts has a tapered cavity extending axially inward from the inside face of the nut and tapering from a larger opening down to the diameter of a threaded portion of the nut. Even further, both the first nut and the second nut may have a tapered cavity extending axially inward from the inside face of the nut, and tapering from a larger opening down to the diameter of a threaded portion of the nut.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further according to the method of the invention, steps comprise: torquing the first nut against the immobilizing component sufficiently to achieve a desired clamping force therebetween, thereby establishing the set position for the first nut; obtaining instructions for tightening the second nut against the ferrule and the first nut, wherein the instructions state a torque value that is expected to be sufficient to crimp the ferrule against the threads of the threaded rod; and torquing the second nut in accordance with said instructions. A further method step comprises positioning one or more workpieces for clamping between the immobilizing component and the first nut.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Further according to the method of the invention, the instructions state that the torque value is an amount that closes the nut to nut separation distance to essentially zero. Alternatively the instructions state that the torque value is an amount that achieves a stated fraction of a turn after the first and second nuts contact the first and second ferrule ends, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to the method of the invention, a strength specification for the nut is achieved by obtaining a nut with a tapered cavity wherein the nut has an extended axial thickness sufficient to maintain a threaded portion of the nut that is in accord with requirements of the strength specification.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to the method of the invention, the threaded rod is a bolt.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to the method of the invention, the nut has a tapered cavity on both axial faces of the nut.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to the method of the invention, the ferrule has a lesser outside diameter at either or both of the ends than it does between the ends.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to the method of the invention, the ferrule has one or more weakened portions for reducing the amount of force that is sufficient to crimp the ferrule against the threads of the threaded rod. Furthermore, the ferrule may be weakened by one or more radially open slots. Even further, one slot may extend the entire length of the ferrule.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to the method of the invention, a portion of the ferrule is weakened by reduced thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to the method of the invention, a wall of the tapered cavity in the nut has a radially extending groove or ridge feature.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to the method of the invention, the ferrule is crimped such that a portion thereof is embedded in the threads of the threaded rod.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to the method of the invention, the ferrule is crimped such that the tapered cavity around the threaded rod is substantially filled by the crimped ferrule.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Other objects, features and advantages of the invention will become apparent in light of the following description thereof.</p>

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3B</figref>, some representative embodiments are illustrated. An inventively modified nut <b>120</b> has threads <b>124</b> that correspond to (i.e., mate with, are mated to) the threads <b>908</b> of a threaded rod <b>910</b> (e.g., rod portion of a bolt) on which the nut <b>120</b> is intended (designed) to be used. One face <b>126</b> of the nut has a tapered cavity <b>122</b> extending axially inward from the face <b>126</b> to a depth &#x201c;E&#x201d; where it transitions to the nut threads <b>124</b>. An inside diameter D4 of the cavity <b>122</b> at the face <b>126</b> is made equal to or greater than an outside diameter (D3=D1) of a lengthwise end <b>112</b> of the ferrule (e.g., <b>110</b>, <b>110</b>&#x2032;). The ferrules <b>110</b>, <b>110</b>&#x2032; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> have ends <b>112</b> which have tapered down from a centered collar portion <b>114</b> having, in this example, a maximum ferrule outside diameter D3, to a sharp edge where the outside diameter D3 becomes equal to the inside diameter D1 of the ferrule <b>110</b>, which in turn is comparable to the outside diameter of the threaded rod <b>910</b> because the ferrule <b>110</b> is preferably close fitting on the threaded rod <b>910</b>. Thus the tapered cavity <b>122</b> &#x201c;tapers&#x201d; from a larger opening down to the nominal thread diameter D2 at a depth E. The nominal thread diameter of the nut is nominally equivalent to the outside diameter of the mating threaded rod <b>910</b>, therefore both are labeled as diameter D2. The cavity <b>122</b> may be referred to as &#x201c;conical&#x201d; or &#x201c;funnel-like&#x201d; due to the reduction of diameter, but the linear profiled cone shape shown in the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is merely representative of a variety of shapes whose suitability will become more clear as the shape's purpose and function is further disclosed hereinbelow. In another embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> a &#x201c;wire drawing die&#x201d; type of shape is illustrated. It can be seen that a nominal cavity wall <b>122</b> slope designated as a taper angle A22 has clear meaning in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, but with the curved profile of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> the taper angle A22 varies with depth along a range as shown, so for irregular profiles the nominal taper angle A22 will be understood as an approximation, for example an average, or for example, maybe the angle at the cavity opening in the face <b>126</b> of the nut <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Where it is desirable to meet a Fastener Standard (e.g., a specified tensile strength of the nut threads), the modified nut <b>120</b> is formed from a nut body having an extended axial thickness sufficient to maintain a threaded portion <b>124</b> of the nut that is in accord with requirements of the Fastener Standard strength specification. For example <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows a threaded portion <b>124</b> of the nut <b>120</b> having the same thickness T of a nut meeting the standard, plus an added body thickness E to accommodate the depth E of the tapered cavity <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (more will be presented hereinbelow) the ferrule <b>110</b>, <b>110</b>&#x2032; has a tapered nose on both lengthwise ends <b>112</b> such that the taper profile of the end <b>112</b> mates with the tapered cavity <b>122</b> in the nut <b>120</b>. (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> for an example of this wherein the ferrule end taper angle A12 equals the cavity taper angle A22.) The shape and dimensions of the mating tapered portions are such that a predetermined amount of pressure on a joint of the mating tapered portions <b>112</b>, <b>122</b> (e.g., from screwing torque applied to the nut <b>120</b>) will cause the ferrule <b>110</b> to be crimped (or swaged) against the threads <b>908</b> of the threaded rod <b>910</b>, i.e., radially squeezed all around the rod by distorting the ferrule end <b>112</b> in the direction of reducing its circumference and diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the disclosure hereinbelow we will discuss advantages and disadvantages of various shapes and dimensions for ferrules <b>110</b>, <b>110</b>&#x2032; and the like. It may be noted that the inventive ferruled locknut system/set/method (e.g., <b>100</b>) does not require tapered ends <b>112</b> on the ferrule (e.g., <b>110</b>, <b>110</b>&#x2032;). For example, in the next set of drawings (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>) the ferrule <b>110</b> has a different ferrule end taper angle A12 magnitude than the cavity taper angle A22.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The offset view of the ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2032; shows that it is threaded, i.e., the ferrule's axial bore <b>111</b> has threads <b>124</b> mated to the threads <b>908</b> of the rod <b>910</b>. The ferrule body <b>114</b> (e.g., a middle portion) can advantageously have some type of gripping feature such as, for example, knurling as shown, so that the threaded ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2032; can be hand tightened against a first nut (e.g., <b>120</b>) in a locknut pair. Other examples of gripping features <b>114</b> include, but are not limited to: hex flats, two wrench flats, prong-notches or cavities, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4D</figref> illustrate a method of use for the ferruled locknut set <b>100</b> that is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. It will be seen that this method, which employs a ferrule (e.g., <b>110</b>) and a cavity nut (or locknut) (e.g., <b>120</b>), both important elements according to the present invention, is an effective method of preventing (or at least significantly resisting) movement of a nut away from a set position on a threaded rod <b>910</b>, i.e., providing a vastly improved form of &#x201c;locknut&#x201d;. Although the ferruled locknut set <b>100</b> could be used to simply hold two nuts in a set position anywhere on a threaded rod <b>910</b> (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B), most of the usage examples in the present disclosure show what is expected to be the most common use wherein a nut is used to clamp one or more workpieces <b>914</b> (e.g., metal sheets or bars, a flange or bracket, etc.) together on a bolt, or mounted on (removably affixed to) a massive object like a machine base or other immobilizing component <b>912</b> that has a threaded rod (stud) <b>910</b> extending therefrom. Be it a bolt head (e.g., bolt with head in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>) or a massive object (e.g., a bulkhead in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>) the immobilizing component <b>912</b> provides a clamping counterpart for a nut on the rod such that the workpiece(s) <b>914</b> are positioned for clamping between the immobilizing component <b>912</b> and the nut (e.g., a generic or &#x201c;regular&#x201d; nut <b>20</b> as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>) which is then torqued sufficiently to provide a desired clamping force F1/F1r. Typically a second generic nut <b>20</b><i>b </i>is used as a &#x201c;locknut&#x201d; by torquing it against the first nut <b>20</b><i>a</i>. So far, this process is a common method for fastening something, and as discussed in the background, the common method is often insufficient for the user's needs/desires. The present invention provides a much more secure form of &#x201c;locknut&#x201d;, or more generally stated, a locking device/system/method for nut-and-bolt type fasteners (bolt meaning a threaded rod <b>910</b>, preferably, but not necessarily, with an immobilizing component <b>912</b> affixed to one end of it).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> show a first nut (in this example a cavity nut <b>120</b><i>a</i>) after it has been threaded onto the threaded rod <b>910</b> (of a bolt), and torqued as desired against the bolt head <b>912</b> thereby clamping two workpieces <b>914</b><i>a</i>, <b>914</b><i>b </i>with a desired clamping force F1r which is the equal force in a reverse direction from the tensile force F1 which is tending to stretch the threaded rod <b>910</b>. It should be clear that this clamping function does not require a cavity nut <b>120</b> since it can be performed by any generic nut <b>20</b>. The inventive locking device <b>100</b> comes into play after this clamping function is performed, which establishes a set position on the threaded rod <b>910</b>. Since the established clamping force is directly dependent on the set position of the nut <b>20</b>, <b>120</b>; and since movement of the components (e.g., workpiece <b>914</b> being moved by vibration), a locking device such as a locknut is desirable if not critical depending upon the usage.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">To continue the illustrated example wherein a cavity nut <b>120</b> is used as the first nut <b>120</b><i>a</i>; it can be seen that to be involved in the locking function, the tapered cavity <b>122</b> (<b>122</b><i>a </i>in the first nut) faces &#x201c;inside&#x201d; the locking device <b>100</b> where the other components will be positioned. Thus the cavity nut's face <b>126</b> becomes an inside face <b>126</b><i>a </i>on the first nut <b>120</b><i>a</i>. Next, the ferrule <b>110</b> is positioned on a threaded lengthwise portion of the rod <b>910</b> such that a first end <b>112</b><i>a </i>of the ferrule <b>110</b> is facing the inside face <b>126</b><i>a </i>of the first nut <b>120</b><i>a</i>. A second nut (e.g., cavity nut <b>120</b><i>b</i>) is threaded onto the threaded rod <b>910</b> so that an inside face <b>126</b><i>b </i>of the second nut <b>120</b><i>b </i>is facing a second end <b>112</b><i>b </i>of the ferrule <b>110</b> that is distal to the first end <b>112</b><i>a </i>Like the first nut <b>120</b><i>a</i>, the second nut <b>120</b><i>b </i>is oriented such that the nut's cavity <b>122</b><i>b </i>is in the nut face <b>126</b> that becomes the inside face <b>126</b><i>b </i>of the second nut <b>120</b><i>b</i>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, the first nut <b>120</b><i>a</i>, the ferrule <b>110</b>, and the second nut <b>120</b><i>b </i>are positioned on a threaded lengthwise portion of the rod <b>910</b> such that the first and second nuts <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b</i>, respectively, contact the first and second ferrule ends <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b</i>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Because of various design factors such as the ferrule's overall axial length L, when the second nut <b>120</b><i>b </i>is thus made &#x201c;finger tight&#x201d; on the ferrule <b>110</b> the nut faces <b>126</b><i>a</i>, <b>126</b><i>b </i>have a suitable separation distance X, the suitability being that X is a distance such that when the second nut <b>120</b><i>b </i>is forcibly tightened (torqued) to make the nut faces <b>126</b><i>a</i>, <b>126</b><i>b </i>meet as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> (i.e., separation distance reduced to essentially zero), then the ferrule <b>110</b> should be crimped sufficiently to create a designer-specified locknut holding force magnitude which has been predetermined by the ferrule and nut designer who determined the proper combination of the shape and dimensions and material of the ferrule <b>110</b>, the nut <b>120</b>, and its cavity <b>122</b>. Of course the design will also be influenced by given features and requirements such as threaded rod diameter D2 and thread profile, the fastener usage requirements, applicable fastener standards and specifications, and probably other factors like the threaded rod material, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Because of considerations such as these, it is desirable to sell fasteners as a &#x201c;kit&#x201d; or matched set <b>100</b> which includes, for example, at least one cavity nut <b>120</b> matched with one ferrule <b>110</b>, thereby assuring the user that the fastener set <b>100</b> has been optimized by design to work together to meet a particular standard of performance when used with a particular type of threaded rod <b>910</b> in specified usage. To meet tighter specifications and/or more severe usage conditions it may be desirable to include the specified threaded rod (typically a bolt) <b>910</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the final step (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>), the first and second nuts <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b</i>, respectively, are torqued together with sufficient force to &#x201c;crimp&#x201d; the ferrule against the threads <b>908</b> of the threaded rod <b>910</b>. In this illustrated example, torquing together means forcibly tightening the second nut <b>120</b><i>b </i>against the ferrule <b>110</b> and the first nut <b>120</b><i>a </i>which is already in an effectively immovable set position.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The term &#x201c;crimp&#x201d; is used somewhat generically to mean distorted in a way that moves the material of the ferrule <b>110</b> in a shape changing, material displacing manner which squeezes ferrule material away from an overly-confined portion of the cavity <b>122</b> into any available open space, such as being compressed tightly against the threads <b>908</b>, and if enough force is applied, down into the threads <b>908</b>, as shown. This is like swaging or wire drawing through a die, especially given the generally funnel-like shape of the tapered cavity (walls) <b>122</b>. However, it will be seen from the description hereinbelow, that distortion and material movement of the ferrule during crimping is affected by many factors which can be advantageously varied in the design of various embodiments of ferruled locknut sets <b>100</b>. All of the embodiments illustrated herein are believed to be within the scope of the present invention(s) as claimed because all of them involve at least one cavity nut <b>120</b> and a ferrule <b>110</b> which is crimped against the threaded rod <b>910</b> when an end <b>112</b> of the ferrule <b>110</b> is sufficiently forced into the tapered cavity <b>122</b> of the nut <b>120</b>. Whatever is eventually determined to be the essential elements of the invention(s), variations and additions to the physical components or the method of use that don't eliminate any of the essential elements of the invention are considered within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The locknut holding force is determined by a number of factors including the force/reaction force vectors F2/F2r shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>. In reaction to the compressive crimping, the ferrule <b>110</b> is pushing the two nuts apart, while the threaded rod <b>910</b> reacts to tensile force applied by the nuts to the threads and pulls the nuts together. Although not illustrated, it can be seen that there is also a radial component to the forces around the compressively crimped ferrule <b>110</b>, thereby providing extra force against the threads of the threaded rod <b>910</b> and against the wall of the cavity <b>922</b> that is really a surface of the nut <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Another factor in holding force can be seen by comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4C and 4D</figref>: the ferrule <b>110</b> has been distorted by the crimping such that it greatly increases its contact area with the nut and threaded rod. The contact area is very limited at first, contact being at the outermost points of the ferrule ends <b>112</b> where they first touch the cavity wall and at some portions of the threads' outermost tips wherever the &#x201c;close fitting&#x201d; but still easily movable ferrule bore <b>111</b> happens to scrape against or rest upon them. After crimping, the ferrule <b>110</b> has distorted enough to contact a large portion, if not all of the cavity wall <b>122</b>, and has established intimate contact all around the outside of the threads plus at least some of the sides of the threads.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Friction is proportional to both surface area of contact and to perpendicular force magnitude, therefor the magnitude of friction forces that will counteract any attempt to rotate either one of the nuts has been greatly increased in a mostly irreversible way since the ferrule material has been rather permanently deformed. This greatly increased friction is in addition to the usual friction provided by locknuts which, when their inside faces are torqued together, produce axial force vectors similar to the F2/F2r vectors, and these forces cause the inward side of the threads <b>908</b> to pull inward (F2r) against the outward faces of the nut threads that are being pushed outward (F2) by contact pressure between the nut faces. Thus there is friction between each nut and the threaded rod. Furthermore, there is friction between the nut faces <b>126</b><i>a</i>, <b>126</b><i>b </i>that is proportional to the surface area and the amount of torque that applied force of the second nut face onto the first nut face. Here there is somewhat of a tradeoff since the cavity or cavities <b>122</b> reduce the surface area of the nut face, and also the face to face force is only whatever amount exceeds the force needed to hold the ferrule <b>110</b> in its compressed/crimped state. It may be noted that the face-to-face contact area provides frictional resistance to movement of one nut relative to the other, while the forces acting on the nut-to-thread contact area resist any movement of the nuts relative to the threaded rod, whether they move together or separately. However, the crimped ferrule <b>110</b> bridges the boundary between nuts, and thereby simultaneously provides frictional resistance to any movement of the nuts relative to the threaded rod and relative to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Another interesting note: the force component between nut faces acts on the first nut <b>120</b><i>a </i>to threaded rod <b>908</b> interface in a direction opposed to that of the clamping force F1/F1r. Speaking in terms of directions as seen in the drawings of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B and 4D</figref>, the first nut torqued against the workpieces <b>914</b> and bolt head <b>912</b> creates a force F1 that uses the right side of the first nut's threads to pull the threaded rod toward the right of the workpieces <b>914</b> (and bolt head <b>912</b>) while pushing the workpieces to the left with equal force F1r. Thus friction is created in proportion to the amount of the force F1/F1r that is applied to the right side of the first nut's threads. At the same time, the second nut torqued against the first nut creates a force F2r that uses the second nut's threads to also pull the threaded rod to the right while pushing the first nut to the left with equal force F2. However, pulling the threaded rod by the second nut means that the force F2 is being applied by the rod threads toward the left side of the first nut's threads. This means that application of the ferruled locknut <b>100</b> to a clamping nut (e.g., first nut <b>120</b><i>a</i>) tends to reduce the frictional resistance to rotation of the first nut on the threaded rod while increasing the frictional resistance to movement of the first nut relative to the second nut and to movement of the second nut relative to the threaded rod. It also tends to reduce the frictional &#x201c;grip&#x201d; of the workpieces on the first nut.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Thus it can be seen that there are many ways to vary the performance and functional behavior of the ferruled locknut system <b>100</b> such that an engineer/designer can optimize structure and method of use to produce a wide variety of ferruled locknut kits designed for a wide variety of usage conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6D</figref> illustrate substantially the same method of use as described above, but slightly adapted for use with a threaded ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2032;, a variation of the ferrule <b>110</b> wherein the ferrule bore (still ID of D1) has threads <b>124</b> mated to the threads <b>908</b> of the threaded rod <b>910</b> (OD of D2) as shown in perspective view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> shows a first nut <b>120</b><i>a </i>that is screwed onto a bolt <b>910</b> (threaded rod with a head <b>912</b>), and tightened against the workpiece(s) <b>914</b> of the joint to be clamped. The first nut <b>120</b><i>a </i>is tightened (e.g., by a suitable wrench which may be a torque wrench if precise specs must be met) to a specified (desired) torque per usual practice for nuts <b>20</b> clamping a joint. Next the threaded ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2032; is threaded onto the bolt <b>910</b> and hand tightened to position it against the first nut <b>120</b><i>a </i>(i.e., a first ferrule extension/end <b>112</b><i>a </i>is advanced into and up against the cavity wall <b>122</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>). To assist hand tightening the threaded ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2032;, the ferrule body <b>114</b> can have some type of gripping feature such as, for example, knurling as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In the next step, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, the second nut <b>120</b><i>b </i>is screwed onto the bolt <b>910</b> until it is hand tightened against the threaded ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2032; (i.e., the second nut <b>120</b><i>b </i>is advanced such that the tapered cavity <b>122</b><i>b </i>of the second nut <b>120</b><i>b </i>surrounds the second ferrule end <b>112</b><i>b</i>, axially distal to the first end <b>112</b><i>a</i>, and stops with the end <b>112</b><i>b </i>up against the cavity wall <b>122</b><i>b</i>). The ferruled locknut set <b>100</b> is designed such that this hand tightening will result in the two nut faces <b>126</b><i>a </i>and <b>126</b><i>b </i>still being separated (not touching each other), e.g., a separation distance X. Finally the second nut <b>120</b><i>b </i>is tightened a specified amount on the threaded ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2032;, and possibly also against the first nut <b>120</b><i>a</i>. In an embodiment, for example, the specified amount of tightening could be &#x201c;&#xbc; turn&#x201d; (one quarter turn, i.e., 90 degrees). In another embodiment, for example, the specified amount could be &#x201c;until the two nut faces touch&#x201d;, and/or until a specified torque value is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">When first tried, the threaded ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2032; was expected to produce a stronger locknut holding force due to its threads <b>124</b> that were already extended most of the way into the threads <b>908</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>) which, when crimped, should yield pressure on much more surface area of the threads <b>908</b> than for the unthreaded ferrule <b>110</b> (compare <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4D to 6D</figref>). However my testing showed that although it is effective as a locking device, the threaded ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2032; may not be as good in general use as the unthreaded version <b>110</b> because of a different behavior it exhibits. At least with the component materials tested so far, the threaded ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2032; tends to be swaged more on the back end <b>112</b><i>b </i>than the front end <b>112</b><i>a </i>because the second nut <b>120</b><i>b </i>is crushing (crimping, swaging) the back end <b>112</b><i>b </i>of the threaded ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2032; while simultaneously trying to turn the threaded ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2032; to advance it along the bolt threads <b>908</b> into the cavity <b>122</b><i>a </i>of the first nut <b>120</b><i>a</i>, so that the front end of the ferrule <b>112</b><i>a </i>can then be swaged.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">On the other hand, these issues are more of a problem in the situation described than they would be for a locking device application that only crimps one end of the threaded ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2032;. In the disclosure hereinbelow (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A</figref>, <b>7</b>B, <b>11</b>) we will present some ferruled locknut <b>100</b> applications that may benefit from use of a threaded ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2032;. Also, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the cavity nut <b>120</b><i>a </i>is shown with a threaded ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2032; hand tightened into intimate contact with the cavity <b>122</b> (especially possible because the taper angle A12 of the ferrule end <b>112</b><i>a </i>is closely matched to the taper angle A22 of the cavity wall <b>122</b>). Given that the threads <b>124</b> of the threaded ferrule are mated with the bolt threads <b>908</b>, it should be possible to hold the ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2032; in a set position on the threaded rod <b>910</b> while the cavity nut <b>120</b><i>a </i>is torqued against it. The farther the cavity nut <b>120</b> is forced over the threaded ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2032; the more it will be crimped to fill the bolt threads <b>908</b> and thereby supply increasing frictional resistance to movement of the ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2032; away from the nut <b>120</b>. It may require a stronger gripping feature than knurling on the ferrule body, but wrench flats, prong holes or the like on the ferrule body <b>114</b> could easily do the job. This combination of a ferrule and one cavity nut could be used to establish a set location along the length of a threaded rod <b>910</b>. An example might be to use this particular embodiment of a ferruled locknut as stops to support spaced apart crossbars on a long hanging threaded rod.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In general, however, the threaded ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2032; tends to make the locking device <b>100</b> more difficult to assemble or remove. First of all, the threaded ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2032; requires an extra operation to assemble&#x2014;that of properly engaging the ferrule threads <b>124</b> with the bolt threads <b>908</b> and then hand tightening all the way to the first nut <b>120</b><i>a </i>(or regular clamping nut <b>20</b><i>a</i>). Secondly, when crimped, the threads of the ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2032; tend to completely fill at least a part of the bolt's thread <b>908</b>, which makes unscrewing it difficult (an advantage for holding the first nut's position, but a disadvantage when removal of the nuts is desired).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a way to add more locknut holding strength by increasing the friction between nut faces <b>126</b>. Shown are two cavity nuts <b>120</b>&#x2032; that have a high friction surface feature&#x2014;in this embodiment being an unscrewing resistant face <b>126</b>&#x2032;, e.g., interlocking radial serrations having a ramped sawtooth shape for interlocking with complementary mating ramps on a mating nut <b>126</b>&#x2032;. The ramped serrations are oriented to only allow tightening rotation of one nut face <b>126</b>&#x2032; against the other face <b>126</b>&#x2032;. Other ferruled locknut set <b>100</b> embodiments wherein friction is increased between nut faces (e.g., <b>126</b>, <b>126</b>&#x2032;, <b>26</b>) are also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 11</figref>, described hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Various prototype Ferruled Locknut sets <b>100</b> have been tested on an Instron and in a rigorous standardized &#x201c;Junker Fastener Vibration Test.&#x201d; So far, tests of limited sample size have yielded excellent results, far exceeding minimum mil specs for security of threaded fastener joints. It may be noted that tests of an earlier experimental locknut pair that had only the modified nut face <b>126</b>&#x2032; (but no ferrule or cavity) produced unsatisfactory Junker test results, therefor the most significant features of the present invention are believed to be the ferrule <b>110</b> and cavity nut <b>120</b> sets according to the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Successfully tested prototypes include both stainless and brass ferrules <b>110</b> with stainless steel cavity nuts <b>120</b> made by cutting the tapered cavity <b>122</b> in a &#xbc;-20 nut for use with a corresponding (mating) &#xbc;-20 bolt (threaded rod) <b>910</b>. Other materials are expected to work as well as, maybe even better than the first prototype. For example, a hard metal cavity nut and bolt may be combined with ferrules <b>110</b> made from various softer materials in order to enhance the crimping/swaging effect. For example, plastics and composite materials may be advantageous.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Different ferrule and cavity shapes continue to be developed to optimize the design for various applications and threaded rod sizes. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the overall length L of the ferrule <b>110</b> and other lengths and diameters as shown can be varied relative to the cavity shape and depth (E) to vary the amount of ferrule material involved in the crimp deformation and the degree of swaging/crimping that occurs. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, such variations can mean the difference between completely filling the cavity space with the crimped ferrule <b>110</b> material versus partially filling it.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">We now present additional embodiments and variations of the ferruled locknut <b>100</b> device and fastening method.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7B</figref>, what could be called a single-ended ferrule <b>110</b> is shown being used to secure a cavity nut (locknut) <b>120</b><i>b </i>against a regular nut <b>20</b><i>a </i>that is torqued onto the workpieces <b>914</b> being fastened (clamped) together. The locknut <b>120</b><i>b </i>is substantially equivalent to previously described locknuts <b>120</b><i>b</i>, having a face <b>126</b><i>b </i>and a cavity <b>122</b>. The regular nut has a face <b>26</b><i>a</i>. Both nut faces <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>126</b><i>b </i>are oriented to face the ferrule <b>110</b> as &#x201c;inside&#x201d; faces. When the locknut <b>120</b><i>b </i>is finger tight on the ferrule <b>110</b> the inside faces have a suitable separation distance X that may be different from the separation distance X for a double ended ferrule <b>110</b> (being used between two cavity nuts <b>120</b>), the suitability being a distance that swages the ferrule <b>110</b> enough to create a desired holding force when the second nut <b>120</b><i>b </i>is tightened to make the faces meet as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. As stated hereinabove, other criteria may be used to indicate a suitable amount of crimping.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b>, and <b>10</b> show examples of some other fastening method embodiments that may be useful, for example, in decreasing expense by eliminating the first nut <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>a </i>so that only a ferrule <b>110</b> and one cavity nut <b>120</b> are used to tighten against the workpiece(s) <b>914</b> and/or the immobilizing component <b>912</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows use of a ferrule <b>110</b> that has a first slope (taper angle) A12a on the first ferrule end <b>112</b><i>a </i>that is greater (larger angle, steeper) than the slope A12b on the second ferrule end <b>112</b><i>b </i>which is used with the locknut cavity <b>122</b>. Angles and the length of the ferrule center portion <b>114</b> can be adjusted to suitable values when they are tested, but it is anticipated that the steeper slope on the front end might be partly crimped into the through hole <b>915</b> as the ferrule <b>110</b> is crimped against the face <b>926</b> of the workpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a similar application wherein a washer or lock washer <b>916</b> is inserted between the workpiece <b>914</b><i>b </i>and the ferrule <b>110</b>. In this example, the washer <b>916</b> has a larger center hole <b>917</b>, so a longer ferrule end <b>112</b><i>a </i>is used to be crimped more into the hole <b>917</b> and against the bolt threads <b>908</b> within. Again, ferrule <b>110</b> dimensions may need adjustment.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a similar application (without washer) wherein the inside workpiece <b>914</b><i>b </i>has a tapered cavity <b>122</b> that has been countersunk into its inside face <b>926</b> (e.g., during assembly of the joint), such that the workpiece cavity <b>122</b> will be used to swage/crimp the ferrule <b>110</b> where it is pressed into it. Since the example shows a workpiece cavity <b>122</b> that is substantially equivalent in shape and dimensions to the cavity <b>122</b> of the cavity nut <b>120</b>, then both ferrule ends <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b </i>may be able to use the same shape and dimensions as each other.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">It may be recognized by the knowledgeable reader that the single nut embodiments are likely to be less effective than the full double-nut embodiment, however the single nut version may be adequate for use in less demanding applications. Alternatively, in certain cases it may be desirable to use a ferrule <b>110</b> with a first cavity locknut <b>120</b> the way it is used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, for example, but then securely locking all of that in place by using a second ferrule <b>110</b> and cavity locknut <b>120</b> on the other side of the first cavity locknut <b>120</b>. This would be the most secure if the second ferrule <b>110</b> were to be crimped on both ends by facing tapered cavities <b>122</b>, as in FIG. <b>4</b>D. A convenient way to do this is to make the first locknut <b>120</b> as a double-cavity locknut <b>120</b>, i.e., having two tapered cavities <b>122</b> on the axially opposed faces <b>126</b> of a single nut. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, such a nut is easily visualized wherein the double cavity nut has a sufficient axial length to allow for an adequate threaded portion length T between the two cavities <b>122</b>, each of depth E.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> again, it may also be noted that the lockwasher <b>916</b> in the nut-to-work surface joint, could be considered helpful by increasing friction between the workpiece surface <b>926</b> and the nut face <b>126</b>, but further consideration and/or testing may show that this is undesirable. For example, a workpiece <b>914</b> may be resilient such that the clamping torque specified for the first nut is relatively light or even just finger tight. In this case the joint holding capability is entirely controlled by the locknut set's ability to hold itself locked and fixed at a set position on the threaded rod <b>910</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a flanged ferrule <b>230</b> that is similar to a single ended ferrule <b>110</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7B</figref>) except that a washer-like flange <b>236</b> extends radially outward from the non-tapered end of it. As in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> this flanged ferrule <b>230</b> can be used, as shown, with a regular nut <b>20</b><i>a </i>and a cavity nut <b>120</b><i>b </i>which will torque against the face <b>26</b> of the first (regular) nut <b>20</b><i>a </i>while crimping (swaging) the end <b>112</b> of the ferrule <b>230</b> inside the cavity <b>122</b>. As this happens, the flange <b>236</b> will be compressed between the nut faces <b>26</b> and <b>126</b>. The flange <b>236</b> may have a variety of axial face characteristics as suitable for different purposes and/or uses. For example, both faces (left and right as shown) could have a rough texture to increase frictional resistance to unscrewing the locknut <b>120</b><i>b</i>. For example, the flange <b>236</b> may be fashioned like a lock washer (compare <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). For example, the left face could be polished, Teflon coated, and the like to make a slippery surface for placement against a workpiece surface <b>926</b> when a first nut is not used (as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). This would allow the ferrule end <b>112</b> to crimp and lock inside the second nut cavity <b>122</b> while at the same time minimizing unscrewing forces that might come from contact with a vibrating workpiece <b>914</b>, for example. If the flanged ferrule <b>230</b> has threads <b>124</b> like the threaded ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2032;, then this may work even better.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A-14</figref> illustrate a ferruled locknut system (set, kit) <b>100</b>&#x2032; embodiment with a modified cavity locknut <b>220</b> wherein the cavity wall <b>122</b> has a radially outward/inward extending groove <b>221</b><i>a</i>/ridge <b>221</b><i>b </i>respectively. These two cavity wall modifications may be referenced collectively as features <b>221</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A</figref>, <b>12</b>B and <b>14</b> illustrate an example of an annular groove <b>221</b><i>a </i>cut radially outward in the cavity wall <b>122</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A</figref>, <b>13</b>B illustrate an example of a cavity wall <b>122</b> having four flute-like ridges <b>221</b><i>b </i>that extend radially inward an increasing amount as the cavity depth increases. In other words, the peak of each ridge <b>221</b><i>b </i>ramps radially inward from the cavity wall <b>122</b> at a much steeper cavity taper angle A22&#x2032; than the rest of the cavity wall's taper angle A22. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> shows the two angles together for comparison of magnitude, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref> shows the different lines along the cavity where the two angles are measured.) The system <b>100</b>&#x2032; is otherwise substantially the same as previously described systems <b>100</b>. The modified cavity locknut <b>220</b> is best seen in cross section as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12B and 13A</figref>, both cross-sections being taken along a line such as the line <b>12</b>B-<b>12</b>B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The annular groove <b>221</b> can be, for example, a square-U shape as shown, a rounded bottom, and the like; but preferably it has a sharp or squared-off (not beveled) edge transition at the cavity wall <b>122</b> of the nut <b>220</b>. The groove <b>221</b> is axially (longitudinally) positioned preferably close to the start of the nut's threads <b>124</b> and concentric about the nut's axis (not pitched like the threads). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a perspective cutaway view of the grooved cavity system <b>100</b>&#x2032; showing the result of tightening the locknuts <b>120</b> and <b>220</b> according to the invention. A locking ridge <b>210</b> is formed by material of the ferrule <b>110</b> that is squeezed outward into the groove <b>221</b> as a result of being swaged by the tapered cavity wall <b>122</b> of the grooved locknut <b>220</b>. The ridge <b>210</b> provides an added locking mechanism for holding the grooved locknut <b>220</b> in position relative to the bolt threads. This provides a physical hook that resists pulling the cavity <b>122</b> of the grooved locknut <b>220</b> back away from the crimped ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2014;disengaging the second locknut <b>220</b><i>b </i>from being locked against the first locknut (e.g., <b>120</b><i>a</i>). Since the nut <b>220</b> must be unscrewed to move axially away from the ferrule <b>110</b>, another effect of the groove <b>221</b> is to increase surface area of contact between the nut and ferrule where the crimped ferrule <b>110</b> has been extruded into the groove <b>221</b> to form the locking ridge <b>210</b> as shown. This will add frictional resistance against rotating the crimped ferrule <b>110</b> relative to the cavity wall <b>122</b> and therefor relative to the nut <b>220</b>. This increase adds to the friction between the crimped ferrule <b>110</b> and the rest of the cavity wall <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Similarly, the axially directed ridges <b>221</b><i>b </i>will provide a very effective block against rotational movement of the locknut <b>220</b> relative to the crimped ferrule <b>110</b>. An additional effect, at least for ridges <b>221</b> that flute the cavity wall <b>122</b> such as these do, is that the ridges' steeper cavity taper angle A22&#x2032; alternates with the wall's taper angle A22 to cause a fluted or corrugated crimping pattern in the ferrule <b>110</b> when it is crimped.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Given this teaching, it can be seen that the grooved locknut <b>220</b> can be advantageously used for either or both of the first and second locknuts (cavity nuts) <b>120</b>, as well as in any of the other embodiments and configurations of the inventive &#x201c;Ferrule-Lock&#x201d; fastener <b>100</b> and methods of its use. Furthermore, it can be seen that the groove <b>221</b> will perform the described function even if it is only a portion of an annulus (not fully circumferential) and even if it is irregularly shaped and oriented in the cavity wall (e.g., reverse spiral versus the thread pitch <b>908</b>; e.g., axially extending grooves <b>221</b> for more direct rotation resistance, etc.). Even further, similar resistance effects as those produced by the radially-outward extending groove <b>221</b> appears likely to derive from an &#x201c;inverted groove&#x201d;, i.e., a radially-inward extending ridge <b>221</b> as shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A</figref>, <b>13</b>B. We expect this concept to produce varying degrees of improved locknut holding strength whether the groove/ridge feature <b>221</b> is a radially outward or inward extending feature&#x2014;either recess or bump&#x2014;that abruptly changes the otherwise smooth cavity wall <b>122</b>, preferably having a sharp edge that is somewhat orthogonal to movement of the crimped ferrule relative to the cavity wall <b>122</b> of the nut <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A-15B</figref> illustrate how the ferrule locknut <b>100</b> installation process produces the locking ridge <b>210</b> according to the inventive method of use. The method of use with the modified ferruled locknut set <b>100</b>&#x2032; is substantially equivalent to the previously described methods, although the torque magnitude sufficient to crimp the ferrule as intended may be somewhat higher than with an unmodified locknut <b>120</b> (no groove or ridge feature <b>221</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> shows a first cavity nut <b>120</b> that has been screwed onto a bolt <b>910</b> and tightened against two workpieces <b>914</b><i>a</i>, <b>914</b><i>b </i>to form a joint that is clamped to a specified torque per usual practice for nuts <b>20</b>, <b>120</b> holding such a joint. The ferrule <b>110</b> has been positioned on the bolt's threaded rod <b>910</b> with a first end <b>112</b><i>a </i>against the first nut (i.e., up against the cavity <b>122</b> in the inside face <b>126</b> of the first nut <b>120</b>). Also the second nut, here being a grooved locknut <b>220</b>, is threaded onto the threaded rod <b>910</b> and hand tightened against the ferrule <b>110</b> (i.e., the second ferrule end <b>112</b><i>b </i>is against the cavity wall <b>122</b><i>b </i>of the second nut <b>220</b>). The ferruled locknut set <b>100</b>&#x2032; is designed such that this hand tightening will result in the two nut faces <b>126</b><i>a </i>and <b>126</b><i>b </i>still being separated (not touching each other).</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> also shows that the grooved locknut set <b>100</b>&#x2032; is designed to position the groove <b>221</b> where the ferrule end <b>112</b> will be able to move around behind an edge of the groove/ridge feature <b>221</b> when it is crimped. Although the groove <b>221</b> will work to some degree no matter where it is positioned on the wall of the cavity <b>122</b>, the present thinking is that it will work best if located at or close to where the thinnest (or farthest out) portion of the ferrule end <b>112</b> becomes pinched between the OD of the threaded rod <b>910</b> and the cavity wall <b>122</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> shows the result of crimping, wherein the second nut (grooved locknut <b>220</b>) is tightened a specified amount on the ferrule <b>110</b>, and possibly also against the first nut <b>120</b>. In an embodiment, for example, the specified amount could be &#x201c;&#xbc; turn&#x201d; (one quarter turn, i.e., 90 degrees). In another embodiment, for example, the specified amount could be &#x201c;until the two nut faces <b>126</b> touch&#x201d;, and/or until a specified torque is achieved. As in previous embodiments, the ferrule <b>110</b> is swaged in a way that causes it to press tightly against the cavity walls <b>122</b><i>a</i>, <b>122</b><i>b </i>while also being crimped down into the threads <b>908</b> of the rod. The improvement here is that the ferrule material's displacement caused by the swaging effect will also cause it to be squeezed radially outward into the groove <b>221</b> to produce the circular ridge <b>210</b> around the ferrule <b>110</b>. The dimensions, shape and/or material of the ferrule <b>110</b> used with the grooved locknut <b>220</b> can be adjusted to optimize the locknut holding effect.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Prototype ferruled locknut sets <b>100</b>&#x2032; with one or two modified cavity locknuts <b>220</b> (grooved, ridged) have been tested on an Instron and in a rigorous standard &#x201c;Junker Fastener Vibration Test.&#x201d; So far, tests of limited sample size have yielded excellent results, possibly even better than the above-described ferruled locknut sets <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Suitable ferrule and cavity materials, shapes and relative dimensions are still being developed to optimize the design. For example, a straight (untapered) center length LC (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>) of the ferrule body <b>114</b> can be varied to vary the amount of material involved and the degree of swaging/crimping that occurs. For example, rather than a conical shape, the tapered profile of the nut cavity <b>122</b> can be curved like a wire drawing die (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>), or could be shaped like a swaging tool. Another example is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, wherein a taper angle A12 of the ferrule end(s) <b>112</b> could be different than a taper angle A22 of the nut cavity <b>122</b>. This may cause a greater amount of ferrule deformation, at least at the thinner outside ends <b>112</b>, which may be advantageous.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">A tapered ferrule end <b>112</b> (e.g., tapering to a thin end) has been shown in most of the example embodiments described hereinabove because it was first assumed to be best, often wherein the ferrule end taper angle A12 is close to matching the cavity wall taper angle A22 (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B</figref>, <b>6</b>B, and <b>11</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A</figref>, <b>8</b>, <b>9</b> and <b>17</b>A-B illustrate situations wherein a ferrule end slope A12 is changed to adapt to an object other than a locknut <b>120</b> having a tapered cavity <b>122</b>. The logic behind the ferrule shape designs includes determining where and how much the ferrule will be distorted by crimping, the quantity of ferrule material that will be available for &#x201c;moving around&#x201d; in a given part of the tapered cavity <b>122</b>, and also the magnitude of torque on the locknut <b>120</b>, <b>220</b> that will be required to achieve a &#x201c;sufficient&#x201d; amount (and location) of crimping. Given these considerations, the applicant has determined that a significant result of tapering the ferrule end(s) <b>112</b> is that the taper selectively &#x201c;weakens&#x201d; a portion of the ferrule <b>110</b> (the tapered end <b>112</b>), thereby providing a way to control the crimping results. All of this assumes, of course, that the shape of the cavity <b>122</b> in the nut <b>120</b> is the primary determinant of the nature of the crimping action. In general, at least a portion of the tapered cavity wall <b>122</b> is sloped from a larger diameter to a lesser diameter such that a portion of an axially directed force of the sloped cavity wall <b>122</b> against the ferrule end <b>112</b> will be redirected by the cavity slope to produce a radially inward directed crimping force on the cylindrical ferrule end <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates a variety of ferrule modifications beyond length and end slope variations. The drawing shows a modified ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2033; wherein slots <b>113</b> and grooves <b>115</b> are used in a variety of embodiments to vary the location and amount of ferrule weakening. (Obviously all of the illustrated weakening features are unlikely to be implemented all together as shown. The drawing is merely a composite used to show the different features.) The two terms are used rather conventionally, i.e., a &#x201c;slot&#x201d; <b>113</b> is a region of the ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2033; where material is removed by cutting radially all the way through the ferrule, thus making the slot <b>113</b> &#x201c;radially open&#x201d;. A &#x201c;groove&#x201d; <b>115</b> is a region of the ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2033; where material is removed by cutting only partially through the radial thickness of the ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2033;, thereby making the region thinner. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2033; has both axially distal ends <b>112</b> tapered. A ferrule length L comprises a straight center portion of length LC, and tapered front and back ends <b>112</b> of equal length LN.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">A first exemplary slot <b>113</b><i>a </i>extends axially from an end <b>112</b> (edge) to a slot length LS a with a uniform slot width WS. As illustrated, this first slot <b>113</b><i>a </i>is the same length LS as the end length LN, is mirrored on the distal ferrule end <b>112</b>, and is regularly spaced around the circumference of the ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2033;. This kind of slot will make the ferrule ends <b>112</b> easier to crimp. A second exemplary slot <b>113</b><i>b </i>extends the entire end to end length of the ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2033;, turning it into a &#x201c;C-shaped&#x201d; ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2033; that will likely be the easiest ferrule to crimp, depending upon the shape of the tapered cavity <b>122</b> with which it is mated. Two other examples of slots <b>113</b><i>c </i>and <b>113</b><i>d</i>, are shown as circumferentially extending slots placed along a tapered end <b>112</b> and along a center portion <b>114</b>, respectively. These will allow some axial collapsing (telescoping) depending upon their length.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The grooves <b>115</b> will have similar or not-so-similar effects, depending upon groove depth as well as placement and length. For example, a circumferential groove <b>115</b><i>a </i>may collapse on only one side of the ferrule thickness, thereby resulting in a bending moment. A second exemplary groove <b>115</b><i>b </i>is cut into the outside surface of the ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2033; and extends axially.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">By weakening a specific portion of the ferrule, as selected by a designer, the slots <b>113</b> and/or grooves <b>115</b> generally make the ferrule easier to crimp (less force applied). As discussed, one design objective is to make the ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2033; easier to radially crimp (swage) to a reduced diameter and circumference, due to less material and less stiffness. This may enable, for example, the use of harder material in a slotted ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2033; versus a comparable un-slotted ferrule <b>110</b>, <b>110</b>&#x2032; (e.g., steel versus brass). Or, for example, this may provide a &#x201c;light duty&#x201d; version of the ferruled locknut <b>100</b> concept. Alternatively, this may actually improve the holding power of ferruled locknuts by enabling, for example, more material to be compressed (swaged) into the threads of the bolt.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">It may be noted that the double prime on the ferrule reference number (i.e., <b>110</b>&#x2033;) is used to indicate a variation in a feature of the modified ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2033;, versus the unmodified ferrules <b>110</b>, <b>110</b>&#x2032; previously disclosed, however these ferrule differences are expected to be within the scope of a generalized &#x201c;ferrule&#x201d; as used in the ferruled locknut sets <b>100</b> according to the invention(s) claimed.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Any or all, if not more advantages than those mentioned herein may accrue from using a slotted/grooved ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2033;, in a ferruled locknut fastener <b>100</b>, such benefits being determined by further testing and development of variations of the herein disclosed ferrules <b>110</b>, <b>110</b>&#x2032;, <b>110</b>&#x2033;, all such variations being considered optimization and/or usage adaptations within the scope of what has been disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref> (an enlarged portion of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> view) show an example implementation for some of the component variations discussed hereinabove. In this example, the threaded rod <b>910</b> is a fixed stud extending out of a bulkhead or other kind of massive object <b>912</b> which serves as the immobilizing component instead of the bolt head <b>912</b> shown elsewhere in the drawings. A single workpiece <b>914</b> is clamped by a regular nut <b>20</b> which serves as the first nut <b>20</b><i>a </i>in this ferruled locknut <b>100</b> embodiment. The second nut is a cavity locknut <b>120</b><i>b </i>that has a tapered cavity <b>122</b> wherein the sloped portion of the cavity wall <b>122</b> is only at the deepest part of the cavity and the lead-in to that is substantially straight (i.e., cylindrical). The ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2033;, best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref> (where the threaded rod <b>910</b> is made invisible for better viewing), is correspondingly straight/cylindrical along most of its length except for a very steep taper angle A12 at the first ferrule end <b>112</b><i>a</i>. Positioned immediately behind the tapered end <b>112</b><i>a </i>is a circumferential groove <b>115</b> that is cut outward through the ferrule bore wall <b>111</b> and most of the way through the thickness of the ferrule body <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> shows the ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2033; positioned between the first and second nuts <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>120</b><i>b</i>, respectively. The first nut's inside face <b>26</b> is substantially flat, and the first ferrule end <b>112</b><i>a </i>which faces it has the steep taper angle A12 and the groove <b>115</b> behind it. The thought behind this design variation is that when the smallest diameter but frontmost edge <b>112</b><i>a </i>is forced against the flat nut face <b>26</b>, it will tend to crimp down into the threads <b>908</b> as the groove <b>115</b> collapses at the inside diameter but functions more like a hinge at the outside diameter beyond the groove <b>115</b>. Thus the crimping action of a tapered cavity is achieved against a flat wall. If necessary, the crimping might be helped by adding some axially oriented edge slots like slots <b>113</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref> shows the ferrule <b>110</b>&#x2033; after the second nut <b>120</b><i>b </i>has been advanced so that the cavity wall <b>122</b> touches the first ferrule end <b>112</b><i>b </i>which is not at all tapered. The straight portion of the wall <b>122</b> confines the straight, close-fitting body <b>114</b> so that it cannot bulge outward significantly. Because of the significant concentration of ferrule material at the full-thickness first ferrule end <b>112</b><i>b</i>, a significant amount of ferrule material will be crimped against and likely deeply embedded in the threads <b>908</b> of the rod, thereby establishing intimate contact with a high force level to provide a significant amount of frictional resistance to relative movement in any direction.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is provided as a summary of the many types of ferrule variations discussed and/or suggested by the teaching of the present disclosure. The illustration is not intended to be complete and should not be considered limiting of scope in the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">At the top of FIG. <b>18</b>'s column of side views, an outside view of a ferrule <b>110</b> is used to indicate reference numbers and dimensional labels all together (although the taper angle A12 has been omitted due to crowding). All have been discussed previously in the present disclosure. Below the ferrule <b>110</b> the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates partial cross-sectional views of four ferrule embodiments that exemplify some of the wide range of ferrule variations that are asserted to be within the scope of the ferrule <b>110</b> (also <b>110</b>&#x2032;, <b>110</b>&#x2033; and the like) component of the invention(s) being claimed. Not all reference characters are shown in each of the following illustrations due to crowding, however references to diameters, for instance, should be easily inferred from the drawing at the top of the Figure.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The ferrule example <b>110</b><i>a </i>has tapered first and second ends <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b </i>(<b>112</b> collectively), but the body <b>114</b> in the center is essentially a point (circle around the ferrule circumference) that will have the largest outside diameter D3 of the ferrule <b>110</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The ferrule example <b>110</b><i>b </i>has un-tapered first and second ends <b>112</b>, so the body <b>114</b> is the same as the ends <b>112</b>. all of which have the same outside diameter D3 and inside/bore diameter D1.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The ferrule example <b>110</b><i>c </i>is about half the length L of the others, and has only the second end <b>112</b><i>b </i>tapered, so the body <b>114</b> portion that has the largest outside diameter D3 of the ferrule <b>110</b><i>a </i>is the same as, and is located at, the first end <b>112</b><i>a</i>. Both the first and second ends <b>112</b> of this ferrule <b>110</b><i>c </i>serve a purpose as suggested by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, so even if loosely termed a &#x201c;single-ended&#x201d; ferrule, it should be understood as a ferrule like the other ferrules <b>110</b>, but having two very different looking ferrule ends <b>112</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The bottom illustration shows a complete cross-sectional side view of an entire half of the ferrule example <b>110</b><i>d</i>, so that its unusual profile will not be misinterpreted. The first end <b>112</b><i>a </i>is un-tapered and thus the same thickness as the body <b>114</b>. The second end <b>112</b><i>b </i>has a reverse or inverted taper angle such that the entire length L of the ferrule <b>110</b><i>d </i>has the same magnitude outside diameter D3 which is also the &#x201c;maximum diameter&#x201d; and the &#x201c;body diameter&#x201d;. However, the body thickness varies as the inside diameter D1 becomes larger until it equals the outside diameter at the outermost edge of the second tapered end <b>112</b><i>b</i>. This will produce a crimp that starts with a curled-inward shape when forced into a uniformly tapered cavity <b>122</b> as in most of the cavity locknuts <b>120</b> illustrated herein. However, if used with a modified cavity locknut <b>220</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A-13B</figref>) the thin outside diameter leading edge <b>112</b> may yield some very useful results (with either the groove <b>221</b><i>a </i>or ridge <b>221</b><i>b </i>feature <b>221</b> of the cavity wall <b>122</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Although the invention has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and foregoing description, the same is to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive in character&#x2014;it being understood that only preferred embodiments have been shown and described, and that all changes and modifications that come within the spirit of the invention as claimed are desired to be protected. Undoubtedly, many other &#x201c;variations&#x201d; on the &#x201c;themes&#x201d; set forth hereinabove will occur to one having ordinary skill in the art to which the present invention most nearly pertains, and such variations are intended to be within the scope of the invention, as disclosed herein.</p>
