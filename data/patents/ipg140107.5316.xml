<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A system and method using a vehicle drive shaft torque coupled to a driven wheel and a non-driven wheel speed for a vehicle throttle control system includes reading first and second torque values generated by the torque sensor. The method identifies when a sustained drop occurs between the first and second torque values. Another step determines if a change occurred between the first and second torque value readings in any of: a throttle position; a gear setting; and a brake pressure. A detected traction loss is signaled when the sustained drop occurred with no change between the first and second torque value readings in the throttle position, gear setting, and brake pressure. A desired throttle value is calculated using an engine torque and a target engine speed to prevent driven wheel slip. A throttle command signal changes an existing throttle value to the desired throttle value.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/375,296 filed on Jan. 27, 2009, which is a National Phase of International Application No. PCT/US2007/017788, filed Aug. 10, 2007, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/839,053, filed Aug. 21, 2006. The entire disclosures of each of the above applications are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a method and system for controlling an engine throttle using feedback signals from a torque sensor.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The statements in this section merely provide background information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Loss of traction between a road surface and a tire can occur during acceleration or deceleration. In both cases the available traction force between the tire and the road surface falls below a threshold capacity which is required to maintain the vehicle on a desired course and speed. Loss of traction force can also occur when a vehicle traveling at constant throttle encounters a sudden drop in friction coefficient of the road surface, which can cause wheel slip unless the engine controller proactively cuts the throttle. A delay of as little as a tenth of a second in determining the onset of traction loss without correction in a throttle setting can result in loss of vehicle control. Algorithms are therefore commonly used to calculate corrections for vehicle control. Due to the availability of speed sensors, most algorithms for throttle control rely mainly on speed information to determine wheel slip to take a follow-up action. Because of the highly non-linear relationship between the throttle input and the resultant wheel speed, convoluted algorithms are used to determine the throttle action for any given slip condition.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Attempts have been made to model systems and estimate several quantities such as torque and desired throttle position to reduce the complexity of the algorithms used, however algorithms generally cannot calculate exact torque values for all conditions. Known models therefore estimate torque and apply ground/wheel friction coefficients that are saved in tables of data. Because the tables of data are themselves empirical or estimations the data may not be responsive to rapidly changing conditions or determination of potential loss of traction at very early stages.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to several embodiments of a traction control system using torque sensor for adaptive engine throttle control of the present disclosure, a ground vehicle torque sensor based throttle control system includes a drive train including a power unit connected to a transmission. A plurality of wheels are included, at least a first one of the wheels defining a driven wheel in response to a drive torque transmitted through the transmission, and at least a second one of the wheels defining a non-driven wheel. At least one torque sensor is connected to the drive train operable to produce a traction torque signal. A speed sensor signals a wheel speed of the non-driven wheel. A throttle control signal is interpolated from a comparison of the traction torque signal to the non-driven wheel speed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to further embodiments, a method for operating a ground vehicle using a torque sensor based throttle control system is provided. The vehicle has a power unit connected to a transmission, a plurality of wheels, at least a first one of the wheels defining a driven wheel in response to a drive torque produced by the power unit, and at least a second one of the wheels defining a non-driven wheel, at least one torque sensor, and a speed sensor. The method includes producing a traction torque signal by the torque sensor in response to the drive torque. The method further includes generating a wheel speed signal by the speed sensor representing a rotational speed of the non-driven wheel. A throttle control signal is created by a comparison of the traction torque signal to the rotational speed of the non-driven wheel. The throttle control signal is used to adjust a throttle position when the traction torque signal indicates a driven wheel slip condition.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to still further embodiments, a method is provided for using a rotational torque of a vehicle drive shaft coupled to a driven wheel together with a wheel speed of a non-driven wheel for a vehicle throttle control system. The method includes reading first and second torque values generated by the torque sensor. The method further includes identifying if a sustained drop has occurred between the first to the second torque values. The method still further includes determining if a change occurred between the first and second torque value readings in any of: a throttle position; a gear setting; and a brake pressure. A detected traction loss is signaled when the sustained drop occurred with no change between the first and second torque value readings in any of the throttle position, the gear setting, and the brake pressure. A desired throttle value is then calculated using an engine torque and a target engine speed operable to prevent wheel slip of the driven wheel. The method also includes sending a throttle command signal operable to change an existing throttle value to the desired throttle value.</p>

One embodiment is described in reference to a combustion engine and transmission, however, any type of power source producing a drive torque can be used including but not limited to an electric motor or a fuel cell without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. It is also anticipated that the function or use of a transmission can be replaced by speed changing devices used in conjunction with an electric motor (such as a voltage step device acting to change motor speed or an alternate winding) or the transmission can be combined with the power unit providing a direct drive capability. A transmission as defined herein is therefore any device used to effect speed changes for the vehicle whether separate from or combined with the power unit. The term &#x201c;engine&#x201d; as used herein therefore broadly encompasses the above type of power units and &#x201c;gear&#x201d; includes the above speed changers. According to several embodiments, first and second rear wheels <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> are driven by transmission <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to several additional embodiments a transfer case <b>26</b> can be provided between transmission <b>24</b> and first and second rear wheels <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>.

Drive torque from power unit <b>22</b> is transferred through transfer case <b>26</b> (when used) or directly from transmission <b>24</b> via a prop shaft <b>28</b> to a rear differential <b>30</b>. From rear differential <b>30</b>, rotational drive is provided to one or both of first and second rear wheels <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> via a first rear half shaft <b>32</b> and a second rear half shaft <b>34</b> respectively.</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in several embodiments, and without limiting the disclosure to specific torque sensors or wheels, the power unit <b>22</b> is connected to the transmission <b>24</b>. Of the plurality of wheels <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, at least a first one of the wheels defines a driven wheel (for example first rear wheel <b>18</b>) in response to a drive torque produced by the power unit <b>22</b>. At least a second one of the wheels <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> defines a non-driven wheel (for example first steerable wheel <b>14</b>). At least one of the torque sensors <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>49</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> produces a traction torque signal <b>57</b> in response to the drive torque. A speed sensor <b>59</b> signals a non-driven wheel speed &#x3c9;<sub>nd </sub>of the non-driven wheel (<b>14</b>) to CPU <b>55</b>. A throttle control signal <b>61</b> is generated by the CPU <b>55</b> using the traction torque signal <b>57</b> and the non-driven wheel speed &#x3c9;<sub>nd</sub>. The throttle control signal <b>61</b> is sent to a throttle control unit <b>63</b> which can adjust a throttle control position, ignition timing, fuel mixture, and the like of the power unit <b>22</b>, which in turn changes the drive torque of the power unit <b>22</b> to mitigate wheel slip of the driven wheel (<b>18</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a plurality of operations performed by traction control system <b>10</b> determine if a traction loss is detected for vehicle <b>12</b>. In a sensor reading operation <b>134</b>, the exemplary one of the plurality of torque sensors of the present disclosure is read and a torque sensor value obtained. The torque sensor value can be a voltage which is picked up as traction torque signal <b>57</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and can be further conditioned for use in CPU <b>55</b> or in a similar controller. The controller can be a stand alone unit or the algorithm can be integrated into another vehicle controller (not shown) which performs for example the transfer case control or transmission control, or the like. The torque sensor output can also be output as a current or a resistance change within the scope of the present disclosure. The controller or CPU <b>55</b> receives the torque signal or conditioned information and executes a calibration process to determine an actual torque value. Interchange of signal information can be conducted using a standard protocol such as Control Area Network (CAN).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Using the torque sensor value obtained in sensor reading operation <b>134</b>, in a subsequent torque drop determining operation <b>136</b> a determination is made if a sudden and &#x201c;sustained&#x201d; drop in the torque reading has occurred. &#x201c;Sustained&#x201d; is herein defined as a drop occurring over approximately 3 to 5 ms. This time period is used to avoid sudden changes in the torque signal due to signal noise. The duration of signal noise is commonly approximately a single clock pulse. It is anticipated there will be events of greater than 5 ms duration required to restore traction torque such as but not limited to a vehicle encountering a pot hole. The control system and algorithm of the present disclosure continues to monitor the torque sensor output and reverses action taken for intermittent torque drop within a period of the throttle actuation and power train bandwidth. This approach allows a better use of critical time that is needed for avoidance rather than introducing artificial delay into a control loop of the system. Once the event is mitigated as specified herein adjustment of the throttle setting can be accomplished using known techniques. A rate of drop of the torque signal can also be used to provide a quicker or slower throttle response. For example, the sustained period can be varied as a function of a rate of the drop, which can range between 10% to 100% in a way that is inversely proportional to the rate of the drop. If no sudden and sustained drop in torque reading is determined the program returns to sensor reading operation <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">If a sudden and sustained drop in torque reading is measured a throttle change determining operation <b>138</b> is performed. Throttle change determining operation <b>138</b> determinates if a change in throttle position has caused the sudden and sustained drop in the torque reading. If the torque reading change is attributable to a change in throttle, the program returns to the sensor reading operation <b>134</b>. A separate throttle controller such as throttle control unit <b>63</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) can either receive direct torque information or the torque value can be broadcast from another controller such as CPU <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">If the sudden and sustained drop in torque reading is not attributable to a change in throttle, the program continues to a gear setting determining operation <b>140</b>. Gear setting determining operation <b>140</b> determines if a change in a gear setting has caused the sudden and sustained drop in torque reading from torque drop determining operation <b>136</b>. If a change in gear setting has caused the torque reading change, the program returns to sensor reading operation <b>134</b>. Gear setting or gear change information is commonly available such as through the CAN or similar network. A separate transmission controller (not shown) can also be used which can provide the gear setting signal.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">If a change in gear setting is not the cause for the sudden and sustained drop in torque reading, the program continues on to a brake pressure determining operation <b>142</b>. This operation determines if there has been a change in brake pressure that caused the sudden and sustained drop in torque reading. If a change in brake pressure has caused the torque sensor reading to drop, the program returns to sensor reading operation <b>134</b>. If a change in brake pressure is not the cause of the sudden sustained drop in torque reading, the program identifies that a traction loss event has occurred and produces a traction loss indication signal <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, once a traction loss event has been identified by traction loss indication signal <b>144</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the algorithm via CPU <b>55</b> (or similar controller) performs a plurality of parallel acquisition steps. In a torque sensor value acquisition step <b>146</b> a torque sensor value T&#xb7; is acquired. In a speed value acquisition step <b>148</b> a speed value &#x3c9;<sub>ts </sub>of the drive train component proximate the torque sensor location is calculated as described below. For example, a single torque sensor between the engine and the driven wheel is sufficient to implement the algorithm. When engine speed and the location of the sensor are known, the speed at the torque sensor location can be calculated, because the power train ratios are generally constant at given gear ratios.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In an engine speed value acquisition step <b>150</b> an engine speed value &#x3c9;<sub>R </sub>commonly represented by engine rpm is measured and therefore available. In a gear setting and ratio calculation step <b>152</b> the current gear setting is acquired and a ratio R<sub>2 </sub>is already known due to the mechanical design of the drive train elements. A non-driven wheel speed value acquisition step <b>154</b> is then performed wherein a speed value at the non-driven wheel &#x3c9;<sub>Nd </sub>is acquired. To calculate the speed value &#x3c9;<sub>ts </sub>at the torque sensor location in acquisition step <b>148</b>, a ratio R<sub>1 </sub>is first determined in a step <b>156</b> where:</p>

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The engine torque T<sub>e </sub>result obtained by engine torque calculation step <b>158</b>, and the target engine speed &#x3c9;<sub>es </sub>obtained in target engine speed calculation step <b>162</b> are interpolated using table data of constant throttle curves in the exemplary table of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> in a throttle value determination step <b>164</b>. In step <b>164</b> the engine characteristics are used to calculate the corresponding target throttle value <b>174</b>. The target throttle value <b>174</b> obtained by throttle value determination step <b>164</b> is used to provide a set throttle command <b>166</b> to set or reset the vehicle throttle position. In several embodiments each of the steps performed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> to set or reset the throttle command can be performed in approximately 100 milliseconds or less which is sufficient to prevent loss of vehicle control.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring now more specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a rapid response from traction control system <b>10</b> is provided for an exemplary set of data. It will be evident that each vehicle or vehicle model having differing power unit output torques and different drive train configurations will have a predetermined graph similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> identifies a start point <b>168</b> which signifies initial acceleration of vehicle <b>12</b> at constant throttle. Vehicle <b>12</b> subsequently accelerates and shifts through a plurality of gears until vehicle power unit <b>22</b> reaches approximately 4,200 rpm. Torque oscillations of the power train during the plurality of shifts are ignored for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. A plurality of constant throttle curves <b>170</b> are provided each signifying approximately a 10 percent change from 10 percent throttle up to approximately 100 percent throttle. At a point <b>172</b> a start of a low friction event occurs. The low friction event can correspond to the vehicle encountering a travel surface having a significantly lower coefficient of friction than at start point <b>168</b>. Upon encountering the low coefficient of friction surface the torque sensor reading immediately begins to dip downward.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">It is at this time that a correction in throttle setting is required to mitigate wheel spin (traction loss) and potential loss of vehicle control to maintain stability of vehicle <b>12</b>. The corrective action includes identification of a critical throttle value that corresponds to a traction torque of the non-driven wheel speed &#x3c9;<sub>Nd </sub>of vehicle <b>12</b>, provided for example in an engine map stored in CPU <b>55</b>. The critical throttle value is the result obtained by throttle value determination step <b>164</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The critical throttle value is used to set or reset the throttle command as rapidly as possible to maintain traction and vehicle control. Because the ratios of the power train are known, a target engine speed &#x3c9;<sub>es </sub>that corresponds to the non-driven wheel speed &#x3c9;<sub>Nd </sub>can be calculated. In another embodiment, an actual speed ratio &#x3c9;<sub>ts </sub>determined by comparing the drive train speed at the torque sensor to the engine speed &#x3c9;<sub>R </sub>of the power unit <b>22</b> can also be used to modify the measured torque sensor value T&#xb7;. For this embodiment the two points, i.e., the critical throttle value and the actual speed ratio &#x3c9;<sub>ts </sub>together define what the throttle setting should be to maintain traction for vehicle <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, after the start of the low friction event at point <b>172</b>, the target throttle value <b>174</b> is determined where the combination of the torque sensor information from the torque sensor output identified as value <b>176</b> intercepts one of the constant throttle curves <b>170</b> at a point corresponding to the non-driven wheel speed &#x3c9;<sub>nd</sub>, in this example shown at position <b>178</b>. The target throttle value <b>174</b> is then used by the algorithm to reset the throttle command to reduce engine speed at a new constant throttle curve (in the example shown at 18%) corresponding to a vehicle traction condition at the lower coefficient friction surface conditions identified at the start of the low friction event at point <b>172</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">An algorithm is created to control operation of traction control system <b>10</b>. A torque sensor reading is used to calculate an engine torque. The calculated engine torque and the calculated target engine speed are used to determine a throttle control action further using an engine torque-speed curve. A single torque sensor can be used in several applications of the present disclosure. In an exemplary front wheel drive vehicle, providing a single torque sensor positioned between the engine and the front wheels is sufficient to provide the torque sensor reading. In a rear wheel drive vehicle, providing a single torque sensor positioned between the engine and the rear wheels is sufficient to provide the torque sensor reading. In a four wheel drive vehicle, the torque sensor should be positioned with respect to the set of normally driven wheels. For example only, in a pickup truck having a transfer case with the rear wheels being the normally driven wheels and having a torque biasing clutch to distribute torque to the front wheels on demand, a sensor can be positioned on the power-train between the engine and the rear wheels.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A torque sensor has a fundamental advantage compared to a speed sensor. The torque sensor measures a change in acceleration while the speed sensor measures a change in speed. The change in speed is the cumulative result of the change in acceleration. While the change in acceleration can occur within a very short time span, a change in speed occurs relatively more gradually. A control action is normally taken after the change exceeds a certain, normally predetermined threshold, therefore a control action which relies on a speed sensor measurement necessarily requires a delayed period to reach the threshold. A torque sensor however, provides a substantially immediate signal which provides a substantially immediate indication the threshold has been exceeded. The torque sensor system of the present disclosure therefore can both sense a slip condition faster and prepare the appropriate control action response faster following a traction loss condition than a speed sensor system.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The normal reaction of a driver who senses a loss of wheel traction is first to reduce the throttle. However, the response of a driver is commonly slower than the 3-5 ms sustained time period of the present system, which can lead to loss of vehicle control. The traction control system <b>10</b> of the present disclosure is therefore faster than either a system using speed sensors or the normal response time of a vehicle operator. The present disclosure can also provide for a partial reduction in the throttle setting which in some instances is a better response than the normal operator response to completely cut back on the throttle setting.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The traction control system <b>10</b> of the present disclosure provides several advantages. First, the system provides a rapid recognition that a low coefficient friction event is occurring. This recognition is made possible through the use of torque sensors which have a more rapid response time than velocity sensors typically used for this determination in other control systems. Second, a rapid response is provided by the traction control system <b>10</b> of the present disclosure. The traction control system of the present disclosure uses the torque sensor value to define the follow-up action required to maintain vehicle control and stability. Using the torque sensor value minimizes the task of previous adaptive algorithms and achieves an optimum or corrective throttle control value faster than known systems.</p>
