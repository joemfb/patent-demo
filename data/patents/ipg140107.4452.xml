<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">With increasingly high demand for mobile broadband services, network operators are rushing to deploy large-scale networks. Such networks include Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks as well as other types of networks. The services that can be supported on the networks include both data (including video) and voice.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In some wireless data networks (e.g., CDMA2000 EV-D (Code Division Multiple Access 2000 Evolution-Data), UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication System) networks), the maximum bit rates available are governed by both settings in the network (both core and radio) and by a category and/or a capability of the mobile device. In some cases, the mobile device can support higher maximum bit rates than the network can support and, in this case, the network sets the upper limit for the maximum bit rate. When the mobile device transitions from a first network (e.g., a current network or source network) to a second network (e.g., target network), the second network might be able to support a higher maximum bit rate than the first network was able to support. However, since the maximum bit rate has already been set, changes cannot be made when the device transitions to the second network. This is the case even if the device can support a higher maximum bit rate that is also supported by the second network. Thus, even though available, the device cannot take advantage of the higher maximum bit rates, which has a direct impact on the user experience.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The above-described deficiencies of today's systems are merely intended to provide an overview of some of the problems of conventional systems, and are not intended to be exhaustive. Other problems with conventional systems and corresponding benefits of the various non-limiting embodiments described herein may become further apparent upon review of the following description.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A simplified summary is provided herein to help enable a basic or general understanding of various aspects of exemplary, non-limiting embodiments that follow in the more detailed description and the accompanying drawings. This summary is not intended, however, as an extensive or exhaustive overview. Instead, the sole purpose of this summary is to present some concepts related to some exemplary non-limiting embodiments in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description of the various embodiments that follow.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Various embodiments are configured to enable a capable device to utilize the benefits of higher data rates provided by a target network. When a device moves from a source network to a target network, the target network can dynamically initiate a quality of service modification procedure. The quality of service modification procedure can help resolve maximum bit rate and/or other quality of service parameter mismatching issues when the device moves between networks.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, the target network can proactively initiate an upward quality of service negotiation in order to support the device with higher data rates, which are supported by the target network. Such benefits can be obtained as part of the inter-radio access technology mobility procedure, which allows the benefits to be realized at substantially the same time as the device is handed off from the source network and/or when the device is registered with the target network.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Overview</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In various wireless data networks (e.g., CDMA2000 EV-D), UMTS networks), the maximum bit rates (MBR) available are governed by both settings in the network (both core and radio) and by the category and/or capability of a device. For example, typical MBR that can be achieved by a device in the uplink direction (e.g., from device to network) and in the downlink direction (e.g., from network to device) under ideal radio conditions is normally limited to around 5 Mbps (Mega-bits per second) and about 21 Mbps, respectively. In a 3GPP network, for example, once a mobile device (or User Equipment (UE)) Data Session Context is established, the MBR rates are recorded in a final negotiated bearer Quality of Service (QoS) profile stored in a SGSN/PDSN (Serving General Packet Radio Service (GRPS) Support Node/Packet Data Serving Node). The final negotiated bearer QoS profile is used in subsequent data transmissions. During the inter-RAT (Radio Access Technology) mobility procedure, these QoS parameter sets in the source network bearer QoS profile are carried over to the target network (e.g., a 4G network) in order to maintain session continuity. However, the target network may support data rates that are higher (or even much higher) than the data rates available in the source network. Based on current standards (e.g., 4G standards), the Mobility Control Nodes (e.g., SGSN, 4G-SGSN, MME (Mobility Management Entity)) are not able to modify (e.g., upgrade) the QoS of a capable device and, therefore, the device (and device user) is not able to have the higher target network data rates after the inter-RAT mobility procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Thus, it would be beneficial to enable a capable device to utilize benefits of higher data rates provided by a target network. Such benefits can be obtained as part of the inter-RAT mobility procedure, which allows the benefits to be realized at substantially the same time as the device is handed off to the target network.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">An aspect relates to an apparatus that includes a receiver component configured to obtain information related to a first set of QoS parameters supported by a source network. The apparatus also includes an evaluation component configured to perform a comparison of the first set of QoS parameters and a second set of QoS parameters supported by a target network and with a capability of a device that moved to the target network from the source network. Further, the apparatus includes a context modification component configured to negotiate a third set of QoS parameters as a function of the comparison.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an implementation, the receiver component is further configured to receive an identity of the device, a current location of the device, and a last location of the device. The context modification component is configured to negotiate the third set of QoS parameters based on the comparison.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In another implementation, the apparatus includes a transmitter component configured to convey the third set of QoS parameters to the device. The receiver component is further configured to receive an acknowledgement of the third set of QoS parameters from the device.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some implementations, the apparatus includes a transmitter component configured to convey to the device a maximum bit rate and an allocation retention priority.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In various implementations, the first set of QoS parameters includes a first maximum bit rate and the second set of QoS parameters includes a second maximum bit rate.

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">By way of further description with respect to one or more non-limiting ways to provide improved throughput during inter-RAT (Radio Access Technology) mobility procedures, a high-level block diagram of an exemplary communication system <b>100</b> is illustrated generally by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A device <b>102</b> can be registered in a source network <b>104</b> that is configured to provide a first bit rate level <b>106</b>. The device <b>102</b> can include a category or a set of capabilities <b>108</b> that include, among other information, data rates that can be supported by the device <b>102</b>. The data rates that can be supported by the device <b>102</b> might be higher than the first bit rate level <b>106</b> supported by the source network <b>104</b>. Thus, when the device <b>102</b> is registered in the source network <b>104</b>, the device <b>102</b> is limited to the first bit rate level <b>106</b> supported by the source network <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">When the device <b>102</b> is moved into a coverage area supported by a different network, such as target network <b>110</b>, a registration procedure <b>112</b> is performed between the source network <b>104</b> and the target network <b>110</b>. As part of the registration procedure <b>112</b>, the first bit rate level <b>106</b> is recorded (e.g., in a data store) and used by the target network <b>110</b> for subsequent data transmissions with the device <b>102</b>. However, the target network <b>110</b> might be able to support a second bit rate level <b>114</b>, which can have rates that are higher than the rates supported by the first bit rate level <b>106</b>. Even though the target network <b>110</b> (and device <b>102</b>) can support higher data rates, in conventional systems, such rates cannot be utilized for subsequent data transmissions and the first bit rate level <b>106</b> is instead used.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In accordance with the various aspects disclosed herein, the target network <b>110</b> is configured to support higher data rates (e.g., second bit rate level <b>114</b>) than the data rates (e.g., first bit rate level <b>106</b>) supported by source network <b>104</b>. Thus, according to an aspect, a sub-procedure <b>116</b> is performed between the source network <b>104</b> and the target network <b>110</b>. The sub-procedure <b>116</b> allows for negotiation of the bits rates. Thus, if both the target network <b>110</b> and the device <b>102</b> can support higher data rates than the rates supported by source network <b>104</b>, the higher data rates are utilized for subsequent data transmissions. In such a manner, the device <b>102</b> (and device user) can benefit from the higher data rates, which can increase system speed and enhance a user experience.</p>

Various aspects will be described herein with respect to a 2G/3G network and a 4G network. However, it should be understood that the disclosed aspects are not limited to this implementation. Instead, any particular implementation discussed herein is for purposes of describing the one or more aspects.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A User Equipment UE <b>202</b> (e.g., device) powers on under a 2G/3G coverage area (e.g., UMTS, CDMA2000 EV-DO) and starts a Registration Procedure. The Registration Procedure can be started when the UE <b>202</b> sends a Registration Request <b>204</b> to a 2G/3G Radio Access Network RAN <b>206</b>, which relays the Registration Request <b>204</b> to a 2G/3G packet core control node <b>208</b>. The UE <b>202</b> can convey its identity and its current location (e.g., source network) identification to the 2G/3G packet core control node <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The 2G/3G packet core control node <b>208</b> processes the Registration Request <b>204</b> and validates the information received from the UE <b>202</b>. Then, the 2G/3G Packet Core Control Node <b>208</b> (e.g., SGSN, PDSN) sends a Location Update Request <b>212</b> to a Home Location Register HLR <b>214</b>. The Location Update Request <b>212</b> includes the UE identity and the RAT technology where the UE <b>202</b> is currently located. In accordance with some aspects, the HLR <b>214</b> and a Home Subscriber Server HSS <b>216</b> can be combined.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The HLR <b>214</b> verifies the information in the Location Update Request <b>212</b>. The HLR <b>214</b> looks up the subscriber database based on the UE identity provided in the Location Update Request <b>212</b> and sends the subscription data <b>218</b> to the current serving Packet Core Control Node (e.g., 2G/3G Packet Core control node <b>208</b>). The subscription data <b>218</b> includes the services the UE <b>202</b> subscribes to and the subscribed QoS for each service. The subscribed QoS is based on the RAT information received from the Location Update Request <b>212</b>. In the 2G/3G network, the MBR of a data session might be limited to less than about 5 Mbps for the Uplink and less than around 21 Mbps for the downlink.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The 2G/3G Packet Core Control Node <b>208</b> sends an acknowledgement ACK <b>220</b> to acknowledge the successful receipt of the UE subscription information. The HLR <b>214</b> acknowledges ACK <b>222</b> the Location Update. The 2G/3G Packet Core Control Node <b>208</b> accepts the Location Registration from the UE <b>202</b> by sending the Registration ACK <b>224</b> to the 2G/3G RAN <b>206</b>, which relays the Registration ACK <b>224</b> to the UE <b>202</b>. The initial mobility management procedure ends here.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The UE <b>202</b> can start initiating a data session for any particular service by sending an Active Data Session Request <b>226</b> to the 2G/3G Packet Core Control Node <b>208</b>. The Active Data Session Request <b>226</b> can include the Packet Data Network Service Name. The 2G/3G RAN <b>206</b> relays the Active Data Session Request <b>226</b> from the UE <b>202</b> the 2G/3G Packet Core Control Node <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The 2G/3G Packet Core Control Node <b>208</b> verifies whether the PDN (Packet Data Network) Service is authorized. If the PDN Service is authorized by the subscription profile, the 2G/3G Packet Core Control Node <b>208</b> sets up the data session for the UE <b>202</b> with the QoS provided in the subscription. The uplink MBR can be less than about 5 Mbps for the Uplink and less than around 21 Mbps for the downlink. The Packet Core Control Node <b>208</b> sends the Acknowledgement <b>228</b> of the Active Data Session to the UE <b>202</b>. The 2G/3G RAN <b>206</b> relays the Data Session Activation Acknowledgement <b>228</b> to the UE <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">At this point, the uplink and the downlink data paths are established and the UE <b>202</b> can send and/or receive data to/from the packet data network.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">At <b>230</b>, the UE <b>202</b> moves into a 4G RAN coverage area and initiates a new location registration procedure to register with the 4G network. The UE <b>202</b> sends a Location Registration Request <b>232</b> to the 4G Packet Core Control Node <b>210</b>. The Location Registration Request <b>232</b> includes the UE identity, the current location of the UE <b>202</b> (e.g., target network), and the last location of the UE <b>202</b> (e.g., source network). The 4G RAN <b>234</b> relays the Location Registration Request <b>232</b> to the 4G Packet Core Control Node <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The 4G Packet Core Control Node <b>210</b> (e.g., 4G-SGSN, MME) verifies the information in the Location Registration Request <b>232</b>. Then, based on the old location information proved by the UE <b>202</b>, the new 4G Packet Core Control Node <b>210</b> will derive the (old) 2G/3G Packet Core Control Node <b>208</b> and send a UE Context Request to the (old) 2G/3G Packet Core Control Node <b>208</b>. The (old) 2G/3G Packet Core Control Node <b>208</b> verifies the old (e.g., source) location information and the old (e.g., source) identity information in the UE <b>202</b> Context Request <b>238</b> Message. Then, the (old) 2G/3G Packet Core Control Node <b>208</b> will forward the UE Mobility Context and Data Session Context to the (new) 4G Packet Core Control Node <b>210</b> for session continuity. The original QoS assignments are included in the Data Session Context transferred. In other words, now, the 4G Packet Core Control Node <b>210</b> has the UE Data Session Context with the uplink limited to less than about 5 Mbps and the downlink limited to less than around 21 Mbps.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The 4G Packet Core Control Node <b>210</b> sends an Update Location Request <b>240</b> to the HSS <b>216</b>. The Update Location request <b>240</b> includes the UE identity and the current RAT where the UE <b>202</b> resides (e.g., target network).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The HSS <b>216</b> verifies the UE <b>202</b> and sends an Update Location Response <b>242</b> with the 4G subscription data to the 4G Packet Core Control Node <b>210</b>. Note that in the 4G network, the subscription data can be sent within the &#x201c;Update Location Response&#x201d; message. Also, note that the HSS/HLR may be the same platform.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The 4G Packet Core Control Node <b>210</b> saves the subscription data and only verifies the UE identity information and Mobility Management restrictions in the subscription records in this case. Then, the 4G Packet Core Control Node <b>210</b> uses the original Session Context (including QoS setting) received from the (old) 2G/3G Packet Core Control Node <b>208</b> for data session continuity. Even though the 4G subscription data indicates that higher MBR rates are possible, the 4G packet core will not initiate an upwards QoS negotiation due to the procedure carried over from the standards (e.g., legacy 3GPP standards). The 4G Packet Core Control Node <b>210</b> sends a Location Registration Accept <b>244</b> to the UE <b>202</b>. The 4G RAN <b>234</b> relays the Location Registration Accept <b>244</b> to the UE <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The UE <b>202</b> is now registered with the 4G network. However, its MBR rates are still limited by the original 2G/3G data rates.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The disclosed aspects can provide improved throughput when a device moves from a source network to a target network. Even though the source network supports a lower data rate than the target network, the target network can be configured to renegotiate the data rates. Through the renegotiation, the device can be supported by the target network at a higher data rate, which can be the data rate supported by the target network or the data rate capabilities of the device (if lower than the data rate supported by the target network).</p>

The target network <b>306</b> is configured to support a first data rate <b>308</b> and the source network <b>304</b> is configured to support a second data rate <b>310</b>. The first data rate <b>308</b> is higher than the second data rate <b>310</b>. For example, the first data rate can have an uplink speed of more than about 20 Mbps and a downlink speed of more than about 50 Mbps while the second data rate <b>310</b> can have an uplink speed of around 5 Mbps and a downlink speed of around 22 Mbps.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A receiver component <b>312</b> is configured to obtain a first set of QoS parameters <b>314</b> associated with the device <b>302</b> at about the same time as the device <b>302</b> moves into the coverage area of the target network <b>306</b>. For example, device <b>302</b> can be registered in source network <b>304</b> that supports a geographic area. As the device <b>302</b> is moved, it can be moved into a geographic area supported by the target network <b>306</b>. Based on this movement, an inter-RAT mobility procedure is initiated.</p>

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The 4G Packet Core Control Node <b>210</b> saves the subscription data. The 4G Packet Core Control Node <b>210</b> verifies the identity information and Mobility Management restrictions in the subscription records and compares the subscribed 4G QoS for each Packet Data Session with the original QoS parameters received in the Context Exchange procedure with the 2G/3G core network. If the MBR rates are different and/or the Allocation Retention Priority (ARP) value is different, the 4G Packet Core Control Node <b>210</b> should prepare for initiation of a QoS modification procedure at about the same time as completion of the Location Registration Procedure. The 4G Packet Core Control Node <b>210</b> sends a Location Registration Accept <b>402</b> first to the UE <b>202</b>. The 4G RAN <b>234</b> relays the Location Registration Accept <b>402</b> to the UE <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The 4G Packet Core Control Node <b>210</b> sends the QoS Modification Request <b>404</b> to the UE <b>202</b>.

In this example, the MBR rates are 4G data rates, which can range between about 20 to about 50 or more Mbps Uplink and around 20 to around 100 Mbps Downlink, which are higher than the rates that 2G/3G networks can offer.

If there is a discrepancy, the 4G Packet Core Control Node can initiate a context modification procedure both towards the device and other Core nodes (e.g., Serving Gateway, PDN Gateway) to renegotiate the QoS parameters in the 4G network, following the location registration procedure. Thus, the disclosed aspects can proactively initiate an upward QoS negotiation and the device will be able to utilize the 4G network benefits at about the same time as the device registers with the 4G network.</p>
