No. 13/590,901 filed on Aug. 21, 2012 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/950,990 filed on Nov. 19, 2010, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The instant invention relates generally to automatic docking and marine vessel collision avoidance systems preferably for a marine vessel, and more particularly to a programmable automatic docking system incorporating a plurality of transducers to detect and transmit a set of distance information between the marine vessel and an external object (i.e. a dock, another marine vessel, a structure above water, or buoy for example) to enable the programmable automatic docking system to navigate the marine vessel to a final pre-selected position from the external object and maintain that position.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Docking operations of large marine vessels is a precision operation which may cause damage to the marine vessel and the dock when relying on the skill and judgment of an operator. Maintaining the final position of the marine vessel requires the aid of multiple ropes and fenders. Dangerous weather conditions such as wind, water currents and darkness, increase the risk associated with the docking operation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Previous docking systems have required additional aids to assist in measuring the effects of these variables in order to provide visual aids to assist a skilled operator to manually dock the marine vessel. The docking operation requires a skilled pilot and many deck hands to assist with docking. Furthermore, the larger a marine vessel, the greater the risk that exists during docking operations thereby resulting in a greater need for the application of skill and extra deck hands.</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In yet another embodiment, the programmable processor control unit <b>30</b> is in electronic communication with and automatically controls the bow thruster <b>51</b> and the stern thruster <b>52</b> to position the side of the marine vessel <b>60</b> adjacent to the external object <b>70</b> at a pre-selected distance from the external object <b>70</b> and to maintain the side of the marine vessel <b>60</b> at the pre-selected distance automatically, thereby providing a completely programmable automatic docking system <b>10</b> of integrated interactive proximity obtaining feedback and automatic control of marine vessel positioning which requires no operator after setting the system in operation.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an automatic collision avoidance function of the instant invention preferably in marinas and other similar docking areas. In this embodiment, when a forward/reverse drive selector <b>62</b> is in operation, the &#x201c;ON&#x201d; button <b>21</b> is selected on the control panel <b>20</b>, and the selection is electronically communicated to the programmable processor control unit <b>30</b>. Following the activation of the programmable automatic docking system <b>10</b>, by the selection of the on button <b>21</b>, the programmable processor control unit <b>30</b> transmits to activate a bow distance, velocity and position transducer <b>46</b>. Upon activation of the bow distance, velocity and position transducer <b>46</b>, real-time distance and velocity information is detected and wirelessly transmitting to the programmable processor control unit <b>30</b> distance and velocity information of the bow <b>69</b> of the marine vessel <b>60</b> in relation to an external object <b>70</b> (i.e. an environment such as a marina, another marine vessel or rocks etc.). In this embodiment, the programmable processor control unit <b>30</b> is in electronic communication with a plurality of actuators <b>53</b> which control the forward/reverse drive selector <b>62</b> to maintain the marine vessel's <b>60</b> velocity preferably at a maximum of five knots. Alternatively, if the external object <b>70</b> is detected by the bow distance transducer <b>46</b> directly ahead of the marine vessel <b>60</b> at a distance of one hundred feet or less, the distance and velocity information is transmitted to the processor control unit <b>30</b>. Subsequently, the programmable processor control unit <b>30</b> which is in electronic communication with a plurality of actuators <b>53</b> will automatically control the plurality of actuators <b>53</b> to engage the main drive <b>62</b> to reduce the velocity by 0.06 knots per foot of travel and stop the marine vessel <b>60</b> at a default distance of preferably twenty feet away from the external object <b>70</b> thereby automatically avoiding a collision. The programmable automatic docking system <b>10</b> will maintain this final position in relation to the external object <b>70</b> until an operator assumes manual control of the marine vessel <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an automatic slip operation of the programmable automatic docking system <b>10</b>. In this embodiment, a slip location for a marine vessel <b>60</b> may be described as follows: a dock is a secured flat structural mass bordering water which has no movement and is above the waterline. A slip walkway is attached to the dock at approximately ninety degrees to the dock extending out above the water at a distance necessary to accommodate marine vessels <b>60</b> of various lengths. There are usually two walkways <b>71</b> attached to the dock one adjacent to each side of the marine vessel and this structure provides a safe u-shaped location for a marine vessel to be stored, normally with the aid of ropes.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The slip feature of the instant invention is able to operate in both the forward or reverse direction, along with port side or starboard side. When operating in slip reverse direction, a stern distance, velocity and position transducer <b>47</b> is engaged. In this embodiment, the control panel <b>20</b> further includes a slip forward button <b>64</b> and a slip reverse button <b>65</b>, wherein upon selection of either the slip forward button <b>64</b> or slip reverse button <b>65</b>, the programmable processor control unit <b>30</b> maintains the marine vessel's <b>60</b> velocity at approximately two knots and defaults to a two feet side clearance between the side of the marine vessel <b>60</b> and the slip walkway <b>71</b> on the port or starboard side.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one embodiment, the slip operation of the instant invention may occur as follows (the following example demonstrates a forward starboard selection as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>):

</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0051">Following the selection of the slip forward button <b>64</b> and the selection of the starboard button <b>67</b> by the operator, all further operations are maintained and controlled by the programmable automatic docking system <b>10</b>, thereby eliminating further operator intervention.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0052">In one embodiment (assuming for example that the starboard button <b>67</b> has been selected on the control panel <b>20</b>), as the marine vessels bow <b>69</b> enters the slip, the set of starboard side transducers, namely the pair of distance sensing transducers <b>41</b>S and <b>42</b>S located on the starboard fore side of the marine vessel <b>60</b>, and the pair of distance sensing transducers <b>44</b>S and <b>45</b>S located on the starboard aft side of the marine vessel <b>60</b> transmit a set of distance and velocity information to the programmable processor control unit <b>30</b>; the set of distance and velocity information preferably relates to the distance between the starboard side of the marine vessel <b>60</b> and the slip walkway <b>71</b>. The programmable processor control unit <b>30</b> will maintain the starboard side of the marine vessel <b>60</b> at a default distance setting of approximately two feet between the marine vessel <b>60</b> and the slip walkway <b>71</b> by engaging the front thruster <b>51</b> and the rear thruster <b>52</b> via electronic communication in response to the distance and velocity information detected and transmitted from the set of starboard side transducers <b>41</b>S <b>42</b>S <b>44</b>S and <b>45</b>S.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0053">Simultaneously and operating independently, while the distance and velocity information is transmitted by the set of starboard side transducers <b>41</b>S <b>42</b>S <b>44</b>S and <b>45</b>S, the bow distance transducer <b>46</b> wirelessly transmits distance and velocity information to the programmable processor control unit <b>30</b> in relation to the bow <b>69</b> and the dock <b>70</b>. Furthermore, the programmable processor control unit <b>30</b> is in electronic communication with and controls a plurality of actuators <b>53</b>, which in turn control the forward/reverse drive selector <b>62</b>. Therefore, the marine vessel <b>60</b> will automatically proceed to the dock <b>70</b> and maintain a maximum velocity of two knots until the bow distance transducer <b>46</b> transmits a minimum distance of three feet between the dock <b>70</b> and the bow <b>69</b> of the marine vessel <b>60</b> to the programmable processor control unit <b>30</b>.

<p id="p-0057" num="0058">Initially at step <b>100</b>A, an operator will bring the marine vessel <b>60</b> to a stop approximately sixty feet or less adjacent to the external object <b>70</b>, wherein the marine vessel <b>60</b> preferably is in a parallel orientation to the external object <b>70</b>. Once the marine vessel <b>60</b> is stopped, then at step <b>102</b>A, the on button <b>21</b> located on the control panel <b>20</b> is selected by an operator. Upon selection of the on button <b>21</b>, at step <b>104</b>A, the programmable processor control unit <b>30</b> is activated. Following activation of the programmable processor control unit <b>30</b>, at step <b>106</b>A a final desired distance between the starboard side of the marine vessel <b>60</b> and the external object <b>70</b> is pre-selected in order for the programmable automatic docking system <b>10</b> to cease movement of the marine vessel once the pre-selected position is reached. In one embodiment, the pre-selected distance may be input into the control panel <b>20</b> by pressing a plus button <b>24</b> to increase the distance or by pressing a minus button <b>25</b> to decrease the distance; the present distance selected will be shown on a display <b>23</b>. Once the final distance is selected, at step <b>108</b>A, a port button <b>66</b> or a starboard button <b>67</b> is selected on the control <b>20</b> (for this example a starboard button <b>67</b> will be selected). At step <b>110</b>A, the programmable processor control unit <b>30</b> automatically transmits to activate a set of starboard side transducers <b>40</b>S, which include the pair of distance sensing transducers <b>41</b>S and <b>42</b>S located on the starboard fore side of the marine vessel <b>60</b>, and the pair of distance sensing transducers <b>44</b>S and <b>45</b>S located on the starboard aft side of the marine vessel <b>60</b> and a starboard side lateral position transducer <b>43</b>S. Following activation of the set of starboard side transducers <b>40</b>S, at step <b>112</b>B the programmable processor control unit <b>30</b> activates the bow thruster <b>51</b> via electronic communication in response to the set of real-time distance and velocity information transmitted from the pair of distance sensing transducers <b>41</b>S and <b>42</b>S located on the starboard fore side of the marine vessel <b>60</b> to move the marine vessel <b>60</b> in a starboard direction. Simultaneously, at step <b>114</b>B the programmable processor control unit <b>30</b> activates the stern thruster <b>52</b> via electronic communication in response to the set of real-time distance and velocity information transmitted from the pair of distance sensing transducers <b>44</b>S and <b>45</b>S located on the starboard aft side of the marine vessel <b>60</b> to move the marine vessel <b>60</b> in a starboard direction. At step <b>116</b>B, the programmable processor control unit <b>30</b> automatically controls the bow thruster <b>51</b> and the stern thruster <b>52</b> to move the marine vessel <b>60</b> in a starboard direction preferably at a velocity of one foot every two seconds towards the external object <b>70</b>. Once the marine vessel <b>60</b> is approximately within ten feet from the pre-selected final distance in relation to the external object <b>70</b>, at step <b>118</b>B the programmable processor control unit <b>30</b> communicates with the bow thruster <b>51</b> and the stern thruster <b>52</b> to reduce the velocity of the marine vessel <b>60</b>; for example, if the pre-selected final distance from the external object <b>70</b> is five feet, then the marine vessel <b>60</b> will begin reducing velocity by 0.03 knots per foot of travel at fifteen feet from the external object <b>70</b>. Next, at step <b>120</b>B, once the pre-selected final position is reached; the programmable processor control unit <b>30</b> engages the bow thruster <b>51</b> and the stern thruster <b>52</b> to stop the marine vessel <b>60</b>. Once the pre-selected final distance to the external object <b>70</b> is reached by the marine vessel <b>60</b>, at step <b>122</b>B, the final pre-selected position is maintained indefinitely while the programmable automatic docking system <b>10</b> is in operation.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0059">While the starboard transducers <b>41</b>S <b>42</b>S <b>44</b>S and <b>45</b>S are in operation and transmitting real-time distance and velocity information to the programmable processor control unit <b>30</b> to move the marine vessel <b>60</b> in a starboard direction, the starboard lateral side position transducer <b>43</b>S will be operating simultaneously and independent of the set of starboard transducers <b>41</b>S <b>42</b>S <b>44</b>S and <b>45</b>S to detect and transmit real-time lateral position of the marine vessel <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0060">Therefore, at step <b>112</b>C, the starboard lateral side position transducer <b>43</b>S detects a lateral reference point on the external object <b>70</b> and wirelessly transmits the lateral reference point to the programmable processor control unit <b>30</b>. At step <b>114</b>C, the programmable processor control unit <b>30</b> memorizes the lateral reference point, from which any future lateral movement of the marine vessel <b>60</b> thereafter is processed. At step <b>116</b>C, the programmable processor control unit <b>30</b> automatically compensates for any lateral movement of the marine vessel <b>60</b> by controlling the plurality of actuators <b>53</b> in response to the real-time lateral position information transmitted from the starboard lateral side position transducer <b>43</b>S. At step <b>118</b>C, the plurality of actuators engage the forward/reverse drive selector <b>62</b> in order to maintain the marine vessel <b>60</b> in a controlled lateral path of travel toward the precise lateral reference point memorized by the programmable processor control unit <b>30</b>. At step <b>120</b>C Once the marine vessel <b>60</b> reaches the final pre-selected position as described at step <b>118</b>C, the starboard lateral side position transducer <b>43</b>S will continue to transmit real-time lateral position information of the marine vessel <b>60</b> in relation to the memorized precise lateral reference point to the programmable processor control unit <b>30</b> and at step <b>122</b><i>c </i>will maintain the lateral position of the marine vessel <b>60</b> while the programmable automatic docking system <b>10</b> is in operation</p>

At step <b>208</b>, once the bow distance, velocity and position transducer <b>46</b> is activated, the bow distance, velocity and position transducer <b>46</b> will detect and transmit real time distance and velocity information between the bow <b>69</b> of the marine vessel <b>60</b> and an external object <b>70</b>. After transmission of the initial distance information, at step <b>210</b> the forward/reverse drive selector <b>62</b> is controlled via a plurality of actuators <b>53</b> in electronic communication with the programmable processor control unit <b>30</b>. At step <b>212</b> the programmable processor control unit <b>30</b> controls the drive selector <b>62</b> to maintain the marine vessel <b>60</b> preferably at a default velocity of five knots.

Finally, at step <b>218</b>, once a distance of twenty feet between the bow <b>69</b> of the marine vessel <b>60</b> and the external object <b>70</b> is reached, the marine vessel <b>60</b> is maintained at that position indefinitely. Alternatively, if the bow distance, velocity and position transducer <b>46</b> does not detect an external object <b>70</b> within one hundred feet of the bow <b>69</b> of the marine vessel at step <b>218</b>, then the system returns to step <b>212</b> to continue to transmit real-time distance information from the bow distance, velocity and position transducer <b>46</b> to the programmable processor control unit <b>30</b>.</p>
