<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Embodiments of the subject matter described herein relate generally to turbomachinery, such as turbofan engines. More particularly, embodiments of the subject matter relate to coupling assemblies connecting the core of such a turbomachine to a surrounding housing.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Turbomachines, such as those in turbofan, turbojet, and other turbine engines often experience forces during operation which can affect the clearances between operating components. For example, an aircraft can perform maneuvers during flight which cause bending in the components due to their inertia. To accommodate bending from normal operations, components of the aircraft engine have spacing between them. For example, an engine core having a rotating shaft with radial airfoils may be enclosed by a housing. To accommodate bending in the housing of the core, a space may be present between the airfoil tips and the housing. The components may be spaced apart further than they would otherwise to permit bending of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This spacing, also known as a clearance or tolerance, has the disadvantage of reducing the efficiency of the engine, or other turbomachine. In the example of the rotating shaft, air can travel around the airfoils by passing between the airfoils and the housing, rather than travelling over an airfoil, as desired. Accordingly, the efficiency of the engine is reduced as less work is extracted from the passing air by the airfoils.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A typical approach to reducing the required clearances between components is to couple the ends of the housing of the core of the engine to surrounding components, such as a bypass duct. Unfortunately, rotating elements within the core are not supported in the same way as the housing of the core. Thus, restraining the housing of the engine core can cause the housing of the engine core to bend around the central rotating shaft, which remains relatively straight. As a result, the airfoils will approach undesirably close to the interior of the housing.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A coupling assembly for an engine core of a turbomachine is provided. The coupling assembly comprises a duct having a substantially circular shape and surrounding the engine core, and a plurality of coupling struts, each coupling strut extending only in a substantially vertical direction relative to the direction of gravity when the engine core is at a rest position with zero pitch and zero roll, each of the plurality of coupling struts coupling the engine core to the duct.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A coupling assembly for an engine core surrounded by a duct is also provided. The coupling assembly comprises a plurality of coupling struts, the plurality of coupling struts extending only in a substantially vertical direction relative to the direction of gravity when the engine core is at a rest position with zero pitch and zero roll, each of the plurality of coupling struts coupling the engine core to the duct.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another coupling assembly for an engine core of a turbomachine is provided. The engine core is at least partially surrounded by a duct. The coupling assembly comprises a plurality of coupling struts extending only in a direction substantially parallel to a downward direction of gravity when the engine core is at a rest position with zero pitch and zero roll, each of the plurality of coupling struts coupled to the engine core and to the duct and adapted to inhibit vertical movement of the engine core.</p>

<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an embodiment of an aircraft <b>100</b> with a turbofan engine <b>110</b>. Although described in the context of the aircraft <b>100</b>, various features and characteristics provided can be used in other contexts and with a variety of equipment. For example, although the engine <b>110</b> is particular to the aircraft <b>100</b>, various engines, as well as different types of turbomachinery, can benefit from the features described below. Thus, no particular feature or characteristic is constrained to an aircraft or turbofan engine, and the principles could be equally embodied in other vehicles, such as automobiles, or equipment, such as power generators or compressors, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The aircraft <b>100</b> is powered by the engine <b>110</b>, which can provide both a motive force as well as electrical and hydraulic power generation. Additionally, the engine <b>110</b> can supply high pressure and/or high temperature air to various other components and system of the aircraft <b>100</b>, if desired. As shown, the engine <b>110</b> can be coupled to the aircraft <b>100</b> on the side of the aircraft <b>100</b>. Thus, the engine <b>110</b> can provide a motive force alongside the aircraft <b>100</b> which can be transmitted to the aircraft <b>100</b> through a mounting <b>102</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a rear view of the aircraft <b>100</b> and engine <b>110</b>, wherein the mounting <b>104</b> is visible.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Also visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are various features of the engine <b>110</b>, such as the engine core <b>112</b> and bypass duct <b>114</b>, as well as a mounting assembly comprised of a number of coupling struts <b>116</b>. The engine core <b>112</b> typically contains a number of components and systems, some of which will be described in greater detail below. Although illustrated as the sole component surrounding and enclosing the engine core <b>112</b>, the bypass duct <b>114</b> can itself be partially or entirely surrounded and/or enclosed and/or shrouded by additional components. Such additional elements are omitted for clarity of depiction and description.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The engine core <b>112</b> can comprise a number of systems and/or components, including one or more rotors and/or shafts, including those supporting airfoils, support assemblies, such as bearing assemblies, coupling components, fuel and combustion components and systems, one or more exterior mixer lobes, and so on. The engine core <b>112</b> can have different components in different embodiments. The engine core <b>112</b> can perform various functions involved with power and motive force generation, including the compression, combustion, and expansion operations of a turbine engine. Thus, for example, the engine core <b>112</b> can include a rotating shaft with a plurality of radial airfoils over which compressed and/or heated air can flow.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The engine core <b>112</b> can be rigidly and/or pivotally coupled to the bypass duct <b>114</b> and/or a mounting frame at the front of the engine core <b>112</b>. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the engine core <b>112</b> can be cantilevered from the front of the engine <b>110</b> as it extends toward the rear of the engine <b>110</b>. Thus, without further coupling members, the engine core <b>112</b> can be free to deflect and bend, similar to a cantilevered beam.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As mentioned, the bypass duct <b>114</b> can enclose and surround the engine core <b>112</b>. The bypass duct <b>114</b> can provide structural support for the engine core <b>112</b>, including coupling locations for the plurality of coupling struts <b>116</b>. The bypass duct <b>114</b> can perform additional operations or have other beneficial features, such as confining and/or directing a flow of air or compressed air useful in other operations of the engine <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref> illustrate the engine <b>110</b> wherein the engine core <b>112</b> is in several different positions as a result of various forces acting on the engine <b>110</b>. In each, the downward direction of gravity acting on the engine core <b>112</b> is shown and indicated with a g. It should be understood that the deflection of the engine core <b>112</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> is greatly exaggerated for illustrative clarity and that, relative to the size of the components, deflection of the engine core <b>112</b> is in actuality much smaller, and in some cases may not be visible to the unaided eye. Additionally, for purposes of describing the effects of various forces on the engine <b>110</b>, including deflection of the engine core <b>112</b>, the coupling struts <b>116</b> are omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the engine <b>110</b> with the engine core <b>112</b> in an unloaded position. The bypass duct <b>114</b> is shown substantially concentric around, and co-axial with, the engine core <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the engine <b>110</b> undergoing vertical, or maneuver-induced, bending. In the context of the aircraft <b>100</b>, maneuver-induced bending occurs when the aircraft <b>100</b> executes a maneuver, such as an altitude increase or decrease. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates such a maneuver, that of an altitude decrease. The bypass duct <b>114</b> remains substantially rigid relative to the aircraft <b>100</b> because the connections to the aircraft body by the mounting <b>102</b> and rear mounting <b>104</b> are rigid, as well as the overall stiffness of the bypass duct <b>114</b>. The inertia of the engine core <b>112</b>, however, causes it to tend to remain at a higher altitude than the rest of the engine <b>110</b>. Relative to the bypass duct <b>114</b>, this results in an apparent rise in the engine core <b>112</b> from its undeflected position.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the engine <b>110</b> undergoing horizontal, or thrust-induced bending. Because the engine <b>110</b> generates a forward force, the force is resisted at the front by the mounting <b>102</b>, which is coupled to the forward frame, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-10</figref>, and described in greater detail below. Because the mounting <b>102</b> reacts the forward force of thrust out of plane with the application of engine thrust, a moment is generated. The moment results in an outward bowing of the engine <b>110</b>, away from the body of the aircraft <b>100</b>, as described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The engine core <b>112</b>, however, is cantilevered from the forward frame. As the forward frame bends at an angle to the aircraft <b>100</b>, the engine core <b>112</b> correspondingly is moved to angle away from the aircraft <b>100</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The rear mounting <b>104</b> constrains the outward bowing of the bypass duct <b>114</b>, however, resulting in an offset of the rear of the engine core <b>112</b> relative to the center of the bypass duct <b>114</b>, as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional top view of the engine <b>110</b> depicting the relationship of certain components for descriptive purposes. It is should be understood to be simplified and omitting various systems and components unrelated to the descriptive purpose, and is not a true and exact depiction of an engine <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The engine core <b>112</b> is coupled to the forward frame <b>118</b>, as shown, and can extend as a cantilever therefrom. The forward frame <b>118</b> can be coupled to the bypass duct <b>114</b> and to the mounting <b>102</b>, which can couple the engine <b>110</b> to the aircraft <b>100</b>. The bypass duct <b>114</b> can additionally be coupled to the aircraft <b>100</b> by the rear mounting <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Among other components, the engine core <b>112</b> can include a core housing <b>120</b>, a rotating shaft <b>122</b>, and bearing mounts <b>124</b> supporting the shaft <b>122</b>. The shaft <b>122</b> can have an airfoil section <b>130</b> including numerous airfoils extending radially outward from the shaft <b>122</b>. The bearing mounts <b>124</b> preferably support the shaft <b>122</b> such that it is free to rotate. The bearing mounts <b>124</b> can support the shaft <b>122</b>, which is not directly supported by the bypass duct <b>114</b> and/or mounting <b>102</b>. In an actual engine <b>110</b>, the components can have a different configuration, size, and so on. For example, the shaft <b>122</b> can be a hollow cylinder, or tube, rather than the solid cylinder depicted. Alternatively, or additionally, in some embodiments, the airfoil section <b>130</b> can extend outside the core housing <b>120</b> and have a clearance with the interior of the bypass duct <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As can be seen, the distance between the airfoil section <b>130</b> and the core housing <b>120</b> is preferably small. During operation, air can travel through the engine core <b>112</b>, within the core housing <b>120</b>, across the airfoil section <b>130</b>. The air can travel over the airfoil section <b>130</b>, causing it to turn, resulting in turning of the shaft <b>122</b>. The efficiency of this operation increases as the clearance between the airfoil section <b>130</b> and core housing <b>120</b> is reduced, causing as much air to pass over the airfoil section <b>130</b> as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional side view of an embodiment of an engine <b>110</b> experiencing maneuver-induced bending in a downward direction, such as would be associated with an altitude increase of the aircraft <b>100</b>. It should be understood that the bending of components illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-10</figref> is greatly exaggerated for ease of viewing. In practice, the bending and deflections experienced by the illustrated components may be much smaller, relative to their size and shape, and may not be visible to the unaided eye. Although illustrated as straight, the bypass duct <b>114</b> may exhibit some bending during the maneuver. This bending of the bypass duct <b>114</b> is omitted for clarity.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The engine core <b>112</b> can be seen to bend in a downward direction under its inertia during a maneuver. As the engine core <b>112</b> bends downward, the rear bearing <b>124</b> is deflected downward. The forward bearing <b>124</b>, however, remains relatively stationary. As a result, the bearings <b>124</b> are no longer co-axial with the undeflected center of the engine <b>110</b> or engine core <b>112</b>. Because the shaft <b>122</b> is supported only by the bearings <b>124</b> and relatively stiffer than the engine core <b>112</b> as a whole, the shaft <b>122</b> does not experience bending to the same degree, and maintains a substantially straight shape. Therefore, the core housing <b>120</b> is being deflected downward, whereas the shaft <b>122</b> is maintaining a relatively straight shape. Accordingly, the airfoil section <b>130</b> is moved closer to the core housing <b>120</b> on one side, and farther from the core housing <b>120</b> on the other side. To accommodate this movement, additional clearance may be required in the undeflected, unloaded configuration. Consequently, efficiency may be reduced. Moreover, where the airfoil section <b>130</b> moves away from the core housing <b>120</b>, the larger clearance allows passage around the airfoil section <b>130</b>, rather than across the airfoils, which is less desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates the cross-sectional side view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, except that the vertically-extending coupling struts <b>116</b> are shown in the proper position to support the rear of the engine core <b>112</b>. The coupling struts <b>116</b> can experience compression in the lower struts and tension in the upper struts, thereby inhibiting downward bending of the rear of the engine core <b>112</b>. As a result, the engine core <b>112</b> can remain relatively straight and unbent. Consequently, the shaft <b>122</b> can maintain a relatively co-axial position with the center of the engine core <b>112</b>. Therefore, the airfoil section <b>130</b> will maintain its position relative to the interior of the core housing <b>120</b>, and the required clearance can be reduced, thereby improving the efficiency of the engine <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional top view of the engine <b>110</b> operating under a thrust-induced load. The forward frame <b>118</b> is coupled to the mounting <b>102</b>, which is in turn coupled to the aircraft <b>100</b>. The bypass duct <b>114</b> is coupled to the forward frame <b>118</b>, but also coupled to the aircraft <b>100</b> by the rear mounting <b>104</b>. During operation, the engine <b>110</b> can produce thrust in a forward direction, to the right of the illustrated engine <b>110</b>. The thrust of the engine <b>110</b> can provide the motive force for the aircraft <b>100</b>. The thrust is resisted by the forward frame <b>118</b>, to which the bypass duct <b>114</b> and engine core <b>112</b> are coupled. Resisting the thrust of the engine <b>110</b> through the forward frame <b>118</b> is the mounting <b>102</b>. Because the mounting <b>102</b> resists the force in a position off-axis from the thrust, a movement around the mounting <b>102</b> is generated, in addition to a shear force. The moment causes the forward frame <b>118</b> to bend towards the right relative to its unloaded state, by the angle &#x3b8;, as shown. Similarly, the bypass duct <b>114</b> will bend away from the body of the aircraft <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The engine core <b>112</b>, however, is coupled to the forward frame <b>118</b> by a cantilever coupling. Accordingly, the central axis of the engine core <b>112</b> is angled away from the aircraft towards the front of the engine core <b>112</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates several coupling struts <b>190</b> coupling the rear of the engine core <b>112</b> to the bypass duct <b>114</b> in a horizontal direction. Coupling struts <b>190</b> are not present in earlier illustrations and are used solely to illustrate the effect of horizontal struts on thrust-induced loads.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Coupling struts <b>190</b> extend from the bypass duct <b>114</b> to the engine core <b>112</b> and support tension and compression to maintain the position of the engine core <b>112</b> relative to the bypass duct <b>114</b>. Because the front of the engine core <b>112</b> is bending outward, however, the result is an arc-shaped engine core <b>112</b>, as shown. Consequently, the location of the core housing <b>120</b> relative to the airfoil section <b>130</b> is altered. The inboard side of the airfoil section <b>130</b> is closer to the core housing <b>120</b> than the outboard side. To prevent the airfoil section <b>130</b> from impinging on the interior surface of the core housing <b>120</b>, additional clearance may be required between the airfoil section <b>130</b> and the core housing <b>120</b>. Disadvantageously, this increased clearance can reduce the efficiency of the engine <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional top view of the engine <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, in the thrust-loaded state, with the coupling struts <b>190</b> removed. As can be seen, although the bypass duct <b>114</b> continues to bend, and the forward frame <b>118</b> remains at an angle &#x3b8; relative to its unloaded position, removal of the coupling struts <b>190</b> permits the engine core <b>112</b> to maintain a straight shape. Consequently, the bearings <b>124</b> support the shaft <b>122</b> along a straight line through the central axis of the engine core <b>112</b>. Therefore, no additional clearance is required between the airfoil section <b>130</b> and the bypass duct <b>114</b>. Accordingly, the efficiency of the engine <b>110</b> is not decreased by additional clearance.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-10</figref>, it is desirable to have an engine coupling assembly which provides tension and compression to resist displacement of the engine core in a vertical direction, such as maneuver-induced bending, while permitting the engine core to displace in a horizontal direction, such as when experiencing thrust-induced bending. With reference back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a coupling assembly comprising a plurality of coupling struts <b>116</b> extending only in a substantially vertical direction is shown. Such a configuration provides the desired reaction characteristics to minimize clearances between the airfoil section <b>130</b>, or other rotating component, and core housing <b>120</b>, or other surrounding component. The vertical direction is relative to the direction of gravity.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates a perspective view of the rear of an engine <b>200</b> having an engine coupling assembly comprising a plurality of coupling struts <b>230</b> embodying certain features described below. Although four coupling struts <b>230</b> are used in the exemplary embodiment, more or fewer struts can be present in various embodiments, as later shown and described. Unless described otherwise, the engine <b>200</b> can have features and properties similar to those described above with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-10</figref> and engine <b>110</b>. The engine <b>200</b> comprises a bypass duct <b>210</b> and an engine core <b>220</b>, among other components and systems. As explained above, such additional components and systems are omitted for clarity. Certain embodiments of the engine <b>200</b> can have more or different components and features without departing from the spirit of the embodiments described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Four coupling struts <b>230</b> are provided for coupling the engine core <b>220</b> to the bypass duct <b>210</b> by transmitting force only in a substantially vertical direction. Preferably, the coupling struts <b>230</b> are rigid members. The coupling struts <b>230</b> can be composed of any appropriate material, including metals of various types, such as high-strength metals which retain their strength at high temperatures. For example, a nickel- or cobalt-based superalloy can be used, along with other metals, as desired for the embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The coupling struts <b>230</b> can be coupled to the engine core <b>220</b> on a lateral side. Such a lateral side can be approximately 90&#xb0; in either direction around the engine core <b>220</b> from the downward direction of gravity, g. The coupling sites on the engine core <b>220</b> do not have to be at exactly 90&#xb0; to either side, and can be offset to either side, as desired for the embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Preferably, the coupling struts <b>230</b> are coupled to the engine core <b>220</b> at a mounting bracket or other such assembly designed to receive the coupling struts <b>230</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates a detailed view of a portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> in which such a mounting bracket <b>222</b> is shown. In some embodiments, the coupling struts <b>230</b> can be coupled to the engine core <b>220</b> with a fastener or fasteners, such as a pin, nut and bolt assembly, threaded member, or other desired coupling technique. The coupling struts <b>230</b> can be coupled directly to the engine core <b>220</b> or to an intermediary coupling device, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In certain embodiments, the coupling struts <b>230</b> can have an adjustable length, while in other embodiments, they can be rigid, fixed members which cannot be adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates a detailed view of a portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> showing the connection between a coupling strut <b>230</b> and the bypass duct <b>210</b>. In at least some embodiments, the bypass duct <b>210</b> can have an interior surface <b>212</b> which faces the engine core <b>220</b>. The interior surface <b>212</b> can have one or more ports <b>214</b>, through which at least a portion of the coupling strut <b>230</b> can extend. It can be desirable to avoid protruding any portion of a coupling connection between the coupling strut <b>230</b> and bypass duct <b>210</b> inward toward the engine core <b>220</b> beyond the interior surface <b>212</b>. High-temperature and/or high-pressure air can travel along the interior surface <b>212</b>, which can have deleterious effects on such the physical components of couplings, as well as reducing efficiency. Additionally, in certain embodiments, at least some of the coupling struts <b>230</b> can have cross-sectional shapes selected to affect their aerodynamic response to air traveling within the bypass duct <b>210</b>. For example, some coupling struts <b>230</b> can have a cross-sectional shape similar to an airfoil, while others can have a teardrop shaped cross-section, or a circular cross-section, or an oblong or oval cross-section, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates an exemplary configuration of coupling struts <b>230</b> from a rear view of the engine <b>200</b>. As can be seen, each coupling strut <b>230</b> extends only in a substantially vertical direction relative to the direction of gravity, g, when the engine <b>200</b> is at a rest position. Preferably, each coupling strut <b>230</b> is substantially parallel to the direction of gravity, such that the angle &#x3b8; formed between a coupling strut <b>230</b> and the downward direction of gravity is equal to or less than 30&#xb0;. In certain embodiments, the angle &#x3b8; can be 0&#xb0;, where a coupling strut <b>230</b> runs in an exactly vertical direction. In other embodiments, the angle &#x3b8; can be anywhere between 0&#xb0; and 30&#xb0;, inclusive, as desired. Preferably, no coupling strut <b>230</b> extends in a horizontal or substantially horizontal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">All references to a vertical direction or horizontal direction are to be understood to in the context of a stationary aircraft at a rest position of zero pitch and zero roll and otherwise level relative to the surface of the Earth. Additionally, such references applying to components of an engine or engine core or other component thereof are also to be understood to be in reference to a rest position wherein the engine, engine core, other component, or aircraft or other vehicle to which the engine or sub-component is coupled is flat and level relative to the surface of the Earth. Although vehicles may experience gravity in different directions relative to the components during operation, references for directions are made only in the rest position, flat and level on the Earth.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Moreover, the engines, including subcomponents, are illustrated separated from the body of any aircraft. It should be understood that, when mounted, the downward direction of gravity can be in a different direction. For example, an engine, such as the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, can be mounted substantially horizontally from the aircraft body. In such a mounted position, the direction of gravity, g, will be substantially the same. As another example, the engine can be mounted at an angle to the substantially horizontal direction, resulting in an angle between the illustrated downward direction of gravity in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> and the actual downward direction of gravity when mounted. Such mounting angles are contemplated with any of the embodiments disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-18</figref> illustrate various alternative embodiments of engines having a coupling assembly comprising a plurality of coupling struts in various configurations. Unless described otherwise, each described engine can have features and properties similar to those described above with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-10</figref> and engine <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As can be see in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, in addition to the four coupling struts previously illustrated, the coupling struts <b>330</b> can also extend at a different angle from the downward direction of gravity, g. Preferably, however, the angle formed with the downward direction of gravity, &#x3b8;, is less than 30&#xb0;, regardless of the direction of extension of the struts <b>330</b>. As the engine <b>300</b> operates, the engine core <b>320</b> and bypass duct <b>310</b> will undergo thermal expansion. Because the engine core <b>320</b> experiences a higher operating temperature than the bypass duct <b>310</b>, the engine core <b>320</b> undergoes a larger thermal expansion than the bypass duct <b>310</b>. Advantageously, the struts <b>330</b>, as with the struts of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14</figref>, and <b>16</b>-<b>18</b> are positioned such that radial expansion of the engine core <b>320</b>, <b>220</b> does not cause direct compressive loading of the struts <b>330</b>, <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates an embodiment of an engine <b>400</b> wherein two coupling struts <b>430</b> couple the engine core <b>420</b> to the bypass duct <b>410</b>. The coupling struts <b>430</b> extend only in the upward direction from the lateral sides of the engine core <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates an embodiment of the engine <b>500</b> wherein two coupling struts <b>530</b> couple the engine core <b>520</b> to the bypass duct <b>510</b>. Unlike the engine <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the coupling struts <b>530</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> extend only downwards, relative to the direction of gravity, in a substantially vertical direction. In either embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, as with other embodiments, the angle formed between the coupling struts <b>430</b>, <b>530</b> and the engine core <b>420</b>, <b>520</b> can vary as desired for the embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, coupling struts <b>630</b> used to couple an engine core <b>620</b> to a bypass duct <b>610</b> can be asymmetrical around one or more axes passing through the center of the engine <b>600</b>. Thus, as shown, one coupling strut <b>630</b> can extend downward, relative to the direction of gravity, from a lateral side of the engine core <b>620</b>, while another extends upwards from the other lateral side.</p>
