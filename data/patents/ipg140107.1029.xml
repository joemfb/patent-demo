<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to display packages. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to packages for displaying and holding light fixture such as lamps and accessories such as light bulbs.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Some jurisdictions have enacted laws to decrease or at least stabilize electrical energy consumption. Some of these laws require manufacturers to make energy efficient lamps or light fixtures. For example, under California law, manufactures, sellers, and importers of lamps or light fixtures may comply with current energy reduction statutes and regulations by including a compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulb in the product packaging, while still using a standard screw-based socket in the lamp. In light of the foregoing, it is desirable to provide a packaging assembly capable of displaying and holding a light fixture and a light bulb.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF TEE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to a packaging assembly for displaying and holding a light fixture and an accessory thereof. In one embodiment, the packaging assembly generally includes a bottom base portion and an upper portion. The bottom base portion has an open compartment dimensioned to receive a base of a light fixture. The upper portion is coupled to the bottom base portion and includes a hollow compartment dimensioned to receive an accessory for the light fixture.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In accordance with the above embodiment, the upper portion may include an opening leading to the hollow compartment. This opening is dimensioned to allow at least one of the accessory or a package containing the accessory to be visible from outside of the upper portion. The accessory may comprise a light bulb.

<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> depict a packaging assembly <b>10</b> for displaying and holding any suitable light fixture. Packaging assembly <b>10</b> may be used not only during shipping but also for displaying the light fixture in a store. In some embodiments, the packaging assembly <b>10</b> includes a bottom base portion <b>12</b> having an open compartment <b>14</b>. The open compartment <b>14</b> is shaped and dimensioned to receive the base of any suitable light fixture, such as a lamp.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The packaging assembly <b>10</b> further includes a hollow upper portion <b>16</b> coupled to the bottom base portion <b>12</b>. The hollow upper portion <b>16</b> includes a hollow compartment <b>18</b> dimensioned to receive any accessory for the light fixture. Suitable accessories for the light fixture include, but are not limited to, light bulbs, such as a CFL bulb. The hollow upper portion <b>16</b> may additionally include an opening <b>20</b> leading to the hollow compartment <b>18</b>. The opening <b>20</b> is dimensioned to allow the accessory for the light fixture or the package containing such accessory to be visible from outside the hollow upper portion <b>16</b>. In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, the opening <b>20</b> is located in a lower portion of the hollow upper portion <b>16</b> near the bottom base portion <b>12</b>. However, the opening <b>20</b> may be positioned at any suitable location along the height of the hollow upper portion <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The hollow upper portion <b>16</b> may additionally include one or more locking tabs <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> near the opening <b>20</b> for inhibiting removal of the accessory through the opening <b>20</b>. In one specific embodiment, the hollow upper portion <b>16</b> may include two locking tabs <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> protruding toward each other and disposed over the opening <b>20</b> in a common plane. While the drawings show only two locking tabs <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, the hollow upper portion <b>16</b> may include fewer or more locking tabs.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The hollow upper portion <b>16</b> may include a pair of spaced apart apertures <b>30</b> at or near its lower end <b>34</b> and another pair of spaced apart apertures <b>32</b> at or near its upper end <b>36</b>. Each aperture <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> is dimensioned to receive a cable tie or any other elongated structure capable of holding a light fixture.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The packaging assembly <b>10</b> may also include a hollow cord compartment <b>26</b> disposed between the hollow upper portion <b>16</b> and the bottom base portion <b>12</b>.

The packaging assembly <b>10</b> may include a hole <b>28</b> leading to the cord compartment <b>26</b> and in communication with the open compartment <b>14</b> of the bottom base portion <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref> show the packaging assembly <b>10</b> supporting a light fixture <b>200</b>. Light fixture <b>200</b> generally includes a base <b>202</b>, a light socket <b>204</b> and a body <b>206</b> interconnecting the base <b>202</b> and the light socket <b>204</b>. The base <b>202</b> of light fixture <b>200</b> includes a bottom surface, which may have a substantially planar configuration. Regardless of its configuration, the base <b>202</b> of the light fixture <b>200</b> is partly or entirely disposed within the open compartment <b>14</b> of the bottom base portion <b>12</b> of the packaging assembly <b>10</b>. The lower end <b>208</b> of the body <b>206</b> is connected to the base <b>202</b>, whereas the upper end <b>210</b> of the body <b>206</b> is connected to the light socket <b>204</b>. At least a portion of the body <b>206</b> may abut or contact the hollow upper portion <b>16</b> of the packaging assembly <b>10</b>. An upper portion of the body <b>206</b>, however, may extend beyond the upper end <b>36</b> of the hollow upper portion <b>16</b>. In such embodiments, a shade (not shown) can be attached to the light fixture <b>200</b> while the light fixture is still disposed in the package assembly <b>10</b>. The light fixture <b>200</b> may include one or more attachment members <b>212</b> at or near the upper end <b>210</b> of the body <b>206</b> to allow a shade to be secured to the light fixture <b>200</b>. The attachment members <b>212</b> may be hooks or any other device, mechanism, or means suitable for securely receiving a shade. The attachment members <b>212</b> may alternatively be connected to the light socket <b>204</b>. The light socket <b>204</b> of the light fixture <b>200</b> may be adapted to securely receive any suitable light bulb, such as a CFL bulb.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>, the packaging assembly <b>10</b> may further include a first cable tie <b>38</b> passing through the pair of apertures <b>30</b> and a second cable tie <b>40</b> passing through the pair of spaced apart apertures <b>32</b>.
