<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A device and method are described for extending the life of check valves. An improved check valve having a double poppet and tapered guides is more robust, and a check valve protection device between the check valve and the environment into which fluid is injected protects the valve from a contaminating or corrosive environment. The check valve and check valve protection device are small and light weight to prevent vibration-induced failures. The check valve protection device preferably has an interior volume that fills quickly by relatively few cycles of the lubricant pump to reduce delay of lubricant to the injection point.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to extending the life of check valves in hostile environments, and is particularly suitable for use in lubrication systems for natural gas compressors.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Natural gas compressors receive natural gas from wells and compress the gas into compressed natural gas (&#x201c;CNG&#x201d;), which is more readily stored. Lubrication systems for natural gas compressors are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,835,372 to Roys et al. To lubricate the compressor, a small volume of lubricant at high pressure is typically applied periodically into the compressor cylinder. A check valve inserted between the lubricant line and the compressor cylinder seals the compressor cylinder to prevent natural gas from flowing into the lubrication line. The high pressure lubricant periodically opens the valve to inject the lubricant. The lubricant is at a higher pressure than the natural gas, so when the valve is open, the lubricant flows into the cylinder, instead of the natural gas flowing out of the cylinder. To prevent the hot natural gas from contaminating or otherwise damaging the check valve, an oil reservoir device is typically mounted between the cylinder and the check valve to maintain an oil barrier between the check valve and the natural gas.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a cross section of a typical reservoir device <b>100</b> mounted on a compressor <b>102</b> to provide an oil barrier between cylinder <b>104</b> and check valve <b>106</b>.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Applicant has found through his investigations of check valve failures in CNG compressors that check valves in compressors should preferably not be installed directly on the cylinder. Gas migrating into the check valve as it opens and closes can also create coking, that is, formation of carbon deposits from the lubricant, on the ball and seat of the check valve due to heat from the compressed gas or air. The coking causes premature failure of the valve. Vertical installation of the check valve allows the introduction of hot, contaminated gas into the check valve each time the valve opens to inject oil into the lubrication point, but failures can occur regardless of the orientation of the check valve on the cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Applicant has found that the prior art reservoir device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, while providing some degree of protection compared to mounting the check valve directly on the compressor, has several drawbacks.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A. Volume of Oil</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The interior volume of the various check valve, reservoir, and fitting components must be filled before oil will pass through those components and lubricate the compressor. The volume of oil needed to fill the check valve cavity on the discharge end, the &#xbc;&#x2033;&#xd7;&#xbc;&#x2033; nipple that couples the check valve to the reservoir device, and the reservoir device void, is approximately 0.183 cubic inches. If a divider block system providing the lubrication cycles every 30 seconds and has a 0.006 piston size, the compressor could operate for 15 minutes before lubrication is injected into the lubrication point. CNG compressors typically operate intermittently, on demand. Due to the frequent starting and stopping and the limited run times of CNG compressors during operation, this delay in providing lubrication can cause premature wear or failure of cylinder and packing components. A typical CNG compressor can start as many as 150 times each day and run for only a short period of time, such as five to fifteen minutes. This problem of delaying the delivery of lubricant is exasperated when using divider block systems having longer cycle times. The combination of long cycle time of the divider block and the extra time required to fill the void in the reservoir device after replacement of parts on the lube system, can present a major problem in providing lubrication to the compressor components.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">B. Dilution of Oil by Natural Gas</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">After start-up, the compressor fills the CNG storage bottles with the compressed gas to a specified pressure, typically 3600 psi, and then automatically shuts down. The remaining gas in the cylinder is released (&#x201c;blown down&#x201d;) to allow the unit to start again in an unloaded state. As the compressor cylinder compresses gas, the volume of oil in the reservoir device becomes saturated with dissolved gas. As the compressor stops and the cylinder is blown down, the dissolved gas comes out of solution because of the rapid decompressing of the oil and creates foaming of the oil (entrained air) which in turn forces out some of the oil in the reservoir device, replacing the oil with gas released from solution. This process forces the oil contained in the check valve cavity, the oil in the &#xbc;&#x2033;&#xd7;&#xbc;&#x2033; nipple, and the oil in the reservoir device out with the gas blown down. At start-up the divider block system must fill all of these voids before lubrication is introduced into the injection point to lubricate the cylinder and packing. This causes premature wear or failure of the compressor components.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">C. Vibration-Induced Failures</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The combined weight of the reservoir device, double female check valve, &#xbc;&#x2033;&#xd7;&#xbc;&#x2033; MPT nipple, and the tubing fitting shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is approximately 14 ounces. The compressor experiences extreme vibration during normal operation. The vibration combined with the weight of the components causes premature failure of the &#x215b;&#x2033; or &#xbc;&#x2033; NPT male pipe connector <b>120</b> threaded into the injection point. This failure results in compressed gas in the cylinder or packing point to immediately escape to the atmosphere creating an explosion or fire safety hazard and possible injury to operators standing near the compressor.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">D. Premature Failure of Cylinders/Packing</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">When the NPT connector of the reservoir device cracks, the oil needed to lubricate the compressor components leaks to atmosphere with the gas and the compressor will continue to operate causing the compressor components (cylinders/packing) to suffer premature wear and failure due to lack of lubrication.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">While the prior art reservoir device described above protects the check valve from the gasses in the cylinder to some extent by providing an oil barrier seal, those components suffer from the problems described in A-D above. Preferred embodiments of the invention provide a liquid seal between the check valve and the environment into which the liquid is being injected that overcomes the above problems. Below are described embodiments that provide oil head seals between the check valve and gas/debris in the cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an oil seal is provided by using standard tubing and fittings in a novel way. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a fitting <b>202</b> connected to a natural gas compressor cylinder <b>204</b>. Tubing <b>206</b> runs from the fitting <b>202</b> to another fitting <b>208</b> connected to a check valve <b>210</b>. A bend <b>212</b> in the tubing <b>206</b> between the injection point at the compressor cylinder <b>204</b> and the check valve <b>210</b> forms an oil seal. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, while providing advantages over the prior art, has disadvantages. The extra components create additional costs, provide additional possibilities for leaks, and the additional weight, combined with vibration of the compressor, can create stress cracks in the tubing allowing hazardous gases to escape into the atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The female-by-female check valve manufactured and installed on thousands of gas and air compressors incorporates &#xbc;&#x2033; NPS (national pipe straight) thread connections. The tube fitting and male pipe nipple used to assemble the check valve and components use NPT threads. When connecting these different types of threads, the result is that only 1&#xbd; to 2 threads are actually available to create the sealing area. Although this connection is insufficient to comply with preferred engineering practices, it is still used by many compressor manufacturers. To ensure reliable sealing between the components, users should employ industry standard NPTF (NPT female) to NPTM (NPT male) thread connections.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows a preferred embodiment that increases reliability of check valves, protects compressor components, and provides a safer working environment. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> uses an improved check valve protective device <b>300</b> (also referred to as an &#x201c;oil head fitting&#x201d;) and an improved check valve <b>301</b>. The check valve <b>301</b> and the check valve protective device <b>300</b> may be two separate devices that are connected, or they can be combined into a single unit.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an enlarged view of check valve <b>301</b>. Check valve <b>301</b>, referred to as the CCT &#x201c;XD&#x201d; Injection Check Valve, is preferably made from stainless steel and is lightweight to reduce failure caused by vibration. A preferred check valve <b>301</b> is rated to operate at 10,000 PSI operating pressure and a temperature of 400&#xb0; F., although the operating specifications of an embodiment will, of course, depend on the application to which the valve is applied. Check valve <b>301</b> includes a valve body <b>402</b> and poppets <b>404</b>A and <b>404</b>B that are pressed by respective springs <b>406</b>A and <b>406</b>B to seal against respective O-rings seals <b>408</b>A and <b>408</b>B, which are positioned in tapered guides <b>410</b>A and <b>410</b>B, respectively. In one embodiment, tapered guide <b>410</b>B is milled in the valve body <b>402</b> and tapered guide <b>410</b>A is a feature of a metal insert <b>414</b>. The poppets are further guided by pilot portions <b>420</b>A and <b>420</b>B that include tapered front portions <b>422</b>A and <b>422</b>B (hidden by spring <b>406</b>A), which are guided into alignment by tapered guides <b>410</b>A and <b>410</b>B, respectively. The use of one or more tapered guides and pilots ensures that the poppets <b>404</b>A and <b>404</b>B are always guided to the tapered metal shoulders to seat the O-rings, thereby providing a positive seal. The double O-ring seals positioned in the tapered guides allow for a positive seal to eliminate leakage. Check valve <b>301</b> also incorporates a tubing connector <b>430</b> that is integral with the check valve to eliminate possible leak paths in the assembly, simplify installation, and reducing weight.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Check valve <b>301</b> is relatively small and light, thereby reducing or eliminating vibration-induced failures. Check valve <b>301</b> provides to the compressor industry a dependable solution to extend the longevity and reliability of divider block system injection check valves. The use of double self guiding poppets, although not required for every implementation, is preferred in most implementations to provide a sure seal.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a preferred protective device <b>300</b> that provides an oil head to seal and protect the check valve from heated gas and from contamination in the gas stream. A preferred check valve protection device minimizes the amount of oil required to fill the device to reduce the effects of gas saturation and to reduce the time required to inject lubricant to the cylinder or packing. The preferred protection device is rated at 10,000 psi operating pressure and is light weight to eliminate vibration-induced failures. The device is readily connected to the check valve with a minimum of fittings, or the device is integral with the check valve. Also, a preferred device enables installation of a pressure gauge at the injection point to check actual injection pressure for field troubleshooting.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Check valve protection device <b>300</b> includes a solid body <b>302</b> having a first passage <b>304</b> that provides fluid to the device (not shown) to which the fluid is to be delivered and a second passage <b>306</b> receiving the fluid from a check valve <b>301</b>, which screws into a first threaded cavity <b>312</b> in solid body <b>302</b>. A second threaded cavity <b>314</b> provides a fluid connection between passage <b>304</b> and passage <b>306</b>, the second threaded cavity being sealed by a plug <b>318</b>. Plug <b>318</b> is screwed into the second threaded cavity <b>314</b> to leave just sufficient space in the second threaded cavity <b>314</b> to allow fluid to flow readily from passage <b>304</b> to passage <b>306</b> through the second threaded cavity <b>314</b>. Plug <b>318</b> can be preferably removed to install a pressure gauge to check actual injection pressure for field troubleshooting. This aspect is novel and is provided to enable troubleshooting of the compressor cylinder and the lubrication system. The industry has never had an easy way to check the system pressure at the injection point, and this design makes a pressure check possible. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows check valve protection device <b>300</b> with the plug <b>318</b> removed and a pressure gauge <b>350</b> attached.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">While the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> is relatively simple to manufacture, skilled persons will recognize that the design, such as the path between the check valve and the device to which fluid is to be delivered, could be altered without departing from scope of the invention. For example, rather than passages <b>304</b> being centered, passages <b>304</b> and <b>306</b> could be offset from the longitudinal axis of solid body <b>302</b>, and plug <b>318</b> could be designed with a wide, circumferential ridge that reduces the volume of the cavity along an annulus outside the passages. In another example, second threaded cavity <b>314</b> could be eliminated. Passage <b>306</b> could then be drilled from the top or bottom and sealed with a plug, and then a third passage drilled from the side of body <b>302</b> to connect passage <b>304</b> and <b>306</b>, with the third passage also sealed by a plug. The embodiment of the check protection device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> will provide protection to the check valve when mounted in any orientation. When mounted with the check valve sticking up vertically from the check valve protection device <b>300</b>, the oil seal is provided in most embodiments by oil retained in the passages <b>304</b> and <b>306</b> by surface tension, because the passages <b>304</b> and <b>306</b> are sufficiently narrow and the surface tension is sufficiently high. In embodiments in which the surface tension is not sufficiently high and it is desired to orient the assembly with the check valve vertical, skilled persons could readily add an additional passage or alter existing passages to provide an oil head in any direction.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a method of making and using a preferred check valve protection device. The steps can also be performed in a different order from the order shown. In step <b>500</b>, solid body <b>302</b> is provided, with external threads cut in the portion extending from a taper at one end. In step <b>502</b>, first cavity <b>312</b> is cut in solid body <b>302</b> for attaching the check valve. In step <b>504</b>, second cavity <b>314</b> is cut for connecting internal passages to be drilled. In step <b>506</b>, internal threads are cut in the first and second cavities. In step <b>508</b>, passage <b>304</b> is drilled from the second cavity <b>314</b> through the threaded end of body <b>302</b>. In step <b>510</b>, passage <b>306</b> is cut from second cavity <b>314</b> to intersect first cavity <b>312</b>. In step <b>512</b>, plug <b>318</b> is screwed into cavity <b>314</b> sufficiently far to seal the cavity and to reduce the remaining volume of the cavity, but not so far as to impede the flow of lubricant from passage <b>304</b> to <b>306</b>. The method of making the protection device that includes cutting a second cavity and threading a portion of it has the benefit of providing a convenient place to plug in a pressure gauge to monitor the lubrication system pressure at the injection point. In step <b>520</b>, check valve <b>301</b> is screwed into cavity <b>312</b>. In step <b>522</b>, the check valve protection device <b>300</b> with check valve <b>301</b> is screwed into a compressor cylinder. In step <b>524</b>, the check valve is connected to the lubrication source.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The total weight of the combination of check valve <b>301</b> and check valve protection device <b>300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is about 4 oz. In other preferred embodiments, the combination of check valve and check valve protection device weigh less than 10 oz, less than 8 oz, and most preferably less than 5 oz. The light weight reduces the likelihood of failure caused by vibration.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> has a fill capacity of about 0.010 in<sup>3</sup>, which requires less than two cycles of a number 6 (0.006 in) piston in a divider block to deliver lubrication at the injection point. The fill capacity, that is, the volume required to fill the check valve protection device before lubricant is delivered to the compressor, can vary with the embodiment, and will typically depend on the size of the lubrication system. That is, lubrication systems using a larger pump that deliver more lubricant per cycle can have a larger fill capacity for the protection device, without causing an excessive delay of the lubricant injection. A preferred check valve protection device for a typical system has an internal volume of preferably less than 0.12 cubic inches, less than 0.10 cubic inches, less than 0.050, less than 0.030 cubic inches, and more preferably approximately 0.01 cubic inches or less. The preferred fill capacity will vary depending on the size of the lubrication system. A preferred check valve protection device requires less than 15 cycles of the lubricant pressurization device, such as a divider block, to fill the device. A more preferred device requires less than 10 cycles, less than 7 cycles, less than 5 cycles, less than 3 cycles, or less than 2 (all for example, of a No. 6 or other piston) to fill the device and begin delivering fluid to the injection point.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The invention is not limited to any particular arrange of internal passages. A preferred embodiment provides a small fill capacity, regardless of the design of the device, so that the lubricant is delivered rapidly to the lubricated system and the check valve or other device is protected. A preferred protection device works while mounted in any orientation on the compressor. That is, an oil head remain between the compressor and the check valve in any orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8C</figref> show a part of another preferred embodiment of a check valve <b>800</b>. Check valve <b>800</b> includes a ball <b>802</b>, rather than the flat poppet <b>404</b>A or <b>404</b>B of check valve <b>301</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Ball <b>802</b> is preferably made from stainless steel. Ball <b>802</b> is positioned in a tapered passage <b>804</b> and is pressed by a spring <b>806</b> into an o-ring <b>810</b> positioned in a groove <b>812</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the ball <b>802</b> is not seated and valve <b>800</b> is open. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, at low or medium pressure, the ball will seal against the o-ring <b>810</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, at higher pressures, ball <b>802</b> can compress the o-ring <b>810</b> and form a metal-to-metal seal with tapered passage <b>804</b> to provide a back-up sealing surface. A preferred embodiment of a check valve uses two of the assemblies shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A-8C</figref> in series, similar to the double valve concept shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">With an operating pressure rating of about 10,000 PSI and operating temperature rating of about 400&#xb0; F., the check valve and protection device combination of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> combination addresses the need for dependable check valve operation, protection of compressor components, and operator safety. While a check valve having the features shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8C</figref> is preferred, any check valve can be used with the check valve protection device <b>300</b>. Also, a check valve having the improvements shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8C</figref> can be used without a check valve protection device, in less harsh environments. Moreover, the check valve protection device can be used to protect other equipment besides a check valve.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In this embodiment, the o-ring provides the primary sealing surface. If the o-ring should fail, the ball provides a metal-to-metal back-up seal. The metal-to-metal sealing surface reduces or eliminates problems at elevated temperatures or with fluids that would not be compatible with the o-ring elastomer in the double poppet of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">This embodiment provides several additional advantages over prior art check valves. It eliminates the need to machine small poppets and can use commercially available balls and springs. The ball <b>802</b> is easily guided onto the o-ring surface and does not require precise positioning on the o-ring to seal. The o-ring is typically stationary in its seat, and will not expand due to pressure. The o-ring provides a very effective sealing surface for low pressure applications and is forgiving should debris become caught between the ball and the o-ring seal; the ball can crush small debris and continue to seal. If the o-ring loses its sealing ability due to failure caused by temperature, fluid compatibility issues, excessive pressure, or heat, the ball will travel downward compressing the o-ring and contact the metal surface of the seat. This provides a metal-to-metal back-up sealing surface.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The system describes herein provides the compressor industry with a dependable solution to extend the longevity and reliability of divider block system injection check valve. The invention includes more than one novel and inventive aspect, and not all implementations will require all aspects to be combined in each implementation. Although the present invention and its advantages have been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. The invention is not limited to the use of check valves in CNG compressors, but is useful on all systems, such as compressors, and in any environment where contamination or corrosion of equipment, is possible.</p>
