<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A drilling machine includes a feed cable system which operatively couples a rotary head to a tower. The feed cable system includes first and second pull up cables and an equalizer bar, wherein the equalizer bar is coupled to the first and second pull up cables. The equalizer bar drives the rotary head to be held in a level position so that it is restricted from tilting. The drilling machine includes a slack take up device which couples the equalizer bar to the tower. The slack take up device is repeatably moveable between extended and retracted conditions.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/098,783, filed on Sep. 21, 2008 by the same inventors, the contents of which are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates generally to feed cable systems for drilling machines.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are many different types of drilling machines for drilling through a formation. Some of these drilling machines are mobile and others are stationary. Some examples of mobile and stationary drilling machines are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,245,180, 3,692,123, 3,708,024, 3,778,940, 3,815,690, 3,833,072, 3,905,168, 3,968,845, 3,992,831, 4,020,909, 4,170,340, 4,478,291, 4,595,065, 5,988,299, 6,672,410, 6,675,915, 7,325,634, 7,347,285 and 7,413,036, as well as U.S. Patent Application No. 2003056989 and International Application No. PCT/NO96/00310. Some drilling machines, such as the one disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,295,758, are designed to float and are useful for ocean drilling. The contents of these cited U.S. Patents are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A typical mobile drilling machine includes a vehicle and tower, wherein the tower carries a rotary head and drill string. The rotary head is coupled with the tower using a feed cable system, wherein the feed cable system allows the rotary head to move between raised and lowered positions. In operation, the drill string is driven into the formation by the rotary head. In this way, the drilling machine drills through the formation. More information about drilling machines, and how they operate, can be found in the above-identified references.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The feed cable system typically includes two pull up cables which couple the rotary head to the top of the tower. The two pull up cables are separately coupled to the tower, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,413,036 and U.S. Patent Application No. 20030056993, so that the tension in the pull up cables can be different. It is desirable, however, to have the tension in the two pull up cables to be the same so that the rotary head is held level. When the tension in the two pull up cables are different, the rotary head tilts so that it is not held level.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides a drilling machine with a feed cable system. The novel features of the invention are set forth with particularity in the appended claims. The invention will be best understood from the following description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The operation of equalizer bar <b>120</b> and slack take up device <b>110</b> is discussed in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i>, <b>3</b><i>c </i>and <b>3</b><i>d</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>are side views of slack take up device <b>110</b> coupled with equalizer bar <b>120</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>c </i>and <b>3</b><i>d </i>are side views of tower crown <b>102</b><i>b </i>of the tower <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> with rotary head <b>106</b> in the raised position, and slack take up device <b>110</b> in extended and retracted conditions, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As mentioned above, slack take up device <b>110</b> is repeatably moveable between extended and retracted conditions. Slack take up device <b>110</b> operates as an actuator and is repeatably moveable between extended and retracted conditions. In this embodiment, slack take up device <b>110</b> includes cylinder <b>111</b> and piston <b>112</b>. In the extended condition of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, piston <b>112</b> is moved away from cylinder <b>111</b> and, in the retracted condition of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b</i>, piston <b>112</b> is moved towards cylinder <b>111</b>. In the extended condition, equalizer bar <b>120</b> moves away from chord <b>104</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b </i>and <b>3</b><i>c</i>) and, in the retracted condition, equalizer bar <b>120</b> moves towards chord <b>104</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b </i>and <b>3</b><i>d</i>). In this way, equalizer bar <b>120</b> is repeatably moveable between positions towards and away from chord <b>104</b><i>a </i>in response to actuating slack take up device.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As mentioned above, chord <b>104</b><i>a </i>is positioned away from table <b>119</b>. Hence, in the extended condition, equalizer bar <b>120</b> moves towards table <b>119</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b </i>and <b>3</b><i>c</i>) and, in the retracted condition, equalizer bar <b>120</b> away from table <b>119</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b </i>and <b>3</b><i>d</i>). In this way, equalizer bar <b>120</b> is repeatably moveable between positions towards and away from table <b>119</b> in response to actuating slack take up device.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In operation, equalizer bar <b>120</b> drives the tension of pull up cables <b>132</b><i>a </i>and <b>132</b><i>b </i>to equal each other. For example, a reference line <b>125</b> extends through slack take up device <b>110</b> and reference lines <b>126</b> and <b>127</b> extend through equalizer bar <b>120</b> along pull up cables <b>132</b><i>a </i>and <b>132</b><i>b</i>, respectively. Hence, slack take up device <b>110</b> experiences an upwardly directed force F<sub>1 </sub>and pull up cables <b>132</b><i>a </i>and <b>132</b><i>b </i>experience upwardly directed forces opposed to F<sub>2 </sub>and F<sub>3</sub>, respectively. It should be noted that force F<sub>1 </sub>is equal to the sum of forces F<sub>2 </sub>and F<sub>3</sub>. Force F<sub>1 </sub>is applied to slack take up device <b>110</b> because slack take up device <b>110</b> is coupled with tower crown, as discussed in more detail above. Forces F<sub>2 </sub>and F<sub>3 </sub>are applied to pull up cables <b>132</b><i>a </i>and <b>132</b><i>b</i>, respectively, because pull up cables <b>132</b><i>a </i>and <b>132</b><i>b </i>are coupled with rotary head <b>106</b>. Further, forces F<sub>2 </sub>and F<sub>3 </sub>are applied to equalizer bar <b>120</b> because pull up cables <b>132</b><i>a </i>and <b>132</b><i>b </i>are coupled with equalizer bar <b>120</b>. In this way, the tension (i.e. forces F<sub>2 </sub>and F<sub>3</sub>) of pull up cables <b>132</b><i>a </i>and <b>132</b><i>b </i>is applied to slack take up device <b>110</b> through equalizer bar <b>120</b>. Hence, equalizer bar <b>120</b> is coupled to rotary head <b>106</b> through a pulley system which includes pulleys <b>133</b><i>a</i>, <b>133</b><i>b</i>, <b>133</b><i>c </i>and <b>133</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">It is desirable to have reference line <b>125</b> positioned between reference lines <b>126</b> and <b>127</b>. In particular, it is desirable to have reference line positioned halfway between reference lines <b>126</b> and <b>127</b>. In this way, forces F<sub>2 </sub>and F<sub>3 </sub>are driven to equal each other, and equalizer bar <b>120</b> is driven to remain level. It is desirable to have equalizer bar <b>120</b> remain level in response to pull up cables <b>132</b><i>a </i>and <b>132</b><i>b </i>raising and lowering rotary head <b>106</b>. It should be noted that equalizer bar <b>120</b> will tilt in response to forces F<sub>2 </sub>and F<sub>3 </sub>being unequal to each other. In this way, feed cable system <b>130</b> includes an equalizer bar which drives the tension of first and second pull up cables to equal each other in response to first and second pull up cables raising and lowering a rotary head.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Hence, equalizer bar <b>120</b> drives the difference in the tension of pull up cables <b>132</b><i>a </i>and <b>132</b><i>b </i>to zero. Further, equalizer bar <b>120</b> drives the difference in the tension (i.e. the difference between forces F<sub>2 </sub>and F<sub>3</sub>) of pull up cables <b>132</b><i>a </i>and <b>132</b><i>b </i>to zero in response to rotary head <b>106</b> moving along tower <b>102</b>. Equalizer bar <b>120</b> drives the tension of pull up cables <b>132</b><i>a </i>and <b>132</b><i>b </i>to equal each other (i.e. forces F<sub>2 </sub>and F<sub>3 </sub>are drive to equal each other).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In operation, equalizer bar <b>120</b> increases and decreases the tension of pull up cable <b>132</b><i>a </i>in response to the tension of pull up cable <b>132</b><i>b </i>increasing and decreasing, respectively.

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Rotary head <b>106</b> can be moved along tower <b>102</b> in many different ways, such as that disclosed in U.S. Patent Application No. 20030056993, wherein pulleys <b>133</b><i>c </i>and <b>135</b><i>a </i>are coupled together with a pulley support member that is moveable along tower <b>102</b>.
