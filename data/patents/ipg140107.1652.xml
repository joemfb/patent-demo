<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A gaming system compatible with patron-controlled portable electronic devices, such as smart phones or tablet computers, is described. The gaming system is configured to detect the presence of portable electronic devices and to determine whether to initiate a wireless communication session with the portable electronic device based on the strength of the signal received from the portable electronic device. If the signal strength exceeds a minimal threshold level, thereby indicating the portable electronic device is near a gaming device, a wireless communication session can be initiated. The signal strength transmitted from the portable electronic device can be monitored during a game play session to determine whether the wireless communication session should remain active or be terminated.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Described Embodiments</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The described embodiments relate generally to gaming systems, such as gaming systems deployed in a casino enterprise. More particularly, apparatus and method for determining wireless connections of portable electronic devices to electronic gaming machines are described.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Developing and maintaining a loyal customer base is a critical component of operating a successful casino enterprise. To develop a loyal customer base, casino enterprises attempt to generate interactions with their patrons that provide a unique and personalized game playing experience. As an example, casino enterprises offer patrons the opportunity to participate in a loyalty program. Via the loyalty program, patrons are offered various promotions and free items that encourage the patron to return to the casino.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the loyalty program, the promotions can be tailored to a particular patron's preferences. As an example, if preferred, a patron can choose to receive promotional credits for game play on an electronic gaming machine (EGM) and information regarding this preference can be stored to an account associated with the loyalty program. In general, information regarding the patron's preferences for promotions as well as other activities within the casino enterprise, such as food, drink and room preferences, can be stored to the patron's account associated with the loyalty program. The patron information stored in the account can be used to personalize the service and the game playing experience provided by the casino enterprise.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An ever increasing portion of patrons who visit casinos are regularly carrying portable electronic devices, such as smart phones, laptops, netbooks and tablet computers capable of wireless communications, on their person. The portable electronic devices provide 1) a means of communication allowing the patron to communicate with other individuals within or outside of a casino via a number of different communication modes, 2) a source of news and information, 3) a portal to the patron's on-line activities, such as social media applications, 4) support for entertainment features, such as audio/video playback and gaming applications, 5) a repository for personal information, such as financial information that enables financial transactions in mobile wallet applications and 6) a means of capturing information, such as video images and audio recordings. Thus, portable electronic devices, such as smart phones, are becoming essential tools and, in some instances, the primary electronic interface for many individuals.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The popularity of portable electronic devices allows for the possibility of utilizing their capabilities to further personalize and enhance the gaming experience in a casino gaming environment. In view of the above, methods and apparatus are desired that allow for complementary interactions with a portable electronic devices within a casino environment, such as when a patron is participating in game play on an electronic gaming machine or when a patron is in the vicinity of an electronic gaming machine.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DESCRIBED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A gaming system compatible with patron-controlled portable electronic devices, such as smart phones, laptops, netbooks and tablet computers, is described. The gaming system can include gaming devices, such as electronic gaming machines and system servers. The gaming system can be configured to establish or end active communication sessions with the portable electronic devices, depending on the strength of the wireless signal received from the portable electronic device. After the strength of the wireless signal of the portable electronic device in a wager-based gaming environment, such as a casino, is determined, the system can be configured to initiate an active wireless communication session between the portable electronic device and one or more nearby electronic gaming machines.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to one aspect, a method in a gaming system including a server, processor, memory and a network interface is described. Detection information indicating a presence of a portable electronic device in a gaming environment is received via the network interface. The detection information includes wireless signal data transmitted from the portable electronic device. A signal strength from the wireless signal data is determined before determining whether the signal strength exceeds a predetermined threshold level. When it is determined the signal strength exceeds the predetermined threshold level, a wireless connection with the portable electronic device is initiated.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to another aspect, a method in a gaming system including a server, processor, memory and a network interface is described. A presence of a portable electronic device in a gaming environment is detected via the network interface. An available gaming device is determined and a wireless signal data transmitted by the portable electronic device is received at the gaming device.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIBED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the following paper, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the concepts underlying the described embodiments. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the described embodiments may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process steps have not been described in detail in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the underlying concepts.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A gaming system compatible with portable electronic devices controlled by users of the gaming system is described. The gaming system can include a number of features that determine whether to wirelessly connect or disconnect portable electronic devices, such as, for example, smart phones, laptops, netbooks and tablet computers, to an EGM in a casino gaming environment. In particular embodiments, connection to a nearby portable electronic device can be triggered on EGMs based upon the detection of such a nearby portable electronic device and the wireless signal strength from the portable electronic device. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, interactions involving wireless communications and details of a wireless infrastructure for supporting these communications are shown.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, two banks of EGMs are shown. Ten EGMs, <b>10</b><i>a</i>-<b>10</b><i>f</i>, are in the first bank and ten EGMs, <b>12</b><i>a</i>-<b>12</b><i>f</i>, are in the second bank. The EGMs can be in wireless or wired communication with one or more remote servers, such as server <b>14</b> or server <b>15</b>. A number of patrons can be located proximate to the EGMs where some of the patrons near the EGMs can be engaging in a game play session. For instance, patron <b>20</b> is located near EGM <b>10</b><i>d </i>and can be engaging in a game play session on the EGM <b>10</b><i>d </i>and patron <b>24</b> is located near EGM <b>10</b><i>d </i>and can be engaging in a game play session on EGM <b>12</b><i>j</i>. Other patrons, such as <b>22</b>, can be walking or standing near the EGMs but not currently engaged in game play. The patrons not engaged in game play, like patrons engaged in game play, can be carrying portable electronic devices, such as a smart phone, a netbook or a tablet computer. For instance, patron <b>22</b> is carrying a portable electronic device <b>16</b>. Patrons who are engaged in game play can also be carrying a portable electronic device <b>17</b>. For example, patron <b>20</b> carrying portable electronic device <b>17</b> can already be engaged in game play.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a casino, more than one portable electronic device <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> may be in proximity to an EGM, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. In a busy casino, numerous such portable devices <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> may be in proximity to the EGM. In such cases, the EGM can use wireless signal strength of a particular portable device <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> to determine whether to connect to or disconnect from that particular portable device. Generally, the stronger the wireless signal strength of a particular portable device, the closer the device is to the EGM and the more likely the owner of the device is to engage or already be engaged in game play at the EGM.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">For example, a player of an EGM is a person <b>20</b> typically sitting in front of the EGM <b>10</b><i>d </i>and the player's portable electronic device <b>17</b> is the one that should be wirelessly connected with the EGM <b>10</b><i>d </i>as opposed to the portable device <b>16</b> belonging to a person, who is not engaged in a game play session, sitting at a bar near the EGM or walking near the EGM, such as patrons <b>22</b>, <b>25</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. As the person <b>20</b> sitting directly in front of the EGM <b>10</b><i>d </i>is closer to the EGM <b>10</b><i>d </i>and has a portable device <b>17</b> with a stronger signal than the device <b>16</b> of the patrons <b>22</b>, <b>25</b> not walking in the aisle, the EGM <b>10</b><i>d </i>can use this logic to infer that the portable device <b>17</b> with the stronger signal belongs to the player and that the portable device <b>17</b> is the one that should be wirelessly connected to the EGM <b>10</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a typical casino, there are many EGMs in close proximity to one another, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. If several of the EGMs in a particular location are being played by people with such portable devices <b>17</b>, each EGM will detect several potential players, as the EGMs will detect wireless signals from more than one portable device <b>17</b>. The EGM may also detect wireless signals from portable devices <b>16</b> belonging to people not engaged in a game play session. The system or the EGM itself can determine that the weaker signals belong to portable devices that are further away and the stronger signals are closer to a particular EGM. As discussed in more detail below, the EGM can have a configured threshold that it uses to determine which of the strongest signals to consider for connection, and can determine whether to allow the weaker signals to connect.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">For example, if an EGM detects a new signal from a portable electronic device <b>16</b> and the signal from the device becomes stronger over time, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, then the EGM can make a wireless connection with that portable device <b>16</b> by pairing the device <b>16</b> with the EGM when the signal strength from the portable device exceeds a threshold level. If the signal from the portable device <b>16</b> becomes stronger, the EGM can infer that the portable device <b>16</b> is approaching the EGM and the owner of the portable <b>16</b> device may decide to play the EGM.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to an embodiment, the EGM may initiate a wireless connection with the portable electronic device <b>16</b> if the EGM detects that the strength of the wireless signal from the device has leveled off after becoming stronger, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. The leveling off of the signal strength can indicate that the patron is no longer moving and is getting ready to engage in or already engaged in an active game play session at the EGM. In one embodiment, the EGM can initiate the wireless connection if it detects that the signal strength has leveled off for at least five seconds, or at least 10 seconds, or at least 30 seconds, which can indicate that the patron has stopped in front of an EGM with the intention to begin a game play session.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Bluetooth&#x2122; and Wi-Fi&#x2122; can be used to wirelessly pair a portable device with an EGM. Near field communication (NFC) pairing can also be used to wirelessly connect an EGM with a portable device for facilitating transactions, data exchange, and other wireless communications between the two devices when they are in close proximity to each other, usually about a few centimeters. NFC chips embedded in a portable electronic device can be used to store information, such as credit card data, belonging to the owner of the portable electronic device. When the patron waves or holds his or her portable electronic device near the EGM, or the portable electronic device is simply near the EGM, the portable electronic device can send such information to the EGM so that the EGM can identify the patron.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Once the portable device is paired to the EGM, payment information, such as an electronic voucher or electronic fund transfer, can be provided to the EGM to start a game play session. Player loyalty points can also be tracked without the need for insertion of a player loyalty card into the EGM. Thus, a game play session can be started quickly and conveniently, as the patron with the paired portable electronic device only needs to be within a predetermined range of the EGM. As noted above, once the portable electronic device is paired with the EGM, there is no need for another form of payment so neither cash nor a paper payment voucher needs to be inserted into the EGM. If the patron also has a player loyalty account with the casino, loyalty tracking will take place without insertion of a separate player loyalty card. Thus, with the pairing, the patron will not mistakenly leave a credit card and/or loyalty card in an EGM after he or she has left the EGM.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As will be explained in more detail below, the wireless connection between the portable electronic device and the EGM can be terminated when the system determines that the signal strength has fallen below a predetermined threshold level. A weakening signal strength can indicate that the portable electronic device is moving away (along with the patron) from the EGM, and that the patron has finished his or her game play session on the EGM.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">However, in some cases, a weakened signal does not necessarily mean that the patron has walked away or intends to end the game play session. For example, in some cases, if a signal strength weakens but the EGM is continues to be engaged in an active game play session, the weak signal strength can indicate a bad pairing of the devices. If the system detects a bad pairing, a new wireless communication link between the EGM and the portable electronic device can be established. In other cases, the signal strength may become weaker but smooths out as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, indicating that the patron had either moved a bit farther from the EGM or the pairing of the devices is faulty. If the EGM has continued to be engaged in an active game play session during this time, then the system can infer that the pairing is faulty or that the player has moved a bit farther from the EGM, and the system or the EGM itself can attempt to initiate a new wireless communication link between the EGM and the portable electronic device. If the EGM is no longer engaged in an active game play session, then the system can infer that the patron has left that EGM. In some cases, the patron might move to the next EGM to start a new game play session. In such cases, the system can check with adjacent EGMs to determine whether that patron is interested in starting a new game play session on another EGM. If so, then the system can initiate a new wireless communication link between a new EGM and the portable electronic device, and terminate the wireless communication link between the previous EGM and the portable electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The pairing of the portable electronic device to an EGM can also provide the system with information including details about the patron, including the patron's preferences and playing history. The pairing can also allow the system to track the patron's activity. Such tracking can enable the system to make offers directly to the patron's portable electronic device via the wireless connection. For instance, the casino might offer the patron a free drink.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to an embodiment, the EGM can make a wireless connection by pairing with a portable electronic device <b>16</b> if the strength of the wireless signal from the portable device <b>16</b> exceeds a predetermined threshold level. In one embodiment, the predetermined threshold level can be a predetermined distance between the portable device and the EGM. As noted above, position data for a portable electronic device can be determined. The system or the EGM can approximate the distance based on the signal strength. In another embodiment. The predetermined threshold level can be simply the signal strength itself. Once the EGM and the portable device are paired, the EGM can continue to monitor or track the signal from that portable device.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">While the portable electronic device and the EGM are wirelessly paired, the patron may decide to participate in a group game at, for example, adjacent EGMs. As is described in more detail below a linked gaming function <b>644</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) can be used to provide game play activities involving a player participating as a group via multiple EGMs. Thus, the patron's portable device can be paired with multiple EGMs. Alternatively, a game on an EGM can involve more than one player and that EGM therefore can be paired to two different portable electronic devices.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">If the signal strength becomes weaker and falls below the predetermined threshold level, the system or the EGM itself may end the wireless connection by disconnecting the EGM from the portable device. A weaker signal strength can indicate increased distance between the EGM and the portable device. A patron who intends to end his or her game play session at an EGM may simply walk away from the EGM without cashing out. Thus, the system can infer that when the signal strength from the patron's portable device falls below the predetermined threshold level, the patron has walked away from the EGM because he or she is finished with the game play session on that EGM.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to an embodiment, the wireless connection can be terminated only after a predetermined period of time, such as ten seconds or thirty seconds or any other predetermined period of time. Terminating the wireless connection after a period of time, as opposed to immediately terminating when the signal strength falls below the threshold level, allows the connection to remain active for patrons who simply walk away from the EGM and return to the game play session at the EGM without the intention of ending the game play session. For example, the patron may walk away to talk to a friend or to buy a drink. The EGM may also end the wireless connection if the patron cashes out from the EGM.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a casino environment where hundreds of gaming machines can be located in close proximity to one another, loud noises and bright lights emanating from multiple EGMs simultaneously in the same area can sometimes be annoying and disruptive to patrons. Thus, when a wireless communication session has ended between an EGM and a portable electronic device, that EGM can switch to a power saving mode with dimmer lights and sounds having lower volume.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to an embodiment, the pairing between a portable electronic device and an EGM is initiated only after the owner of the portable electronic device confirms that he or she wants to establish a wireless connection with the EGM. As described in more detail below, a Quick Response (QR) code can pop up on a display of the EGM and the patron can use his or her portable electronic device to confirm. Alternatively, the QR code can pop up on the display of the portable electronic device and the patron can hold the QR code on the display up to a QR code reader of the EGM. In this embodiment, the EGM can send a signal or message to the owner of the portable electronic device asking whether the owner desires to establish a wireless connection with the EGM. The owner of the portable electronic device can then either confirm or cancel using the portable electronic device or by pushing a electro-mechanical input button or using a touch sensitive surface on the input panel <b>712</b> or touch sensitive display <b>710</b> on the EGM <b>700</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Even if the owner of the portable device <b>16</b> has not yet decided to play a particular EGM, the EGM can send an attract signal to the device <b>16</b> if it detects that the signal from the portable device <b>16</b> is becoming stronger and the signal exceeds the predetermined threshold level. As discussed in more detail below, an EGM can implement an attract feature to attract a potential player to the EGM and encourage him or her to begin a play session on that EGM or on multiple EGMs for a group game. Attract features are described in detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/220,430, filed on Aug. 29, 2011 and entitled &#x201c;ATTRACT BASED ON MOBILE DEVICE,&#x201d; the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein for all purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, the system can also monitor the portable electronic device to encourage responsible gaming. For example, if the system or the EGM itself detects that a portable electronic device has been at an EGM for too long and the EGM has been engaged in an active game play session during that period of time, the EGM can end the game play session. In some embodiments, the EGM can send a message to the patron, either via a message on the EGM's display or a message to the patron's portable electronic device, reminding the patron of responsible gaming.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Next, with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a method <b>100</b> of determining whether to establish a wireless communication session between a portable electronic device and an EGM is described. As described above, one or more of the steps in the method can also be performed by an application executing on an EGM or on a portable electronic device. In <b>102</b>, the presence of a portable electronic device can be detected. As an example, the presence of the portable electronic device can be detected in a gaming environment, such as a casino, based upon passive monitoring of wireless signals transmitted from the portable electronic device. As another example, the presence of the portable electronic device can be detected when an active communication session is initiated between the portable electronic device and one or more gaming devices in the gaming system, such as a system server or an EGM.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In <b>104</b>, a wireless signal strength received from the portable electronic device can be determined. The determination can be made by either an EGM or a system server. The strength of the wireless signal can be used by the system to estimate the position of the portable electronic device. Position data for a portable electronic device can also be determined over time. The position data can be used to determine estimate a velocity for the device and possible predict a future position of the device. In one embodiment, a system server or an EGM can be configured to receive accelerometer data from the portable electronic device. The accelerometer data can be used to determine the velocity of the device and estimate its future position.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In <b>106</b>, a determination can be made as to whether the portable electronic device is already engaged in an active wireless communication session with an EGM in the system with a patron engaged in game play. If the system recognizes the portable electronic device as one that is already engaged in an active wireless communication session with an EGM in the system, the system or the EGM itself will monitor the portable electronic device in <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">If the system determines that the portable electronic device is not already engaged in an active wireless communication session with an EGM, in <b>108</b>, a determination can be made as to whether to initiate a wireless communication session between the portable electronic device and the nearest EGM that is not already engaged in an active game play session. In some embodiments, the nearest EGM might already be engaged in an active game play session, but if the game is a group game in which multiple players can participate, that EGM can still be available for wireless pairing with another portable electronic device. In some embodiments, the determination can be based upon information, such as whether the device has been actively moving over some time period and whether any nearby EGMs are reporting any gaming activity. If an EGM that is not engaged in a game play session detects a wireless signal from a portable device becoming stronger, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, and exceeds a predetermined threshold level, a wireless communication session may be initiated between the EGM and the portable device in <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Once the wireless communication session is activated, the system will continue to monitor the signal strength that the EGM receives from the portable device in <b>112</b>. If the system detects the signal strength becoming weaker, indicating that the patron is moving away from the EGM, the system can terminate the wireless communication session, in <b>114</b>, if the signal strength falls below a predetermined threshold level.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Directional Antenna</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, an omni-directional antenna in an EGM communicates wirelessly in a sphere around the EGM. As an example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, when four EGMs with four players are in close proximity, each EGM can connect with the portable electronic device belonging to each player.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A directional antenna, as opposed to an omni-directional antenna, in the EGM allows the EGM to wirelessly connect to portable electronic devices that are in front of the EGM, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>. For example, the EGM's detection of portable electronic devices can be limited to a field of vision that is, for example, 120&#xb0; or 180&#xb0; in front of the EGM. The field of vision of the directional antenna can be adjusted. A directional antenna in the EGM can be used to correctly differentiate between a player at the EGM and another player at an EGM in close proximity.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments in which the EGM has a directional antenna, the portable electronic device may not be paired to the nearest available EGM if the portable electronic device is not in front of the EGM. Thus, for example, if a patron with a portable electronic device is standing to the side of or behind an EGM, the EGM will not attempt to initiate a wireless communication session with that portable electronic device. The directional antenna can be used to narrow in on the person directly in front of the EGM and eliminate others sitting next to the EGM, and can be used in conjunction with signal strength and other methods, such as for example NFC or QR codes, in determining with which portable device the EGM should be wirelessly paired.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In an embodiment, an EGM can have both an omni-directional antenna and a directional antennal. The omni-directional antenna can be provided in an EGM in order to generate an attract feature and the directional antenna can be provided in the EGM for directional pairing of the EGM and a portable electronic device. The omni-directional antenna allows the EGM to send attract features to patrons in the vicinity of the EGM, whether in front of or behind or to the side of the EGM. As noted above, the directional antenna can be used to correctly differentiate between a potential player and another person who happens to be near the EGM and is not interested in playing.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Wireless Architecture</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The determination of whether to connect or disconnect from a wireless mobile device involves the utilization of a wireless architecture. Thus, some details of a wireless architecture are described for the purpose of illustration. The EGMs and the servers can be configured to communicate via wireless communications with portable electronic devices. On the EGM, in one embodiment, wireless communications can be controlled by a game controller on the EGM. In other embodiments, a secondary controller on the EGM, such as a secondary controller in a player tracking unit, a card reader, a bill validator or a printer, can be used to control wireless communications as well as an attract feature involving a portable electronic device independently of the game controller. For example, a player tracking unit can include its own touch screen video display, audio device and wireless communication capabilities that allow it to pair with a portable electronic device and to implement an attract feature independently of the game controller.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In yet other embodiments, two or more different controllers can be used to implement wireless communications, including an attract feature, involving a portable electronic device. In one embodiment, a first controller, such as a player tracking controller, can handle wireless communications with the portable electronic device. The player tracking controller can forward the communications to a second controller, such as the game controller. In response, the game controller can wirelessly pair with a portable electronic device and/or implement an attract feature on the EGM and possibly communicate with the portable electronic device via the player tracking unit.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The wireless communications can be used to implement for various functions, including payment, player loyalty, and implementing attract features involving one or more EGMs and/or portable electronic devices. To enable wireless communications, all or a portion of the EGMs can each include one or more wireless transceivers. The EGMs can be configured to communicate using the wireless transceivers in a number of different communication protocols depending on the capabilities of the portable electronic device. For instance, communications protocols, such as Bluetooth&#x2122;, Wi-Fi&#x2122; and Near-Field Communication (NFC) can be implemented on the EGMs. Further details of the capabilities of the EGMs are described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">When implemented, devices implementing the protocols can have different communication ranges. For instance, a class 2 Bluetooth&#x2122; device has a range of about 10 meters or less while a low power class 3 Bluetooth&#x2122; device has a range of about 5 meters or less. NFC enabled devices can have a range of about 4 cm or less. Indoors, depending on the obstructions and the version of Wi-Fi that is implemented, the range of a Wi-Fi enabled device can be up to about 50 meters. A cellular communication range can be up to a few kilometers. The portable electronic devices described herein can be enabled to simultaneously implement multiple wireless communication protocols. Devices, such as EGMs, can be configured to detect and interpret wireless signals formatted in different protocols. As will be discussed in more detail below, the different ranges associated with each protocol can be used, at a first pass, to determine the approximate location of a wirelessly transmitting portable electronic device relative to a receiving device, such as an EGM.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In various embodiments, methods, such as triangulation, signal strength determination and signal analysis can be used to determine an approximate location of portable electronic device within a casino including relative distance of a portable electronic device to other devices within the casino, such as an EGM. A location determination can be performed by a server, such as <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> and/or an EGM to determine the locations of nearby portable electronic devices. Further, portable electronic devices can be provided with an application that allows it to determine its relative indoor position, such as a position within a casino. The application may utilize information furnished by a casino, such as a floor plan, and the location of wireless signal sources within the casino to determine its relative position within an indoor environment, such as a casino.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A number of wireless access points (not shown) can be provided in the area proximate to the banks of EGMs. As described in the previous paragraph, location information associated with the wireless access points can be provided to portable electronic device used within the casino. In one embodiment, via the wireless access points, a portable electronic device, such as <b>16</b>, can communicate with a server, such as <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>. In another embodiment, a portable electronic device may be able to communicate with a server, such as <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>, through an intermediary device, for example via an EGM. Besides being used for portable device communication, via the wireless access points, an EGM, such as <b>10</b><i>a</i>, may also be to communicate with servers, such as <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In particular embodiments, a plurality of receivers can be located within the casino environment for receiving wireless communication signals, such as, for example, 1) the signals that cellular capable devices broadcast to cell phone towers, 2) the signals Wi-Fi&#x2122; enabled devices broadcast and 3) the signals Bluetooth&#x2122; enabled devices broadcast. In general, wireless signals can be formatted according to many different types of communication protocols. Thus, different receivers configured to receive one or more different types of wireless signals and associated devices that process the wireless signals according to an associated wireless communication protocol can be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In particular embodiments, wireless receivers of different types, i.e., configured to receive wireless signals in one or more different portions of the wireless spectrum can be incorporated into an EGM. A wireless receiver can be a separate component provided with the EGM or can be built in a device provided with the EGM, such as but not limited to a card reader, bill validator, a player tracking unit or a printer. In some instances, an EGM can include multiple wireless receivers. The data received from the various wireless receivers can be used in a method used to determine the location of a portable electronic device, such as a method involving signal triangulation.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As an example, the cellular data signals can be processed according to a cellular communication protocol, such as GSM or CDMA, to learn information about the device that is broadcasting the information, such as information that allows the cellular enabled device to be identified as a unique node in a cellular network. In one embodiment, one or more of the EGMs can include this capability, i.e., the ability to receive and process cellular data signals in a GSM or a CDMA format. Again, this information can also be utilized for device location and tracking purposes. Further, the information can be used for patron identification purposes if the player has registered unique device information, such as a phone number, with the casino enterprise.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some instances, a single device can be configured to broadcast multiple wireless communication protocols simultaneously. According to such an embodiment, a wireless device tracking system can be configured to detect a single device in different wireless spectrums simultaneously and perform location estimations, such as triangulation, based on the signals broadcast in the different wireless spectrums. For instance, a single portable electronic device, such as a smart phone, can be configured to broadcast wireless signals in a cellular portion of the wireless spectrum and a Wi-Fi&#x2122; portion of the spectrum simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A wireless device tracking system can be configured to determine two estimates of its location using each of the two different types of wireless signals that have been received. In one embodiment, the system can be configured to determine which of the two different location estimates is more accurate and select the one determined more accurate for use. In another embodiment, the system can be configured to determine a single location estimate based upon each of the two location estimates. For instance, the two location estimates can be averaged together to provide the single location estimate.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Wireless Signal Detection</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In one embodiment, wireless receivers separate from the EGMs can be distributed throughout a casino enterprise and can be used to detect the presence of portable electronic devices, such as <b>16</b> or <b>17</b>, via their transmitted cellular signals or other types of transmitted radio signals. The wireless receivers can report their signal information to a server, such as <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>. Based upon the information interpreted from the received wireless signals, an approximate position of the portable electronic device <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> within the casino enterprise can be determined, such as a location on a casino floor. In particular, the position of portable electronic devices <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> relative to particular EGMs can be estimated. In other words, the approximate distance between a particular portable electronic device <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> and an EGM can be estimated. Over time, this process can be repeated, i.e., the wireless signal environment can be regularly sampled, such that a location history versus time for various portable electronic devices <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> can be determined.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Based upon this positional information determined for the portable electronic devices, a system server can be configured to determine whether to initiate a wireless connection between one or more of the portable devices and one or more EGMs. In another embodiment, an EGM can be configured to utilize the positional information to initiate a wireless connection with a portable electronic device. In yet other embodiments, an EGM acting alone or in conjunction with other EGMs via peer-to-peer communications can be configured to detect a nearby portable electronic device and initiate a wireless connection with the portable electronic device independently of a system server. It will be understood that the devices described above can also trigger an attract feature in addition to initiating a wireless connection between devices.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As described above, the portable electronic device can be recognized as belonging to a particular patron. For instance, a patron that is a member of a loyalty program may have registered unique identification information about the device, such as a MAC address and/or a phone number, to a loyalty account with the casino enterprise. The loyalty account can store preference information about the patron, such as preferred activities and promotions. The system, which can include servers <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> and the EGMs, can be configured to determine whether a portable electronic device is associated with a particular patron and if so determine whether any preference information is known about the particular patron, such as preference information stored in the patron's loyalty account. If preference information is known, then this information can be used to initiate a wireless connection with the portable electronic device belonging to that patron and/or to generate an attract feature for the patron based upon his or her preferences, such as preferred game types, preferred game denominations, particular games within a game type (e.g., a particular game generated on a video slot machine or a particular game generated on a reel slot machine) or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some instances, the portable electronic device may not be recognized as belonging to a patron associated with a loyalty program. Nevertheless, the system can be configured to track the portable electronic device and store information about activities that have taken place near the portable electronic device when it has been detected at a particular location. For instance, if a portable electronic device is determined to be located near an EGM for a period of time during which game play occurred, and the game play is associated with an anonymous or unidentified patron, the system can be configured to associate the game play activity to the portable electronic device as a proxy for the unidentified patron. Thus, when a portable electronic device is detected and it is determined not to be associated with a patron registered with a loyalty program, the system can be configured to store information about activities that have been associated with the identified portable electronic device. This information can be used to determine whether to initiate a wireless connection or to trigger an attract feature or not and can possibly affect the content of an attract feature.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As part of the determination of whether to initiate a wireless connection, by, for example, triggering an attract feature, in response to detecting the electronic device, the system can be configured to determine whether the portable electronic device is associated with a patron, such as <b>22</b>, currently not engaged in a gaming activity. In one embodiment, the system can use location history information of the portable electronic device to make this determination. For instance, if a position of the portable electronic device has been changing by some amount over some time period then the system may determine that the patron carrying the device is not engaged in a gaming activity, as the patron may be walking around the casino. This determination can involve comparing the rate of change of movement to the portable electronic device to a threshold value.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As part of the determination, the system can be configured to query a status of EGMs or other gaming devices near the patron, such as EGMs, <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b</i>, <b>10</b><i>c</i>, <b>12</b><i>f</i>, <b>12</b><i>g </i>and <b>12</b><i>h</i>. When all or a portion of these devices are reporting an idle status, then the system can determine that the patron is not engaged in a gaming activity since no gaming activity is occurring in the vicinity of the detected portable electronic device. Thus, in one embodiment, based upon information received within the gaming system, such as nearby EGM status and portable device positional information, the system can be configured to determine whether the portable electronic device and hence the patron carrying the portable electronic device is a candidate to receive an attract feature or to otherwise initiate a wireless connection with the portable electronic device. In another embodiment, the system can be configured to trigger an attract feature or to otherwise initiate a wireless connection independently of the movement history of the portable electronic device and/or the status of nearby gaming devices.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In another embodiment, the system can be configured to communicate with an application executing on the portable electronic device, the application can be configured to report accelerometer data and/or positional data of the portable electronic device to the system. Such data can be used to determine whether the device is moving or not and hence can indicate whether the patron is engaged in gaming activity. If the portable electronic device is moving, then the system can presume that the patron is not engaged in gaming activity. Even if it the system detects that the portable electronic device is not moving, it is necessarily engaged in gaming activity. In such cases, the system can check the EGM nearest the portable electronic device to determine if the EGM has an active game play session.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In yet another embodiment, based upon accelerometer data measured by the portable electronic device and wireless data broadcast from devices in the system that are received by the portable electronic device, an application on the portable electronic device can be configured to determine its relative position within a casino. The portable electronic device can be configured to report this position to the system, such as to servers <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>. The patron can be enticed to allow their device to send this information to the system with the possibility of receiving promotions.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In yet another embodiment, an application running on a portable electronic device, such as <b>16</b> or <b>17</b>, can be configured with user selectable parameters indicating preferences of the user, such as a game type (i.e., mechanical or video slot) and a particular game (i.e., a particular game or a game denomination). This information can be broadcast by the portable electronic device and received by system devices, such as a server <b>15</b> or an EGM <b>10</b><i>a</i>. Based upon these settings, a system server or an EGM may only establish a wireless communication session when an EGM is nearby that meets the selected criteria. For instance, if the patron has selected parameter(s) in the application that indicates his or her interest in large jackpot progressive games (i.e., jackpots above a threshold value of one million dollars or more), then a wireless communication link will only be established with an idle EGM nearby that provides this type of game play. As another example, if the patron has selected parameters in that application that indicates their interest in games of only a dollar denomination then a wireless communication session may not be established with EGMs that do not meet these criteria. As described above, this information can also be stored to the patron's loyalty account. However, using an application executing on the patron's portable electronic device can allow for patrons not registered in a loyalty program to express preferences that can affect whether a wireless communication link is established with that patron's device.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In other embodiments, an application on a patron's portable electronic device <b>16</b> can be configured to instruct a system server or an EGM to use game play history information stored on the portable electronic device or within the gaming system to specify parameters that affect the initiation of wireless connection. In particular, the application executing on the patron's portable electronic device can include a user selectable parameter that instructs an EGM or a system server to initiate a wireless connection based upon their game play history. As an example, a patron can select a parameter that instructs the system to initiate a wireless connection even if the patron is outside the normal range for connection. For example, if the normal range of the system for connection is 10 yards and if the patron's game play history information indicates that the patron likes a particular type of game and there is an EGM with such a game within 20 yards of the patron, the system can be configured to initiate a wireless connection with the portable electronic device <b>16</b> belonging to that patron even though the patron is outside the normal connection range. If the patron's device includes information about the patron's game play history, this information can be uploaded to the system and used in conjunction with user selectable parameters about the game play history to determine whether to initiate a wireless connection and/or to trigger an attract feature.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">When the patron <b>22</b> approaches one of the EGMs and is within a predetermined range, a wireless communication link can be established between one of the EGMs and the patron's portable electronic device. In one embodiment, the predetermined range is a radius of about 10 yards around the EGM. In another embodiment, the predetermined range can be a radius of about 15 yards around the EGM. The system can be configured to set different predetermined ranges for particular EGMs and/or portable devices. The different predetermined ranges can be based on criteria, such as, for example, a patron's preferences, game play history of the portable electronic device, game play history of the EGM, an application on the patron's portable electronic device, as well as casino default ranges. Once the wireless communication link is established between the EGM and portable electronic device, a game play session can begin. In another embodiment, an attract feature, such as an offer, can be sent to the portable electronic device to encourage the patron to begin a game play session. The attract feature can be sent to the portable electronic device by either a server or the EGM itself.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">If a nearby EGM as already occupied by a patron engaged in an active game play session, the system will not establish a new wireless communication link between that EGM and a portable electronic device <b>17</b> belonging to another patron nearby. The system can also be configured to account to add spacing between occupied EGMs and EGMs with which a wireless communication link can be established. For example, with EGMs <b>10</b><i>d </i>and <b>12</b><i>j </i>occupied, the system can be configured not to establish wireless communication with EGM <b>10</b><i>c</i>, <b>10</b><i>e </i>or <b>12</b><i>i </i>for patron <b>22</b> so as not to disturb patrons <b>20</b> and <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The system can also monitor a movement rate or direction of a patron carrying a portable electronic device. As described above, the system can be configured to estimate a speed and/or direction of a portable electronic device, by monitoring wireless signal strength of a portable electronic device carried by the patron. This information can be used by the system to determine which devices with which to initiate a wireless connection. For example, if it is determined that, via portable electronic device <b>16</b>, patron <b>22</b> is not moving because the wireless signal strength remains constant, then EGMs <b>10</b><i>a </i>or <b>12</b><i>f </i>can be selected to initiate a wireless communication link with the portable electronic device <b>16</b>. If it is determined that patron <b>22</b> is moving slowly towards patron <b>20</b> because the wireless signal strength is gaining strength, then EGMs <b>10</b><i>b </i>and <b>12</b><i>g </i>slightly ahead of the patron's position can be selected to initiate a wireless communication link. According to an embodiment, if it is determined that patron <b>22</b> is moving away from the two banks of EGMs because the wireless signal is losing strength, then none of the EGMs in the two banks will initiate a wireless connection with the portable electronic device <b>16</b> belonging to that patron <b>22</b>. Instead EGMs (not shown), ahead of the patron's position that the patron encounters if they continue to move on their current path can be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">If two portable electronic devices transmit signals having the same strength, the server or the EGM can send a message to both devices asking the owner of each device whether he or she would like to establish a wireless communication link with the EGM. In one embodiment, in which NFC pairing is used, a message can be sent to the devices asking the owner of the device to swipe it at the EGM to establish a wireless communication link.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As described above, a wireless communication link in the system can be triggered by a server, an EGM or a combination of an EGM and a server. For instance, server <b>14</b> can receive and/or generate information regarding the position of portable electronic device <b>16</b> and notify nearby EGMs of the devices relative proximity. Then, one of the nearby EGMs can make the determination of whether to establish a wireless communication session with the portable electronic device <b>16</b>. In another example, one or more of the EGMs near portable electronic device <b>16</b>, such as EGMs <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b</i>, <b>10</b><i>c</i>, <b>12</b><i>f</i>, <b>12</b><i>g </i>and <b>12</b><i>h </i>can detect portable electronic device <b>16</b>. The EGMs that detect the device <b>16</b> can send a message to server <b>14</b> indicating the detection of the device and status information that can affect whether a wireless communication link is initiated, such as whether they are idle or not. According to one embodiment, if the server <b>14</b> receives information from two or more nearby EGMs indicating the portable device <b>16</b> has been detected and each EGM is available for a game play session, then the server <b>14</b> can be configured to select the nearest available EGM to establish a wireless communication session between that EGM and the portable device.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In another embodiment, an EGM, such as <b>10</b><i>c</i>, can detect the presence of a portable electronic device, such as <b>18</b>, and determine whether to initiate a wireless communication session. As discussed above, the determination of whether to initiate a wireless communication session upon detecting a portable electronic device can be based on such factors as a signal strength, the strength of the signal detected over some time period, the current status of the EGM (e.g., idle or not), if the EGM is in an idle state how long it has been in the idle state and/or combinations thereof. The determination can be made independently of the system server. In yet another embodiment, prior to initiating the wireless communication session with the portable device, an EGM can be configured to query nearby EGMs via a peer-to-peer communication. The peer-to-peer communication may request information, such as whether any nearby EGMs detect the same portable electronic device, if the device is detected what is the signal strength, whether any nearby electronic device has already established a wireless communication session with the portable electronic device in response to the detection of the portable electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In one embodiment, a group of EGMs can be configured to negotiate among themselves to determine which EGM is to initiate a wireless communication session with the portable electronic device. For instance, three EGMs, such as <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b </i>and <b>10</b><i>c</i>, can detect a portable electronic device <b>18</b>. The three EGMs can exchange signal strength information and it can be decided that <b>10</b><i>c </i>is to initiate the wireless communication session because its signal strength is the highest. In another embodiment, the three EGMs can be involved in a group game play session during which each of the three EGMs can be in wireless communication with multiple portable devices.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In one embodiment, when the portable electronic device is configured to transmit patron preferences, an EGM can receive this information and compare the received information to its configuration to determine whether or not to initiate a wireless communication session. For instance, when EGM, such as <b>10</b><i>c</i>, receives information from a portable electronic device, such as <b>18</b>, indicating the patron prefers one dollar denomination games and the EGM is not a one dollar denomination machine, it can decide not to establish a wireless communication link with the portable electronic device <b>18</b>. If the EGM meets the criteria of the information received from the portable electronic device, such as a particular denomination and a particular game, then the EGM can determine in combination with one or more of the parameters described in the preceding paragraph whether to initiate a wireless communication session with the portable electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a block diagram of a gaming system <b>600</b> in accordance with the described embodiments. The gaming system <b>600</b> can include one or more servers, such as server <b>602</b>, and a variety of gaming devices including but not limited to table gaming devices, such as <b>652</b>, mobile gaming devices, such as <b>654</b>, and slot-type gaming devices, such as <b>656</b>. The table gaming devices, such as <b>652</b>, can include apparatus associated with table games where a live operator or a virtual operator is employed. The gaming devices and one or more servers can communicate with one another via a network <b>601</b>. The network can include wired, wireless or a combination of wired and wireless communication connections and associated communication routers.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Some gaming devices, such as <b>652</b>, <b>654</b> and <b>656</b>, can be configured with a player interface that allows at least 1) selections, such as a wager amount, associated with a wager-based game to be made and 2) an outcome of the wager-based game to be displayed. As an example, gaming devices, <b>652</b>, <b>654</b> and <b>656</b>, include player interfaces, <b>652</b><i>a</i>, <b>654</b><i>a </i>and <b>656</b><i>a</i>, respectively. Typically, gaming devices with a player interface are located in publicly accessible areas, such as a casino floor. On the other hand, some gaming devices, such as server <b>602</b>, can be located in publicly inaccessible areas, such is in a back-room of a casino or even off-site from the casino. Gaming devices located in publicly inaccessible areas may not include a player interface. For instance, server <b>602</b> does not include a player interface. However, server <b>602</b> includes an administrator interface <b>635</b> that allows functions associated with the server <b>602</b> to be adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">An example configuration of a gaming device is described with respect to gaming device <b>604</b>. The gaming device <b>604</b> can include 1) a game controller <b>606</b> for controlling a wager-based game played on the gaming device and 2) a player interface <b>608</b> for receiving inputs associated with the wager-based game and for displaying an outcome to the wager-based game. In more detail, the game controller <b>606</b> can include a) one or more processors, such as <b>626</b>, b) memory for holding software executed by the one or more processors, such as <b>628</b>, c) a power-hit tolerant memory, such as <b>630</b>, d) one or more trusted memories, such as <b>632</b>, e) a random number generator and f) a plurality of software applications, <b>610</b>. The other gaming devices, including table gaming device <b>652</b>, mobile gaming device <b>654</b>, slot-type gaming device <b>656</b> and server <b>602</b>, can each include a game controller with all or a portion of the components described with respect to game controller <b>606</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In particular embodiments, the gaming device can utilize a &#x201c;state&#x201d; machine architecture. In a &#x201c;state&#x201d; machine architecture critical information in each state is identified and queued for storage to a persistent memory. The architecture doesn't advance to the next state from a current state until all the critical information that is queued for storage for the current state is stored to the persistent memory. Thus, if an error condition occurs between two states, such as a power failure, the gaming device implementing the state machine can likely be restored to its last state prior to the occurrence of the error condition using the critical information associated with its last state stored in the persistent memory. This feature is often called a &#x201c;roll back&#x201d; of the gaming device. Examples of critical information can include but are not limited to an outcome determined for a wager-based game, a wager amount made on the wager-based game, an award amount associated with the outcome, credits available on the gaming device and a deposit of credits to the gaming device.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The power-hit tolerant memory <b>630</b> can be used as a persistent memory for critical data, such as critical data associated with maintaining a &#x201c;state&#x201d; machine on the gaming device. One characteristic of a power-hit tolerant memory <b>630</b> is a fast data transfer time. Thus, in the event of a power-failure, which might be indicated by a sudden power fluctuation, the critical data can be quickly loaded from volatile memory, such as RAM associated with the processor <b>626</b>, into the power-hit tolerant memory <b>630</b> and saved.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In one embodiment, the gaming device <b>605</b> can be configured to detect power fluctuations and in response, trigger a transfer of critical data from RAM to the power-hit tolerant memory <b>630</b>. One example of a power-hit tolerant memory <b>630</b> is a battery-backed RAM. The battery supplies power to the normally volatile RAM so that in the event of a power failure data is not lost. Thus, a battery-backed RAM is also often referred to as a non-volatile RAM or NV-RAM. An advantage of a battery-backed RAM is that the fast data transfer times associated with a volatile RAM can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The trusted memory <b>632</b> is typically a read-only memory of some type that may be designed to be unalterable. An EPROM or EEPROM are two types of memory that can be used as a trusted memory <b>632</b>. The gaming device <b>604</b> can include one or more trusted memories. Other types of memories, such as Flash memory, can also be utilized as an unalterable memory and the example of an EPROM or EEPROM is provided for purposes of illustration only.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Prior to installation the contents of a trusted memory, such as <b>632</b>, can be verified. For instance, a unique identifier, such as a hash value, can be generated on the contents of the memory and then compared to an accepted hash value for the contents of the memory. The memory may not be installed if the generated and accepted hash values do not match. After installation, the gaming device can be configured to check the contents of the trusted memory. For instance, a unique identifier, such as a hash value, can be generated on contents of the trusted memory and compared to an expected value for the unique identifier. If the generated value of the unique identifier and the expected value of the unique identifier don't match, then an error condition can be generated on the gaming device <b>604</b>. In one embodiment, the error condition can result in the gaming device entering a tilt state where game play is temporarily disabled on the gaming device.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Sometimes verification of software executed on the gaming device <b>604</b> can be performed by a regulatory body, such as a government agency. Often software used by a game controller, such as <b>606</b>, can be highly regulated, where only software approved by a regulatory body is allowed to be executed by the game controller <b>606</b>. In one embodiment, the trusted memory <b>632</b> can store authentication programs and/or authentication data for authenticating the contents of various memories on the gaming device <b>604</b>. For instance, the trusted memory <b>632</b> can store an authentication program that can be used to verify the contents of a mass storage device, such as <b>620</b>, which can include software executed by the game controller <b>606</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The random number generator (RNG) <b>634</b> can be used to generate random numbers that can be used to determine outcomes for a game of chance played on the gaming device. For instance, for a mechanical or video slot reel type of game, the RNG, in conjunction with a paytable that lists the possible outcomes for a game of chance and the associated awards for each outcome, can be used to generate random numbers for determining reel positions that display the randomly determined outcomes to the wager-based game. In other example, the RNG might be used to randomly select cards for a card game. Typically, as described above, the outcomes generated on a gaming device, such as <b>604</b>, are considered critical data. Thus, generated outcomes can be stored to the power-hit tolerant memory <b>630</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Not all gaming devices may be configured to generate their own game outcomes and thus, may not use an RNG for this purpose. In some embodiments, game outcomes can be generated on a remote device, such as server <b>602</b>, and then transmitted to the gaming device <b>604</b> where the outcome and an associated award can be displayed to the player via the player interface <b>608</b>. For instance, outcomes to a slot-type game or a card game can be generated on server <b>602</b> and transmitted to the gaming device <b>604</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In other embodiments, the gaming device <b>604</b> can be used to play central determination games, such as bingo and lottery games. In a central determination game, a pool of game outcomes can be generated and then, particular game outcomes can be selected as needed (e.g., in response to a player requesting to play the central determination game) from the pool of previously generated outcomes. For instance, a pool of game outcomes for a central determination game can be generated and stored on server <b>602</b>. Next, in response to a request to play the central determination game on gaming device <b>604</b>, one of the outcomes from the pool can be downloaded to the gaming device <b>604</b>. A game presentation including the downloaded outcome can be displayed on the gaming device <b>604</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In other embodiments, thin client type gaming devices, such as mobile gaming devices used to play wager-based video card or video slot games, may be configured to receive at least game outcomes from a remote device and not use an RNG to generate game outcomes locally. The game outcomes can be generated remotely in response to inputs made on the mobile device, such as an input indicating a wager amount and/or an input to initiate the game. This information can be sent from the mobile device to a remote device, such as from mobile gaming device <b>654</b> to server <b>602</b>. After receiving the game outcome from the remote device, a game presentation for the game outcomes generated remotely can be generated and displayed on the mobile device. In some instances, the game presentation can also be generated remotely and then streamed for display to the mobile device.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The game controller <b>606</b> can be configured to utilize and execute many different types of software applications <b>610</b>. Typically, the software applications utilized by the game controller <b>606</b> can be highly regulated and may undergo a lengthy approval process before a regulatory body allows the software applications to be utilized on a gaming device deployed in the field, such as in a casino. One type of software application the game controller can utilize is an Operating System (OS). The OS can allow various programs to be loaded for execution by the processor <b>626</b>, such as programs for implementing a state machine on the gaming device <b>606</b>. Further, the OS can be used to monitor resource utilization on the gaming device <b>606</b>. For instance, certain applications, such as applications associated with game outcome generation and game presentation that are executed by the OS can be given higher priority to resources, such as the processor <b>626</b> and memory <b>628</b>, than other applications that can be executing simultaneously on the gaming device.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">As previously described, the gaming device <b>604</b> can execute software for determining the outcome of a wager-based game and generating a presentation of the determined game outcome including displaying an award for the game.

The gaming controller <b>606</b> can configured to provide a menu (typically, only operator accessible), that allows the results of a past game to be displayed via the player interface <b>608</b>. The output from the history menu can include a re-creation of the game presentation associated with a past game outcome, such as a video representation of card hand associated with a video poker game, a video representation of a reel configuration associated with a video slot game, and/or raw data associated with the past game result, such as an award amount, an amount wagered, etc. The history menu can be used for dispute resolution purposes, such as if a player complains that they have not been properly awarded for a game previously played on the gaming device <b>604</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The reporting software can be used by the game controller <b>606</b> to report events that have occurred on the gaming device <b>604</b> to remote device, such as server <b>602</b>. For instance, in one embodiment, the game controller <b>606</b> can be configured to report error conditions that have been detected on the gaming device <b>604</b>, such as if a device has malfunctioned or needs attention. For instance, the reporting software can be used to send a message from the gaming device <b>604</b> to the server <b>602</b> indicating that a printer on the gaming device needs a refill of tickets. In another embodiment, the gaming controller <b>606</b> can be configured to report security events that may have occurred on the gaming device <b>604</b>, such as but not limited to if a door is opened, a latch is activated or an interior portion of the gaming device <b>604</b> has been accessed.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In yet other embodiments, the game controller <b>606</b> can be configured to report gaming activity and associated events that has been generated on the gaming device, such as a deposit of cash or an indicia of credit, at the gaming device, a generation of game outcome including an associated award amount and a dispensation of cash or an indicia of credit from the gaming device <b>604</b>. As part of a loyalty program, the gaming activity can be associated with a particular player. The reporting software can include player tracking elements that allow the gaming activity of a particular player to be reported to a remote device, such as server <b>602</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The game controller <b>606</b> can execute the authentication software to verify the authenticity of data and/or software programs executed on the gaming device <b>604</b>. For instance, the authentication software can be used to verify the authenticity of data and/or software applications when they are first downloaded to the gaming device <b>604</b>. Further, the authentication software can be used to periodically verify the authenticity of data and/or software applications currently residing on the gaming device, such as software applications stored on one of the memories coupled to the gaming device <b>604</b> including applications loaded into the memory <b>628</b> for execution by the processor <b>626</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The communication software executed by the game controller <b>606</b> can be used to communicate with a variety of devices remote to the gaming device <b>604</b>. For instance, the communication software can be used to communicate with one or more of a) servers remote to the device, such as <b>602</b>, b) other gaming devices, such as table gaming device <b>652</b>, mobile gaming device <b>654</b> and slot-type gaming device <b>656</b> and c) mobile devices carried by casino personnel or players in the vicinity of the gaming device <b>604</b>. Via the communication software, the game controller can be configured to communicate via many different communication protocols. For instance, different wireless and/or wired communication protocols can be implemented. Further, proprietary or non-proprietary gaming specific protocols can be implemented. For instance, gaming specific non-proprietary communication protocols, such as G2S (game to system), GDS (gaming device standard) and S2S (system to system) communication protocols provided by the Gaming Standards Association (GSA), Fremont, Calif., can be implemented on the gaming devices described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The gaming device <b>604</b> can communicate with one or more remote devices via one or more network interfaces, such as <b>612</b>. For instance, via network interfaces <b>612</b> and the network <b>601</b>, the gaming device <b>604</b> can communicate with other gaming devices, such as server <b>602</b> and/or gaming devices, <b>652</b>, <b>654</b> and <b>656</b>. The network interfaces can provide wired or wireless communications pathways for the gaming device <b>604</b>. Some gaming devices may not include a network interface or can be configured to operate in a stand-alone mode where the network interface is not connected to a network.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In other embodiments, a mobile device interface or interfaces, such as <b>614</b>, can be provided for communicating with a mobile device, such as a cell phone or a tablet computer carried by players or casino personnel temporarily in the vicinity of the gaming device <b>604</b>. A wireless communication protocol, such as Bluetooth&#x2122; and a Wi-Fi compatible standard, can be used for communicating with the mobile devices via the mobile device interfaces <b>614</b>. In one embodiment, the mobile device interface can implement a short range communication protocol, such as a near-field communication (NFC) protocol used for mobile wallet applications. NFC is typically used for communication distances of 4 cm or less. In addition, a wired communication interface, such as a docking station, can be integrated into the gaming device, such as <b>604</b>. The wired communication interface can be configured to provide communications between the gaming device <b>604</b> and the mobile device and/or providing power to the mobile device.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Near field communication, or NFC, allows for simplified transactions, data exchange, and connections with a touch. Formed in 2004, the Near Field Communication Forum (NFC Forum) promotes sharing, pairing, and transactions between NFC devices and develops and certifies device compliance with NFC standards. NFC's short range helps keep encrypted identity documents private. Thus, a smartphone or tablet with an NFC chip can make a credit card/debit card payment to a gaming device or serve as keycard or ID card for a loyalty program. Further, an NFC device can act a hotel room key. The user of an NFC device as a hotel room keys and/or a player tracking card instrument may allow fast VIP check-in and reduce staffing requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">NFC devices can read NFC tags on a gaming device <b>604</b> to get more information about the gaming device including an audio or video presentation. For instance, a tap of an NFC enabled device to a gaming device can be used to instantly share a contact, photo, song, application, video, or website link. In another example, an NFC enabled device can be used to transfer funds to the gaming device or enter the player in a multi-player tournament. As another example, an NFC enabled device can be used to receive information from a gaming device that can be used in a persistent gaming application or a social media application.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Further, NFC enabled signage can include NFC tags that allow a patron to learn more information about the content advertised in the signage. The NFC enabled signage can be part of a gaming system. For instance, a sign advertising a show available at the casino can be configured to transfer information about the show, show times and ticketing information via an NFC tag. As another example, a sign showing jackpot information, such as progressive jackpot information, can be used to transfer information about the jackpot, such as the last time the jackpot was won and where it was won.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In one embodiment, an NFC interface on a gaming device can be used to set-up a higher speed communication between the gaming device and another NFC enabled device such as smart phone. The higher speed communication rates can be used for expanded content sharing. For instance, a NFC and Bluetooth enabled gaming device can be tapped by an NFC and Bluetooth enabled smart phone for instant Bluetooth pairing between the devices. Instant Bluetooth pairing between a gaming device and an NFC enabled device, such as a smartphone, can save searching, waiting, and entering codes. In another example, a gaming device can be configured as an NFC enabled router, such as a router supporting a Wi-Fi communication standard. Tapping an NFC enabled device to an NFC enabled and Wi-Fi enabled gaming device can be used to establish a Wi-Fi connection between the two devices.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">As an example, the NFC communication can be used to exchange information to allow pairing to be established between a user-controlled device and the gaming device <b>604</b>. For instance, Bluetooth&#x2122; pairing occurs when two Bluetooth devices agree to communicate with each other and establish a connection. In order to pair two Bluetooth wireless devices, a password (passkey) is exchanged between the two devices. The Passkey is a code shared by both Bluetooth devices, which proves that both users have agreed to pair with each other. After the passkey code is exchanged, an encrypted communication can be set up between the pair devices. In Wi-Fi paring, every pairing can be set up with WPA2 encryption or another type of encryption scheme to keep the transfer private. Wi-Fi Direct is an example of a protocol that can be used to establish point-to-point communications between two Wi-Fi devices. The protocol allows for a Wi-Fi device pair directly with another without having to first join a local network. The method makes it possible to share media from a phone, play multiplayer games or otherwise communicate directly, even when no router exists. Via pairing between the gaming device <b>604</b> and portable electronic device, a portable electronic device may be able to utilize some of the functionality of secondary devices residing on the gaming device <b>604</b>. For instance, it may be possible for a player to print something from their portable electronic device using the printer on the gaming device <b>604</b> when it is paired to the gaming device <b>604</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The gaming device <b>604</b> can include one or more each of value input devices <b>616</b> and value output device <b>618</b>. The value input devices <b>616</b> can be used to deposit cash or indicia of credit onto the gaming device. The cash or indicia of credit can be used to make wagers on games played on the gaming device <b>604</b>. Examples of value input devices <b>616</b> include but are not limited to a magnetic-striped card or smart card reader, a bill and/or ticket acceptor, a network interface for downloading credits from a remote source, a wireless communication interface for reading credit data from nearby devices and a coin acceptor. A few examples of value input devices are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The value output devices can be used to dispense cash or indicia of credit from the gaming device <b>604</b>. Typically, the indicia of credit can be exchanged for cash. For instance, the indicia of credit can be exchanged at a cashier station or at a redemption station. Examples of value output devices can include a network interface for transferring credits into a remote account, a wireless communication interface that can be used with a mobile device implementing mobile wallet application, a coin hopper for dispensing coins or tokens, a bill dispenser, a card writer, a printer for printing tickets or cards redeemable for cash or credits. Another type of value output device is a merchandise dispenser, which can be configured to dispense merchandise with a tangible value from a gaming device. A few examples of value output devices are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The combination of value input devices <b>616</b> and value output devices <b>618</b> can vary from device to device. In some embodiments, a gaming device <b>604</b> may not include a value input device or a value output device. For instance, a thin-client gaming device used in a mobile gaming application may not include a value input device and a value output device. Instead, a remote account can be used to maintain the credits won or lost from playing wager-based games via the mobile device. The mobile device can be used to access the account and affect the account balance via game play initiated on the mobile device. Credits can be deposited or withdrawn from the remote account via some mechanism other than via the mobile device interface.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In yet other embodiments, the gaming device <b>604</b> can include one or more secondary controllers <b>619</b>. The secondary controllers can be associated with various peripheral devices coupled to the gaming device, such as the value input devices and value output devices described in the preceding paragraphs. As another example, the secondary controllers can be associated with peripheral devices associated with the player interface <b>608</b>, such as input devices, video displays, electro-mechanical displays and a player tracking unit. In some embodiments, the secondary controllers can receive instructions and/or data from and provide responses to the game controller <b>606</b>. The secondary controller can be configured to interpret the instructions and/or data from the game controller <b>606</b> and control a particular device according to the received instructions and/or data. For instance, a print controller may receive a print command with a number of parameters, such as a credit amount and in response print a ticket redeemable for the credit amount. In another example, a touch screen controller can detect touch inputs and send information to the game controller <b>606</b> characterizing the touch input.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In a particular embodiment, a secondary controller can be used to control a number of peripheral devices independently of the game controller <b>606</b>. The game controller may or may not be able to provide control commands for these peripheral devices. For instance, a player tracking unit can include one or more of a video display, a touch screen, card reader, network interface, a wireless interface for communicating with a portable electronic device, a wireless receiver for detecting a portable electronic device or input buttons that are only configured to receive control commands from a player tracking controller and not the game controller. A secondary controller, such as a player tracking controller, can control these devices to provide player tracking services and bonusing on the gaming device <b>604</b>. In alternate embodiments, the game controller <b>604</b> can control one or more of these devices to perform player tracking functions.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Other devices besides player tracking units, such as card readers, bill validators and printers which are utilized on a gaming device <b>604</b>, can also include secondary controllers that can be used to perform functions independently of a game controller. In particular embodiments, a secondary controller on one of these devices can be used to initiate a wireless communication session involving a portable electronic device, as described above. For instance, a player tracking unit may be able to detect a portable electronic device and initiate a wireless communication session the portable electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In yet other embodiments, a secondary controller and the game controller <b>606</b> can share one or more devices on the gaming device. For instance, the secondary controller at times may be able to utilize a portion of the video display that used by the game controller to output a game of chance. Logic can be provided that arbitrates which controller is allowed to control a particular shared device at a particular time. The arbitration can depend on the current state of the gaming device. Thus, in some instances depending on the current state of the gaming device, a first controller, such as a game controller, can be given control over a shared device while in other instances, a secondary controller, such as a player tracking controller, can be given control over a shared device.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">An advantage of performing player tracking functions via a secondary controller, such as a player tracking controller, is that since the player tracking functions do not involve controlling the wager-based game, the software on the player tracking unit can be developed modified via a less lengthy and regulatory intensive process than is required for software executed by the game controller <b>606</b>, which does control the wager-based game. In general, using a secondary controller, certain functions of the gaming device <b>604</b> that are not subject to as much regulatory scrutiny as the game play functions can be decoupled from the game controller <b>606</b> and implemented on the secondary controller instead. An advantage of this approach, like for the player tracking controller, is that software approval process for the software executed by the secondary controller can be less intensive than the process needed to get software approved for the game controller. Thus, in particular embodiments, it may be advantageous to provide the software involving wireless communications with portable electronic devices in a secondary controller.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">A mass storage unit(s) <b>620</b>, such as a device including a hard drive, optical disk drive, flash memory or some other memory storage technology can be used to store applications and data used and/or generated by the gaming device <b>604</b>. For instance, a mass storage unit, such as <b>620</b>, can be used to store gaming applications executed by the game controller <b>606</b> where the gaming device <b>604</b> can be configured to receive downloads of game applications from remote devices, such as server <b>602</b>. In one embodiment, the game controller <b>606</b> can include its own dedicated mass storage unit. In another embodiment, critical data, such as game history data stored in the power-hit tolerant memory <b>630</b> can be moved from the power-hit tolerant memory <b>630</b> to the mass storage unit <b>620</b> at periodic intervals for archival purposes and to free up space in the power-hit tolerant memory <b>630</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The gaming device <b>604</b> can include security circuitry <b>622</b>, such as security sensors and circuitry for monitoring the sensors. The security circuitry <b>622</b> can be configured to operate while the gaming device is receiving direct power and operational to provide game play as well as when the gaming device is uncoupled from direct power, such as during shipping or in the event of a power failure. The gaming device <b>604</b> can be equipped with one or more secure enclosures, which can include locks for limiting access to the enclosures. One or more sensors can be located within the secure enclosures or coupled to the locks. The sensors can be configured to generate signals that can be used to determine whether secure enclosures have been accessed, locks have been actuated or the gaming device <b>604</b>, such as a mobile device has been moved to an unauthorized area. The security monitoring circuitry can be configured to generate, store and/or transmit error events when the security events, such as accessing the interior of the gaming device, have occurred. The error events may cause the game controller <b>606</b> to place itself in a &#x201c;safe&#x201d; mode where no game play is allowed until the error event is cleared.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The server <b>602</b> can be configured to provide one or more functions to gaming devices or other servers in a gaming system <b>600</b>. The server <b>602</b> is shown performing a number of different functions. However, in various embodiments, the functions can be divided among multiple servers where each server can communicate with a different combination of gaming devices. For instance, player interface support <b>636</b> and gaming device software <b>638</b> can be provided on a first server, progressives can be provided on a second server, loyalty program functions <b>640</b> and accounting <b>648</b> can be provided on a third server, linked gaming <b>644</b> can be provided on a fourth server, cashless functions <b>646</b> can be provided on a fifth server and security functions <b>650</b> can be provided on a sixth server. In this example, each server can communicate with a different combination of gaming devices because each of the functions provided by the servers may not be provided to every gaming device in the gaming system <b>600</b>. For instance, the server <b>602</b> can be configured to provide progressive gaming functions to gaming devices <b>604</b>, <b>652</b> and <b>656</b> but not gaming device <b>654</b>. Thus, the server <b>602</b> may not communicate with the mobile gaming device <b>654</b> if progressive functions are not enabled on the mobile gaming device at a particular time.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Typically, each server can include an administrator interface that allows the functions of a server, such as <b>602</b>, to be configured and maintained. Each server <b>602</b> can include a processor and memory. In some embodiments, the servers, such as <b>602</b>, can include a game controller with components, such as but not limited to a power-hit tolerant memory <b>630</b>, a trusted memory <b>632</b> and an RNG <b>634</b> described with respect to gaming device <b>604</b>. The servers can include one or more network interfaces on which wired or wireless communication protocols can be implemented. Next, some possible functions provided by the server <b>602</b> are described. These functions are described for the purposes of illustration only and are not meant to be limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The player interface support <b>636</b> can be used to serve content to gaming devices, such as <b>604</b>, <b>652</b>, <b>654</b> and <b>656</b>, remote to the server. The content can include video and audio content that can be output on one of the player interfaces, such as <b>608</b>, <b>652</b><i>a</i>, <b>654</b><i>a </i>and <b>656</b><i>a</i>. Further, the content can be configured to utilize unique features of a particular player interface, such as video displays, wheels or reels, if the particular player interface is so equipped.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In one embodiment, via the player interface support, content can be output to all or a portion of a primary video display that is used to output wager-based game outcomes on a player interface associated with a gaming device. For instance, a portion of the primary display can be allocated to providing a &#x201c;service window&#x201d; on the primary video display where the content in the service window is provided from a server remote to the gaming device. In particular embodiments, the content delivered from the server to a gaming device as part of the player interface support <b>636</b> can be affected by inputs made on the gaming device. For instance, the service window can be generated on a touch screen display where inputs received via the service window can be sent back to server <b>602</b>. In response, to the received inputs, the server <b>602</b> can adjust the content that is displayed on the remote gaming device that generated the inputs.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The &#x201c;service window&#x201d; application can be generated by software code that is executed independently of other game controller software in a secure &#x201c;sandbox.&#x201d; Via the sandbox, an executable can be given limited access to various resources on an EGM, such as a portion of the CPU resources and memory available on a game controller. The memory can be isolated from the memory used by other processes, such as game processes executed by the game controller.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">As described above, a service window application can be allowed to control, send and/or receive data from secondary devices on a gaming device, such as a video display, a touch screen power interfaces or communication interfaces. A service window application allowed to utilize a communication interface, such as a wireless communication interface, can be configured to communicate with a portable electronic device via the communication interface independently of a game controller on an EGM. Further details of utilizing a service window on a gaming device on an EGM are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/209,608, by Weber et al., filed Sep. 12, 2008, titled &#x201c;Gaming Machine with Externally Controlled Content Display,&#x201d; which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and for all purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In another embodiment, via the video display, the service window application can be configured to output data in an optical image format, such as a 1-D/2-D bar-code or a QR code.

<p id="p-0134" num="0133"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a perspective drawing of a gaming device <b>700</b> in accordance with the described embodiments. The gaming device <b>700</b> is example of what can be considered a &#x201c;thick-client.&#x201d; Typically, a thick-client is configurable to communicate with one or more remote servers but provides game play, such as game outcome determination, independent of the remote servers. In addition, a thick-client can be considered as such because it includes cash handling capabilities, such as peripheral devices for receiving cash, and a secure enclosure within the device for storing the received cash. In contrast, thin-client device, such as a mobile gaming device, may be more dependent on a remote server to provide a component of the game play on the device, such as game outcome determination, and/or may not include peripheral devices for receiving cash and an associated enclosure for storing it.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Many different configurations are possible between thick and thin clients. For instance, a thick-client device, such as <b>700</b>, deployed in a central determination configuration, may receive game outcomes from a remote server but still provide cash handling capabilities. Further, the peripheral devices can vary from gaming device to gaming device. For instance, the gaming device <b>700</b> can be configured with electro-mechanical reels to display a game outcome instead of a video display, such as <b>710</b>. Thus, the features of gaming device <b>700</b> are described for the purposes of illustration only and are not meant to be limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The gaming device <b>700</b> can include a main cabinet <b>702</b>.

The main cabinet can include an access mechanism, such as door <b>704</b>, which allows an interior of the gaming device <b>700</b> to be accessed. The actuation of the door <b>704</b> can be controlled by a locking mechanism, such as lock <b>716</b>. The lock <b>716</b>, the door <b>704</b> and the interior of the main cabinet <b>702</b> can be monitored with security sensors for detecting whether the interior has been accessed. For instance, a light sensor can be provided to detect a change in light-level in response to the door <b>704</b> being opened.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The interior of the main cabinet <b>700</b> can include additional secure enclosure, which can also be fitted with locking mechanisms. For instance, the game controller, such as game controller <b>606</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, can be secured within a separate locked enclosure. The separate locked enclosure for the game controller may allow maintenance functions to be performed on the gaming device, such as emptying a drop box for coins, emptying a cash box or replacing a device, while preventing tampering with the game controller. Further, in the case of device with a coin acceptor, <b>720</b>, the separate enclosure can protect the electronics of the game controller from potentially damaging coin dust.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">A top box <b>706</b> can be mounted to the top of the main cabinet <b>702</b>. A number of peripheral devices can be coupled to the top box <b>706</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a display device <b>708</b> and a candle device <b>714</b> are mounted to the top box <b>706</b>. The display device <b>708</b> can be used to display information associated with game play on the gaming device <b>700</b>. For instance, the display device <b>708</b> can be used to display a bonus game presentation associated with the play of a wager-based game (One or more bonus games are often features of many wager-based games). In another example, the display device <b>708</b> can be used to display information associated with a progressive game, such as one or more progressive jackpot amounts. In yet another example, the display device <b>708</b> can be used to display an attract feature that is intended to draw a potential player's attention to the gaming device <b>700</b> when it is not in use.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">The candle device <b>714</b> can include a number of lighting elements. The lighting elements can be lit in different patterns to draw attention to the gaming device. For instance, one lighting pattern may indicate that service is needed at the gaming device <b>700</b> while another light pattern may indicate that a player has requested a drink. The candle device <b>714</b> is typically placed at the top of gaming device <b>700</b> to increase its visibility. Other peripheral devices, including custom bonus devices, such as reels or wheels, can be included in a top box <b>706</b> and the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is provided for illustrative purposes only. For instance, some of the devices coupled to the main cabinet <b>702</b>, such as printer <b>726</b>, can be located in a different top box configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The gaming device <b>700</b> provides a player interface that allows the play of a game, such as wager-based game. In this embodiment, the player interface includes 1) a primary video display <b>710</b> for outputting video images associated with the game play, 2) audio devices, such as <b>722</b>, for outputting audio content associated with game play and possibly casino operations, 3) an input panel <b>712</b> for at least providing game play related inputs and 4) a secondary video display <b>708</b> for outputting video content related to the game play (e.g., bonus material) and/or the casino enterprise (e.g., advertising). In particular embodiments, one or both of the video displays, <b>708</b> and <b>710</b>, can be equipped with a touch screen sensor and associated touch screen controller, for detecting touch inputs, such as touch inputs associated with the play of a game or a service window output to the display device.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">The input panel <b>712</b> can include a number of electro-mechanical input buttons, such as <b>730</b>, and/or touch sensitive surfaces. For instance, the input panel can include a touch screen equipped video display to provide a touch sensitive surface. In some embodiments, the functions of the electro-mechanical input buttons can be dynamically reconfigurable. For instance, the function of the electro-mechanical input buttons may be changed depending on the game that is being played on the gaming device. To indicate function changes, the input buttons can each include a configurable display, such as an e-ink or a video display for indicating the function of button. The output of the configurable display can be adjusted to account for a change in the function of the button.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The gaming device <b>700</b> includes a card reader <b>728</b>, a printer <b>726</b>, a coin acceptor <b>720</b>, a bill and/or ticket acceptor <b>720</b> and a coin hopper (not shown) for dispensing coins to a coin tray <b>732</b>. These devices can provide value input/output capabilities on the gaming device <b>700</b>.
