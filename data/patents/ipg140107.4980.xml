<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A radio communication device capable of lightening the influence of a frequency selective fading in the wide-band transmission of a single carrier thereby to prevent deterioration of error rate characteristics. In this device, an FFT unit subjects a modulated signal inputted from a modulation unit to a Fourier transformation. A pilot insertion unit inserts a pilot symbol into a plurality of individual frequency components of the modulated signal. Weight multiplication units multiply the individual frequency components and the pilot symbols inserted into the individual frequency components, by weight coefficients set at a weight coefficient setting unit. IFFT units subject the frequency components to an inverse Fourier transformation, thereby to convert the frequency components into time domains.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a radio communication apparatus and radio communication method.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Looking toward next-generation mobile communication systems, various studies have been conducted on radio transmission systems suitable for high-speed packet transmission capable of achieving data rates in excess of 100 Mbps. Broadband is necessary for the frequency band used for such high-speed transmission, and the use of a bandwidth on the order of 100 MHz has been studied. However, when this kind of broadband transmission is performed using a single carrier in mobile communications, error rate characteristics deteriorate significantly due to multipath interference. Thus, frequency domain equalization has been studied as a technology for eliminating the effects of multipath interference in reproducing a waveform (see Non-patent Document 1, for example). Frequency domain equalization is an equalization technology that can be implemented with a simple configuration, in which equalization processing is performed for a signal transmitted by means of a single carrier by multiplying each frequency component of a received signal received by the inverse characteristic of a estimation value of propagation path frequency characteristic on the receiving side.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0005">In single-carrier broadband transmission, if there is a frequency component whose reception level falls significantly due to the effects of frequency selective fading, equalization is not fully performed and a multipath interference component remains even if the above-described kind of frequency domain equalization is carried out, with the result that error rate characteristics deteriorate.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0006">It is an object of the present invention to provide a radio communication apparatus and radio communication method that enable the effects of frequency selective fading to be reduced and deterioration of error rate characteristics to be prevented in single-carrier broadband transmission.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0007">A radio communication apparatus of the present invention employs a configuration that includes: a first antenna and a second antenna; a first conversion section that converts an input signal to the frequency domain to obtain a plurality of frequency components of the input signal; a weighting section that weights the plurality of frequency components using a first weighting factor and weights the plurality of frequency components using a second weighting factor; a second conversion section that converts the plurality of frequency components weighted using the first weighting factor to the time domain to obtain a first transmit signal and converts the plurality of frequency components weighted using the second weighting factor to the time domain to obtain a second transmit signal; and a transmitting section that transmits the first transmit signal and the second transmit signal from one or both of the first antenna and the second antenna.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0021">Embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. A radio communication apparatus described below is installed, for example, in a radio communication terminal apparatus or radio communication base station apparatus used in a mobile communication system.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0022">In the radio communication apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a coding section <b>11</b> codes input time-series transmit data.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0023">A modulation section <b>12</b> modulates output from coding section <b>11</b> using a modulation method such as QPSK or 16 QAM to generate a modulated signal.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0024">An FFT section <b>13</b> executes FFT (Fourier transform) processing on a modulated signal input from modulation section <b>12</b> to convert the modulated signal to the frequency domain. By means of this FFT processing, a plurality of frequency components <b>1</b> through N of the modulated signal are obtained. These frequency components <b>1</b> through N are input to a pilot insertion section <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0025">Pilot insertion section <b>14</b> inserts a frequency-domain pilot symbol in each of input frequency components <b>1</b> through N, and inputs the frequency components to weight multiplication sections <b>15</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>15</b>-<b>2</b>. Details of the processing performed by pilot insertion section <b>14</b> will be given later herein.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0026">Weight multiplication sections <b>15</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>15</b>-<b>2</b> multiply weighting factors W<b>11</b> through W<b>1</b>N and W<b>21</b> through W<b>2</b>N set by a weighting factor setting section <b>54</b> by frequency components <b>1</b> through N and the pilot symbols inserted in frequency components <b>1</b> through N, thereby weighting frequency components <b>1</b> through N and pilot symbols with the same weighting factor. Weighting factors W<b>11</b> through W<b>1</b>N multiplied in weight multiplication section <b>15</b>-<b>1</b> and weighting factors W<b>21</b> through W<b>2</b>N multiplied in weight multiplication section <b>15</b>-<b>2</b> differ from each other. Frequency components <b>1</b> through N weighted by weight multiplication section <b>15</b>-<b>1</b> are input to an IFFT section <b>16</b>-<b>1</b>, and frequency components <b>1</b> through N weighted by weight multiplication section <b>15</b>-<b>2</b> are input to an IFFT section <b>16</b>-<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0027">IFFT section <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> executes IFFT (inverse Fourier transform) processing on input frequency components <b>1</b> through N to convert frequency components <b>1</b> through N to the time domain. By means of this processing, a transmit signal <b>1</b> containing frequency components <b>1</b> through N weighted by weights W<b>11</b> through W<b>1</b>N is obtained. This transmit signal <b>1</b> has a guard interval inserted by a GI insertion section <b>17</b>-<b>1</b>, undergoes radio processing such as up-conversion and amplification by a transmit radio processing section <b>18</b>-<b>1</b>, and is then transmitted to a communicating party via an antenna <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0028">IFFT section <b>16</b>-<b>2</b> executes IFFT processing on input frequency components <b>1</b> through N to convert frequency components <b>1</b> through N to the time domain. By means of this processing, a transmit signal <b>2</b> containing frequency components <b>1</b> through N weighted by weights W<b>21</b> through W<b>2</b>N is obtained. This transmit signal <b>2</b> has a guard interval inserted by a GI insertion section <b>17</b>-<b>2</b>, undergoes radio processing such as up-conversion and amplification by a transmit radio processing section <b>18</b>-<b>2</b>, and is then transmitted to the communicating party via an antenna <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0029">On the other hand, a receive radio processing section <b>51</b>-<b>1</b> executes radio processing such as down-conversion on a signal received via antenna <b>1</b>, and inputs the signal to a pilot extraction section <b>52</b>-<b>1</b> and a combining section <b>55</b>. A receive radio processing section <b>51</b>-<b>2</b> executes radio processing such as down-conversion on a signal received via antenna <b>2</b>, and inputs the signal to a pilot extraction section <b>52</b>-<b>2</b> and combining section <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0030">Pilot extraction section <b>52</b>-<b>1</b> extracts a pilot symbol contained in the signal received by antenna <b>1</b> and inputs the pilot symbol to a frequency characteristic measuring section <b>53</b>-<b>1</b>. Frequency characteristic measuring section <b>53</b>-<b>1</b> measures a frequency characteristic of a propagation path between antenna <b>1</b> and the communicating party using this pilot symbol. Also, pilot extraction section <b>52</b>-<b>2</b> extracts a pilot symbol contained in the signal received by antenna <b>2</b> and inputs the pilot symbol to a frequency characteristic measuring section <b>53</b>-<b>2</b>. Frequency characteristic measuring section <b>53</b>-<b>2</b> measures a frequency characteristic of a propagation path between antenna <b>2</b> and the communicating party using this pilot symbol. The frequency characteristic measurement method will be described later herein. The frequency characteristics measured by frequency characteristic measuring sections <b>53</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>53</b>-<b>2</b> are input to weighting factor setting section <b>54</b>. Weighting factor setting section <b>54</b> sets weights W<b>11</b> through W<b>1</b>N and weights W<b>21</b> through W<b>2</b>N in accordance with the respective frequency characteristics. The setting method will be described later herein.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0031">Combining section <b>55</b> combines the signal received by antenna <b>1</b> and the signal received by antenna <b>2</b>, a demodulation section <b>56</b> demodulates the combined signal, and a decoding section <b>57</b> decodes the demodulated signal. By this means, receive data is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0032">Next, the processing performed by frequency characteristic measuring sections <b>53</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>53</b>-<b>2</b> will be described. Frequency characteristic measuring sections <b>53</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>53</b>-<b>2</b> are composed of an FFT section <b>531</b>, a division section <b>532</b>, and a squaring section <b>533</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. By means of this configuration, frequency characteristic measuring sections <b>53</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>53</b>-<b>2</b> measure the frequency characteristics of the respective propagation paths&#x2014;that is to say, the propagation path quality of each frequency component of the propagation path between antenna <b>1</b> and the communicating party and the propagation path between antenna <b>2</b> and the communicating party. Here, the received power value per frequency component of a pilot symbol is measured as the propagation path quality per frequency component as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0033">FFT section <b>531</b> executes FFT processing on an input received pilot symbol to convert the pilot symbol to the frequency domain. By means of this FFT processing, a plurality of frequency components <b>1</b> through N of the pilot symbol are obtained. These frequency components <b>1</b> through N are input to division section <b>532</b>. Frequency components <b>1</b> through N obtained here correspond to frequency components <b>1</b> through N obtained by FFT section <b>13</b>. Division section <b>532</b> divides each of frequency components <b>1</b> through N by frequency characteristic of a pilot replica. A pilot replica is a pilot waveform known to both the pilot symbol transmitting side (that is, the communicating party) and the pilot symbol receiving side (that is, the radio communication apparatus of this embodiment). By means of this division processing, channel estimation values are obtained for each of frequency components <b>1</b> through N. In squaring section <b>533</b>, these channel estimation values are squared to give power values. By having this series of processes performed by frequency characteristic measuring sections <b>53</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>53</b>-<b>2</b>, received power values are measured for each of frequency components <b>1</b> through N of the antenna <b>1</b> propagation path and the antenna <b>2</b> propagation path. The measured received power values are input to weighting factor setting section <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0034">Next, the processing performed by weighting factor setting section <b>54</b> will be described. Weighting factor setting section <b>54</b> sets weighting factors W<b>11</b> through W<b>1</b>N used by weight multiplication section <b>15</b>-<b>1</b> and weighting factors W<b>21</b> through W<b>2</b>N used by weight multiplication section <b>15</b>-<b>2</b>, in accordance with received power values input from frequency characteristic measuring section <b>53</b>-<b>1</b> (that is, the propagation path quality of each frequency component of the antenna <b>1</b> propagation path) and received power values input from frequency characteristic measuring section <b>53</b>-<b>2</b> (that is, the propagation path quality of each frequency component of the antenna <b>2</b> propagation path). As the setting method, a received power value input from frequency characteristic measuring section <b>53</b>-<b>1</b> and a received power value input from frequency characteristic measuring section <b>53</b>-<b>2</b> are compared for each of frequency components <b>1</b> through N, a weighting factor corresponding to the antenna where the received power value is larger is set to 1, and a weighting factor corresponding to the antenna where the received power value is smaller is set to 0. More specifically, for example, among frequency components <b>1</b> through N, received power values in frequency component <b>1</b> transmitted from antenna <b>1</b> (that is, the frequency component multiplied by weighting factor W<b>11</b>) and frequency component <b>1</b> transmitted from antenna <b>2</b> (that is, the frequency component multiplied by weighting factor W<b>21</b>) are compared, and if the received power value of frequency component <b>1</b> transmitted from antenna <b>1</b> is larger than the received power value of frequency component <b>1</b> transmitted from antenna <b>2</b>, weighting factor W<b>11</b> is set to 1, and weighting factor W<b>21</b> is set to 0. Conversely, if the received power value of frequency component <b>1</b> transmitted from antenna <b>2</b> is larger than the received power value of frequency component <b>1</b> transmitted from antenna <b>1</b>, weighting factor W<b>21</b> is set to 1, and weighting factor W<b>11</b> is set to 0. This processing is performed for all frequency components. By this means, each of frequency components <b>1</b> through N is transmitted from one of antenna <b>1</b> and antenna <b>2</b>, which has larger received power. That is to say, transmitting antenna selection is performed for each frequency component. By selecting the antenna with the better propagation path quality as the transmitting antenna for each frequency component in this way, a greater transmission diversity effect can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0035">The above-described comparison/selection processing is illustrated graphically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The two curves shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> represent the frequency characteristics of each antenna input to weighting factor setting section <b>54</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, for each frequency component, the weighting factor corresponding to the antenna with the larger received power is set to 1, and the weighting factor corresponding to the antenna with the smaller received power is set to 0. As a result, the frequency characteristics in signal reception by the communicating party are as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. That is to say, since one of antenna <b>1</b> and antenna <b>2</b> which has a better propagation path quality is selected as the transmitting antenna for each frequency component, there are no longer any frequency components where the communicating party's received power falls significantly. AS a result, error rate characteristics can be improved compared with a case in which all frequency components are transmitted only from either antenna <b>1</b> or antenna <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0036">Next, the processing performed by pilot insertion section <b>14</b> will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> applies to a TDD system, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> to an FDD system.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in this embodiment each frame is divided into a plurality of time slots, and pilot symbols are transmitted in the start time slot and end time slot of each frame. Thus, in pilot insertion section <b>14</b>, pilot symbols are inserted in each frequency component by having a switch corresponding to each frequency component connected to an &#x201c;a&#x201d; side at transmission timings of start time slot and end time slot, and to a &#x201c;b&#x201d; side at other timings. Also, in a TDD system, weighting factor updating in weighting factor setting section <b>54</b> is performed at the boundary between an uplink frame and downlink frame, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and the same weighting factor is used in all slots in one downlink frame. In an FDD system, on the other hand, weighting factor updating in weighting factor setting section <b>54</b> is performed at the boundary between each frame, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, and the same weighting factor is used in all slots in one frame. By using such weighting factor update timing, a pilot part and data part are multiplied by the same weighting factor, so that in signal reception by a communicating party, the communicating party can receive a signal by means of the same kind of reception processing as when all frequency components are transmitted from only one antenna, as in the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0038">Thus, according to this embodiment, a transmission diversity effect can be obtained for each frequency component, enabling a fall in power of frequency component due to the effects of frequency selective fading to be reduced, and as a result, enabling error rate characteristics to be improved. Also, since a weighting factor is set for each frequency component in accordance with propagation path frequency characteristics, transmission diversity effects can be further increased.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0039">It is also possible for the communicating party to measure the propagation path quality of frequency components of each antenna and report the results to the radio communication apparatus of this embodiment, and for the radio communication apparatus to set a weighting factor in accordance with a reported propagation path quality. And it is also possible for the communicating party additionally to perform weighting factor setting in accordance with propagation path quality and report the results to the radio communication apparatus of this embodiment, and for the radio communication apparatus to multiply each frequency component by a reported weighting factor. In this way, the radio communication apparatus of this embodiment can be given an optimal configuration for an FDD system that uses propagation path of different frequencies for transmission and reception.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Embodiment 2</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0040">A radio communication apparatus according to this embodiment sets a weighting factor combination as a weighting factor multiplied by each frequency component, among a plurality of combinations of weighting factors W<b>11</b> through W<b>1</b>N and W<b>21</b> through W<b>2</b>N, where received power is largest at the communicating party that is the signal receiving side, in accordance with the propagation path quality of each frequency component.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0041">A radio communication apparatus according to this embodiment differs from Embodiment 1 only in the operation of weighting factor setting section <b>54</b>. When signals are transmitted from a plurality of antennas, a weighting factor whereby signals transmitted from each antenna are reinforced at the reception point is a weighting factor having an amplitude and phase such that P<sub>n </sub>expressed by Equation (1) is a maximum. Thus, weighting factor setting section <b>54</b> sets a weighting factor combination w<sub>n </sub>where P<sub>n </sub>of Equation (1) is a maximum as the weighting factors of the frequency components of each antenna. A plurality of weighting factor combination w<sub>n </sub>candidates are stored beforehand in weighting factor setting section <b>54</b>, and weighting factor setting section <b>54</b> calculates P<sub>n </sub>for these combination candidates, selects the combination w<sub>n </sub>where P<sub>n </sub>is a maximum, and outputs this selected combination w<sub>n </sub>to weight multiplication sections <b>15</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>15</b>-<b>2</b>.

<p id="p-0043" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows frequency characteristics at the time of signal reception by the communicating party when weighting factor setting according to this embodiment is performed. It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> that when weighting factor setting according to this embodiment is performed, frequency components whose received power falls significantly are eliminated. Comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> (Embodiment 1), received power is smaller in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> than in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. However, if the estimation error of frequency characteristic of propagation path is large, larger received power is obtained by transmission of each frequency component from two antennas than by transmission from one antenna as in Embodiment 1.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0044">Thus, according to this embodiment, received power can be reinforced for each frequency component, so that frequency components whose received power falls significantly are eliminated, and, as a result, error rate characteristics can be improved.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Embodiment 3</heading>
<p id="p-0045" num="0045">In Embodiment 1, a signal is deformed on an individual frequency component basis for each antenna by means of weighting factor multiplication, and there is consequently a possibility of a signal's PAPR (Peak to Average Power Ratio) becoming large compared with a case in which multiplication by a weighting factor is not performed. This possibility is greatly increased by creating non-transmitted frequency components in the frequency components within a signal. In the case of a large PAPR that comes within the nonlinear region of the transmitting amplifier characteristic, a transmit signal is distorted and the SNR deteriorates on the signal receiving side.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0046">Thus, in this embodiment, the degree of signal deformation is reduced by transmitting only a frequency component where the difference in propagation path quality between antennas is greater than or equal to a threshold value from one antenna, and transmitting a frequency component where that difference is less than the threshold value from a plurality of antennas, thereby reducing the number of non-transmitted frequency components in signals transmitted from each antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0047">The configuration of a radio communication apparatus according to this embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. In the following description, configuration elements identical to those in Embodiment 1 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) are assigned the same reference numbers as in Embodiment 1, and descriptions thereof are omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0048">In the radio communication apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, frequency characteristic measuring section <b>53</b>-<b>1</b> measures the received power values of frequency components <b>1</b> through N of a pilot symbol contained in a signal received by antenna <b>1</b>, and inputs the received power values to weighting factor setting section <b>54</b> and a power difference measuring section <b>58</b>. Also, frequency characteristic measuring section <b>53</b>-<b>2</b> measures the received power values of frequency components <b>1</b> through N of a pilot symbol contained in a signal received by antenna <b>2</b>, and inputs the received power values to weighting factor setting section <b>54</b> and power difference measuring section <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0049">Power difference measuring section <b>58</b> measures the difference between the received power value input from frequency characteristic measuring section <b>53</b>-<b>1</b> and the received power value input from frequency characteristic measuring section <b>53</b>-<b>2</b> for each frequency component. That is to say, power difference measuring section <b>58</b> measures the difference in the received power value of each frequency component between antenna <b>1</b> and antenna <b>2</b>. This received power difference is input to a threshold value determination section <b>59</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0050">Threshold value determination section <b>59</b> determines for each frequency component whether or not the received power difference input from power difference measuring section <b>58</b> is greater than or equal to a threshold value, and inputs the determination result to weighting factor setting section <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0051">Weighting factor setting section <b>54</b> sets a weighting factor for the frequency component where the received power difference is determined to be greater than or equal to the threshold value using the setting method described in Embodiment 1. That is to say, weighting factor setting section <b>54</b>, between antenna <b>1</b> and antenna <b>2</b>, compares the received power values of a frequency component where the received power difference is determined to be greater than or equal to the threshold value, sets the weighting factor of the antenna where the received power value is larger to 1, and sets the weighting factor of the antenna where the received power value is smaller to 0. On the other hand, for a frequency component where the received power difference is determined to be less than the threshold value, weighting factor setting section <b>54</b> sets the weighting factor to 0.5 for both antennas. By performing this kind of weighting factor setting, only a frequency component where the received power difference is large&#x2014;that is, only a frequency component where the difference in propagation path quality between the antennas is large&#x2014;is transmitted from the antenna with the better propagation path quality, and other frequency components are transmitted from both antennas. Thus, the number of frequency components transmitted from only one antenna can be decreased, and the degree of signal deformation is reduced. By this means, an increase in the PAPR can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0052">Thus, according to this embodiment, since deformation of frequency components at each antenna is kept to a minimum, an increase in the PAPR can be suppressed, and deterioration of error rate characteristics caused by signal deformation due to an increase in the PAPR can be suppressed. Also, frequency components having a large difference in propagation path quality can be transmitted from the antenna with the better propagation path quality with concentrated power, so that at the signal receiving side, frequency components whose received power falls significantly is eliminated, and it is possible to improve error rate characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0053">Weighting factor setting section <b>54</b> of this embodiment may also use the setting method described in Embodiment 2 to set the weighting factor of a frequency component where the received power difference is determined to be greater than or equal to a threshold value.</p>

In the following description, configuration elements identical to those in Embodiment 1 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) are assigned the same reference numbers as in Embodiment 1, and descriptions thereof are omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0056">In the radio communication apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, frequency characteristic measuring section <b>53</b>-<b>1</b> measures the received power values of frequency components <b>1</b> through N of a pilot symbol contained in a signal received by antenna <b>1</b>, and inputs the received power values to weighting factor setting section <b>54</b> and a peak suppression frequency setting section <b>60</b>. Also, frequency characteristic measuring section <b>53</b>-<b>2</b> measures the received power values of frequency components <b>1</b> through N of a pilot symbol contained in a signal received by antenna <b>2</b>, and inputs the received power values to weighting factor setting section <b>54</b> and peak suppression frequency setting section <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0057">Peak suppression frequency setting section <b>60</b> compares the received power values of a plurality of frequency components between the antennas, and of the plurality of frequency components, sets a frequency component where the received power value of one antenna is lower by a predetermined value or more than the received power value of the other antenna as a peak suppression frequency component. If the PAPR of a post-IFFT signal is greater than or equal to a threshold value, a signal for suppressing peak power (peak suppression signal) is inserted in this peak suppression frequency component. Then, peak suppression frequency setting section <b>60</b> inputs the setting result to peak suppression signal generation sections <b>21</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>21</b>-<b>2</b>, and peak suppression signal insertion sections <b>22</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>22</b>-<b>2</b>. When a peak suppression frequency component is set in this way, a frequency component in which a peak suppression signal is inserted becomes a frequency component multiplied by a weighting factor of 0 in Embodiment 1, and also becomes a frequency component that is transmitted from an antenna whose propagation path quality is considerably lower than that of the other antenna and suffers major propagation path attenuation, enabling an increase in the PAPR to be suppressed without causing deterioration of reception quality on the communicating party side due to the effects of the peak suppression signal.</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0060">in accordance with this directive, peak suppression signal generation sections <b>21</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>21</b>-<b>2</b> generate a peak suppression signal. Based on the position on the frequency axis of a frequency component set for peak suppression and the position of peak power on the time axis, peak suppression signal generation sections <b>21</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>21</b>-<b>2</b> generate a peak suppression signal with a phase such that that frequency component signal has the opposite phase at the peak power position on the time axis. Also, peak suppression signal generation sections <b>21</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>21</b>-<b>2</b> make the amplitude of the peak suppression signal a value proportional to the PAPR value. Another peak suppression signal generation method that can be used is the method described in Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication No. 2001-237800, for example. Peak suppression signal generation sections <b>21</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>21</b>-<b>2</b> then input the generated peak suppression signals to peak suppression signal insertion sections <b>22</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>22</b>-<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0061">Peak suppression signal insertion sections <b>22</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>22</b>-<b>2</b> insert the peak suppression signal generated by peak suppression signal generation sections <b>21</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>21</b>-<b>2</b> respectively in a frequency component set by peak suppression frequency setting section <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0062">Thus, according to this embodiment, an increase in the PAPR can be suppressed without causing deterioration of reception quality on the communicating party side due to peak suppression signal insertion, and deterioration of error rate characteristics due to signal distortion caused by an increase in the PAPR can be suppressed.</p>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Embodiment 5</heading>
<p id="p-0063" num="0063">In this embodiment, a radio communication apparatus is described that suppresses an increase in the PAPR by means of a different method from those in Embodiments 3 and 4.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0064">The configuration of a radio communication apparatus according to this embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In the following description, configuration elements identical to those in Embodiment 1 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) are assigned the same reference numbers as in Embodiment 1, and descriptions thereof are omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0065">In the radio communication apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, if the PAPR of a post-IFFT signal is greater than or equal to a threshold value, an antenna selection section <b>23</b> combines a signal that has undergone IFFT processing by IFFT section <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> and a signal that has undergone IFFT processing by IFFT section <b>16</b>-<b>2</b>, and selects either antenna <b>1</b> or antenna <b>2</b> as the transmitting antenna for this combined signal. Antenna selection section <b>23</b> selects the antenna where the total power of all frequency components (that is, the total value of the propagation path qualities of all frequency components) is larger as the transmitting antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0066">The internal configuration of antenna selection section <b>23</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a PAPR measuring section <b>231</b> measures the PAPR value of a post-IFFT signal input from IFFT section <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> (the PAPR value of antenna <b>1</b>) and the PAPR value of a post-IFFT signal input from IFFT section <b>16</b>-<b>2</b> (the PAPR value of antenna <b>2</b>), and inputs the PAPR values to a threshold value determination section <b>232</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0067">Threshold value determination section <b>232</b> compares the antenna <b>1</b> PAPR value and the antenna <b>2</b> PAPR value with a threshold value, and if both PAPR values are less than the threshold value, connects SW<b>1</b> through SW<b>4</b> to the &#x201c;a&#x201d; side. Thus, when the antenna <b>1</b> PAPR value and antenna <b>2</b> PAPR value are both greater than or equal to the threshold value, in the same way as in Embodiment 1, a signal output from IFFT section <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> is input directly to GI insertion section <b>17</b>-<b>1</b>, and a signal output from IFFT section <b>16</b>-<b>2</b> is input directly to GI insertion section <b>17</b>-<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0068">On the other hand, if either the antenna <b>1</b> PAPR value or the antenna <b>2</b> PAPR value is greater than or equal to the threshold value, threshold value determination section <b>232</b> connects SW<b>1</b> through SW<b>4</b> to the &#x201c;b&#x201d; side, and also instructs a received power measuring section <b>234</b> to operate. Thus, in this case, a signal output from IFFT section <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> and a signal output from IFFT section <b>16</b>-<b>2</b> are both input to a combining section <b>233</b>, and combining section <b>233</b> combines these two signals. The combined signal is output to SW<b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0069">A pilot symbol extracted by pilot extraction section <b>52</b>-<b>1</b> and a pilot symbol extracted by pilot extraction section <b>52</b>-<b>2</b> are input to received power measuring section <b>234</b>. In accordance with a directive from threshold value determination section <b>232</b>, received power measuring section <b>234</b> measures the received power values of these pilot symbols (the received power value of antenna <b>1</b> and the received power value of antenna <b>2</b>) in the time domain, and inputs the received power values to a transmitting antenna selection section <b>235</b>. Thus, if the antenna <b>1</b> PAPR value and antenna <b>2</b> PAPR value are both less than the threshold value, received power measuring section <b>234</b> does not operate, and unnecessary power consumption is prevented. As the received power value measured in the time domain by received power measuring section <b>234</b> is the total power value for all frequency components, it is also possible for the total values of the received power of all frequency components measured by frequency characteristic measuring sections <b>53</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>53</b>-<b>2</b> to be used respectively as the antenna <b>1</b> received power value and the antenna <b>2</b> received power value.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0070">Transmitting antenna selection section <b>235</b> compares the antenna <b>1</b> received power value and antenna <b>2</b> received power value, and selects the antenna with the larger received power value. If the antenna <b>1</b> received power value and antenna <b>2</b> received power value are equal, antenna <b>1</b> is selected. That is to say, transmitting antenna selection section <b>235</b> connects SW<b>5</b> to the &#x201c;a&#x201d; side if the antenna <b>1</b> received power value is greater than or equal to the antenna <b>2</b> received power value, and connects SW<b>5</b> to the &#x201c;b&#x201d; side if the antenna <b>2</b> received power value is greater than the antenna <b>1</b> received power value. By this means, when either the antenna <b>1</b> PAPR value or the antenna <b>2</b> PAPR value is greater than or equal to the threshold value, the signal combined by combining section <b>233</b> is transmitted from either antenna <b>1</b> or antenna <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0071">Next the method of setting the threshold value used by threshold value determination section <b>232</b> will be described. When the power amplification characteristic of the transmitting amplifiers of transmit radio processing sections <b>18</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>18</b>-<b>2</b> is as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, distortion occurs in a transmit signal if the PAPR comes within the nonlinear region of the amplifier characteristic. Therefore, to prevent transmit signal distortion, the PAPR threshold value used by threshold value determination section <b>232</b> is set to an input backoff power value&#x2014;that is, a marginal power value from the average level in the linear region.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0072">A signal following combining by combining section <b>233</b> is the same as the signal input from modulation section <b>12</b> to FFT section <b>13</b>. Thus, in this embodiment, it is also possible to use a configuration whereby, if either the antenna <b>1</b> PAPR value or the antenna <b>2</b> PAPR value is greater than or equal to a threshold value, the signal input to FFT section <b>13</b> is transmitted directly instead of the combined signal.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0073">Thus, according to this embodiment, the occurrence of nonlinear distortion in a transmit signal due to an increase in the PAPR can be prevented. Also, a signal is transmitted from the antenna with the best propagation path quality for each frequency component only when nonlinear distortion does not occur, enabling an improvement in reception quality to be achieved dependably on the signal receiving side.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0074">In the above embodiments, a radio communication terminal apparatus may be indicated by &#x201c;UE,&#x201d; and a radio communication base station apparatus by &#x201c;Node B.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0075">In the above embodiments, a signal transmitted from a radio communication apparatus may be, in addition to a signal transmitted by means of a single carrier, an IFDMA (Interleaved Frequency Division Multiple Access) signal having frequency components distributed at equal intervals, a Distributed FDMA signal, or a Localized FDMA signal using a localized band.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0076">The function blocks used in the descriptions of the above embodiments are typically implemented as LSIs, which are integrated circuits. These may be implemented individually as single chips, or a single chip may incorporate some or all of them.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0077">Here, the term LSI has been used, but the terms IC, system LSI, super LSI, and ultra LSI may also be used according to differences in the degree of integration.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0078">The method of implementing integrated circuitry is not limited to LSI, and implementation by means of dedicated circuitry or a general-purpose processor may also be used. An FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) for which programming is possible after LSI fabrication, or a reconfigurable processor allowing reconfiguration of circuit cell connections and settings within an LSI, may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0079">In the event of the introduction of an integrated circuit implementation technology whereby LSI is replaced by a different technology as an advance in or derivation from, semiconductor technology, integration of the function blocks may of course be performed using that technology. The adaptation of biotechnology or the like is also a possibility.</p>
