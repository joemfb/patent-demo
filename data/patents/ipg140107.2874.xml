<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to polymerizable resin binders, particularly useful as foundry binders, processes for making foundry shapes by curing the binders in place after forming a foundry mold or core, foundry mixes and multi-part resin binder components or kits that are mixed on site to bind foundry aggregate, such as sand, in a desired shape.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Sand cores are used to form the internal cavities of a finished casting. When sand cores are placed in a mold and molten metal is introduced into the mold, a rapid thermal expansion of the sand in the sand cores takes place. As a result of the rapid thermal expansion of the sand in the sand core, the sand core cracks, and the molten metal runs into the cracks in the core, creating a fin projecting from the casting surface (in foundry terms, a &#x201c;vein&#x201d;) as the molten metal solidifies. These veining defects, caused by uncontrolled core sand thermal expansion, are most often controlled by anti-veining or expansion control agents, which are mixed uniformly with the sand and core sand binders prior to the formation of the sand cores themselves. Anti-veining or expansion control agents change the thermal coefficient of expansion of the sand core to control its cracking and reduce or eliminate the formation of veins.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For years, iron oxides were used in foundries to improve sand cores and the qualities of castings. Iron oxides proved to be advantageous in sand cores by reducing the formation of thermal expansion defects such as veining. Iron oxides in use include red iron oxide (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), also known as hematite, black iron oxide (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>), known as magnetite, and yellow ochre. The most common methods of employing such iron oxides are by addition of approximately 1% to 3% by weight to the core sand during mixing. The mechanism by which iron oxides improve the surface finish is not known. One theory is that the iron oxides increase the plasticity of the sand core during casting by formation of sand grain interfaces which deform, or give, without fracturing, thereby preventing cracks in the core which can form veins in the casting.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 4,735,973 discloses an additive for the foundry sands used to produce cores and molds which improves the quality of the castings by reducing thermal expansion and gas defects, thereby reducing the veins formed in a casting. The disclosed additive comprises a composition containing from about 15% to about 95% titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>), including a preferable additive comprising about 2% to about 38% silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>), about 5% to about 40% ferric oxide (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), about 15% to about 95% titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>), and about 2% to about 45% aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). The resulting sand cores are described as comprising about 80% to about 98% of core sand aggregates selected from a group consisting of silica sand, zircon sand, olivine sand, chromite sand, lake sand, bank sand, fused silica, and mixtures thereof, about 0.5% to about 10% of a core sand binder, and about 0.5% to about 5% of an additive composition containing from about 15% to about 95% titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>). The use of such additives in sand cores is described as reducing the casting defects associated with the use of plastic bonded and other core binder systems, increasing the strength of the resulting bonded core sand, and allowing a reduction in the amount of plastic binder required.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 5,911,269 discloses a method of making silica sand cores utilizing lithium-containing materials that provide a source of lithium oxide (Li<sub>2</sub>O) to improve the quality of castings by reducing sand core thermal expansion and the veins resulting therefrom in metal castings. The disclosed method of making sand cores comprises the steps of preparing an aggregate of sand core and a resin binder, and mixing into the aggregate a lithium-containing additive selected from a group consisting of .&#x3b1;.-spodumene, amblygonite, montebrasite, petalite, lepidolite, zinnwaldite, eucryptite and lithium carbonate, in the amount to provide from about 0.001% to about 2% of lithium oxide. The use of such a method and lithium oxide-containing additives is described as reducing the casting defects associated with thermal expansion of silica, including the formation of veins in the cavity and improving the surface finish of the castings.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Examples of commercially available anti-veining additives include VEINSEAL 14000 (IGC Technologies Inc., Milwaukee, Wis.). VEINSEAL 14000 comprises 60-70 wt. % SiO<sub>2</sub>, 10-20 wt. % Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, 15-25 wt. % Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, 10-25 wt. % TiO<sub>2 </sub>and 2-5 wt. % Li<sub>2</sub>O. Typical loadings of VEINSEAL in a foundry mold is about 1-5 wt. % on the total weight of the foundry aggregate. Unfortunately, the costs, even at this low dosage are relatively high. Other commercially available anti-veining agents include VEINSEAL 15000 from IGC Technologies, and VEINO Ashland Inc.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Described herein, in the preferred embodiment, is a casting method that yields vein-free products, the method includes a mold or a core that is essentially free of anti-veining agents.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One embodiment includes manufacturing a metal shape by contacting a liquid metal and a surface of a foundry core under conditions wherein vein defects occur, the surface of the foundry core carried by a foundry core layer that comprises a foundry aggregate, a combustible-organic material and a polyurethane resin, and the foundry core layer being essentially free of an anti-veining agent; cooling the liquid metal to a temperature below its melting point thereby forming a metal shape; and then removing the foundry core from the metal shape.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another embodiment includes casting vein-free metal shapes by determining conditions wherein vein defects occur; forming a foundry core that comprises a foundry aggregate, a combustible-organic material, a polyurethane resin, and that is essentially free of anti-veining agents; contacting a liquid metal with the foundry core under the conditions wherein vein defects occur; and then removing a cooled metal shape from the foundry core; wherein the metal shape is free of or substantially free of vein defects.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Still another embodiment includes manufacturing a metal shape by contacting a liquid metal with a foundry core and a foundry mold, that individually comprise a foundry aggregate, a combustible-organic material and a polyurethane resin, and are essentially free of an anti-veining agent; and then separating the metal shape from the foundry core and foundry mold.</p>

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Foundry shapes can be formed from a foundry mix, e.g., by the in situ polymerization of a polyol with an isocyanate, as an admixture with a foundry aggregate. In a preferred embodiment, the admixture of the polyol, isocyanate, and foundry aggregate further includes a polyurethane polymerization catalyst and a combustible-organic solid. The formation of the foundry mix typically involves the stepwise addition of the components to the foundry aggregate, e.g. sand, with mixing, to form a foundry mix that sets or cures to form a structurally sound shape over the course of a predetermined time, typically minutes. The admixing of the components can be either stepwise in the foundry aggregate or some of the components, e.g., the polyol component and/or the catalyst component, can be admixed prior to admixing with the foundry aggregate. The polyol-isocyanate components form a polyurethane resin that binds the foundry aggregate and permits the formation of a foundry shape useful in metal casting.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The foundry shape carries a foundry-shape surface on a foundry-shape layer. On pouring of a liquid metal into a foundry shape, the foundry-shape surface contacts the liquid metal and can provide a structural relief (shape) upon which the liquid metal solidifies. The foundry-shape layer that carries the foundry-shape surface can extend into the foundry shape up to 1 cm or about 1 cm. The foundry-shape layer is preferably free of or essentially free of anti-veining agents, and furthermore has preferably the same composition as the foundry shape. In some circumstances, the foundry-shape surface can be coated with a coating or wash that can be advantageous to the quality of the final cast metal product. For example, a core wash can be applied to the foundry shape (typically the foundry core) as a liquid suspension of a refractory material; the refractory material, for example, can be graphite, coke, mica, silica, aluminum oxide, magnesium oxide, talc, zircon flour and mixtures of these materials.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;conditions wherein vein defects occur&#x201d; means those conditions in casting a liquid metal upon a resin-bound, sand-based foundry shape, that is free of or essentially free of anti-veining agents, that yield a metal shape having vein defects. The casting &#x201c;conditions wherein vein defects occur&#x201d; can include those conditions where an anti-veining agent is typically added to the resin-bound, sand-based foundry shape to prevent or reduce the veining defects. Preferably, the &#x201c;conditions wherein vein defects occur&#x201d; are those where the foundry shape consists essentially of a foundry aggregate (e.g., silica sand) and an effective amount of a binder (e.g., a polyurethane resin). More preferably, the &#x201c;conditions wherein vein defects occur&#x201d; are those where the foundry shape consists of the foundry aggregate and an effective amount of the binder. Even more preferably, the &#x201c;conditions wherein vein defects occur&#x201d; include a foundry-shape layer and a foundry-shape surface that contacts molten metal which consists essentially of the foundry aggregate and the binder. Conditions where casting a liquid metal upon a resin-bound, sand-based foundry shape that consists essentially of the foundry aggregate and an effective amount of binder yields a metal shape free of or essentially free of veining defects are excluded from the definition of &#x201c;conditions wherein vein defects occur.&#x201d; Furthermore and as used herein, &#x201c;vein defects&#x201d; means those veining defects recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art of metal casting, and preferably recognized as reducible or preventable by the addition of an anti-veining agent to the foundry shape.</p>

This means, the foundry mix and foundry shape, the manufacture of which is described herein, are free of or essentially free of the anti-veining agent. Herein, a foundry shape that is &#x201c;essentially free of&#x201d; an anti-veining agent excludes added anti-veining agent(s) but may include unavoidable impurities in starting materials and essential ingredients. The unavoidable impurities might include not more than 0.5 wt. %, preferably not more than 0.1 wt %, more preferably not more than 0.05 wt % of an anti-veining agent or combined anti-veining agents in the foundry shape. The source and quality of the foundry aggregate may have some effect on the amount of unavoidable impurities in the foundry shape, as would be understood by one of ordinary skill. Notably, one of ordinary skill can draw a line between unavoidable impurities and added anti-veining agents. Herein, anti-veining agents include, for example, iron oxides (e.g., Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>), titanium dioxide, lithium oxide, sodium bicarbonate (NORACEL W 100), sodium carbonate, shale (e.g., U.S. Pat.

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an alternative embodiment and despite the observation that anti-veining agents are not necessary, the addition of anti-veining agents to the herein disclosed foundry mix or foundry shape is contemplated. This addition of materials that are known anti-veining agents does not provide a positive or a negative (excluding economic) affect on the anti-veining performance of the foundry shape. As such, these agents are considered non-performance additives.</p>

The specific oxygen protecting group is dependent on the chemical nature of the reactive surface oxygen, for example a hydroxyl functionality requires a different oxygen protecting group than does a carboxylate.

Specific examples of lignite-polyol suspensions include, but are not limited to, (1) an admixture of about 15 wt. % lignite; about 72 wt. % triethylene glycol; about 8 wt. % propylene carbonate (&#x201c;PC&#x201d;); and about 4 wt. % polyvinylpyrrolidone; (2) an admixture of about 22 wt. % lignite; about 64 wt. % triethylene glycol; about 7 wt. % propylene carbonate (&#x201c;PC&#x201d;); and about 6 wt. % polyvinylpyrrolidone; (3) an admixture of about 15 wt. % lignite; about 72 wt. % dipropylene glycol; about 8 wt. % propylene carbonate (&#x201c;PC&#x201d;); and about 4 wt. % polyvinylpyrrolidone; and (4) an admixture of about 10 wt. % lignite; about 77 wt. % JEFFOL G30-650; about 9 wt. % propylene carbonate (&#x201c;PC&#x201d;); and about 4 wt. % polyvinylpyrrolidone.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one embodiment, the dispersing agent is PEG-100 stearate at a concentration of about 0.1 to 25 wt. % based on the total weight of the lignite, dry basis, preferably about 0.5 to about 5 wt. %. The polyol, preferably triethylene glycol, is incorporated at a concentration of about 15 to about 90 wt. %, based on the total final weight of the lignite-polyol suspension, preferably of about 40 to about 70 wt. %. The thickening agent is preferably a waxy compound, e.g. PEG-150 distearate or PEG-150, at a concentration of about 1 to about 10 wt. %, or about 2 to about 10 wt. %, based on the total weight of the polyol, preferably the weight percent of the thickening agent is greater than about 3 wt. %, greater than about 3.75 wt. %, or greater than about 4.25 wt. %. In another preferred embodiment, the lignite-polyol suspension further comprises an alkali, which, theoretically, may increase the solubility of the humic acid in the polyol. Sodium hydroxide or a comparable alkaline solution is added to the dispersion medium (lignite carrier) at a concentration of active base from about 0.5 to 30 wt. %, or about 5 to about 15 wt. %, of the lignite. In yet another embodiment, the polyol is admixed with a polar organic solvent prior to heating and mixing with the dispersing agent. Preferably, the molar ratio of the solvent to the glycol is about 0.05 to about 9, about 0.1 to about 3, or about 0.5 to about 1.5. Preferably, the polar organic solvent does not affect the polyurethane polymerization. Examples of polar organic solvents that do not affect the polyurethane polymerization reaction are well know to those of ordinary skill in the art, some examples of polar organic solvent classes include secondary and tertiary alcohols, ketones, amides, amines, nitriles, acetates, ethers, and aldehydes. In one, non-limiting, example with triethylene glycol (&#x201c;TEG&#x201d;), the polar organic solvent is propylene carbonate (&#x201c;PC&#x201d;) and the molar ratio was 1.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one embodiment for preparing a foundry shape, the components (e.g., the combustible-organic material, the polyol, and the isocyanate) are individually admixed with the foundry aggregate. The resultant foundry mix is mixed until nearly homogeneous, and then formed into a foundry shape. In another embodiment, the lignite-polyol suspension and the isocyanate components are premixed, then admixed with the foundry aggregate. In yet another embodiment, the lignite-polyol suspension is premixed with the catalyst component, then admixed with the foundry aggregate before the isocyanate is added. In still another embodiment, the isocyanate is premixed with the catalyst component and then admixed with the foundry aggregate.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The foundry mix is then formed into a foundry shape. Generally in the art, the mold and the core are made from different foundry mixes. The mold mix commonly comprising a clay binder and the core mix commonly comprising a polymer binder. After casting, the majority of the spent foundry shape is removed from the cast shape by shake-out. During shake-out the majority of the mold breaks free from the casting and some of the core is removed. Often the core-binders are not destroyed during casting and must be physically broken from the internal areas of the core. Following the shake-out process and core-removal, the casting is cleaned, wherein residual aggregate is removed by primarily shot blasting. Here, metal flashing and aggregate is removed from the surface of the casting and metal is often adhered to the aggregate. This multi-step process for isolating a cast shape is time consuming, costly, as well as energy and material intensive. The herein described materials and methods significantly reduce the time and energy necessary for the isolation of a cast shape by improving the shake-out, the core removal process, and the number of foundry mixes necessary to make a shape. Preferably, the mold and the core are manufactured with the herein described foundry mix and after casting are cleanly broken from the cast shake during shake-out.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In a preferred embodiment, the foundry core is manufactured from the herein described foundry mix. Preferably, the binders in the core shape are destroyed by the heat of the liquid metal and following the solidification of the metal flow freely from the core area during shakeout. More preferably, about 30 to about 60% more aggregate is removed during shake-out when the herein described foundry mix is used to form the foundry shape than when the foundry shape is manufactured from an admixture consisting essentially of the foundry aggregate and a polyurethane resin. Even more preferably and possibly due to improved burn-out of the binder, the reclamation costs for the aggregate are decreased by about 20 to about 50%.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The metal casting (an article of manufacture) is preferably formed by pouring liquid metal onto the foundry shape. The processes of casting or contacting the liquid metal and the foundry shape is understood by one of ordinary skill of the art and the terms &#x201c;casting&#x201d;, &#x201c;contacting,&#x201d; and &#x201c;pouring onto&#x201d; have similar meanings. The metal making up the casting and/or the liquid can be any metal capable of being cast in an aggregate shape. Examples of metals include iron, steels, carbon steels, stainless steels, chromium steels, alloys, aluminum, titanium, zinc, copper, silver, gold, platinum, palladium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the liquid metal is poured at a sufficiently high temperature to facilitate the burnout of the core resin.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one embodiment, a metal shape can be made by contacting a liquid metal and a surface of a foundry core under conditions wherein vein defects occur. The surface of the foundry core, and/or preferably the foundry core layer, can include a foundry aggregate, a combustible-organic material and a polyurethane resin, but is essentially free of an anti-veining agent. After casting (contacting), the liquid metal is cooled to a temperature below its melting point and solidifies into a metal shape (used herein to mean the solid material). The foundry core can then be removed from the metal shape, for example by shake-out. Preferably, the entire foundry core has the same composition as the foundry core layer, and/or the surface of the foundry core, that is, the core includes the foundry aggregate, the combustible-organic solid and the polyurethane resin. Similarly, the foundry core should be essentially free of the anti-veining agent. Preferable combustible-organic materials are lignite, malt, glucose syrup, powdered sugar, and a mixture thereof; more preferably, lignite, glucose syrup, and a mixture thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The foundry shape, and preferably the core, include the foundry aggregate, the combustible-organic solid, and the reaction product of a polyol, and an isocyanate. The polyol and the isocyanate can be polymerized to form a polyurethane resin. The resin, admixed with the aggregate, can then be cured to yield a solid foundry shape (e.g., a core).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In another embodiment, the process for manufacturing the metal shape can include, first, determining the conditions where vein defects occur, for example, by test casting a metal shape in/on a foundry shape that consists of the foundry aggregate and a polyurethane resin. When the cast metal shape has one or more vein defects as a result of the casting conditions and foundry shape composition, these casting conditions have been determined to be conditions where vein defects occur. Under these conditions, the liquid metal is contacted with a foundry shape that includes a foundry aggregate, a combustible-organic material, a polyurethane resin, and that is free of or essentially free of anti-veining agents. After the metal solidifies, the foundry shape is removed from the cooled metal shape, e.g., by shaking out the aggregate. This casting, of the metal on the foundry shape that includes the foundry aggregate, combustible-organic material, and polyurethane resin, and that is essentially free of anti-veining agents casting, results in a metal shape that is free of or substantially free of vein defects.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Herein, &#x201c;substantially free of vein defects&#x201d; means the metal shape is largely but not necessarily free of vein defects observable by one of ordinary skill in casting metal shapes. Notably, small vein defects and large vein defects are distinguishable based on the height and width of the vein defect, and the shape of the metal part. Preferably, the metal shape that is substantially free of vein defects is free of large vein defects and is substantially free of small vein defects. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In yet another embodiment, the process for manufacturing the metal shape includes limiting the mechanical distortion of the foundry core during the casting of the metal shape. The distortion of the foundry core can be limited to a negative displacement (contraction) as opposed to the common positive displacement (expansion) associated with sand cores. For example, the distortion of the foundry core can be limited to less than 0.11 mm or less than 0.10 mm based on the Thermal Distortion Test described in Example 7. Preferably, the expansion of the foundry core is less than 0.09 mm, 0.08 mm, 0.07 mm, 0.06 mm, 0.05 mm, 0.04 mm, 0.03 mm, 0.02 mm, or 0.01 mm based on the Thermal Distortion Test (i.e., a maximum average expansion based on twelve trials). More preferably, the foundry core does not expand, that is the expansion is approximately 0.00 mm based on the Thermal Distortion Test. Alternatively, the foundry core contracts based on the Thermal Distortion Test.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In still another embodiment, the metal shape can be manufactured by contacting liquid metal with a foundry core and a foundry mold, that have the same composition. For example, the core and mold are formed from a mixture of a foundry aggregate, a combustible-organic material and a polyurethane resin, the mixture being essentially free of an anti-veining agent. The cooled metal shape can then be separated from the core and mold (e.g., shake out) and the aggregate recovered and recycled. The recycled aggregate can be formed into a new foundry core, that is, preferably, essentially free of an anti-veining agent. The formation of the new foundry core using the recycled aggregate can be the same process as the formation of the foundry core with new or non-recycled aggregate, for example admixing the recycled foundry aggregate, a combustible-organic material, a polyol, and an isocyanate; polymerizing the polyol and isocyanate to form the polyurethane resin; and then shaping the admixture into the foundry core. The processes can then be repeated, where liquid metal is cast (contacted) with the foundry core, the metal shape cooled and separated, and the aggregate recycled.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The compositions and processes described herein have been primarily described and illustrated in terms of their use in the foundry art, but those skilled in the art will recognize that the binder resins and binder resin-containing compositions described herein may also be utilized in other fields, including adhesives, coatings, and composites.</p>

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Step-Cone Castings were prepared as follows. A foundry mixture was prepared by admixing (A) a lignite-polyol suspension that includes about 10 wt % of lignite, about 77 wt % of Jeffol G30-650, about 9 wt % propylene carbonate, and about 4 wt % polyvinylpyrrolidone, (B) an isocyanate solution that includes about 10 wt % of propylene carbonate, about 90 wt % of MONDUR MR, and (C) silica sand (FL). N,N-Dimethylethylamine was used as a gaseous polymerization catalyst. The binder loading was 1.05 wt. % based on the total weight of the silica sand. The foundry mixture was formed into a cylindrical mold and a stepped, foundry core. In at least one example, a core wash of graphite powder was applied. Grey iron was then cast into the foundry shape (including the mold and core) at a pouring temperature of 2600&#xb0; F. The cast metal was then allowed to cool to about 500&#xb0; F., the aggregate was removed by shake out, and the shape was sawed in half to provide for unimpeded visual inspection of the part of the casting that contacted the foundry core.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Grading: The each cast part was evaluated, by eight individuals familiar with metal castings and vein defects associated with core castings, on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being no veining (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and 5 being heavy veining (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).

<heading id="h-0020" level="1">Example 7</heading>
<heading id="h-0021" level="1">Thermal Distortion Test</heading>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Uncoated disc-shaped core examples (50 mm dia. 8 mm thick) from various binder systems were supplied with a loading of 1.2 wt. % binder based on the weight of the sand. A Badger 55 round grain silica sand was used for all disc-shaped examples.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">A thermal distortion tester (TDT), as described in Ram rattan et al., American Foundry Society Transactions (2008) 483-492, was used to expose the 50 mm by 8 mm disc-shaped core examples to about 1000&#xb0; C. for 90 sec. To operate the TDT, the electrical power was switched on and the temperature control was adjusted to 1000&#xb1;10&#xb0; C. representing the cast iron/sand mold interfacial temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The predetermined load on the thermal distortion tester (TDT) was adjusted to simulate a specified force of molten metal acting on a mold (head pressure). A 15 cm head height of cast iron with a density of 0.69 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>provides a head pressure of 0.0103 MPa (Head Height*Metal Density). The load used during TDT was 331 g, and was calculated to represent a 15 cm (6 in) cast iron head height (Contact Area of TDT Hot Surface*Head Pressure). This particular head height was used to represent a head pressure typical with small to medium size iron castings.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The computer and data acquisition system was switched on for controlling, monitoring and plotting graphs of temperature/time versus distortion. The temperature was controlled using a K-type thermocouple at the hot surface. The test piece was inserted into the pivoting holder (gimbal) designed for holding the disc shaped specimen. The test piece was then automatically raised until direct symmetrical contact was made with the 2.00 cm dia. hot surface. This simultaneously engages the linear voltage displacement transducer (LVDT) and a laser that measure the distortion longitudinally. The data acquisition system automatically logged and plotted the distortion/temperature versus time curves. During the test, the predetermined load chosen to represent the force of molten metal pressing against the mold/core wall, presses on the gimbal, which is in contact with the circumference of the specimen, which presses the top of the specimen against the 2 cm dia. hot surface. Any downward movement of the gimbal is recorded as expansion (and appears as upward movement when plotted). Any upward movement of the gimbal, due to the specimen becoming plastic and distorting is recorded as plastic distortion (and appears as downward movement when plotted). Expansion (D<sub>E</sub>) and plastic distortion (D<sub>P</sub>) (in the longitudinal distortion) can be obtained from the thermal distortion curve (TDC). In this investigation, the total distortion (T<sub>D</sub>=&#x3a3;D<sub>E</sub>+&#x3a3;D<sub>P</sub>) was recorded.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The duration of the TDT was 90 seconds and then the head pressure was removed.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Nine binder examples were prepared and run under the Thermal Distortion Test, each example run twelve times. Examples 7-9 are representative of the herein described method. Table 2 provides the relative weight percentages for (A) an admixture of lignite and polyol. The uncoated disc-shaped core examples were then prepared by admixing (A) the admixture of lignite and polyol with (B) an isocyanate solution that includes about 10 wt % of propylene carbonate, about 90 wt % of MONDUR MR, and (C) silica sand; the uncoated disc-shaped core examples were then polymerized as described above.</p>
