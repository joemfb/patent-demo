<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method and system for allowing the setting of reservations and the pre-authorization of credit to purchase a desired service for which a reservation is made. A customer accesses a reservation system that is integrated with a credit authorization system. The customer may make a reservation and substantially simultaneously become pre-authorized to pay for services to be provided at the reservation by one of any number of credit providers. Pre-authorized credit and reservation information is then supplied to the service provider in advance of services being provided, expediting the overall transaction time and allowing for a secure and cardless transaction procedure. The reservation and preauthorization information are typically stored upon the reservation system and then passed to the point-of-sale systems, but other types of input/output storage devices could be used to perform this function.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to an integrated reservation, credit preauthorization and management system. The overall system allows a customer to make a reservation and be preapproved to incur a predesignated dollar amount of credit from a known credit account. The management component of the system generally allows a vendor, through the reservation system, to manage reservations and preauthorizations. The reservation and preauthorization information are preferably stored upon the reservation system and provided to the management system, such as a vendor's point-of-sale (&#x201c;POS&#x201d;) systems, upon direction or as otherwise automatically programmed into the overall system. The overall system is designed to provide a richer experience to both the customer and to the service provider.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Reservations to purchase services or products are customarily either made in person, by phone or through use of an on-line reservation system. It is to be understood that &#x201c;service&#x201d; is used throughout this specification as including both services and products, and should be so understood by a person of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing the basic principles of prior art reservation systems. The figure generally describes a customer <b>20</b> contacting a network, such as a phone or computer network <b>22</b>, to make a reservation with a particular service provider <b>24</b>. Using the system, the customer <b>20</b> selects a date and time for her reservation, submitting her request to the reservation system <b>22</b>. Once the information is received by the reservation system <b>22</b>, the reservation is verified, often against the reservation system's electronic database of available times and days for particular services. If the date or time is not available, the customer <b>20</b> is prompted by the reservation system <b>22</b> to select another date or time. If the date and time are available, the reservation system <b>22</b> reserves the reservation in known fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">On the day and time of the reservation, the customer will often travel to the service provider <b>24</b>, requesting and then receiving reserved and/or other services. The customer next often receives a bill for services provided, paying the bill by the tender of cash, check or credit card. Often, the customer then waits for the transaction to be completed by the receipt of change or authorization/verification of the check or that the credit account has sufficient credit to cover incurred charges.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When credit is used as a payment method, the typical credit authorization process limits the speed at which the transaction can take place. For instance, typically a customer receives a bill for services rendered. The customer, after reviewing the bill, must then often attract the attention of the service provider to hand a credit device, such as a card, to the service provider, who then must obtain an authorization from any one of several known credit authorizing systems. It is not uncommon for this total process to take in excess of several minutes. To obtain that authorization, a vendor normally runs the credit device and/or other account information through its POS or other type of known verifying system. Some examples of known POS systems are Micros, Aloha and Maitre'd. The process, while sometimes only taking seconds, can take much more time.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Once authorization has been achieved, a bill is provided to the customer, who then may add a gratuity and/or sign the receipt. Once that has occurred, the customer is generally free to leave. Once the customer has left, however, the vendor still often must enter an included gratuity, utilizing more of both the vendor's and the credit card authorization system's time and assets. Obviously, the prior art process is cumbersome to both the customer and provider.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The security of credit account information, identification information and perhaps other information is also always at issue in the traditional service provider-customer credit payment transaction process. The traditional transaction model usually requires payment by the use of an actual card or other instrument. Under this transaction model, the customer's credit card and, often times, some form of personal identification (such as a driver's license) leaves the possession of the customer at the time authorization is performed. Unscrupulous third-parties (including service provider staff, other customers, etc.) may then have access to the customer's credit account and personal identification information. With that access, it is possible for the third party to perpetrate any number of forms of identity theft and/or other fraud upon the customer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Also, under the traditional service provider-customer credit account transaction model, customers typically only become aware that their credit line has been or is about to be exceeded after a failed attempt for authorization occurs. For a customer, it may be embarrassing to find out that a proposed credit charge has been denied. A denied credit request also may be frustrating and worrisome to the service provider, who may question whether the customer will be able to ultimately tender payment for services rendered.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention addresses these and other issues raised by known systems. For instance, under a preferred embodiment of the inventive system, a customer will be informed prior to obtaining services from the service provider as to whether or not their chosen credit account has a sufficient credit line for the services to be provided. Also, under the preferred system, the service provider is never provided with the customer's account information. Rather, all the service provider receives is preauthorization information&#x2014;the account information remains securely stored within the reservation system. Also, by preauthorizing payment for services to be provided, the overall payment process will be streamlined, potentially eliminating the entire at-the-provider authorization step, saving both the vendor and customer time and effort.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention has several aspects and includes an integrated reservation, credit preauthorization and vendor information management system. The system allows a customer to make reservations with a service provider and to provide that service provider with information concerning preauthorized credit to pay for services to be purchased, with that information preferably being stored in the reservation system and provided to the service provider's management device, such as a POS, only as designed or needed. Preauthorization could concern credit issued on any account known to the system and for a dollar amount which could be ascertained in any number of fashions. When a customer arrives at a service provider, the system, typically through a POS or similar device, will alert the service provider that the customer has been granted preapproved credit. With that information, payment of the final bill should be facilitated. Facilitation could include the automatic printing of a final bill with the preauthorization information, tip line, comment line, etc., and signature line already included thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Typically, a customer may access a reservation system in a number of fashions. A customer may call a service provider directly; a customer may place a telephone call to a reservation clearing house; a customer may access an internet/www based reservation system; etc. The concepts of the present system will work with any of these and other types of reservation systems. Nevertheless, the system will be described in connection with a customer accessing a computer network-based reservation system.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Upon accessing the reservation system, a customer can register to become an authorized system user. During the registration process, general personal information, such as name and contact information may be gathered. The customer can preferably view a list of subscribing service providers, such as restaurants, automotive repair shops, health clubs, personal hygiene professionals, etc., and the menu of services each provides. If desired and registered, the customer can next attempt to make a reservation to purchase an offered service, requesting a date and time to have that service provided and/or other requests, such as specific seat and table preferences, etc. At the time the reservation is made, the customer may preferably next be prompted to select a credit account payment option. If the customer does not choose that option or if such an option is unavailable from the selected provider or to the customer, the reservation will simply be completed. Should the preauthorized credit account payment option be chosen, however, the customer will be prompted to make additional selections.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">At this point, the customer preferably has several options to potentially pursue. If a returning customer, the customer may select from a menu or other similar device a credit account previously registered with the system and which the customer wishes to utilize for the then under-consideration transaction. A second option preferably available to the customer is to supply the system with information concerning a new or different preexisting credit account. If a customer chooses to use a preexisting credit account, the customer is prompted to provide required identification information into the reservation system. The system will then perform appropriate verification of the information.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">If there is sufficient credit on a selected account, a preauthorization is awarded, and the reservation information being supplied to and stored as a functional unit usually by the reservation system. The customer and perhaps the service provider may also be provided the preauthorization and reservation information for its records.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A third option available to a customer is to apply for instant or other credit through the system. In this situation, the customer is prompted to complete a credit application. The system then conducts a credit check and/or performs other known operations. The credit issuing system, which may be part of the overall reservation system or a stand-alone system, will approve or deny the customer's request for credit based upon any number of prerequisites and system settings, as are generally known in the industry. If the customer's credit application is denied, the customer is so notified and may still request preauthorization with use of a preexisting credit account or request a non-credit preauthorization reservation. If new credit is approved, the customer is notified of the credit limit for the new account and a credit authorization and other information is sent to the reservation system, as generally described above. The system may also provide the customer with new account information and/or devices, such as an account number or credit card, which could be used to pay for purchases made outside of the overall system. Once issued by the system, a customer is free to make reservations and have credit authorizations issued to selected service providers operating within the system, up to the customer's authorized credit limit on any given account.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The dollar amount of credit that may be preauthorized is dependent upon a number of factors. First, a preauthorized dollar amount could be requested by the customer and/or service provider. Additionally, for customers that have sufficiently high credit ratings, the system could preferably authorize any amount actually charged during the reservation, up to predetermined security ceilings. The system could also calculate a dollar amount to be preauthorized utilizing reservation information and/or perhaps other metrics. For instance, a service provider may track the average cost of services typically rendered. That figure may be stored within the overall system and may be used to calculate the amount of preauthorized credit to be awarded any customer who makes a reservation at that or similar service providers. Other metrics may also be utilized, as will be understood by those skilled in the art. How much credit shall be preauthorized and how that figure is arrived at is a dynamic that will be left to and is well within the skill of those working in this art. Suffice it to say, however, that the amount of credit which will be preauthorized through the system will be dictated by customer preferences, member service provider preferences, reservation information or some combination thereof, in addition to other metrics or input data that may be used to determine the amount of credit to be preauthorized.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">With reference now to a customer receiving reserved services, at an appointed time and day, the customer may arrive at the service provider and identify him/herself as the customer having previously made a reservation. Unique customer information (i.e., a code, biometric, call back, etc.) may next be provided to the vendor, perhaps by entering the data into the provider's management system. That system may preferably be programmed to then query the reservation system and/or an associated database to determine if in fact the customer has a reservation and if that customer has received preauthorization to pay for services to be provided with credit. Retrieved information is generally forwarded back to the vendor's management system for use during the then-to-be-concluded transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Next, the customer orders and receives requested services. The customer finally requests a bill for services rendered. The service provider finalizes the service request, usually on its POS system. That system recognizes the customer's transaction as a pre-authorized credit payment and issues a specialized bill for services rendered. The customer signs the special receipt, having the option to leave an additional tip, and leaves the service provider. The service provider completes the transaction by submitting the final customer-authorized total payment and perhaps other desired information to the reservation system. That system will then preferably send required information to an associated credit acquisition or other similar system for payment.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Yet another aspect of the present invention allows for the payment of services by a third-party to the transaction. For example, a party may register on the system, make a reservation, and request credit for services to be provided to another. This aspect of the invention may be most attractive to parents making reservations for and paying for services or products to be consumed by a child.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present invention can be used in conjunction with all service providers that take reservations. For example, the present invention can be used with restaurant services to provide a system of making reservations and for preauthorization of credit to be used to pay for services reserved. In practice, a customer may access the integrated reservation system to select a participating restaurant and to make a reservation. The customer is then given the same options as described above: continue with just a reservation or make a reservation in conjunction with preauthorizing a credit payment for services reserved and to be purchased. On the date of the reservation, the customer travels to the restaurant and identifies him/herself as having a reservation. Upon verification of that reservation, the customer is seated and orders a meal. After the meal, the customer requests the bill. The restaurant's management or other system recognizes the customer as pre-authorized for credit and generates a unique check for the customer to sign. The customer then receives the check and has the option to add a tip. The customer next signs the bill and then leaves the restaurant. The restaurant enters, either manually or automatically, the final total of the bill and perhaps other information into its management system, which can transmit data to the reservation system, credit acquirer and/or other appropriate systems. The reservation system, credit acquirer or other system transmits payment to the restaurant and bills the customer for that service payment. The entire payment process occurs without the service provider ever being privy to the customer's credit account information and without the need of the customer providing the restaurant with a credit card or similar device.</p>

<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It should be understood that the drawings are not necessarily to scale. In certain instances, details which are not necessary for an understanding of the invention or which render other details difficult to perceive may have been omitted. It should be understood, of course, that the invention is not necessarily limited to the particular embodiments illustrated in the drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram showing some of the principles of the preferred integrated reservation and preauthorized credit method and management system. Customer <b>26</b> preferably first accesses a reservation system <b>28</b>. The reservation system <b>28</b>, whether phone, Internet or other network based system, first prompts an existing system customer <b>26</b> to enter identification information or prompts a new customer <b>26</b> to register as a new user on the reservation system <b>28</b>. In the latter scenario, the reservation system <b>28</b> will request a series of input from customer <b>26</b>, which may include personal identification information (e.g., name, address, phone number, e-mail address, etc.), the selection of a unique personal identification code or name (e.g., username), and a password or other personal identification information, such as a call back number, a voice recognition print or other biometric information, caller identification information, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Once registered, the reservation system <b>28</b> will usually next prompt the customer <b>26</b> to select a desired service provider and enter reservation information (e.g., location, date, time, services desired, etc.). Once a reservation is selected and verified as available, the system usually moves to a credit preauthorization processing step.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The reservation system <b>28</b> preferably next prompts the customer to pay for services to be provided at an available reservation through a preauthorized credit option. If the customer selects that option, the customer is asked to either apply for credit through the system (process described above) <b>31</b>, to select a preexisting credit account already registered with the system or to enter information concerning a preexisting credit account into the system. Once an account is selected, the system checks to determine that account has a sufficient available credit limit. If so, preauthorization of at least some credit is granted. Next, preauthorization information, along with the reservation information, is preferably provided to the reservation system. In another embodiment of the invention, that same information could simultaneously be provided to member service provider <b>32</b> and/or customer <b>26</b>. In yet another embodiment of the invention, the reservation and preauthorization information could be provided first to member service provider <b>32</b>, and then, perhaps, subsequently to the reservation system <b>28</b> and customer <b>26</b>. If preauthorization is denied, only the customer is notified, who may attempt to receive preauthorization through another credit account or simply have the reservation, without preauthorization of credit, sent to the reservation system <b>28</b> and/or member service provider <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As explained, the customer <b>26</b> can also apply for and receive a new line of credit through the system. If the customer <b>26</b> applies for new credit, the credit authorizing system <b>30</b> will typically communicate with a credit issuing system <b>31</b>. In this situation, first a credit application must typically be completed by the customer <b>26</b>. The credit issuing system <b>31</b>, using that customer information and other available information, next determines whether to issue new credit, and can communicate approval or rejection of the credit application to customer <b>26</b> directly, through the credit authorizing system <b>30</b> or through the reservation system <b>28</b> or any combination thereof. If the credit application is denied, the reservation system <b>28</b> typically shall store only reservation information and shall only supply that information to member service provider <b>32</b>. The reservation system will provide confirmation of the reservation or a request to select a new reservation, if a conflict exists, to customer <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the reservation system <b>28</b>, credit authorizing system <b>30</b> and credit issuing system <b>31</b> could all be part of a single system, may be separate systems, or may simply be integrated or unintegrated components of much larger overall systems. The actual configurations of systems which perform the disclosed functions do not and should not be considered to limit the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">If customer <b>26</b> selects the pre-authorized credit option and credit is approved, credit information, such as an authorization for a pre-selected amount, is sent from the credit authorizing system <b>30</b> to the reservation system <b>28</b> and/or member service provider <b>32</b>. The reservation system <b>28</b> and/or member service provider <b>32</b> may receive the preauthorization and other information in any number of ways. Typically, such information will be received with the reservation information. Those pieces of information then can be stored for later retrieval and use. The preauthorization and reservation information may be received as a functional unit and may be stored as a functional unit, but that need not be the case. Most preferably, the information is received by and stored upon a management device, such as a service provider's POS system.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As will be understood by those skilled in the art and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the management device <b>74</b> includes a memory <b>76</b>, preferably having random access capabilities, and a display <b>78</b>, preferably a viewing screen of known configuration. The management device <b>74</b> also may have a printing device <b>80</b> of known configuration and functionality. Management device <b>74</b> also preferably includes a device which allows the service provider to input information into the device, such as a keyboard <b>82</b> or other known device. The management device <b>74</b> is in communication, via a network connection <b>82</b>, with reservation system <b>28</b> and/or credit authorizing system <b>30</b> and/or credit issuing system <b>31</b> and/or credit acquisition system (not shown). Information received through network connection <b>82</b> can be stored upon memory <b>76</b>, displayed upon display <b>78</b> and printed upon medium provided as part of printer <b>80</b>. Preferably, device <b>74</b> stores received preauthorization, reservation and other desired information in memory <b>76</b> as a functional unit, i.e., logically related. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that, though shown as a single unit, management device <b>74</b> may, instead, be comprised of many separate functional components, all of which taken together are configured to create the management device <b>74</b>. Further, combinations of several but not all devices into a single package very well could occur and is to be understood as being within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">With specific reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a preferred embodiment of the overall architecture of a preferred system, at least parts of which have already been described, will now be discussed. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, a basic component of the overall system is the reservation system <b>100</b>. That system can either include or can otherwise seamlessly communicate with a database <b>102</b>, preauthorization system <b>104</b>, vendors <b>106</b>, <b>107</b>, <b>108</b>, customers <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, and either directly (not shown) or indirectly, credit acquisition <b>116</b> and credit issuing system <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As has been explained and as will be understood by those skilled in the art, any number of customers <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> can simultaneously communicate with the reservation system <b>100</b> through any number of communication protocols. The reservation system <b>100</b> can likewise communicate with the database <b>102</b> and, either through the database or directly, the preauthorization system <b>104</b> and the credit issuing system <b>118</b>. Preauthorization system <b>104</b> and credit issuing system <b>118</b> can also communicate directly, in another of the preferred embodiments, with customers <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>. Such communication may or may not be necessary, depending upon specific implementation of the system. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, customers <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> can communicate with the reservation system <b>100</b> as needed to make, review, update, modify, cancel or otherwise change reservations. The reservation system <b>100</b> can also communicate on an as-needed basis with customer <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, individually, as a group comprised of less than all customers, or a group comprised of all customers and/or others, depending upon any particular application or communication need.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The reservation system <b>100</b> also may communicate with credit acquisition system <b>116</b>, either directly (not shown) or indirectly through the database <b>102</b>. Credit acquisition system <b>116</b> may also communicate directly or indirectly with customers <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>, on an as-needed basis.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Reservation system <b>100</b> also preferably may have a constant line of communication with all vendors <b>106</b>, <b>107</b> and <b>108</b> participating in the system. Vendors, <b>106</b>, <b>107</b> and <b>108</b> may also bypass certain portions of the reservation system <b>100</b> and communicate directly with database <b>102</b> (not shown), preauthorization system <b>104</b> (not shown) and credit issuing system <b>118</b> (not shown). Vendors <b>106</b>, <b>107</b> and <b>108</b> may also, as necessary, communicate with credit acquisition system <b>116</b> directly or indirectly through the reservation system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As will be understood by those skilled in the art, the overall preferred architecture set forth in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is provided simply for illustrative purposes and could have any number of communication scenarios. Further, it is to be understood that the system can accommodate virtually any number of customers and any number of vendors. Further, one of skill in the art would understand that, within the reservation system and/or within an associated database, information would be stored in a logical manner which would facilitate retrieval by an individual, customer, vendor or others. Such could be accomplished through any number of known data structures, memory partitioning systems or in other ways known in the field.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flowchart illustrating the function of a preferred integrated reservation and credit authorizing system. Customer accesses the system in one of several typical and known ways in the art <b>35</b>. The system requests input <b>36</b> from the customer. If the customer is a new user, the system will prompt the customer to register on the system, requiring the customer to input contact information. Once recognized, the system will prompt the customer to enter reservation information. The system <b>34</b> will then determine whether the requested service provider is a member of the credit authorizing system <b>38</b>. If not, the process of making the reservation is completed <b>40</b>, i.e., the reservation is confirmed and information regarding the reservation is sent to the customer, reservation system and service provider. If the requested service provider is a member of the credit authorizing system, the customer is prompted to use preauthorized credit to pay for service(s) to be received at the reservation. If the customer does not select the preauthorized credit option, the customer may opt-out and complete the reservation <b>44</b>. If the customer chooses the preauthorized credit option, the customer will be prompted to provide credit account information <b>42</b>. Next, the system must determine the amount of credit to be approved <b>45</b>. The system can determine this amount based upon any number of metrics, as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">If preauthorization is denied, the customer is notified and is prompted to either supply different credit account information to attempt to achieve preauthorization or more simply complete her reservation <b>48</b>. If credit is approved, the preapproval and reservation information will typically be sent to the customer, the reservation system and, perhaps, the member service provider <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In another preferred embodiment of the reservation system (not shown), the ability to store meal logs for taxation or other archival purposes may be provided. In this embodiment, customers will be prompted by the reservation system, usually while making a reservation, but perhaps thereafter as well, to state whether the reservation will be for tax-deductible or other purposes. Other descriptive information could also be added to the reservation record. If information is to be added, the customer will be prompted to provide such information. The overall system will maintain a log and provide reporting as to completed reservations, providing inputted and desired information to customers, companies and/or selected other entities. The described functionality will eliminate the need for customer, company or other tracking entity to keep a separate log of fees expended on events purchased through the reservation system, e.g., tax-deductible services, etc. Once again, this functionality will lead to a richer value-added customer experience.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">While the system has been described as having a reservation made first and a request for credit and/or preauthorization occurring second, one working in the art will realize that many of the above described steps can and often will be performed in different and varied orders, with no impact upon overall feasibility of the preferred process.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a preferred flow process of the preferred invention once the customer has arrived at a member service provider. Once at a service provider location <b>54</b>, the customer identifies herself (using traditional or non-traditional forms of identification) as a customer with a reservation <b>56</b>, requesting provision of reserved and/or additional services <b>58</b>. The service provider enters a customer's service request into its management system, such as a POS system <b>60</b>, which will preferably query the integrated reservation system for necessary information and verification. In this example, the customer has chosen to use preauthorized credit and the overall system alerts the provider to this fact so that payment for services to be rendered will occur as anticipated by the customer. The customer next receives requested and perhaps additional services <b>62</b>. The customer then requests a bill for services provided <b>64</b>. The provider's system generates a special bill that indicates payment has been preauthorized with a designated credit account <b>66</b>. The special bill may provide for signature of the customer, the addition of a gratuity, etc. The customer usually will sign the special bill, perhaps leaves a gratuity, and exits the service provider <b>68</b>. The final bill total and other desired information is entered by the service provider onto its system <b>70</b>. Payment is issued to service provider <b>72</b> in a traditional manner and as is well known in the trade <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The invention may also be used as a marketing tool for services providers or others. Marketing programs could include e-mail marketing, customer profiling, referral marketing, multi-channel marketing and gift and loyalty programs. Through the described system, an efficient method of identifying, tracking customer recentness, frequency and amount of money spent, as well as categorizing customers and their preferences, can be provided, as will be understood by one of skill in the art. Through the described system, one could also market differently to each category of customers and reward customers for their desired behaviors, as will be understood by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">For instance, member service providers may provide advertising or incentive programs to be used in conjunction with the overall system. Advertising by an interested service provider may be placed as in-line text, banner, pop-up window advertising and/or other electronic means onto a graphical user interface connecting to the system. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, the system could also be designed to create and send marketing campaigns on behalf of participating service providers or others.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Another such campaign could be the marketing of special events for a service provider. The recipient of e-mail concerning such an event could simply respond to the marketing material, automatically creating a reservation for that event. Events that might be the subject of such marketing campaigns could be e-birthday cards, e-holiday cards, discount coupon advertisements, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Preferably, the reservation system will also enable customers to easily invite others, such as friends or co-workers to planned events which have been reserved through the system. For instance, customers could be able to select a service provider from the system's on-line database and make a reservation. The customer then could create a list of invitees with corresponding e-mail addresses, each of which would be saved by the system. The system would then generate invitations to the reserved event, sending those invitations to each of the invitees set forth on the customer's list. Invitees could then simply respond to their invitation to RSVP for the event. Preferably, once the customer's deadline for the RSVP has passed, the overall reservation will be set in the system, with the service provider's management system being able to obtain necessary information as desired. Thereafter, confirmations could preferably be sent to invitees and the customer, with automatic updates, reminders and other similar electronic notifications being sent as desired, either by the service provider, reservation system, customer or all three. Obviously, once the invitees' contact information is added to the overall system, they too could be marketed to through the system as outlined above.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As should be understood, an interested service provider may also provide promotions, such as incentive/reward point systems and/or other service discounts through the reservation system. The reservation system could transmit such promotional information (e.g., discounts) to the member service provider to be applied to a bill for services to be rendered a given customer or in other ways customary in the trade. Preferably, such a system would be directly integrated with a dedicated management device.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The inventive system may also be used by the member service providers and/or other third parties to track customer purchasing trends, payment trends, etc. Such information can later be used for purposes of direct marketing, through electronic mail or otherwise and/or through sponsored advertising with related Internet links of related and/or competing service providers.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In another embodiment of the present invention, customers could receive frequent dining points to be tracked by the system by either registering an existing credit card with the reservation system and using it as a form of payment, or by making a reservation through the system. Either way, customers can receive points automatically and transparently when they purchase services from a participating service provider. A customer could obtain points by simply walking into a service provider and paying for services purchased with a registered credit card or other registered device. Upon joining a service provider's loyalty program, each time the customer frequents an establishment operating under the loyalty program, they could preferably receive an e-mail confirming the number of loyalty program points added to their account.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In another embodiment, a marketing campaign could be established to allow the purchase of gift cards or certificates.
