<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A terminal apparatus (<b>1</b>) which is a radio transmitting/receiving apparatus receives, from a femto cell base station (home eNB), a pilot channel signal for reception quality measurement and a synchronization channel signal for synchronization. The terminal apparatus (<b>1</b>) has a whitelist stored therein indicative of an accessible femto cell, and determines whether or not a CSG cell of handover destination is accessible based on a PCI of the CSG cell acquired from the synchronization channel and the whitelist. The terminal apparatus (<b>1</b>) then adds the PCI and a CGI to a measurement report for reception quality, and transmits the measurement report to a macro eNB (base station apparatus (<b>2</b>)). In this way, it is possible to suppress wasteful signaling and prevent unnecessary resources from being reserved even when two or more CSG cells that use the same PCI are present in the macro cell.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventionally, the Long Term Evolution (LTE) system is known as a network system for wireless communication between a base station and a terminal apparatus. The LTE system is a mobile communication system of next generation evolved from the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) and is intended to provide more improved mobile communication services.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the LTE, in addition to a macro cell wireless communication base station apparatus (Evolved NodeB, or eNB) that is primarily located outdoors and supports a larger cell diameter, it is under consideration to provide a femto cell wireless communication base station apparatus, which supports a cell diameter on the order of tens of meters, in indoor facilities such as a residence, an office, a restaurant, and a shopping center. Some femto cell wireless communication base station apparatuses under consideration in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) permit limited groups of members to access the base station apparatuses. Such cells are referred to as a Closed Subscriber Group cell, or CSG cell. A wireless communication base station apparatus that forms a CSG cell is referred to as a Home Evoled NodeB, or HeNB. The macro eNB can, for example, manage two or more different frequency bands (f<b>1</b>, f<b>2</b>, . . . , fn), and the home eNB may be located on a frequency f<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A wireless communication terminal apparatus (User Equipment, or UE) permitted to have an access is controlled from the network so as to connect to the home eNB. Specifically, once in the area of the CSG cell, the terminal apparatus is controlled to preferentially connect to the home eNB even if the terminal apparatus can receive radio signals from the eNB. A list of CSG cells that the terminal is permitted to access is referred to as a whitelist. Each of terminal apparatuses has its own whitelist.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Description will now be made to a control method of performing a handover from a macro eNB to a home eNB in a conventional LTE. (refer to, for example, Patent Literature 1 and Non-Patent Literature 1)</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An active UE generally receives a measurement control message through a Dedicated Control Channel, or DCCH, from the eNB to which the UE is connected. The measurement control message provides settings for taking reception quality measurements of the current cell and an adjacent cell. The measurement control message includes parameters such as a frequency and a system to be measured, event information that triggers transmission of a measurement report to the base station, a signal used in the measurement, and a duration (gap) for performing the measurement. The UE measures reception quality of the adjacent cell through a pilot channel (Common Pilot Channel, or CPICH) according to the settings from the measurement control message, and transmits the reception quality measurement result in a report (measurement report) to the eNB in a periodical manner or triggered by a configured event.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is assumed here that the UE moves to the vicinity of the border of the CSG cell. The UE measures the reception quality of the CSG cell, during which the UE acquires a physical cell ID (Physical Cell Identity, or PCI) of the CSG cell by receiving a Synchronization Channel, or SCH. In particular, one PCI is determined among 510 PCIs by a combination of a signal pattern of a Primary Synchronization Channel (P-SCH) and a pattern of a pair of (S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>) or (S<b>2</b>, S<b>1</b>) determined from an Secondary Synchronization Channel (S-SCH). The UE then notifies the macro eNB of the PCI of the CSG cell subjected to the measurement and the measurement result.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The macro eNB retains a list of CSG cells contained in the macro cell, and the list of CSG cells include PCIs for each home eNB and a Cell Global Identity, or CGI. The macro eNB that has received the measurement result of the CSG cell notified by the UE determines a home eNB that has the corresponding PCI from the list of CSG cells contained in the macro cell, and transmits an inquiry (HO request) of whether the UE may be allowed to perform a handover via a Mobility Management Entity (MME)/Gateway (GW) to the home eNB. If the handover of the UE is to be permitted; the home eNB that has received the HO request reserves in advance wireless resources appropriate for services provided to the UE, performs acceptance control, and transmits a response (an ACK to the HO request) that permits the handover of the UE via the MME/GW to the macro eNB.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Upon receiving the ACK to the HO request from the home eNB, the macro eNB transmits an instruction (HO command) causing a transfer to the CSG cell to the UE, and the UE transmits a random access preamble (RACH preamble) in order to establish synchronization with the specified home eNB. Thereafter, when the UE receives a response (random access response, or RACH response) from the home eNB, the UE establishes synchronization with the home eNB and an uplink transmission opportunity is assigned to the UE from the home eNB. Once the synchronization is established, the UE transmits a signal (HO confirmation) indicative of the completion of handover to the home eNB.</p>

<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the conventional handover control method, however, UEs deliver reports to eNBs with reference to only PCIs of CSG cells. Therefore, if two or more CSG cells that use the same PCI are present in the macro cell for example, the macro eNB may transmit HO requests to more than one home eNB in response to the measurement report sent from the UE. In such a case, there may be wasteful signaling to home eNBs different from the home eNB on which the UE actually measured the reception quality. Further, home eNBs, which are different from the home eNB on which the UE actually measured the reception quality, may reserve unnecessary resources for the UE.</p>

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The present invention will now be described in detail. However, the detailed description below and attached drawings are not intended to limit the present invention. Rather, the scope of the invention is defined by the attached claims.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The radio transmitting/receiving apparatus according to the invention comprises: a reception unit for receiving, from a macro cell base station, an instruction for handover to a femto cell contained in a macro cell and receiving, from a femto cell base station, a pilot channel signal for measurement at the femto cell and a synchronization channel signal for synchronization; a storage unit for storing a list indicative of an accessible femto cell among femto cells contained in the macro cell; a determination unit for determining whether or not a femto cell of handover destination is accessible based on a physical cell ID of the femto cell acquired from the received synchronization channel and the list; a measurement report creating unit for adding a physical cell ID and a unique cell ID to a measurement report indicative of a result of measurements taken by means of the pilot channel signal, the physical cell ID being acquired from the synchronization channel and being indicative of a femto cell from which a signal is being received and the unique cell ID being for uniquely identifying a femto cell contained in the macro cell and being indicative of the femto cell of handover destination determined to be accessible; and a transmission unit for transmitting the measurement report to the macro cell.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">With this configuration, not only the physical cell ID (such as PCI) of a femto cell (such as a CSG cell) from which a signal is being received, but also a unique cell ID (such as CGI) of the femto cell of handover destination is added to the measurement report of the radio quality. Therefore, even when two or more CSG cells that use the same PCI are present in the macro cell for example, an accessible CSG cell (a CSG cell of handover destination) can be identified based on the CGI. In this way, it is possible to suppress wasteful signaling to home eNBs of inaccessible CSG cells and prevent unnecessary resources from being reserved.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The present invention adds not only the physical cell ID of a femto cell from which a signal is being received but also a unique cell ID of the femto cell of handover destination to the measurement report, and can thereby suppress wasteful signaling and prevent unnecessary resources from being reserved.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A wireless communication system according to embodiments of the present invention will now be described below with reference to drawings. The wireless communication system according to the embodiments includes a terminal apparatus with radio transmitting/receiving functions (such as mobile phones and PDA devices) and a base station apparatus with radio transmitting/receiving functions. The terminal apparatus and the base station apparatus are also considered as a radio transmitting/receiving apparatus.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">(First Embodiment)</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A wireless communication system according to a first embodiment of the present invention will now be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 6</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing a configuration of a terminal apparatus <b>1</b> according to the embodiment; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram for illustrating a cell arrangement according to the embodiment; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram showing a configuration of a base station apparatus <b>2</b> according to the embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">First, a cell arrangement according to the embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In an example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a macro eNB manages macro cells having two different frequency bands (f<b>1</b>, f<b>2</b>), and CSG cells managed by two home eNBs (HeNB <b>1</b> and HeNB <b>2</b>) are both located on the macro cell of frequency f<b>1</b>. PCIs of the two CSG cells are both &#x201c;PCI #<b>2</b>&#x201d; and both PCIs are the same. In other words, two CSG cells that use the same PCI are present in one macro cell in this case. Meanwhile, CGIs of the two CSG cells are &#x201c;CGI #<b>3</b>&#x201d; for one CSG cell and &#x201c;CGI #<b>6</b>&#x201d; for the other and the two CGIs are different. Here, the macro eNB corresponds to a macro cell base station of the invention. The CSG cell corresponds to a femto cell of the invention, and the home eNB corresponds to a femto cell base station of the invention. Further, the PCI corresponds to a physical cell ID of the invention, and the CGI corresponds to a unique cell ID of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Next, a configuration of the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> according to the embodiment will be described with reference to the block diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> (UE) comprises a reception unit <b>10</b>, a PCI acquisition unit <b>11</b>, a whitelist storage unit <b>12</b>, a determination unit <b>13</b>, a measurement unit <b>14</b>, a measurement report creating unit <b>15</b>, and a transmission unit <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The reception unit <b>10</b> receives a pilot channel for reception quality measurement at a CSG cell as well as a synchronization channel for PCI acquisition from a home eNB, and receives a handover command (HO command) from the macro eNB.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The PCI acquisition unit <b>11</b> acquires a PCI from the synchronization channel information input from the reception unit <b>10</b>, and outputs the acquired PCI to the determination unit <b>13</b> and the measurement report creating unit <b>15</b>. The whitelist storage unit <b>12</b> stores a list of PCIs and CGIs of CSG cells that the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> is permitted to access.

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The determination unit <b>13</b> determines a CGI of a CSG cell accessible to the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> based on the PCI input from the PCI acquisition unit <b>11</b> and the information input from the whitelist storage unit <b>12</b>, and outputs the CGI to the measurement report creating unit <b>15</b>. The measurement unit <b>14</b> measures reception quality based on the pilot channel input from the reception unit <b>10</b>, and outputs the result to the measurement report creating unit <b>15</b>.</p>

The created measurement report is output to the transmission unit <b>16</b>. The transmission unit <b>16</b> transmits the measurement report input from the measurement report creating unit <b>15</b> to the macro eNB through an antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Next, a configuration of the base station apparatus <b>2</b> according to the embodiment will be described with reference to the block diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) comprises a transmission unit <b>20</b>, a reception unit <b>21</b>, a CSG cell list storage unit <b>22</b>, a determination unit <b>23</b>, and an HO request creating unit <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The transmission unit <b>20</b> transmits an HO request input from the HO request creating unit <b>24</b> to the terminal apparatus <b>1</b>. The reception unit <b>21</b> receives a measurement report from the terminal apparatus <b>1</b>. The reception unit <b>21</b> also receives a list of CSG cells contained in the macro cell from the MME/GW. The CSG cell list storage unit <b>22</b> stores the CSG cell list input from the reception unit <b>21</b>, which has been sent from the MME/GW. The CSG cell list information is input to the determination unit <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The determination unit <b>23</b> compares the measurement report output from the reception unit <b>21</b>, which has been sent from the terminal apparatus <b>1</b>, with the CSG cell list output from the CSG cell list storage unit <b>22</b> to extract a CSG cell corresponding to the PCI included in the measurement report from the terminal apparatus <b>1</b>, and outputs an instruction to create an HO request for the corresponding CSG cell to the HO request creating unit <b>24</b>. The HO request creating unit <b>24</b> creates the HO request in response to the instruction from the determination unit <b>23</b> and outputs the HO request to the transmission unit <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The operation of a thus configured wireless communication system will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">First, as a characteristic operation of the invention, description will be made to the operation (i.e. signaling) of the entire system in the case of the cell arrangement as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> when the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> that is camping on the macro cell is to handover to one of two CSG cells having the same PCI (i.e. the CSG cell [PC<b>1</b> #<b>2</b>, CGT #<b>3</b>] of HeNB <b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a sequence diagram showing the operation of the wireless communication system according to the embodiment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> takes reception quality measurements of the home eNB <b>1</b> (S<b>1</b>), and acquires the PC<b>1</b> (here, PCI #<b>2</b>). The terminal apparatus <b>1</b> adds the PCI of the home eNB <b>1</b> subjected to the measurement and the CGI (here, CGT #<b>3</b>) of an accessible CSG cell corresponding to the PCI (the CSG cell that the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> desires to enter) to the measurement result, and notifies the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) of a resultant measurement report MR (PCI #<b>2</b>, if CGI #<b>3</b>) (S<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) determines a home eNB that has the &#x201c;PCI&#x201d; and &#x201c;if CGI&#x201d; notified from the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> (here, the home eNB <b>1</b>), and transmits an HO request to the home eNB <b>1</b> through a Mobility Management Entity (MME)/Gateway (GW) (S<b>3</b>). If the handover of the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> is to be permitted, the home eNB <b>1</b> that has received the HO request reserves in advance wireless resources appropriate for services provided to the terminal apparatus <b>1</b>, performs acceptance control, and transmits an ACK to the HO request via the MME/GW to the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) (S<b>4</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Upon receiving the ACK to the HO request from the home eNB <b>1</b>, the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) transmits an HO command for instructing the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> to transfer to the CSG cell <b>1</b> (S<b>5</b>), and the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> transmits a random access preamble to the specified home eNB (S<b>6</b>). After the home eNB transmits a random access response (S<b>7</b>) and synchronization is established, the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> transmits an HO confirmation to the home eNB <b>1</b> (S<b>8</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Next, the operation of components of the wireless communication system (the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> and the base station apparatus <b>2</b>) will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flow chart showing the operation of the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> according to the embodiment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> receives a pilot channel and a synchronization channel from the home eNB (S<b>10</b>), and takes reception quality measurements of the pilot channel of the home eNB (S<b>11</b>). The terminal apparatus <b>1</b> then determines whether or not the CSG cell of handover destination is accessible (i.e. whether or not it is the CSG cell that the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> desires to enter) based on the PCI acquired from the synchronization channel and the whitelist. In cases where a CSG cell that has the PCI of a home eNB included in the whitelist is the best cell that has the best reception quality (S<b>12</b>) for example, this determination is made by extracting the CGI of the CSG cell corresponding to the PCI from the whitelist (S<b>13</b>). The terminal apparatus <b>1</b> then creates a measurement report to which the CGI (if CGI) of the accessible CSG cell is added (S<b>14</b>), and transmits the measurement report to the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) (S<b>15</b>). Thereafter, once the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> receives an HO command from the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) (S<b>16</b>), a handover to the home eNB is performed (S<b>17</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flow chart showing the operation of the base station apparatus <b>2</b> according to the embodiment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, upon receiving the measurement report of the reception quality measurement at the home eNB from the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> (S<b>20</b>), the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) creates an HO request for the home eNB of handover destination based on the &#x201c;PCI&#x201d; and &#x201c;if CGI&#x201d; added to the measurement report (S<b>21</b>) and transmits the HO request to the home eNB via the MME/GW (S<b>22</b>). Upon receiving a response (HO request ACK) to the HO request from the home eNB via the MME/GW (S<b>23</b>), the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) transmits an HO command for causing a transfer to the home eNB to the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> based on the HO request ACK (S<b>24</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to the wireless communication system according to the first embodiment, since the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) retrieves a home eNB whose CGI (if CGI) is desired by the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> from a list to transmit an HO request, it is possible to reduce wasteful signaling to two or more home eNBs that have the same PCI and reduce unnecessary resources being reserved in the home eNBs.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In other words, to cope with the problem of a prior art that the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) redundantly transmits HO requests even to other home eNBs that have the same PCI, the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> adds a CGI of a home eNB to which the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> desires to handover to a measurement report and transmits the report to the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) in the embodiment, so that the HO request is sent to only an appropriate home eNB.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">(Second Embodiment)</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">A wireless communication system according to a second embodiment of the present invention will now be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 10</figref>. In this unit, description will primarily be made to differences from the first embodiment. Therefore, the configuration and operation of the second embodiment are similar to those of the first embodiment unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In this embodiment, it is assumed that a network policy of the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) does not support a reliable handover and is of aggressive one that performs a handover regardless of the presence or absence of an access permission. In other words, the embodiment is intended for a so-called aggressive base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) of Release <b>8</b>. The network policy of the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) is included in system information of the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB), and conveyed to the entire macro cell through a Broadcast Control Channel, or BCCH. Alternatively, the network policy of the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) is included in a measurement control message, and conveyed to the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> individually through a Dedicated.

<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In this embodiment, it is assumed that a network policy of the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) supports a reliable handover. In other words, the embodiment is intended for a so-called Release <b>9</b> macro eNB.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a block diagram showing a configuration of a terminal apparatus <b>1</b> according to the embodiment. The terminal apparatus <b>1</b> according to the embodiment is not provided with a location information storage unit <b>18</b> and a DRX control unit <b>19</b> is added. Discontinuous reception (DRX) is a control method of the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> to receive data intermittently when the receiving data is discontinuous in order to suppress receiving power consumption. The DRX includes long DRX and short DRX, whose period of time during which data is not received is different from each other. The long DRX is used in cases where data is not received for a long period, since the longer the period during which data is not received is, the more the power consumption of the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> is suppressed. The terminal apparatus <b>1</b> is instructed to implement the DRX and to use either of the long DRX or the short DRX when the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> establishes a connection with the base station apparatus <b>2</b>. The terminal apparatus <b>1</b> does not implement the DRX without an instruction from the base station apparatus <b>2</b>. Further in this embodiment, if it is determined that the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) is a macro eNB of Release <b>9</b> based on information output from the network policy identifying unit <b>17</b>, the determination unit <b>13</b> inputs, to the measurement unit <b>14</b>, an instruction to receive BCCH of a CSG cell to acquire a CGI while the terminal implements the long DRX. On the other hand, if the terminal does not implement the long DRX, the determination unit <b>13</b> outputs, to the measurement report creating unit <b>15</b>, an instruction to create a measurement report including a PCI and a reception quality measurement result of the measured CSG cell. Based on an instruction in a measurement control message output from the reception unit <b>10</b>, the determination unit <b>13</b> inputs an instruction to implement the long DRX to the DRX control unit <b>19</b> or outputs an instruction to measure another frequency (for example, f<b>2</b>) of the macro cell (inter-frequency measurement) to the measurement unit <b>14</b>. The DRX control unit <b>19</b> starts to implement the long DRX according to the output from the determination unit <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a block diagram showing a configuration of a base station apparatus <b>2</b> according to the embodiment. A DRX changing instruction unit <b>28</b> is added to the base station apparatus <b>2</b> according to the embodiment. Further in this embodiment, the network policy storage unit <b>25</b> stores a network policy (Release <b>9</b>) information of the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB). If a PCI and a CGI are added to a measurement report output from the reception unit <b>21</b>, which has been sent from the terminal apparatus <b>1</b>, the determination unit <b>23</b> compares it with a CSG cell list output from the CSG cell list storage unit <b>22</b> to extract a CSG cell corresponding to a combination of the PCI and the CGI included in the measurement report from the terminal apparatus <b>1</b>, and outputs an instruction to create an HO request for the corresponding CSG cell to the HO request creating unit <b>24</b>. If a CGI is not added to a measurement report from the terminal apparatus <b>1</b>, the determination unit <b>23</b> inputs, to the DRX changing instruction unit <b>28</b>, an instruction for the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> to implement the long DRX, or inputs, to the measurement control information creating unit <b>27</b>, an instruction to create a measurement control message including an instruction to measure another frequency (for example, f<b>2</b>) of the macro cell (inter-frequency measurement).</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In response to the instruction from the determination unit <b>23</b>, the DRX changing instruction unit <b>28</b> inputs, to the measurement control information creating unit <b>27</b>, an instruction to create a measurement control message including an instruction to implement the long DRX. In response to the instruction from the determination unit <b>23</b>, the measurement control information creating unit <b>27</b> creates a measurement control message including an instruction to measure another frequency (for example, f<b>2</b>) of the macro cell, and inputs it to the transmission unit <b>20</b>. In response to the instruction from both the determination unit <b>23</b> and the DRX changing instruction unit <b>28</b>, the measurement control information creating unit <b>27</b> creates a measurement control message including an instruction to implement the long DRX, and inputs it to the transmission unit <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The operation of a thus configured wireless communication system will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a sequence diagram showing the operation of the entire wireless communication system according to the embodiment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> receives the system information (BCCH) from the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) and identifies the network policy of the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) (S<b>80</b>). In this case, the network policy of the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) is identified as an eNB of Release <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The terminal apparatus <b>1</b> takes reception quality measurements of the home eNB (home eNB <b>1</b>) (S<b>81</b>), and acquires the PCI (here, PCI #<b>2</b>). Determination is then made to whether the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> implements the long discontinuous reception (DRX) (S<b>82</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">If it is determined that the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> does not implement the long DRX, the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> adds only a PCI of the measured CSG cell to a reception quality measurement result, and transmits the measurement report (PCI #<b>2</b>) to the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB). Upon receiving the measurement report from the terminal apparatus <b>1</b>, the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) transmits a measurement control message for instructing the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> to implement the long DRX and acquire a CGI (i.e. to receive BCCH) of the CSG cell (S<b>84</b>). Instead, the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) may transmit a measurement control message with an instruction to measure another frequency (for example, f<b>2</b>) of the macro cell (inter-frequency measurement).</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">If it is determined that the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> implements the long DRX, and when it is determined that the measured cell is a CSG cell from the acquired PCI and a whitelist, the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> automatically receives BCCH of the CSG cell to acquire a CGI (S<b>85</b>). The terminal apparatus <b>1</b> then creates a measurement report MR (PCI #<b>2</b>, CGI #<b>3</b>) to which the PCI and the CGI are added, and transmits it to the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) (S<b>86</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Upon receiving a measurement report from the terminal apparatus <b>1</b>, the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) determines the corresponding CSG cell from the PCI and the COI added to the measurement report and a list of CSG cells retained by the base station apparatus <b>2</b>, and transmits an HO request to a home eNB (home eNB <b>1</b>) of the corresponding CSG cell (S<b>87</b>). If the handover of the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> is to be permitted, the home eNB <b>1</b> that has received the HO request reserves in advance wireless resources appropriate for services provided to the terminal apparatus <b>1</b>, performs acceptance control, and transmits an ACK to the HO request via the MME/GW to the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) (S<b>88</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Upon receiving the ACK to the HO request from the home eNB <b>1</b>, the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) transmits an HO command for instructing the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> to transfer to the CSG cell <b>1</b> (S<b>89</b>), and the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> transmits a random access preamble to the specified home eNB (S<b>810</b>). After the home eNB transmits a random access response (S<b>811</b>) and synchronization is established, the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> transmits an HO confirmation to the home eNB <b>1</b> (S<b>812</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a flow chart showing the operation of the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> according to the embodiment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> first receives a network policy included in system information from the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) (S<b>90</b>). Next, the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> takes reception quality measurements of a pilot channel of a home eNB (S<b>91</b>), and if a CSG cell that has the PCI of a home eNB contained in the whitelist is the best cell of the best reception qualify (S<b>92</b>), examination is made on the network policy.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">If it is determined that the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) is a macro eNB of Release <b>9</b> (S<b>93</b>) as a result of the examination on the network policy, determination is made on whether or not the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> implements the long DRX (S<b>94</b>). If the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> implements the long DRX, the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> receives BCCH of the CSG cell to acquire a CGI (S<b>95</b>). The terminal apparatus <b>1</b> then creates a measurement report including the acquired PCI and CGI and a reception quality measurement result, and transmits the measurement report to the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) (S<b>96</b>). On the other hand, if the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> does not implement the long DRX, the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> creates a measurement report including the PCI and a reception quality measurement result, and transmits it to the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) (S<b>97</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">According to the wireless communication system according to the fourth embodiment, similar effects to the first embodiment can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The embodiment is intended for a macro eNB of Release <b>9</b>. In this case, since the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) supports a reliable handover to a CSG cell, it is conceivable that the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) provides a handover instruction after the base station apparatus <b>2</b> confirms that the CSG cell is accessible to the terminal apparatus <b>1</b>. Therefore, upon receiving a measurement report of a home eNB from the terminal apparatus <b>1</b>, it is conceivable that the base station apparatus <b>2</b> immediately instructs the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> to read a CGI of the home eNB. In this case, a CGI (if CGI) of the accessible CSG cell sent by the terminal in the first measurement report is redundant and may cause a problem of an increase of message size of a measurement report.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In this embodiment, therefore, it is possible to minimize the message size of the measurement report by sending only a PCI of a home eNB acquired during measurement in the first measurement report.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In particular, according to the wireless communication system according to the embodiment, considering the fact that in cases where the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) is a macro eNB of Release <b>9</b>, the base station apparatus <b>2</b> immediately instructs the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> to read a CGI of a home eNB upon receiving a measurement report of the home eNB from the terminal apparatus <b>1</b>, the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> sends only a PC<b>1</b> of the home eNB acquired during measurement in the first measurement report. It is therefore possible to minimize the message size of the measurement report.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Embodiments according to the present invention have been described by way of illustration. The scope of the invention, however, is not limited thereto and alteration and modification can be made thereto without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">For example, description has been made above to the cases where the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) transmits a network policy throughout the system by means of system information. The scope of the invention, however, is not limited thereto and the base station apparatus <b>2</b> (macro eNB) may transmit a network policy to the terminal apparatus <b>1</b> individually by means of a measurement control message.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Although currently possible preferred embodiments of the invention have been described above, it is understood that various modifications can be made to the embodiments and it is intended that all such modifications that fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention are covered by the attached claims.</p>
<heading id="h-0015" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">As described above, the radio transmitting/receiving apparatus according to the present invention can effectively suppress wasteful signaling and prevent unnecessary resources from being reserved, and is useful for a technique for performing a handover from a macro cell to a CSG cell, and the like.</p>
