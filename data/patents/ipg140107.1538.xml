<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a motor-driven compressor.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As one of the global warming prevention measures, in the refrigerant circuit of a vehicle air-conditioner, new type refrigerant having little effect on ozone depletion has been replacing conventional refrigerant such as chlorofluorocarbon. A refrigerant whose molecular formula is C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>m</sub>F<sub>n </sub>(wherein &#x201c;m&#x201d; is an integer from one to five, &#x201c;n&#x201d; is an integer from one to five, and an equation of &#x201c;m+n=6&#x201d; is satisfied) and which has one double bond, such as CF<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;CF&#x2550;CH<sub>2 </sub>(2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-1-propene) as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2009-225636, has recently been attracting the attention of the industry as a new type refrigerant (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;HFO1234yf type refrigerant&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">HFO1234yf type refrigerant which has the double bond tends to be decomposed in the presence of moisture. If moisture enters into the refrigerant circuit for some reason during manufacturing or use of a vehicle air-conditioner having HFO1234yf type refrigerant, the refrigerant is decomposed and, accordingly, hydrogen fluoride (HF) is produced from fluorine (F) in the refrigerant. Acid such as HF causes early corrosion to metal parts of the motor-driven compressor having relatively low corrosion resistance. Additionally, moisture per se causes chemical reaction to occur in the metal parts of the motor-driven compressor thereby to degrade their characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One of the parts incorporated in an electric motor of the motor-driven compressor that has the lowest corrosion resistance is a permanent magnet. Ferrite magnet and rare earth magnet are mainly used in the electric motor, but they tend to degrade their characteristics in the presence of acid or moisture. Rare earth magnet is more susceptible to acid or moisture than ferrite magnet. Any degraded characteristics of the permanent magnet of the electric motor deteriorates the performance of the motor-driven compressor.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The same problem may occur in conventional refrigerant, any new type refrigerant to be developed in future and lubricating oil contained in refrigerant in the motor-driven compressor, as well as HFO1234yf type refrigerant. Additionally, chemical reaction of moisture with any parts of the motor-driven compressor such as permanent magnet may invite the same problem with the motor-driven compressor.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention is directed to providing a motor-driven compressor which can prevent characteristics degradation of a permanent magnet incorporated in an electric motor.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with the present invention, a motor-driven compressor includes a housing, a rotary shaft, a compression mechanism and an electric motor. The housing includes a suction port and a discharge port. The compression mechanism is disposed in the housing and compresses refrigerant flowed through the suction port into the compression mechanism and discharges the refrigerant through the discharge port.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A motor-driven compressor according to the present invention has a structure including at least one of an adsorbent for absorbing moisture or a neutralizer for neutralizing acid as a compressor interior environment improvement agent. The motor-driven compressor may have a structure including both or only one of the above absorbent and/or neutralizer. The structure of the motor-driven compressor may be determined by the size of an agent hole for the compressor interior environment improvement agent, or whether or not refrigerant or lubricating oil in the motor-driven compressor tends to produce acid.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The rotor includes a magnet hole formed to extend therethrough along the axial direction thereof, and a permanent magnet is disposed in the magnet hole. The rotor also includes an agent hole formed to extend therethrough along the axial direction thereof, and a compressor interior environment improvement agent is disposed in the agent hole. The magnet and agent holes may be formed in the rotor so as to extend along the axial direction thereof and open at one axial end thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The rotor includes a rotor core including the magnet and agent holes and a pair of end plates disposed on the opposite ends of the rotor core. The each end plate has a fluid hole for communication between the agent hole and outside of the rotor core. In this structure, the rotor includes the rotor core and a pair of the end plates, and the rotor core is interposed between the end plates. The end plates close the opposite ends of the magnet hole, so that circulating refrigerant and lubricating oil are prevented from flowing directly into the magnet hole. This reduces the fear of contact between the permanent magnet and the moisture or acid contained in the circulating refrigerant and lubricating oil. The fluid holes formed in the end plate of the rotor core allow the circulating refrigerant and lubricating oil to be positively introduced through the fluid holes into the agent holes. Rotating the rotor enhances the chance of contact between the compressor interior environment improvement agent and the fluid such as refrigerant flowing through the fluid hole into the agent hole. Thus, moisture or acid in the rotor is removed or neutralized early by the compressor interior environmental improvement agent disposed in the agent hole, so that the circulating refrigerant and lubricating oil entering into the magnet hole exists without chemical reaction with the permanent magnet.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A fin is disposed in the fluid hole for introducing fluid into the agent hole when the rotor rotates. A plate portion of the fin may be disposed to face the fluid hole of the end plate and be inclined with respect to the end plate.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A space is formed extending axially in the agent hole adjacent to the compressor interior environment improvement agent or in the compressor interior environment improvement agent adjacent to the agent hole. More specifically, a longitudinal groove serving as the space is formed to extend axially in at least one of the inner surface of the agent hole and the outer surface of the agent unit including the compressor interior environment improvement agent. Fluid passage is formed by the above space, thereby further enhancing the chance of contact between the agent unit and the refrigerant and lubricating oil.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The rotor includes a rotor core including the magnet and agent holes and a pair of end plates disposed on the opposite ends of the rotor core. Each end plate closes the agent hole and the magnet hole so as to seal the agent hole and the magnet hole. A communication passage is formed in the rotor core or the inner surface of the end plate for communication between the magnet hole and agent hole. In this structure, refrigerant is prevented from entering into the agent and magnet holes, and any moisture or acid contained in the refrigerant entering into the agent and magnet holes is absorbed or neutralized early by the compressor environment improvement agents. Moisture or acid entering into the magnet hole is introduced into the agent hole through the communication passage, so that the moisture or acid in the magnet hole may be prevented from staying therein, with the result that characteristic degradation of the permanent magnet may be delayed.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In this type of rotor where the end plates close the agent and magnet holes of the rotor core so as to seal the agent and magnet holes, the outer surface of the rotor is covered with a resin coating. Moisture or acid may be prevented by the resin coating from entering into the magnetic hole. If moisture or acid enters into the magnet hole even though the resin coating is applied to the rotor, moisture or acid may be removed or neutralized early by the compressor environmental improvement agent. The resin coating may be applied to the rotor by means of spraying, dipping or electrodeposition coating. The rotor is mounted on the rotary shaft, and the rotor and the boundary between the rotor and the rotary shaft are covered with the resin coating. Thus, moisture and acid may be prevented from entering into the rotor through the boundary.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The resin for the resin coating includes natural resin, synthetic resin, natural rubber and synthetic rubber. Additionally, a polyethylene series resin, epoxy series resin, a fluorine series resin, an acrylic series resin, a polyamide series resin, a polyamide-imide series resin, a silicone series resin, a polyether ether ketone series resin, a polyetherimide series resin, a phenol series resin, a melamine series resin, a urethane series resin or a rubber is used as the resin for the resin coating.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The agent hole of the rotor may be located at any position where the electric motor has little effect on the magnetic circuit characteristics. For activating the compressor environmental improvement agent disposed in the agent hole as much as possible, the agent hole is preferably formed in the rotor at a position adjacent to the permanent magnet. Thus, the rotor is disposed inside the stator, and the agent hole is formed inside the permanent magnet. In this type of rotor which is disposed inside the stator, the agent hole is located at the above position, so that the magnetic characteristics of the rotor is maintained and the installation space for the compressor environmental improvement agent is easily obtained. The permanent magnets may be disposed in the rotor disposed in the rotor in a polygonal or circular arrangement as seen in the axial direction of the rotor. The permanent magnet may be formed to have a plate shape or a shape of a circular arc in cross-section thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The rotor is disposed outside the stator, and the agent hole is formed outside the permanent magnet. In the structure where the rotor is disposed outside of the stator, the magnetic characteristics of the rotor is maintained, and the installation space for the compressor environmental improvement agent may be easily obtained. In the structure where the stator is disposed inside the rotor, the agent hole is formed in the stator and the compressor environment improvement agent is disposed in the agent hole. The permanent magnets may be disposed in the rotor in a polygonal or circular arrangement as seen in the axial direction of the rotor. The permanent magnet may be formed to have a plate shape or a shape of a circular arc in cross-section thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The absorbent is made of at least one of zeolite, activated carbon, alumina and silica gel. The absorbent has an excellent adsorption performance per unit volume, and is useful for installing in the limited space inside the rotor. The absorbent is generally called as a desiccant.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The neutralizer is made of at least one of calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, calcium carbonate and sodium carbonate. These substances are preferable since the substances stably exist in the solid state for a long period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The rotor may include the grained absorbent and neutralizer inserted in the agent hole closed at the opposite ends thereof by covers having a mesh structure or the above end plates. An agent unit including a case whose each end has a mesh structure and which is filled with at least one of absorbent and neutralizer is inserted in the agent hole. The absorbent formed into a shape corresponding to the shape of the agent hole is used as the absorbent.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The motor-driven compressor is a vehicle air-conditioner including a circulation path made of a nonmetal tube. The vehicle air-conditioner includes the motor-driven compressor, a condenser, a receiver, an expansion valve and an evaporator which are connected through a circulation path filled with refrigerant and lubricating oil. Part of the circulation path is made of a nonmetal tube such as resin tube for having flexible characteristics. The resin of the resin tube includes natural resin, synthetic resin, natural rubber and synthetic rubber. The nonmetal tube has characteristics allowing little moisture to pass therethrough. Thus, if the nonmetal tube is used under hot and humid environment for a long period of time, moisture content in air enters into the circulation path through the nonmetal tube such as resin tube. In the refrigeration cycle having the vehicle air-conditioner including the circulation path made of the nonmetal tube such as resin tube, refrigerant tends to be decomposed to produce acid as compared to in another refrigeration cycle having the circulation path with no nonmetal tube. Thus, the structure where the compressor environment improvement agent is disposed inside the rotor of the electric motor is useful for the vehicle air-conditioner including the circulation path made of the nonmetal tube.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The motor-driven compressor is used in a refrigeration cycle in that refrigerant or mixed refrigerant circulates, the molecular formula of the refrigerant is C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>m</sub>F<sub>n </sub>in that &#x201c;m&#x201d; is an integer from one to five, &#x201c;n&#x201d; is an integer from one to five and an equation of &#x201c;m+n=6&#x201d; is satisfied and that has one double bond. The HFO1234yf type refrigerant is decomposed to produce hydrogen fluoride in the presence of moisture. Thus, the structure where the compressor environment improvement agent is disposed inside the rotor of the electric motor is useful for delaying production of acid.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the motor-driven compressor, the housing is filled with at least one of polyol ester (POE), polyvinyl ether (PVE) and polyalkylene glycol (PAG) as lubricating oil. In this structure, it is not preferable that moisture enters into the circulation path. For example, polyol ester is hydrolyzed into organic carboxylate in the presence of moisture. Organic carboxylate causes early corrosion to the permanent magnet as in the case of hydrogen fluoride. In this case, the structure where the compressor environment improvement agent is disposed inside the rotor of the electric motor is effective for delaying production of acid.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The following will describe a motor-driven compressor according to a first preferred embodiment of the present invention with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the motor-driven compressor designated by reference numeral <b>1</b> includes a housing <b>10</b> having a compression mechanism <b>15</b> and an electric motor <b>2</b>. A suction port <b>11</b> and a discharge port <b>12</b> are formed in the housing <b>10</b>. Refrigerant is flowed through the suction port <b>11</b> into the compression mechanism <b>15</b>, and the refrigerant is compressed in the compression mechanism <b>15</b>. The compressed refrigerant is discharged out of the compression mechanism <b>15</b> and the motor-driven compressor through the discharge port <b>12</b>. The electric motor <b>2</b> drives a rotary shaft <b>21</b> to rotate thereby to drive the compression mechanism <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The compression mechanism <b>15</b> has a fixed scroll <b>13</b> fixed to the housing <b>10</b> and a movable scroll <b>14</b> disposed in the housing <b>10</b> so as to make an orbital motion in facing the fixed scroll <b>13</b>. A variable compression chamber <b>150</b> is formed between the fixed scroll <b>13</b> and the movable scroll <b>14</b> for compressing refrigerant. The movable scroll <b>14</b> is connected to a crank pin <b>210</b> through a bearing <b>216</b> and a crank bush <b>215</b> such that the movable scroll <b>14</b> makes the above orbital motion with the rotation of the rotary shaft <b>21</b> for varying the volume of the compression chamber <b>150</b> between the fixed scroll <b>13</b> and the movable scroll <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The rotary shaft <b>21</b> is inserted in a center hole <b>221</b> formed through a rotor <b>22</b> of the electric motor <b>2</b> with the opposite ends of the rotary shaft <b>21</b> extending out of the center hole <b>221</b> and rotatably supported by the housing <b>10</b> through bearings <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, respectively. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, the electric motor <b>2</b> includes the rotor <b>22</b> and a stator <b>23</b>. The rotor <b>22</b> is fixedly mounted on the rotary shaft <b>21</b>, and the stator <b>23</b> is fixed to the inner peripheral surface of the housing <b>10</b> outside the rotor <b>22</b>. A coil <b>235</b> is disposed in the stator <b>23</b>. The rotor <b>22</b> having the permanent magnet <b>31</b> is rotated by energizing the coil <b>235</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref>, the rotor <b>22</b> includes a cylindrical rotor core <b>220</b> formed of a plurality of laminated electromagnetic steel sheets and has six magnet holes <b>222</b> formed therethrough and extending axially of the rotor <b>22</b>. The six magnet holes <b>222</b> are formed into a shape corresponding to the shape of the permanent magnet <b>31</b> and disposed in a hexagonal arrangement as seen in the axial direction of the rotor <b>22</b>. The permanent magnet is formed of known neodymium magnet (rare earth magnet) which is composed mainly of neodymium (Nd), iron (Fe) and boron (B).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, the rotor <b>22</b> has an absorbent such as zeolite as the compressor interior environment improvement agent <b>32</b>. The compressor interior environment improvement agent <b>32</b> is disposed in each of a plurality of agent holes <b>225</b> formed through the rotor core <b>220</b> along the axial direction thereof. Covers <b>226</b> having a mesh structure are disposed at the opposite ends of each agent hole <b>225</b>. The agent hole <b>225</b> between the covers <b>226</b> is filled with zeolite as the absorbent. Average particle diameter of zeolite is between 0.5 and 10 mm. The mesh structure of the cover <b>226</b> is formed to have openings with a size smaller than the diameters of zeolite particles for preventing zeolite from flowing out of the agent hole <b>225</b>. In addition, the rotor core <b>220</b> has fixing rivets (not shown) and holes (not shown either) through which the rivets are inserted.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the above-described motor-driven compressor <b>1</b> is used as a compressor for a vehicle air-conditioner <b>5</b>. The vehicle air-conditioner <b>5</b> includes the motor-driven compressor <b>1</b>, a condenser <b>51</b>, a receiver <b>52</b>, an expansion valve <b>53</b> and an evaporator <b>54</b> which are connected through a circulation path <b>55</b> in this order from the motor-driven compressor <b>1</b> on the side of its discharge port <b>12</b>. The opening of the expansion valve <b>53</b> is adjusted by a controller <b>57</b> in accordance with the temperature of refrigerant measured by a temperature sensor <b>56</b> disposed downstream of the evaporator <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The receiver <b>52</b> functions to separate liquid refrigerant from gas refrigerant and to allow only liquid refrigerant to flow to the expansion valve <b>53</b>, and to remove moisture contained in refrigerant by absorbent disposed therein (not shown). The circulation path <b>55</b>, or the motor-driven compressor <b>1</b>, is filled with CF<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;CF&#x2550;CH<sub>2 </sub>(2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-1-propene) as refrigerant and polyol ester as lubricating oil (lubricant). Part of the circulation path <b>55</b> is made of a nonmetal tube such as resin tube.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">If the above-described vehicle air-conditioner <b>5</b> is driven for a long period of time, moisture passes or permeates through the resin tube and gradually enters into the circulation path <b>55</b>. If the moisture in the circulation path <b>55</b> is not removed, but continues to exist in the circulation path <b>55</b>, refrigerant is decomposed thereby to produce HF. The permanent magnet is degraded by chemical reaction with the moisture itself. According to a conventional vehicle air-conditioner such as <b>5</b>, moisture entering into the circulation path <b>55</b> is removed only by the absorbent incorporated in the receiver such as <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to the vehicle air-conditioner <b>5</b> of the first preferred embodiment of the present invention, the compressor interior environment improvement agent (absorbent) <b>32</b> is provided in the rotor <b>22</b> of the motor-driven compressor <b>1</b> in addition to the absorbent in the receiver <b>52</b>. The provision of the absorbent <b>32</b> in the motor-driven compressor <b>1</b> increases the permissible volume of moisture entering into the vehicle air-conditioner <b>5</b> of the refrigeration cycle without increasing the installation space for the vehicle air-conditioner <b>5</b> as the refrigeration cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Therefore, if the vehicle air-conditioner <b>5</b> is used in a hot and humid region for a long period of time, increased total moisture absorbing performance by the additional absorbent in the motor-driven compressor <b>1</b>, as well as the absorbent in the receiver permits the vehicle air-conditioner <b>5</b> to operate stably for an extended period of time. Though the permanent magnet <b>31</b> in the rotor <b>22</b> tends to degrade its characteristics in the presence of acid or moisture in comparison with the other members or parts of the motor-driven compressor <b>1</b>, the compressor interior environment improvement agent (absorbent) <b>32</b> disposed just adjacent to the permanent magnet <b>31</b> removes any moisture entering close to the permanent magnet <b>31</b>, thus preventing characteristic degradation of the permanent magnet <b>31</b>. Though in the first preferred embodiment of the present invention only absorbent is used as the compressor interior environment improvement agent <b>32</b>, neutralizer may be additionally used as the compressor interior environment improvement agent <b>32</b> for neutralizing acid.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The following will describe a motor-driven compressor according to a second preferred embodiment of the present invention with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 through 9</figref>. The second preferred embodiment differs from the first preferred embodiment in that a rotor of a modified structure is used.

The rotor core <b>240</b> and the end plates <b>25</b> are fastened together fixing with the rivets. The rotor <b>24</b> is installed in the motor-driven compressor as in the case of the first preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">According to the second preferred embodiment of the present invention, the rotor <b>24</b> includes the rotor core <b>240</b> and a pair of the end plates <b>25</b> between which the rotor core <b>240</b> is interposed. The end plates <b>25</b> close the opposite ends of the magnet hole <b>242</b>, so that circulating refrigerant and lubricating oil are prevented from flowing directly into the magnet hole <b>242</b>. This reduces the fear of contact between the permanent magnet <b>34</b> and the moisture or acid contained in the circulating refrigerant and lubricating oil.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The fluid holes <b>253</b> formed in the end plate <b>25</b> of the rotor core <b>240</b> allow the circulating refrigerant and lubricating oil to be positively introduced through the fluid holes <b>253</b> into the agent holes <b>243</b>. Rotating the rotor <b>24</b> enhances the chance of contact between the compressor interior environment improvement agent and the fluid such as refrigerant flowing through the fluid hole <b>253</b> into the agent hole <b>243</b>. Thus, moisture or acid in the rotor <b>24</b> is removed or neutralized early by the compressor interior environmental improvement agent disposed in the agent hole <b>243</b>, so that the circulating refrigerant and lubricating oil entering into the magnet hole <b>242</b> exists without chemical reaction with the permanent magnet <b>34</b>. Therefore, the motor-driven compressor <b>1</b> may prevent the characteristics degradation of the permanent magnet <b>34</b> by itself.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The following will describe a motor-driven compressor according to a third preferred embodiment of the present invention with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>.

Though not shown in the drawings, the fluid hole <b>253</b> of the end plate <b>25</b> of the rotor core <b>240</b> according to the third embodiment has a shape which is substantially the same as that of the agent hole <b>243</b> having the groove <b>248</b>. Thus, a pair of spaces <b>357</b> is formed extending axially in the agent hole <b>243</b> of the rotor core <b>240</b> adjacent to the agent unit <b>35</b> or in the agent unit <b>35</b> adjacent to the agent hole <b>243</b> of the rotor core <b>240</b>.</p>

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the end plates <b>25</b> close the opposite ends of the magnet holes <b>242</b> and agent holes <b>243</b> so as to seal the opposite ends of the magnet holes <b>242</b> and agent holes <b>243</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the recess <b>256</b> forms a communication passage <b>247</b> for providing fluid communication between the magnet hole <b>242</b> and its adjacent agent hole <b>243</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">According to the fourth preferred embodiment of the present invention, refrigerant is prevented from entering into the agent holes <b>243</b> and the magnet holes <b>242</b>, and any moisture or acid contained in the refrigerant entering into the agent holes <b>243</b> and the magnet holes <b>242</b> is absorbed or neutralized early by the compressor environment improvement agent. Moisture or acid entering into the magnet hole <b>242</b> is introduced into the agent hole <b>243</b> through the communication passage <b>247</b>, so that the moisture or acid in the magnet hole <b>242</b> is prevented from staying therein, with the result that characteristic degradation of the permanent magnet <b>34</b> may be delayed.</p>
