<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">In many jurisdictions, off-duty police officers are required or permitted to carry a handgun that is in some way concealed from the view of others who may be in proximity to the officers. This is particularly important to those who may be working &#x201c;under cover.&#x201d; Many of these officers may also wish to carry a concealed handgun in addition to the service weapon normally worn whale on duty. In addition, many states have enacted &#x201c;right to carry&#x201d; laws that permit a resident to carry a concealed handgun providing the resident has taken a prescribed handgun safety course, has no criminal record, has no outstanding restraining orders imposed by a court of law, and has passed a background check. Many states may not permit persons within the state to openly carry a handgun in public places.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Concealing a handgun may be accomplished by hiding it from view of others within a person's clothing or garments. While being hidden beneath layers of clothing may accomplish concealment, it may also make it difficult for the user to access the handgun expeditiously when confronted by danger. An example of this method of concealment is a shoulder holster carried beneath an armpit and covered with a jacket. Another example is a holster attached to a lower part of a leg. Both of these examples may limit the speed with which a user can access the handgun. Even a holster worn inside a belt and pant waist may require some form of clothing to conceal the presence of a handgun, such as having to wear a shirt tail outside the pants, which may make quick access difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Another method of concealing a handgun is to enclose it within an article that appears to be something other than a holster for a handgun. The exterior fa&#xe7;ade may appear to be a carrying case for a mobile phone or pager. It may also be a fanny pack, bi-fold wallet or pouch used when hiking or participating in similar sporting activities. These implementations typically rely on mechanical snaps, zippers and hook-and-loop type fasteners to close an opening used to access the firearm, and usually require the use of two hands or extensive movements of the hands and arms. These enclosing devices may impede access to a handgun when it becomes necessary to access it quickly.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although many new handgun designs have been dramatically reduced in size, thereby making it easier to conceal, prior art methods described in available literature for concealing a handgun are still encumbered with poor concealment and difficulty of quick access when required.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The following disclosure describes a handgun holster for concealed carry that relies on a fa&#xe7;ade of a cell phone, or a cell phone case with spring-loaded hinges securing moveable panels. It is a compact design that can be worn on the street when dressed in casual clothes or in an office setting when wearing more formal work clothes without drawing attention to the fact that the wearer is carrying a handgun. Although it may rely on a snap or hook-and-loop material, another embodiment using a single magnetic latch on the front or rear edge of a spring-loaded panel is advantageous for rapid acquisition of the handgun. Under this embodiment, springs may be released for providing opening of the holster by simply pressing inward on a side panel, which breaks the magnetic force holding the release springs.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The handgun holster is designed to fit inside the waistband in front of a side pocket close to a draw hand. Being free of material, zippers or straps, it enables a clean grip of the handgun yet allows for quick access that may be accomplished with the flip of a finger. Access is provided whether a user is standing or sitting, allowing ready access even while sitting in a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The holster includes spring-loaded hinged panels that appear to be a cell phone case when closed. When unlatched, the hinged panels spring open to be flush against the body of the user, allowing unimpeded access to the handgun held within the holster pocket, wherein the handgun may be quickly drawn and ready for use. Access is provided with minimal movement of an arm, a hand or even just a finger. A waistband clip may be provided to safely secure the holster containing a handgun inside the waistband of a user while holding the holster securely in place while the gun is withdrawn.</p>

This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.</p>

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The detailed description is directed to a handgun holster apparatus for a person desiring to carry a handgun concealed from view of others. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view <b>100</b> of an embodiment of a handgun holster closed for concealed carry. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows the holster in a stand-alone configuration. It includes a hinged butt panel <b>110</b> (in reference to the side of the holster where the butt of the gun's handle is positioned), a hinged top panel <b>120</b> and a hinged front panel <b>130</b>. These hinged panels are preferably spring-loaded for fast access to an enclosed handgun when released. A fixed hammer panel <b>140</b> (in reference to the side of the holster where the hammer of the gun is positioned) is rigidly positioned to a back panel of the holster <b>180</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>) opposite the hinged front panel <b>130</b>. A holster pocket <b>160</b> is provided to hold a handgun securely until deployment, and is attached to the back panel <b>180</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. A waistband clip <b>150</b> is provided to secure the holster to a waistband or belt <b>195</b> of a garment <b>190</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows the holster attached by a waistband clip <b>150</b> to a waistband or belt of a garment <b>190</b> worn by an individual.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A-FIG</figref>. <b>2</b>E illustrates sequential snapshots of a butt-side panel <b>110</b> view. Not shown is a handgun positioned within the holster pocket <b>160</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. The hinged front panel <b>130</b> is secured in a closed position by a first fastening means <b>215</b> attached to the hinged front panel <b>130</b> and a second fastening means <b>210</b> attached to the hinged butt panel <b>110</b>.

<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective view of an embodiment of a handgun holster in a completely open state or accessible configuration. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows the holster in a stand-alone and open configuration. It includes a hinged butt panel <b>110</b>, a hinged top panel <b>120</b> and a hinged front panel <b>130</b>. As noted above, these hinged panels are preferably spring-loaded for fast access to an enclosed handgun when fastening means <b>210</b>, <b>215</b> is released. A fixed hammer panel <b>140</b> may be rigidly positioned to a back panel of the holster <b>180</b>, or may be connected by a spring-actuated hinge to the back panel <b>180</b>, similar to a third spring-actuated hinge <b>310</b> connecting the butt panel <b>110</b> to the back panel <b>180</b>. A holster pocket <b>160</b> is provided to hold a handgun when the holster is in a closed or concealed configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, and an open or accessible configuration, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. A waistband clip <b>150</b> is provided to secure the holster to a waistband or belt <b>195</b> of a garment <b>190</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows the holster attached by a waistband clip <b>150</b> to a waistband or belt of a garment <b>190</b> worn by an individual. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> also shows the first fastening means <b>215</b>, the second fastening means <b>210</b> and the first, second and third spring-actuated hinges <b>220</b>, <b>230</b>, <b>310</b>. Similarly to the operation of the spring-actuated hinges <b>220</b>, <b>230</b> described above, when the user releases the first fastening means <b>215</b> and second fastening means <b>210</b>, the third spring-actuated hinge <b>310</b> causes the hinged butt panel <b>110</b> to quickly swing open. This action coupled with the simultaneous actions of panels <b>130</b>, <b>120</b>, as described above, enables access to an enclosed handgun. The fastening means may be a snap fastener, hook-and-loop fastener or a magnetic fastener. For reference purposes, the outline <b>320</b> of the butt, the handgrip and the hammer portion of a handgun is shown as dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates embodiments of a back side <b>400</b> of a handgun holster. The purpose of the back side is to rigidly position the connecting second and third hinges <b>230</b>, <b>310</b> and top portion of a holster pocket <b>160</b>, while conforming to the shape of the body of a user and protecting user's clothing from gun oil. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates a configuration whereby the back panel <b>180</b> and the holster pocket <b>160</b> are separate pieces held together by fasteners <b>410</b>. The back panel <b>180</b> is rigid but the holster pocket <b>160</b> is typically fabricated from leather, fabric or extruded synthetic material. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref> illustrate a second embodiment of a back panel <b>185</b> that is a single fabricated piece of leather or synthetic material. The second embodiment of the back panel <b>185</b> may also be an integral part of a completely extruded handgun holster for concealed carry.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates another embodiment of the holster, whereby the butt panel <b>110</b> may be attached via a third spring-actuated hinge <b>310</b> to the front panel <b>130</b> instead of to the back panel <b>180</b>. This may provide for smoother motion of releasing the fastened means while continuing to move the hand toward the pistol because the user's finger would not have to reverse direction to move out of the way of the swinging panel after releasing the fastening means. The butt panel <b>110</b> would then immediately begin springing upward and away from the hand as it opens, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
