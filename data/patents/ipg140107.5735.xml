<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention related to the field of peer to peer computing.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Coordinating linked activities (collaboration) is increasingly important to competitive advantage. Through collaboration, an enterprise can reduce transaction costs, gather better information, save operational costs and reap time efficiencies. Applications that facilitate collaborative computing include e-mail, group calendaring and scheduling, shared folders/databases, threaded discussions, and custom application development.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Collaborative systems today are primarily host peer device based and an example of a model used is the synchronization model, wherein a host peer device holds the master version of data and users work on local versions of the data. At intervals, a user connects to the host peer device and the local version of the data is synchronized with the master version of the data. This model is often used for Personal Information Management (PIM) applications e.g. calendar, email etc.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another computing model that has become popular in recent years is the peer-to-peer (P2P) model. This model is decentralized and comprises a number of &#x201c;peers&#x201d; interacting with each other, wherein a peer is similar in capabilities to other peers. P2P computing has enabled data sharing without a host peer device and with the increase of personal and mobile technology (e.g. mobile telephones, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) etc.) there is a need to support collaborative computing but in a disconnected P2P environment.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, since there is no central host peer device with control over the peers or the data in the system, the P2P model faces problems that are not present in the synchronization model, for example, data tracking.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect, the present invention provides a first peer computer system operable in a peer to peer network, comprising: means for accessing a first piece of information; means for creating a first entity; means for associating the first entity with the first piece of information; wherein the first entity is associated with a topic of the first piece of information.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Preferably, the first entity comprises a unique identifier. More preferably, the first entity comprises the date on which the first entity was created. Still more preferably, the first entity comprises the first piece of information. However, alternatively, the first entity is separate to the first piece of information</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a preferred embodiment, the system further comprises means for defining the first entity (e.g. a schema). Preferably, the system further comprises means for storing the first entity. More preferably, the system further comprises means for sending the first entity to a second peer computer system.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably, there is provided means for creating a second entity, wherein the second entity is associated with a sub-topic of the first piece of information. The first entity is therefore a parent entity and the second entity is a child entity. Preferably, the second entity comprises a reference to the first entity, wherein in one embodiment, the reference is a parent reference.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Aptly, a second entity is associated with a second piece of information, wherein the second entity is associated with a different topic to the first entity. More aptly, the means for defining is operable to be configured so that different scenarios (e.g. a business domain, a leisure domain) can be reflected.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, the first piece of information is a music file and the first entity comprises one or more of the following: data associated with the music file owner, the date on which a download of the music file occurred, data associated with the device that downloaded the music file, the date on which the downloaded file was sent, data associated with the device that receives the downloaded file.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to a second aspect, the present invention provides a peer to peer network, comprising: the first peer computer system as described above; a second peer computer system; and means for communicating between the first peer computer system and the second peer computer system.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, the second peer computer system comprises means for accessing an updated version of the first piece of information, wherein the first peer computer system comprises means for sending a request for the updated version to the second peer system and wherein the second peer computer system comprises means for sending the updated version to the first peer computer system.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, each peer computer system comprises means for controlling access to that peer computer system. In a preferred embodiment, the network further comprises a host peer computer system. More preferably, the network further comprises a software agent for determining the most current version of a piece of information.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a third aspect, the present invention provides a method for use in a first peer computer system operable in a peer to peer network, comprising the steps of: accessing a first piece of information; creating a first entity; associating the first entity with the first piece of information; wherein the first entity is associated with a topic of the information.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a fourth aspect, the present invention provides a computer program comprising program code means adapted to perform the method as described above when said program is run on a computer.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the following examples, the tokens shown are constructed using XML, however it be understood by one skilled in the art that the tokens can be constructed in many other ways</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present invention facilitates collaboration in a decentralized environment, via a &#x201c;token&#x201d; that is associated with a piece of data in the environment. A token represents a &#x201c;topic&#x201d; (i.e. a coherent thread) of the data and allows a user to keep track of a topic or topics of data in the environment. In one embodiment, a token comprises extra data associated with that piece of data. In another embodiment, the token comprises extra data associated with a piece of data and the piece of data itself.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows one example of a defining component for defining the token (also shown as <b>505</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). In the preferred embodiment, the defining component is a XML schema that defines the extra data and the token is constructed in XML. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the schema defines a unique identifier (i.e. &#x201c;TokenId&#x201d;); the token's parent's identifier if relevant (i.e. &#x201c;TokenParent&#x201d;); data associated with the created token (i.e. &#x201c;TokenCreated&#x201d;), namely, the user that has created the token (i.e. &#x201c;byClient&#x201d;)&#x2014;preferably, the token's creator is included, however, this may not be appropriate in a P2P environment, wherein anonymity is usually maintained, the date on which the token was created (i.e. &#x201c;date&#x201d;), the method by which the token was created (i.e. &#x201c;method&#x201d;) and data associated with a free text area (&#x201c;UserNotes&#x201d;), namely, preferably the user who has entered free text (i.e. &#x201c;client&#x201d;) and the date on which the free text associated with that user was last edited (i.e. &#x201c;lastEditDate&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A first scenario involves a team of software sales people (Seller_A, Seller_B and Seller_C) in an IT company. In this environment a sales person's initial contact with a customer can lead to many people performing tasks in support of the proposal generation process. In this scenario, the team members have an associated peer device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an overview of a peer device (<b>500</b>) in which the present invention may be implemented and will be described in more detail, with reference to various scenarios.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, preferably, a peer device comprises a profile (<b>540</b>) that stores a unique identifier for that peer device. Preferably, the profile comprises other information associated with the peer device (e.g. an identifier associated with the user of the peer device, security attributes etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Seller_A is the first to make contact with a customer. Seller_A creates a first piece of information (highlighted in bold) on his peer device (<b>500</b>), for example, via a word processing application program.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to the present invention, a creating component (<b>510</b>) creates a token (<b>200</b>) by preferably using the defining component (<b>505</b>). Next, the token (<b>200</b>) is associated (by an associating component (<b>515</b>)) with the first piece of information. Preferably, the token (<b>200</b>) is stored in a storage area (<b>545</b>). In a preferred embodiment, the storage area (<b>545</b>) stores the unique token identifier of a token, as well as the token itself. Seller_A's storage area is shown below:</p>

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In one embodiment, the request comprises the token identifier of the original token as well as a request to view the most current version of the token.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Once the request is received at the host peer device (<b>615</b>), preferably, the host peer device (<b>615</b>) sends a notification to Seller_B's peer device, notifying Seller_B of Seller_A's request. Preferably, this causes the control component (<b>610</b>) on the peer device (<b>600</b>) to be executed, thereby allowing Seller_B to either reject or accept the request.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">If Seller_B rejects the request, communication ends and preferably, a notification is sent to Seller_A's peer device (<b>600</b>). If Seller_B accepts the request, preferably, this causes the searching component (<b>640</b>) to be executed, which then searches the storage area (<b>655</b>), using the token identifier. Once the token versions are found, preferably, the determining component (<b>645</b>) determines the most current version of a token is executed. Once the most current version is found, Seller_A is given access to it.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In one embodiment, the most current version of a token and the associated information is sent to Seller_A's peer device (<b>600</b>). In another embodiment, Seller_A views the token and associated information on the host peer device (<b>615</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The provision of a system with a host peer devices and peer devices provides flexibility for users, as preferably, they are able to use whichever model is this most appropriate for their current geographical location and infrastructure environment. It should be understood that in the hybrid system, if tokens are communicated between peer devices, in order to obtain the most current version of the tokens, the peer devices preferably contact the host peer device.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Advantageously, the provision of a host peer device allows the mechanism to be &#x201c;lightweight&#x201d; because the peer devices can communicate by using only the unique token identifiers. Furthermore, in a preferred embodiment the associated information is held on the host peer device and the peer devices can view this associated information on the host peer device. This therefore improves storage capacity on the peer devices.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In one implementation, the present invention can be used to track music files. In this implementation, the music file creator creates a token and attaches (i.e. associates) it to the music file. Preferably, the defining component is configured to define data relating to the music file creator, data associated with a date on which a download occurred, data associated with the device that downloads, data associated with a date on which the downloaded file was sent and data associated with the device that receives the download. As the music file is passed from peer device to peer device, the token data is updated, creating a &#x201c;trail&#x201d;. This trail facilitates tracking of the music file.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In another implementation, the mechanism of the present invention can be used with existing technologies such as e-mail systems. One problem associated with e-mail systems is that when a user sends an e-mail to the rest of the team, if the user forgets to address a member of the team, that team member will not be able to see the e-mail unless one of the other team members sends the e-mail. Advantageously, the mechanism of the present invention allows any team member to obtain any updates to the information. In one embodiment, this process happens automatically (e.g. via a software agent) and therefore, there is no need for team members to keep track of whom they have collaborated with.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">A token provides a mechanism for recording and organizing information, allowing users to capture knowledge and share it with others, either at the point of capture or at a later time of the users' choosing.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Advantageously, the present invention allows collaboration to occur without a central host peer device and this is much more flexible, since tokens can be passed between peer devices without them having to wait until they are connected to the host peer device.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Team members who collaborate also form an established community centered on the information associated with the team. All members of the team can review any updates to the information</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In addition to these properties, tokens contain life history information (e.g. parent token information etc.) that allows relationships between tokens to be explored. This information can later be consolidated and analyzed.</p>
