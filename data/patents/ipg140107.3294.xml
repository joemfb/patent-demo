<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a group III nitride semiconductor substrate production method, and a group III nitride semiconductor substrate. In particular, it relates to a group III nitride semiconductor substrate production method, which involves cutting a bulk crystal, and a group III nitride semiconductor substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>

<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to the above production method, it is possible to obtain a GaN substrate with low dislocation density surface because dislocations extend in the GaN single crystal growing direction and are parallel to the substrate surface sliced by slicing the ingot parallel to the dislocation-extending direction.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Group III nitride semiconductor (e.g., boron nitride (BN), aluminum nitride (AlN), gallium nitride (GaN), indium nitride (InN)) crystals have any structure of wurtzite (WZ), zinc blende (ZB), or rock salt (RS). Here, WZ crystalline group III nitride semiconductors are polarized in the [0 0 0 1] direction (c-axis direction) by a difference between electronegativities of group III and V elements. For example, planes perpendicular to the c-axis direction are classified into group III and V polar planes. As one example, group III nitride semiconductor GaN has Ga and N polar planes, and the N polar plane tends to be etched more than the Ga polar plane.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Here, the present inventors have discovered that when measuring the Vickers hardness of each of Ga and N polar planes of GaN, the Vickers hardness of the N polar plane is much softer than the Vickers hardness of the Ga polar plane. Its results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows plane orientation dependency of Vickers hardness of a GaN single crystal and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates the cutting direction relative to crystalline faces of a bulk Group III nitride semiconductor crystal, namely the GaN single crystal.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in the GaN single crystal, the Vickers hardness of the (0 0 0 &#x2212;1) plane, i.e., N polar plane is on the order of 4.4 GPa, while the Vickers hardness of the (0 0 0 1) plane at the angle of 180&#xb0; to the (0 0 0 &#x2212;1) plane, i.e., Ga polar plane is on the order of 7.9 GPa, which is harder than the Vickers hardness of the N polar plane. As the angle to the (0 0 0 &#x2212;1) plane is greater, the Vickers hardness increases. Specifically, as the angle to the (0 0 0 &#x2212;1) plane exceeds 30&#xb0; up to 45&#xb0;, the Vickers hardness increases substantially monotonically, and at angles exceeding 45&#xb0;, the rate of increase is higher. It is shown that as the angle increases from 150&#xb0; to 180&#xb0;, the Vickers hardness is saturated. The &#x2212;n (n: natural number) in a Miller index, such as (0 0 0 &#x2212;1), refers to a negative intercept with a specified coordinate axis.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In this manner, the present inventors have, for the first time, found the fact that, in GaN, the mechanical hardness of Ga and N polar planes depends on crystalline orientations. Based on this fact, the present inventors have found that, in group III nitride semiconductors including GaN single crystals, slicing is performed easily from a mechanically soft crystalline plane (e.g., N polar plane in the case of GaN) to a mechanically hard crystalline plane (e.g., Ga polar plane in the case of GaN).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In other words, the present inventors have found that, in group III nitride semiconductors comprising one crystalline plane and the other crystalline plane having a smaller hardness than the one crystalline plane, slicing is performed easily from the other crystalline plane (mechanically soft crystalline plane) to the one crystalline plane (mechanically hard crystalline plane). Also, the present inventors have found that when slicing a bulk crystal comprising a group III nitride semiconductor single crystal to fabricate a nonpolar or semipolar substrate, slicing is performed easily from its mechanically soft crystalline plane to mechanically hard crystalline plane.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Group III Nitride Semiconductor Substrate Manufacturing Method</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows one example of manufacturing flow of a group III nitride semiconductor substrate in an embodiment according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The process for manufacturing a group III nitride semiconductor substrate in this embodiment comprises preparing a bulk crystal comprising a group III nitride semiconductor single crystal comprising one crystalline plane and the other crystalline plane having a smaller hardness than the one crystalline plane, cutting the prepared bulk crystal from the other crystalline plane to the one crystalline plane of the bulk crystal to provide a surface-untreated group III nitride semiconductor substrate, and grinding the frontside and backside cut surfaces (herein, also referred to as sliced surfaces) of the group III nitride semiconductor substrate obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Below is explained one example of manufacturing a GaN substrate as the group III nitride semiconductor substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Preparing a GaN Ingot</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">First, as one example, using Hydride Vapor Phase Epitaxy (HVPE), a thick GaN film is formed on a Ga or N polar plane of a GaN monocrystalline substrate with a c-plane, to manufacture a monocrystalline GaN ingot (S<b>100</b>, S denoting Step). Also, sapphire substrate surface may be pretreated using Epitaxial Lateral Overgrowth (ELO) or the like. And a thick GaN film is formed by HVPE as a nitride semiconductor. Subsequently, the sapphire substrate is removed by mechanical grinding or laser liftoff. This also results in a GaN ingot as a bulk crystal comprising a GaN single crystal.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Cutting</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Subsequently, the GaN ingot obtained is cut (herein, also referred to as &#x201c;sliced&#x201d;). Specifically, the GaN ingot comprises a first crystalline plane having a first hardness and a second crystalline plane having a smaller second hardness than the first crystalline plane, and in this embodiment, is sliced from the second crystalline plane to the first crystalline plane (S<b>110</b>). For example, the GaN ingot is sliced from its N polar plane to Ga polar plane in this embodiment. The slicing may be implemented with a wire saw having a wire such as a piano wire (steel wire). Also, the slicing may be implemented at a slicing speed of not less than 2 mm/h. This results in a sliced GaN substrate (herein, also referred to as &#x201c;as-sliced wafer&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As long as slicing is performed toward one crystalline plane having a greater hardness than the hardness of the other crystalline plane, the slicing is not limited to the case of cutting from the N polar plane to Ga polar plane. For example, the GaN ingot may be sliced at an angle between the cutting (slicing) direction and +c-axis direction, i.e., [0 0 0 1] direction ranging not less than 0 and less than 90 degrees, preferably not less than 0 and not more than 45 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Grinding</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Subsequently, both frontside and backside surfaces of the as-sliced wafer are mirror-ground (S<b>120</b>). In this grinding, there is removed a damaged layer containing damages such as crystalline defects caused by cutting inward from the as-sliced wafer surfaces. In this embodiment, the damaged layer depth is not more than 50 &#x3bc;m, and therefore in the grinding, the grinding and removal is performed at least from the as-sliced wafer surfaces up to a depth on the order of 50 &#x3bc;m. This results in a ground GaN substrate in this embodiment having exposed ground surfaces with the damaged layer removed therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The group III nitride semiconductor is not limited to GaN, but may use other group III nitride semiconductors having polarities similar to AIN, GaN, or the like. Also, the GaN ingot in this embodiment may be manufactured using metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE), molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), Na flux, ammonothermal growth, or the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Advantages of the Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Since the group III nitride semiconductor substrate manufacturing method in this embodiment slices a bulk crystal from the other crystalline plane to one crystalline plane having a greater hardness than the hardness of the other crystalline plane, it is possible to reduce the thickness of the damaged layer of the sliced substrate, i.e., the depth from the substrate surface to a region end containing crystalline defect portion.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">For example, it is possible to reduce the thickness of the damaged layer even if the slicing speed is increased using a bulk crystal comprising a hard and fragile GaN single crystal compared to semiconductor crystals such as Si, GaAs, and the like. This allows a reduction of the damaged layer thickness and enhancement of the slicing speed.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Reducing the damaged layer thickness allows a reduction in grinding amount in grinding. Accordingly, in the case of adding, to the thickness of the group III nitride semiconductor substrate manufactured by grinding, the damaged layer thickness caused by cutting as a margin during slicing it is possible to reduce the thickness of that margin. This allows an increase in the number of substrates which can be cut out of one ingot.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Further, even if the slicing speed is increased to 2 mm/h or more as one example, it is possible to inhibit an increase of the damaged layer thickness, and therefore substantially shorten the period of time of slicing the bulk crystal and manufacturing the group III nitride semiconductor substrate. For example, in the prior art, the slicing speed is at most 1 mm/h, and therefore the period of time required in slicing a 2 inch (50.8 mm) diameter bulk crystal is not less than 2 days, whereas the manufacturing method in the present embodiment can increase the slicing speed doubly or more, and therefore shorten the period of time required in slicing a 2 inch diameter bulk crystal to &#xbd; or less.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Also, in the prior art, GaN crystals cut by a wire saw may have striped unevenness formed parallel to the wire moving direction. This is called saw marks, and is visible. GaN crystals have a high hardness, and during GaN ingot cutting, therefore tend to cause wire bending or deflection, to produce saw marks. Also, the higher the slicing speed, the more saw marks occur. GaN substrates having remarkable saw marks tend to leave those marks in their ground surfaces after grinding, and therefore produce a striped pattern in the ground surfaces due to surface roughness variations, or tend to leave shallow striped unevenness in the ground surfaces, and render ground surface roughness anisotropic. However, since the group III nitride semiconductor substrate manufacturing method in the present embodiment slices a bulk crystal i.e., GaN ingot from the other crystalline plane to one crystalline plane having a greater hardness than the hardness of the other crystalline plane, even when grinding the sliced surface of the sliced GaN substrate it is possible to make the ground surface roughness isotropic.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Also, the group III nitride semiconductor substrate manufacturing method in the present embodiment slices a bulk crystal from the other crystalline plane to one crystalline plane having a greater hardness than the hardness of the other crystalline plane. In other words, since it slices a bulk crystal from its mechanically soft plane to hard plane, it is possible to shorten the period of time of slicing even in the case of a hard bulk crystal. This allows a decrease in wire abrasion of a wire saw, and inhibiting wire constituent material produced by wire abrasion from contaminating the sliced crystal surface, i.e., as-sliced wafer surface. Accordingly, it is possible to manufacture a high-purity group III nitride semiconductor substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Also, for example, the off angle of surface of a GaN substrate used as an underlying substrate in epitaxial growth significantly affects composition of epitaxial growth layers such as InGaN, AlGaN, etc. Accordingly, the off angle of the GaN substrate surface requires precise control and management. However, in the prior art, when slicing a hard crystal such as a GaN crystal, high-speed slicing may cause wire bending or deflection from an intended position of the GaN ingot. In this case, crystalline orientation distributions in the sliced surface may be large. This sliced surface whose crystalline orientation distributions are large can be modified by obliquely grinding the sliced surface, but in order to ensure specified finished thickness, requires making the original cutout thick. On the other hand, since the group III nitride semiconductor substrate manufacturing method in the present embodiment slices a bulk crystal from the other crystalline plane to one crystalline plane having a greater hardness than the hardness of the other crystalline plane, proper slicing at an intended position of the GaN ingot is possible. This allows manufacturing a good surface accuracy substrate, i.e., a high accuracy GaN substrate.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example 1</heading>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">First, a 2 inch c-plane GaN substrate is prepared. Subsequently, on the Ga polar plane of the GaN substrate prepared is further grown GaN by HVPE. This results in a 20 mm-thick GaN ingot.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Subsequently, using a wire saw, the GaN ingot manufactured is sliced parallel to the c-axis. That is, the slicing is performed from the N polar side to Ga polar side, i.e., in the [0 0 0 1] direction and from the N polar plane to Ga polar plane. Here, used as the wire of the wire saw is a 0.16 mm piano wire. Also, there is prepared a coating material with 5 &#x3bc;m average grain size free abrasive diamond grains dispersed in oil slurry. The GaN ingot portion is wire-saw-sliced (cut), supplying this coating material thereto. The temperature of the oil slurry is set at 30&#xb0; C. Also, the cutting speed is set at 4 mm/h.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">This results in an as-sliced GaN wafer having exposed sliced surfaces at both its sides. The as-sliced wafer obtained is a GaN substrate whose M-plane, i.e., (10-10) plane is a principal surface, and is 20 mm&#xd7;40 mm-sized and 0.6 mm-thick. The period of time required for cutting is approximately 5 hours. Also, no wire bending is caused during GaN ingot slicing. Here, no saw marks are observed in the cut surface of the as-sliced wafer, i.e., the substrate surface exposed by slicing.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The damaged layer depth of the as-sliced wafer surface obtained is calculated by microscopic Raman spectroscopy. Here, the Raman spectral peak is shifted by the crystal lattice strained due to stress caused in the object to be measured. Accordingly, the damaged layer depth is calculated by microscopic Raman spectroscopic measurement of the as-sliced wafer cleavage section inward from the as-sliced wafer surface, and Raman peak shift measurement to the depth from the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows results of microscopic Raman spectroscopic measurement of an as-sliced wafer in Example 1.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in the region from as-sliced wafer surface (at the depth of 0 &#x3bc;m in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) to the depth on the order of 10 &#x3bc;m, the Raman peak shifts to the low wave number side due to damages such as crystalline defects. The Raman peak varies gradually to the high wave number side with increasing depth from the sliced surface, and at depths of 40 &#x3bc;m or more, is saturated on the order of a wave number of 6.95 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. From this result, the damaged layer depth of the as-sliced wafer in Example 1 is considered to be not more than 40 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Subsequently, both surfaces of the as-sliced wafer in Example 1 are mirror-ground by 50 &#x3bc;m's. This results in a 0.5 mm-thick ground GaN substrate with mirror-ground surfaces. Since the ground GaN substrate in Example 1 is formed by slicing the GaN ingot in the [0 0 0 1] direction and subsequently grinding the sliced surfaces, its principal surface is an M-plane, i.e., (10-10) plane.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The surface roughness (RMS value) of the ground GaN substrate in Example 1 is measured under an atomic force microscope (AFM). The surface roughness measurement is performed in 4 directions inclined by 45&#xb0;'s to a wire moving direction of a wire saw taken as a reference.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows results of measuring surface roughness of a ground GaN substrate in Example 1.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the RMS value for the ground GaN substrate surface shows a substantially constant regardless of measuring directions. Specifically, taking the RMS value measured in the wire moving direction as a reference value (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the value measured at the angle of 0&#xb0;), the absolute values of differences between this reference value, and RMS values of surfaces at angles of 45&#xb0;, 90&#xb0; and 135&#xb0; to the wire moving direction are within the range of not more than 10 nm. This verifies that the surface roughness of the ground GaN substrate in Example 1 is isotropic, in other words, there occur no striped pattern and unevenness left in the sliced and ground surface roughness according to wire moving directions of the wire saw, i.e., no phenomenon of unevenness (herein, also referred to &#x201c;saw mark effect&#x201d;) occurring in particular directions only.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Also, the RMS value of surface roughness in the 100 &#x3bc;m&#xd7;100 &#x3bc;m region in the ground GaN substrate surface in Example 1 is 5 nm. Further, the dispersion of crystalline orientation distributions in the ground GaN substrate surface is measured by an X-ray diffraction method. Its result verifies that the dispersion of crystalline orientation distributions in the ground GaN substrate surface in Example 1 is as small as a central value &#xb1;0.01&#xb0;, allowing high-precision GaN ingot slicing.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Subsequently, on the ground GaN substrate surface is epitaxially grown 3 &#x3bc;m-thick GaN using MOVPE, to obtain the GaN substrate with an epitaxial layer. The depth-direction profile of an iron (Fe) impurity concentration in the GaN substrate with the epitaxial layer is measured by SIMS analysis. Its result verifies that the Fe concentrations in the GaN layer, at the interface and in the GaN substrate are not more than a lower detection limit (2&#xd7;10<sup>15 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>).</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example 2</heading>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">First, a 20 mm-thick GaN ingot is fabricated in the same manner as in Example 1. Subsequently, using the same conditions as in Example 1, the GaN ingot is sliced from the N polar side to Ga polar side, parallel to the (1 1 &#x2212;2 2) plane, i.e., in the [&#x2212;1 &#x2212;1 2 3] direction. In Example 2, the slicing speed is set at 2 mm/h. This results in an as-sliced GaN wafer (23.5 mm&#xd7;40 mm-sized and 0.6 mm-thick) in Example 2. The period of time required for cutting is approximately 12 hours. Also, no wire bending is caused during GaN ingot slicing.

The period of time required for completely cutting the 20 mm-thick GaN ingot is approximately 10 hours due to large wire bending during GaN ingot slicing. That is, in Comparative Example 1, the slicing speed is virtually 2 mm/h. This results in an as-sliced GaN wafer (20 mm&#xd7;40 mm-sized and 0.6 mm-thick) in Comparative Example 1.
