<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention resides in a technical field relating to semiconductor devices. In particular, the present invention resides in a technical field relating to semiconductor devices that use a semiconductor element such as a transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Development of semiconductor devices having light-emitting elements has been advanced in recent years. In addition to the existing advantages of liquid crystal display devices, the semiconductor devices also have characteristics such as fast response speed, superior dynamic display, and a wide angle of view. The semiconductor devices are attracting attention as flat panel displays for the next generation of mobile devices, which will be capable of utilizing dynamic contents.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A semiconductor device having light-emitting elements has a plurality of pixels, which each have a light-emitting element and at least two transistors. The transistor that is connected in series with the light-emitting element in the pixel (hereinafter written as a driving transistor) plays a role in controlling light emitted from the light-emitting element. The light-emitting element has a structure having a first electrode, a second electrode, and a light-emitting layer sandwiched between the first electrode and the second electrode. One electrode connected to a source electrode or a drain electrode of the driving TFT is referred to as a pixel electrode, and the other electrode is referred to as an opposing electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Static electricity builds up, developing due to friction, contact, and the like with air and objects such as conductors, semiconductors, and insulators. Electrostatic discharge occurs if an object is strongly charged. If this phenomenon develops in a free node such as an input terminal of the semiconductor device, then minute semiconductor elements manufactured on a substrate will degrade or be destroyed. This is referred to as electrostatic discharge damage.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to prevent electrostatic discharge damage, a circuit formed on a substrate (hereinafter written as an internal circuit <b>64</b>) is connected to an externally attached IC (hereinafter written as an external circuit <b>61</b>) through a protecting means (also referred to as a protection circuit) <b>63</b> and an FPC <b>62</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. The protecting means <b>63</b> detects a voltage and a current supplied from the external circuit <b>61</b> to the internal circuit <b>64</b>, and controls the values of the voltage and the current in order to prevent damage to the internal circuit <b>64</b> during abnormal operation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">When manufacturing a semiconductor device having a light-emitting element, TFTs are first manufactured over a substrate, and light-emitting elements are manufactured thereafter. More specifically, TFTs are first manufactured over a substrate, and then wirings are manufactured so as to be electrically connected to source regions and drain regions of the TFTs. Pixel electrodes of the light-emitting elements are then manufactured so as to be electrically connected to the wirings. The pixel electrodes are in an exposed state when manufactured up to this point, and therefore static electricity tends to build up in the pixel electrodes. In particular, the pixel electrodes become antennas during manufacturing processes involving charged particles, such as dry etching and electron beam evaporation, and electrostatic discharge is easily induced. Sudden discharge of electric charge that has built up in the pixel electrodes leads to degradation or destruction of the semiconductor elements connected to the pixel electrodes.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In light of the above-mentioned circumstances, an object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor device having a light-emitting element, in which electrostatic discharge damage during manufacturing processes thereof is prevented. More specifically, an object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor device in which electrostatic discharge damage is prevented in a state up through the manufacture of pixel electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to resolve the above-mentioned problems, the present invention provides a semiconductor device in which a protecting means is formed in each pixel. The protecting means is provided with one or a plurality of elements selected from resistor elements, capacitor elements, and rectifying elements. Further, the present invention provides a semiconductor device in which the protecting means is disposed between a pixel electrode of a light-emitting element and a source electrode or a drain electrode of a transistor. Note that the aforementioned rectifying elements are, for example, elements having a rectifying action, and correspond to diodes, transistors of which a drain electrode and a gate electrode are connected, and the like. That is, an essential structure of the present invention is one in which the protecting means is formed in each pixel, and the protecting means is disposed between the pixel electrode of the light-emitting element, and the source electrode or the drain electrode of the transistor. The source electrode or the drain electrode of the transistor is connected to the pixel electrode for cases in which the protecting means is assumed not to be disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">If the protecting means is a resistor element, sudden changes in the electric potential of the source electrode or the drain electrode of the transistor are relieved by disposing the resistor element between the pixel electrode and the source electrode or the drain electrode of the transistor so that electric charge that builds up in the pixel electrode is not supplied all at once and directly to the transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">If the protecting means is a capacitor element, sudden changes in the electric potential of the source electrode or the drain electrode of the transistor are relieved by accumulating or discharging the electric charge contained in the capacitor element, and distributing the electric charge among the capacitor element and the transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">If the protecting means is a transistor of which the drain electrode and the gate electrode are connected, a source electrode of the transistor is connected to an electric power source line. The transistor discharges the electric charge that builds up in the pixel electrode to the electric power source line, and the electric potential of the pixel electrode is thus set to the same electric potential as that of the electric power source line, or to an electric potential conforming thereto.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Embodiment Mode 1</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">An embodiment mode of the present invention is explained using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> show a state up through the manufacture of a pixel electrode. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a schematic diagram of a top view (masking diagram) of a pixel of a semiconductor device, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a circuit diagram that schematically expresses a circuit structure thereof. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref> are cross sectional diagrams of the pixels of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a photograph of a panel having an actually manufactured pixel, magnified to approximately 635 times with an optical microscope.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Each of the pixels shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> are disposed in a region surrounded by a signal line <b>17</b> and an electric power source line <b>18</b> arranged in a column direction, and a scanning line <b>20</b> and a reset line <b>19</b> arranged in a row direction. Further, each of the pixels has a switching transistor <b>11</b> (hereinafter written as the transistor <b>11</b>), a driving transistor <b>12</b> (hereinafter written as the transistor <b>12</b>), an erasing transistor <b>13</b> (hereinafter written as the transistor <b>13</b>), a resistor element <b>14</b>, a capacitor element <b>15</b>, and a pixel electrode <b>16</b>. The resistor element <b>14</b> and the capacitor element <b>15</b> correspond to a protecting means <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The fact that the resistor element <b>14</b> and the capacitor element <b>15</b>, which are the protecting means <b>21</b>, are disposed can be given as a characteristic of each of the pixels shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>. The resistor element <b>14</b> relieves sudden changes in the electric potential of the transistor <b>12</b> caused by excess electric charge that builds up in the pixel electrode <b>16</b>. More specifically, sudden changes in the electric potential of a source electrode or a drain electrode of the transistor <b>12</b> can be relieved by disposing the resistor element <b>14</b> between the pixel electrode <b>16</b> and the transistor <b>12</b> so that the excess electric charge that builds up in the pixel electrode <b>16</b> is not supplied all at once and directly to the transistor <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In this embodiment mode, the resistor element <b>14</b> is formed by a semiconductor, and has a resistance value of several tens of k&#xd9;. Specifically, it has a resistance value of 20 k&#xd9; to 200 k&#xd9;. However, the present invention is not limited to this, and a metal or the like for forming a gate electrode or a wiring may also be used as a material for forming the resistor element <b>14</b>. Further, there are also no specific limitations placed on the shape of the resistor element <b>14</b> disposed within the pixel, and the shape can be arbitrarily set. In addition, there are also no specific limitations of the resistance value of the resistor element <b>14</b>, and the constituent material and its shape may be arbitrarily set so that a desired resistance value can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Similarly, the capacitor element <b>15</b> relieves sudden changes in the electric potential of the transistor <b>12</b> caused by the excess electric charge that builds up in the pixel electrode <b>16</b>. More specifically, the capacitor element <b>15</b> accumulates or discharges the excess electric charge that builds up in the pixel electrode <b>16</b>. That is, the excess electric charge that builds up in the pixel electrode <b>16</b> is distributed between the capacitor element <b>15</b> and the transistor <b>12</b>, and sudden changes of the electric potential of the source electrode or the drain electrode of the transistor <b>12</b> are thus relieved.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In this embodiment, the capacitor element <b>15</b> is formed by a laminate of a semiconductor, a gate insulating film, and a gate electrode, and has a capacitance value of several hundreds of fF. Specifically, the capacitor element <b>15</b> has a capacitance value of 100 to 200 fF. However, the present invention is not limited to this, and the material constituting the capacitor element <b>15</b> and the shape of the capacitor element <b>15</b> can be set arbitrarily. Further, there are no specific limitations of the capacitance value of the capacitor element <b>15</b>, and the constituent material and shape may be arbitrarily set so that a desired capacitance value can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Further, the fact that the value of (a channel length L)/(a channel width W) of the transistor <b>12</b> is set to a value equal to or greater than 10 can be given as a characteristic other than those described above. The L/W value is normally from 0.1 to 2, but is set to a value equal to or greater than 10 with the present invention. The capacitance value between the gate and the source of the transistor <b>12</b> itself is such large, and the transistor <b>12</b> can also serve as a capacitor element.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Further, a light-emitting element is structured by wide range of materials covering such as organic materials, inorganic materials, thin film materials, bulk materials, and dispersion materials. From among these materials, organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) which are structured mainly by organic materials can be given as typical light-emitting elements. OLEDs have a structure in which there are an anode, a cathode, and a light-emitting layer sandwiched between the anode and the cathode. The light-emitting layer is structured by one or a plurality of materials selected from the materials described above. Further, light emission caused by return to a ground state from a singlet excitation state (fluorescence), and light emission caused by return to a ground state from a triplet excitation state (phosphorescence) are included in types of luminescence that occur in the light emitting layer.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Next, typical cross sectional structures for the semiconductor device pixel shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref> show a state up through the manufacture of the transistor and the light-emitting element on a substrate. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a cross sectional diagram along the line A-A&#x2032; of the pixel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, and is a cross sectional diagram of the transistor <b>11</b> and the transistor <b>13</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a cross sectional diagram along the line B-B&#x2032;, and is a cross sectional diagram of the transistor <b>12</b>, the electric power source line <b>18</b>, and the signal line <b>17</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> is a cross sectional diagram along the line C-C&#x2032;, and is a cross sectional diagram of the capacitor element <b>15</b> and the pixel electrode <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Reference numeral <b>101</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref> denotes a substrate. Glass substrates, ceramic substrates, quartz substrates, silicon substrates, or plastic substrates (including plastic films) can be used for the substrate <b>101</b>. Further, reference numeral <b>102</b> denotes a base film, which includes a silicon nitride oxide film, a silicon oxynitride film, or a laminate film of these films.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A semiconductor that constitutes an active layer of the transistor <b>11</b> and the transistor <b>13</b> is formed over the base film <b>102</b>. The active layer has a source region <b>103</b>, a drain region <b>104</b>, and a source region <b>107</b>. LDD regions <b>105</b><i>a </i>to <b>105</b><i>d</i>, and channel forming regions <b>106</b><i>a </i>and <b>106</b><i>b</i>, are formed between the source region <b>103</b> and the drain region <b>104</b>, and LDD regions <b>105</b><i>e </i>to <b>105</b><i>h</i>, and channel forming regions <b>106</b><i>c </i>and <b>106</b><i>d</i>, are formed between the drain region <b>104</b> and the source region <b>107</b>, respectively. Note that the active layer of the transistors <b>11</b> and <b>13</b> is an n-type impurity region. Further, semiconductors <b>108</b> to <b>110</b> that are to be the active layers of the transistor <b>12</b>, and a semiconductor that constitutes the capacitor element <b>15</b> are formed at the same time. A p-type impurity region <b>111</b> and an intrinsic semiconductor region <b>112</b> are formed in the semiconductor that constitutes the capacitor element <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A gate insulating film <b>113</b> is formed over the semiconductors by using a silicon oxide film, a silicon oxynitride film (corresponding to a silicon compound film containing Si at 25 to 35 atomic %, oxygen at 55 to 65 atomic %, nitrogen at 1 to 20 atomic %, and hydrogen at 0.1 to 10 atomic %), an aluminum nitride film, an aluminum oxide film, an aluminum oxynitride film, or a laminate film of these insulating films and a silicon nitride film. The gate insulating film <b>113</b> functions as a gate insulating film for the transistors <b>11</b> to <b>13</b>. Further, the gate insulating film functions as a dielectric of the capacitor element <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A metallic layer is patterned on the gate insulating film <b>113</b> to form gate electrodes <b>114</b> and <b>115</b> of the transistor <b>11</b>, gate electrodes <b>116</b> and <b>117</b> of the transistor <b>13</b>, and gate electrodes <b>118</b> and <b>119</b> of the transistor <b>12</b>. Note that the shapes of a first layer electrode (tantalum nitride film) and a second layer electrode (tungsten film) of the gate electrodes of the transistors <b>11</b> and <b>13</b> differ from each other. The first layer electrode has a wider line width than the second layer electrode. JP 2002-57162 A, by the applicants of the present invention, may be referred to regarding reasons for, and advantages of, this characteristic formation method and adopting this type of structure of gate electrode. Further, electrodes <b>120</b> and <b>121</b>, which construct the capacitor element <b>15</b>, are formed together with the gate electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As a first inorganic insulating film <b>122</b>, a silicon nitride oxide film (corresponding to a silicon compound film containing Si at 25 to 35 atomic %, oxygen at 15 to 30 atomic %, nitrogen at 20 to 35 atomic %, and hydrogen at 15 to 25 atomic %), or a silicon nitride film formed by plasma CVD, is formed to have a thickness of 0.1 to 1 &#x3bc;m (preferably from 0.2 to 0.5 &#x3bc;m) over the gate electrodes, and over the electrodes that construct the capacitor element <b>15</b>. The first inorganic insulating film <b>122</b> contains hydrogen at a concentration of 15 to 25 atomic %, and therefore can be made to function as a hydrogen supply source by heat treatment, so that hydrogen termination of the semiconductor, which constitutes an active layer, can be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A first organic resin film <b>123</b> containing a positive photosensitive organic resin is formed over the first inorganic insulating film <b>122</b> at a thickness of 0.7 to 5 &#x3bc;m (preferably from 2 to 4 &#x3bc;m). The first organic resin film <b>123</b> is applied by spin coating and firing. Portions at which it is desired to form opening portions are then exposed to light by using a photomask. Specifically, portions for forming wirings of the transistor <b>11</b> and the transistor <b>13</b>, the gate electrodes <b>118</b> and <b>119</b> of the transistor <b>12</b>, and a portion for taking the capacitance, are exposed to light. If an opening portion is formed in the first organic resin film <b>123</b>, the first inorganic insulating film <b>122</b> is in a state of being partially exposed in the opening portion.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A silicon oxynitride film, a silicon nitride film, an aluminum nitride film, or an aluminum oxynitride film is then formed at a thickness of 0.1 to 0.2 &#x3bc;m as a second inorganic insulating film <b>124</b>, covering the first inorganic insulating film <b>122</b> exposed partially and the first organic resin film <b>123</b>. The second inorganic insulating film <b>124</b> functions to suppress the passage of moisture to and from the first organic resin film <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">A contact hole is formed in the gate insulating film <b>113</b>, the first inorganic insulating film <b>122</b>, and the second inorganic insulating film <b>124</b> by dry etching. By patterning a conductive film formed so as to cover the contact hole, laminates of a 0.1 &#x3bc;m Ti film, a 0.35 &#x3bc;m Al film, and a 0.15 &#x3bc;m Ti film are formed as source wirings <b>125</b> and <b>127</b>, and a drain wiring <b>126</b>. A wiring <b>128</b> corresponding to the electric power source line <b>18</b>, a wiring <b>129</b> corresponding to the signal line <b>17</b>, and a wiring <b>130</b> that connects a p-type impurity region <b>111</b> and a pixel electrode <b>131</b> are formed at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Note that a laminate of the gate electrodes <b>118</b> and <b>119</b> and the wiring <b>128</b>, with the first inorganic insulating film <b>122</b> and the second inorganic insulating film <b>124</b> interposed therebetween, corresponds to a capacitor element in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. That is, the above-mentioned laminate and a laminate constructed from the gate insulating film <b>113</b> interposed between the semiconductors <b>108</b> to <b>110</b> and the gate electrodes <b>118</b> and <b>119</b>, function as two capacitor elements with this structure. Conventional capacitance values of 100 to 500 fF per single transistor can thus be increased to 1000 to 1200 fF. The two laminates described above maintain the voltage between the gate electrode and source of the transistor <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Further, a laminate of the gate electrodes <b>120</b> and <b>121</b> and the wiring <b>130</b>, with the first inorganic insulating film <b>122</b> and the second inorganic insulating film <b>124</b> interposed therebetween, corresponds to a capacitor element in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>. This capacitor element plays a role in maintaining the voltage of the gate electrode of the transistor <b>12</b>. A laminate of an intrinsic semiconductor <b>112</b> and the gate electrodes <b>120</b> and <b>121</b>, with the gate insulating film <b>113</b> interposed therebetween, also functions as a capacitor element with this structure. This capacitor element functions as a protecting means.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Next, a pixel electrode <b>131</b> that contacts the wiring <b>130</b> is formed by patterning a transparent conductive film such as ITO. A second organic resin film <b>132</b> made from a positive photosensitive organic resin is formed on the pixel electrode <b>131</b>. The second organic resin film <b>132</b> is applied by spin coating and firing. A portion at which it is desired to form an opening portion is then exposed to light by using a photomask. A state in which a portion of the pixel electrode <b>131</b> is exposed in the opening portion results when the opening portion is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Note that roundness can be provided in the cross section of the opening portion by using a negative or a positive organic resin film with this structure. It therefore becomes possible to have good coverage of a light-emitting layer and a counter electrode formed later. Defects, called shrink, in which a light-emitting region is reduced in size, can be decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">An inorganic insulating film that contains nitrogen is then patterned, forming a third inorganic insulating film <b>124</b> at a thickness of 0.1 to 0.2 &#x3bc;m so as to cover the exposed pixel electrode <b>131</b> and the second organic resin film <b>132</b>. A light-emitting layer <b>134</b> is formed next by evaporation. In addition, a counter electrode <b>135</b> is formed by evaporation. A laminate of the pixel electrode <b>131</b>, the light-emitting layer <b>134</b>, and the counter electrode <b>135</b> corresponds to a light-emitting element. A TFT and the light-emitting element are thus formed on the substrate <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Next, a photograph of a panel having an actually manufactured pixel is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, magnified to approximately 635 times with an optical microscope. Concrete specifications for the pixels are a channel length of 390 &#x3bc;m and a channel width of 5 &#x3bc;m for the transistor <b>12</b>, and channel lengths of 4.5 &#x3bc;m for the transistors <b>11</b> and <b>13</b>. Further, the pixel pitch is 189 &#x3bc;m vertically, and 63 &#x3bc;m horizontally, with an aperture ratio of 40%.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The present invention, having the structure described above, disposes the resistor element <b>14</b> between the pixel electrode <b>16</b> and the transistor <b>12</b> so that the excess electric charge that builds up in the pixel electrode <b>16</b> is not supplied all at once and directly to the transistor <b>12</b>. Sudden changes in the electric potential of the source electrode or the drain electrode of the transistor <b>12</b> are thus relieved. Further, the capacitor element <b>15</b> is disposed between the pixel electrode <b>16</b> and the transistor <b>12</b>, and the excess charge that builds up in the pixel electrode <b>16</b> is distributed to the capacitor element <b>15</b> and the transistor <b>12</b>. Sudden changes in the electric potential of the source electrode or the drain electrode of the transistor <b>12</b> are thus relieved. The present invention prevents electrostatic discharge damage by relieving sudden changes in the electric potential of the source electrode or the drain electrode of the transistor caused by the electric charge that builds up in the pixel electrode. Further, the present invention prevents electrostatic discharge damage during manufacturing processes, and in particular, prevents electrostatic discharge damage in a state up through the manufacture of the pixel electrode.</p>

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Further, the fact that the value of (the channel length L)/(the channel width W) of the transistor <b>12</b> is set to a value equal to or greater than 10 can be given as a characteristic differing from those described above.

<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Note that roundness can be provided in the cross section of the opening portion by using the organic resin film with this structure.

<p id="p-0106" num="0105">A driving method applied to a semiconductor device of the present invention is explained in brief in this embodiment mode.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Analog gray scale methods and digital gray scale methods can be given as rough classifications of driving methods for displaying multiple scale images, and both methods can be applied to the semiconductor device of the present invention. The difference between the two methods is in controlling the light-emitting elements when they are in a light-emitting state, and in a non-light-emitting state. The analog gray scale method is a method in which gray scales are obtained by controlling the amount of an electric current flowing in the light-emitting elements. Further, the digital gray scale method is a method of driving by using only two states, a state in which the light-emitting elements are on (a state in which the brightness is nearly 100%), and a state in which the light-emitting elements are off (a state in which the brightness is nearly 0%).</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">A method of combining the digital gray scale method with a surface area gray scale method (hereinafter written to as a surface area gray scale method) and a method of combining the digital gray scale method with a time gray scale method (hereinafter written as a time gray scale method) are proposed in order to express multiple gray scales image in the digital gray scale method.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The surface area gray scale method is a method in which one pixel is divided into a plurality of sub-pixels, and light emission or non-light emission is selected for each of the sub-pixels. Gray scales are expressed by the difference between the surface area over which light is emitted, and the remaining surface area, in the one pixel. Further, as reported in JP 2001-5426 A, the time gray scale method is a method in which gray scale expression is performed by controlling the amount of time during which the light-emitting elements emit light. Specifically, one frame period is divided into a plurality of subframe periods of different lengths, and selection is made in each period as to whether the light-emitting elements emit light or do not emit light. Gray scales are expressed by the difference in the lengths of time during which light is emitted within the one frame period.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The semiconductor device of the present invention can apply the analog gray scale method and the digital gray scale method. Further, single color display and multiple color display can be performed. Note that a plurality of sub-pixels corresponding to the colors R, G, and B are formed in one pixel when performing multiple color display. Even if the same voltage is applied to each of the sub-pixels, the brightness of light emitted will differ due to differences in such as transmittance of color filters or the electric current density of each of the R, G, and B materials. It is therefore preferable to change the electric potential of electric power source lines for each of the sub-pixels that correspond to each of the colors.</p>

<p id="p-0123" num="0122">A portion of the light-emitting device that is emitting light consumes power, so it is desirable to display information in such a manner that the light-emitting portion therein becomes as small as possible. Accordingly, when the light-emitting device is applied to a display portion which mainly displays character information, e.g., a display portion of a portable information terminal, and more particular, a mobile telephone or a sound reproduction device, it is desirable to drive the light-emitting device so that the character information is formed by a light-emitting portion while a non-emission portion corresponds to the background.</p>

<p id="p-0125" num="0124">A module with a mounted IC that contains a controller, electric power source circuit, and the like is loaded in a panel in a state in which a light-emitting element is sealed in the electronic devices shown in Embodiment Mode 7. The module and the panel both correspond to embodiments of a display device. The specific structure of the module is explained here.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">A schematic diagram of the module in which a controller <b>801</b> and an electric power source circuit <b>802</b> are mounted into a panel <b>800</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>. A pixel portion <b>803</b> in which a light-emitting element is formed in each pixel, a scanning line driving circuit <b>804</b> for selecting pixels in the pixel portion <b>803</b>, and a signal line driving circuit for supplying a video signal to the selected pixels are formed in the panel <b>800</b>. Further, the controller <b>801</b> and the electric power source circuit <b>802</b> are formed in a printed substrate <b>806</b>. Each type of signal and an electric power source voltage output from the controller <b>801</b> or the electric power source circuit <b>802</b> is supplied through an FPC <b>807</b> to the pixel portion <b>803</b>, the scanning line driving circuit <b>804</b>, and the signal line driving circuit <b>805</b> of the panel <b>800</b>. The electric power source voltage and each type of signal are supplied to the printed substrate <b>806</b> through an interface (I/F) portion <b>808</b> on which a plurality of input terminals are disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Note that although the printed substrate <b>806</b> is mounted via an FPC to the panel <b>800</b> in this embodiment, the structure is not always necessarily limited to this. The controller <b>801</b> and the electric power source circuit <b>802</b> may also be mounted directly to the panel <b>800</b> by using a COG (chip on glass) method. Further, noise may ride on the electric power source voltage and the signals, and the signal rise time may become slowed, due to capacitances that are formed between leading wirings, resistance of wirings themselves, and the like in the printed circuit <b>806</b>. Various types of elements, such as capacitors and buffers, may be formed in the printed substrate <b>806</b> so as to prevent noise from riding on the electric power source voltage or the signals, and slowness in the signal rise time.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">A block diagram of the structure of the printed substrate <b>806</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>. Each of the signals and the electric power source voltage supplied by to the interface <b>808</b> is supplied to the controller <b>801</b> and the electric power source circuit <b>802</b>. The controller <b>801</b> has an analog interface circuit <b>809</b>, a phase locked loop (PLL) <b>810</b>, a control signal generator circuit <b>811</b>, and SRAMs (static random access memories) <b>812</b> and <b>813</b>. Note that, although SRAMs are used here, it is also possible to use SDRAMs or DRAMs (dynamic random access memories) as substitutes for the SRAM, provided that the DRAMs are capable of writing and reading data at a high speed.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">An analog video signal supplied through the interface <b>808</b> undergoes A/D conversion and parallel-serial conversion in the analog interface circuit <b>809</b>, and is input to the control signal generator circuit <b>811</b> as a digital video signal corresponding to the colors R, G, and B. Further, an Hsync signal, a Vsync signal, a clock signal CLK, and the like are generated in the analog interface circuit <b>809</b> based on each of the signals supplied through the interface <b>808</b>, and then input to the control signal generator circuit <b>811</b>. The analog interface circuit <b>809</b> need not be disposed if a digital video signal is input directly into the interface <b>808</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The phase locked loop <b>810</b> functions to align the phase of the operating frequency of the control signal generator circuit <b>811</b> with the frequency of each of the signals supplied through the interface <b>808</b>. The operating frequency of the control signal generator circuit <b>811</b> is not necessarily the same as the frequency of each of the signals supplied through the interface <b>808</b>. The operating frequency of the control signal generator circuit <b>811</b> is regulated in the phase locked loop <b>810</b> so that the frequencies become synchronized.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The video signal input to the control signal generator circuit <b>811</b> is temporarily written into the SRAMs <b>812</b> and <b>813</b>, and stored. A video signal corresponding to all pixels is read out one bit at a time from the video signals of all of the bits that are stored in the SRAM <b>812</b>, and then supplied to the signal line driving circuit <b>805</b> of the panel <b>800</b>. The control signal generator circuit <b>811</b> supplies information, which relates to light emission periods by the light-emitting elements for each bit, to the scanning line driving circuit <b>804</b> of the panel <b>800</b>. The electric power source circuit <b>802</b> supplies a predetermined electric power source voltage to the signal line driving circuit <b>805</b>, the scanning line driving circuit <b>804</b>, and the pixel portion <b>803</b> of the panel <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The structure of the electric power source circuit <b>802</b> is explained next using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. The electric power source circuit <b>802</b> includes a switching regulator <b>854</b> that uses four switching regulator controls <b>860</b>, and a series regulator <b>855</b>. Switching regulators are generally small in size and lightweight compared to series regulators, and it is possible to have a repeated voltage rises and positive-negative inversions without a drop in a voltage. On the other hand, series regulators are only used in voltage step-down, but have a good precision output voltage, and almost no ripple and no noise, compared to switching regulators. Both types are combined and used as the electric power source circuit <b>802</b> of this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The switching regulator <b>854</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> has switching regulator controls (SWR) <b>860</b>, attenuators (ATT) <b>861</b>, transformers (T) <b>862</b>, inductors (L) <b>863</b>, a reference voltage source (Vref) <b>864</b>, an oscillator circuit (OSC) <b>865</b>, diodes <b>866</b>, bipolar transistors <b>867</b>, a variable resistance <b>868</b>, and a capacitor <b>869</b>. If a voltage from an external Li ion battery (3.6 V) or the like is converted in the switching regulator <b>854</b>, an electric power source voltage imparted to a cathode, and an electric power source voltage supplied to the switching regulator <b>854</b> are generated.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">The series regulator <b>855</b> has a band gap circuit (BG) <b>870</b>, an amplifier <b>871</b>, op amps <b>1</b> to <b>6</b>, a current source <b>873</b>, variable resistances <b>874</b>, and bipolar transistors <b>875</b>. The electric power source voltages generated in the switching regulator <b>854</b> are supplied. DC electric power source voltages imparted to wirings (electric current supply lines) in order to supply a current to anodes of each color of the light-emitting elements are generated by the series regulator <b>855</b>, using the electric power source voltages generated in the switching regulator <b>854</b>, based on a fixed voltage generated in the band gap circuit <b>870</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Note that the current source <b>873</b> is used for cases of a driving method in which a video signal current is written into the pixels. In this case, the current generated in the current source <b>873</b> is supplied to the signal line driving circuit <b>805</b> of the panel <b>800</b>. Note that it is not always necessary to form the current source <b>873</b> for driving methods in which a video signal voltage is written into the pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Operation in the series regulator <b>855</b>, which is a structural element of the electric power source circuit <b>802</b>, is explained next in brief using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. A reference voltage is generated by the band gap circuit <b>870</b>, and the reference voltage is amplified by the amplifier <b>871</b>. A 10 V electric power source is made here. Further, the voltage generated by the band gap circuit <b>870</b> is also used in the current source <b>873</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Note that the band gap circuit <b>870</b> is controlled by an external on/off terminal. The external on/off terminal is disposed because there are times when the voltage supplied from the switching regulator <b>854</b> is not stable, mainly during electric power source start up and the like. If used as it is, it is difficult to obtain a desired signal from the band gap circuit <b>870</b>. A delay is provided by the on/off terminal, suppressing this phenomenon.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">The op amp <b>1</b> supplies a voltage of +5V supplied by dividing a voltage of +10V supplied from the amplifier <b>871</b> using an internal resistance, and functions as a buffer. The op amp <b>2</b> supplies a voltage of +8V supplied by converting the voltage of +10V supplied from the amplifier <b>871</b> using an internal resistance, and functions as a buffer. The op amp <b>3</b> supplies a voltage supplied by dividing the voltage of +10V from the amplifier <b>871</b> using an external variable resistance, and functions as a buffer. The op amps <b>4</b>-<b>6</b> supply a voltage supplied by dividing the voltage of +10V supplied from the amplifier <b>871</b> using an external variable resistance, and functions as a buffer. Note that the op amps <b>4</b> to <b>6</b> use transistors <b>875</b> in final output stages because a large amount of an output current is necessary. The current source <b>873</b> converts the reference voltage generated by the band gap circuit <b>870</b> to a current by using an external resistance, performs inversion by an internal current mirror, and outputs the inverted current. The current source <b>873</b> is necessary in order to make temperature changes small because there are times cases when the amount of a current supplied varies due to temperature changes. The series regulator <b>855</b> forms six DC voltage sources by using a +12 V voltage source that is structured by the switching regulator <b>854</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">The structure and operation in the switching regulator <b>854</b>, which is a structural element of the electric power source circuit <b>802</b>, is explained next in brief using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. The switching regulator controls (SWR) <b>860</b> are structured by differential amplifiers <b>1</b> to <b>4</b>, comparators <b>1</b> to <b>4</b>, and output circuits <b>1</b> to <b>4</b>. The ATTs <b>861</b> are structured from resistances <b>890</b> and <b>891</b>. The differential amplifiers <b>1</b> to <b>4</b> detect the output voltage of the switching regulator. The voltage gain is fixed for the differential amplifiers <b>1</b> to <b>4</b>, and phase compensation stabilized with respect to the system can be achieved. The controllers <b>1</b> to <b>4</b> are voltage comparators that possess one inverted input and two non-inverted inputs, and are voltage-pulse width converters that control output pulse on time corresponding to the input voltage. Structural elements of the switching regulator <b>854</b> other than those described above have already been discussed, and are therefore omitted here.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The transistor <b>867</b> is always operated in an on mode or an off mode in the switching regulator <b>854</b>. The DC output voltage can be stabilized by changing the ratio of time in this mode. Voltage losses in the transistor <b>867</b> are therefore small, and an electric power source having a good voltage conversion efficiency results. However, the on/off switching frequency is a high frequency, and therefore the transformer <b>862</b> can be made small. The switching regulator <b>854</b> here structures six DC electric power sources, in which a voltage of +3.6 V is input and then stepped up. The output voltages become +12 V, &#x2212;2 V, +8 V, &#x2212;12 V, +5 V, and &#x2212;3 V. Among these, +12 V and &#x2212;2 V are generated from the same circuit, and +5 V and &#x2212;3 V are generated from the same circuit.</p>

The present invention thus prevents electrostatic discharge damage by relieving sudden changes in the electric potential of the source electrode or the drain electrode of the transistor caused by the electric charge that builds up in the pixel electrode. Further, the present invention prevents electrostatic discharge damage during manufacturing processes, and in particular, electrostatic discharge damage in a state up through the manufacture of the pixel electrode.</p>
