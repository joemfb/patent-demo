<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to control of an auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit for operating an auxiliary tool attached to a work machine.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">There are work machines (e.g., construction, agricultural, forestry) which can operate the hydraulic actuator(s) of an auxiliary tool attached to the work machine. Auxiliary tools are commonly referred to as an auxiliary attachment, or just attachment. Examples of such an auxiliary tool include a multi-function bucket (&#x201c;clamshell bucket&#x201d;), rotary broom, auger, hammer, vibratory compactor, snow blower, grapple, shear felling head, and disk saw felling head, to name just a few.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As indicated, the auxiliary tool has its own hydraulic actuator(s) onboard the auxiliary tool. Such a hydraulic actuator may be, for example, a hydraulic cylinder that provides a linear output, as for a clamshell bucket, and/or a hydraulic motor that provides a rotary output, as for a broom or hammer.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to the present disclosure, there is provided a work machine comprising an auxiliary input device, an auxiliary mode selector for selecting between a proportional mode and a continuous mode to obtain a selected mode, an auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit adapted to operate a hydraulic actuator of an auxiliary tool when the auxiliary tool is attached to the work machine, and a controller unit.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The controller unit communicates with the auxiliary input device, the auxiliary mode selector, and the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit. The controller unit is adapted to electrically operate the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit in the selected mode in response to operation of the auxiliary input device such that, in the proportional mode, the magnitude of flow outputted from the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit to the auxiliary tool is proportional to the displacement of the auxiliary input device, and, in the continuous mode, the magnitude of flow outputted from the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit to the auxiliary tool is substantially constant whenever flow is outputted from the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit to the auxiliary tool in the continuous mode. Thus, in the proportional mode, the auxiliary tool can be operated by the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit in a manner proportional to the displacement of the auxiliary input device, whereas, in the continuous mode, the auxiliary tool can be operated by the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit in a continuous manner at a substantially constant speed. Further, in both the proportional mode and the continuous mode, the direction of flow in the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit exemplarily corresponds to the direction of displacement of the auxiliary input device.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As such, an operator of the work machine can select whether to operate the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit in the proportional mode or the continuous mode, depending on the type of auxiliary tool to be operated by the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit. For example, if the auxiliary tool is a clamshell bucket, the proportional mode can be selected for opening and dosing the jaws of the bucket to a desired extent, whereas, if the auxiliary tool is a broom, the continuous mode can be selected for continuous operation of the broom at a substantially constant speed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The above and other features will become apparent from the following description and the attached drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a work machine <b>10</b> to which an auxiliary tool <b>12</b> may be attached in place of a main tool <b>14</b>. Unlike the main tool <b>14</b>, the auxiliary tool <b>12</b> has its own hydraulic actuator(s) <b>16</b> onboard the auxiliary tool <b>12</b>. Although the work machine is exemplarily illustrated as a backhoe loader with a loader portion <b>18</b>, which may have a loader bucket as a main tool <b>14</b>, and a backhoe portion <b>20</b>, which may have an excavator bucket as a main tool <b>14</b>, the work machine <b>10</b> may be any type of work machine, such as, for example, a construction, agricultural, or forestry machine, to name just a few. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in the exemplary case of a backhoe loader, the loader portion <b>18</b> and/or the backhoe portion <b>20</b> may be equipped with an auxiliary tool <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref>, the auxiliary tool <b>12</b> may be any of a wide variety of auxiliary tools (e.g., clamshell bucket, thumb for a bucket, rotary broom, auger, hammer, vibratory compactor, rotary wrist, snow blower, grapple, shear felling head, disk saw felling head, to name just a few). Illustratively, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the auxiliary tool <b>12</b> is, for example, a clamshell bucket which is attached to the loader portion <b>18</b> and has a pair of onboard hydraulic cylinders as its hydraulic actuators <b>16</b> for moving a movable jaw relative to a fixed jaw. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the auxiliary tool <b>12</b> is, for example, a rotary broom which is attached to the loader portion <b>18</b> and has an onboard hydraulic motor as its hydraulic actuator for rotating the broom. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the auxiliary tool <b>12</b> is, for example, a hammer which is attached to the backhoe portion <b>20</b> and also has an onboard hydraulic motor as its hydraulic actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, various components of the work machine <b>10</b> for operating the auxiliary tool <b>12</b> are shown. An auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit <b>22</b> provides flow of hydraulic fluid to the hydraulic actuator(s) <b>16</b> of the tool <b>12</b> for operation of the tool <b>12</b> when the tool <b>12</b> is attached to the machine <b>10</b> (it is to be understood that the actuator <b>16</b> is shown as a hydraulic cylinder for illustrative purposes only, and not by way of limitation). In the backhoe loader example, there may be a circuit <b>22</b> for the loader portion <b>18</b> and another circuit <b>22</b> for the backhoe portion <b>22</b>, each for operating a respective auxiliary tool <b>12</b>. The auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit <b>22</b> (e.g., one or both circuits <b>22</b> of a backhoe loader) may be under the control of a controller unit <b>24</b> which receives inputs from an auxiliary mode selector <b>26</b>, an auxiliary input device <b>28</b>, and, in some embodiments, an operator interface <b>30</b>, as discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The controller unit <b>24</b> may be a single controller or a plurality of controllers networked for communication. Exemplarily, the controller unit <b>24</b> has a first controller <b>32</b> and a second controller <b>34</b>. The first controller <b>32</b> may be, for example, a right joystick controller (&#x201c;JSR&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) since the auxiliary input device <b>28</b> is exemplarily mounted on top of a right joystick <b>36</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>). The second controller <b>34</b> may be, for example, referred to as a Flex Hydraulic Controller (&#x201c;FHC&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) since it outputs control signals to the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit <b>22</b> and possibly other electro-hydraulic circuits onboard the machine <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">It is to be understood that the first and second controllers <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> may be any of the controllers onboard the machine <b>10</b>. Moreover, as already indicated, a single controller may be used in place of the two controllers <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. Hence, the term &#x201c;controller unit&#x201d; is used herein to mean one or more controllers. Further, the term &#x201c;unit&#x201d; is used herein to mean one or more of the subject component.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Along these lines, the controller unit <b>24</b> has a processor unit, comprising one or more processors, and a memory unit, comprising one or more memory devices, electrically coupled to the processor unit and having stored therein instructions which, when executed by the processor unit, causes the processor unit to perform the various functions of the controller unit <b>24</b>. Similarly, in the case where the controller unit <b>24</b> has multiple controllers, at the controller level, each controller has its own processor <b>36</b><i>a </i>and its own memory device <b>38</b> electrically coupled to the processor <b>36</b><i>a </i>and having stored therein instructions which, when executed by the processor <b>36</b><i>a</i>, causes the processor to perform the various functions of the controller.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the auxiliary mode selector <b>26</b>, the auxiliary input device <b>28</b>, and the operator interface <b>30</b> (when included) may be located at an operators station <b>40</b> for access thereto by an operator at the operators station <b>40</b>. Illustratively, the auxiliary mode selector <b>26</b> is exemplarily included in a sealed switch module <b>41</b> mounted on a stationary panel at the operator's station <b>40</b>. When included, the operator interface <b>30</b> may be mounted on the stationary panel as well, such as, for example, below the sealed switch module <b>41</b>. Further illustratively, the joystick <b>36</b><i>a </i>is exemplarily mounted on a right armrest <b>44</b><i>a </i>on the operator's seat <b>46</b>, and, as shown best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the auxiliary input device <b>28</b> is exemplarily mounted on top of the right joystick <b>36</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the loader backhoe example, the operator input device <b>28</b> on the right joystick <b>36</b><i>a </i>is used to provide inputs for control of an auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit <b>22</b> for the loader portion <b>18</b>, and a similar operator input device (not shown) (e.g., thumb-actuated paddle) is mounted on top of a left joystick <b>36</b><i>b </i>mounted on a left armrest <b>44</b><i>b </i>of the operator's seat <b>46</b> to provide inputs for control of an auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit <b>22</b> for the backhoe portion <b>20</b>, the circuits <b>22</b> being configured as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, but dedicated to their respective portions <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the operator can operate the auxiliary mode selector <b>26</b> to select between a proportional mode and a continuous mode for operation of the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit <b>22</b> and, in turn, the auxiliary tool <b>12</b> in the selected mode. Which mode is selected depends on the type of auxiliary tool <b>12</b> to be operated. The auxiliary mode selector <b>26</b> is configured to toggle between the proportional mode and the continuous mode in response to successive actuation (e.g., pressing) of the auxiliary mode selector.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Illustratively, the auxiliary mode selector <b>26</b> includes auxiliary indicia <b>47</b> representing that the mode selector <b>26</b> is the component which can be operated to switch between the proportional mode and the continuous mode, proportional-mode indicia <b>48</b><i>a </i>representative of the proportional mode and continuous-mode indicia <b>48</b><i>b </i>representative of the continuous mode. The auxiliary mode selector <b>26</b> further includes two visual indicators <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b </i>which upon selection of the respective proportional and continuous modes. Each indicator <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b </i>is, for example, an individual light which illuminates and remains illuminated while the respective mode is the selected mode. An audible indicator (not shown) may also activate for a relatively short period of time (e.g., emit a brief audible tone) each time the mode is changed.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the auxiliary input device <b>28</b> (e.g., a thumb-actuated paddle) is the primary control for controlling operation of the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit <b>22</b> and thus the auxiliary tool <b>12</b> once the mode has been selected. As shown best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the device <b>28</b> is exemplarily rotatable about an axis <b>52</b> away from a neutral position <b>54</b><i>a </i>in forward and reverse directions toward maximum forward and maximum reverse positions <b>54</b><i>b</i>, <b>54</b><i>c </i>as indicated by double-headed arrow <b>56</b>. The purpose for such movement is discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, operation of the overall system is now discussed. A control scheme <b>210</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) may be implemented by the controller unit <b>24</b> to control operation of the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit <b>22</b> and, in turn, the auxiliary tool <b>12</b>. The control scheme <b>210</b> is programmed into the controller unit <b>24</b> to selectively operate the circuit <b>22</b> in the proportional mode and the continuous mode. In the loader backhoe example, in some embodiments, both circuits <b>22</b>, dedicated respectively to the loader portion <b>18</b> and the backhoe portion <b>20</b>, may be operated selectively in the proportional and continuous modes by the controller unit <b>24</b>, whereas, in other embodiments, only one of the circuits <b>22</b> (e.g., the circuit <b>22</b> for the loader portion <b>18</b>) may be operated selectively in the proportional and continuous modes by the controller unit <b>24</b> while the other of the circuits <b>22</b> (e.g., the circuit <b>22</b> for the backhoe portion <b>18</b>) may be operable in the proportional mode, but not the continuous mode, by the controller unit <b>24</b>. The following description discusses the example in which a circuit <b>22</b> is selectively operable in both the proportional and continuous modes, it being understood that such description may apply to a possible second (or more) circuit <b>22</b> onboard the machine <b>10</b> inasmuch as the controller unit <b>24</b> is configured also to operate that circuit <b>22</b> in one or both of the proportional and continuous modes.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The controller unit <b>24</b> communicates with the auxiliary input device <b>28</b>, the auxiliary mode selector <b>26</b>, the operator interface <b>30</b> (when included), and the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit <b>22</b>. In act <b>212</b>, the FHC <b>34</b> monitors output of the mode selector <b>26</b> and receives therefrom a selected-mode signal representative of the selected mode, i.e., the proportional mode or the continuous mode.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The JSR <b>32</b> also monitors output of the auxiliary input device <b>28</b> and receives therefrom at least one control signal (i.e., one or more control signals). The at least one control signal is representative of the displacement of the auxiliary input device <b>28</b>, such as, for example, displacement in either the forward or reverse directions relative to the neutral position. The at least one control signal may also be representative of the direction of displacement of the auxiliary input device <b>28</b> (e.g., forward or reverse direction relative to the neutral position). The at least one control signal may be a single signal representative of both the displacement and the direction of displacement in the form of a signed displacement (e.g., +/&#x2212; displacement from neutral position) or two separate signals respectively representing the displacement and the direction. In any event, in the case in which the controller unit <b>24</b> has the JSR <b>32</b> and the FHC <b>34</b>, the at least one control signal may be sent from the JSR <b>32</b> to the FHC <b>34</b> via a CAN bus.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In act <b>214</b>, the FHC <b>34</b> determines which of the proportional mode or the continuous mode is selected based on the selected-mode signal. The controller unit <b>24</b> then proceeds to electrically operate the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit <b>22</b> in the selected mode in response to operation of the auxiliary input device <b>28</b> (e.g., in response to the at least one control signal) such that, in the proportional mode, the magnitude of flow outputted from the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit <b>22</b> to the auxiliary tool <b>12</b> is proportional to the displacement of the auxiliary input device <b>28</b>, and, in the continuous mode, the magnitude of flow outputted from the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit <b>22</b> to the auxiliary tool <b>12</b> is substantially constant whenever flow is outputted from the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit <b>22</b> to the auxiliary tool <b>12</b> in the continuous mode.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The term &#x201c;continuous&#x201d; as used herein refers to the substantially constant nature of the flow magnitude whenever flow is outputted from the circuit <b>22</b> (or circuit <b>322</b> discussed below) to an auxiliary tool <b>12</b>. It does not mean that the flow is perpetual, as indeed the operator may turn the flow ON and OFF during the continuous mode or other form of continuous operation (e.g., the continuous operation of circuit <b>322</b> below).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further, the term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; is intended merely to account for variations in the flow magnitude that may occur in the continuous mode due to inherent system limitations (the term &#x201c;system&#x201d; referring here to the machine <b>10</b> plus the tool <b>12</b> and any other tools attached to the machine <b>10</b>) such as, for example, system reactions to transients (e.g., load changes), manufacturing tolerances, ramp-up time to the constant magnitude at the beginning of a request for flow, ramp-down time from the constant magnitude at the end of the request for flow, and the like. The term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; is not intended to account for changes in the position of the auxiliary input device <b>28</b> in the continuous mode, except the changes which may be necessary to actually start and end flow during the continuous mode. The magnitude of flow in the continuous mode is otherwise independent of the position of the auxiliary input device <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Thus, in the proportional mode, the auxiliary tool <b>12</b> can be operated by the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit <b>22</b> in a manner proportional to the displacement of the auxiliary input device <b>28</b>, whereas, in the continuous mode, the auxiliary tool <b>12</b> can be operated by the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit <b>22</b> in a continuous manner at a substantially constant speed. Further, in both the proportional mode and the continuous mode, the direction of flow in the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit exemplarily corresponds to the direction of displacement of the auxiliary input device <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">If the FHC <b>34</b> determines that the proportional mode is the selected mode, the control scheme <b>210</b> advances to act <b>216</b>. If, on the other hand, it determines that the continuous mode is the selected mode, the control scheme <b>210</b> advances to either act <b>218</b> or <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In act <b>216</b>, the FHC <b>34</b> electrically operates the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit <b>22</b> in the proportional mode. It does so by commanding operation of an electro-hydraulic pilot section <b>70</b> for piloting a proportional, auxiliary control valve <b>72</b>. The pilot section <b>70</b> of the circuit <b>22</b> is configured as a closed-loop force-feedback section. The auxiliary control valve <b>72</b> of the circuit <b>22</b> is configured for directing flow, pressurized by a variable displacement pump <b>74</b> and supplied by a tank <b>76</b>, between ports <b>78</b><i>a </i>and <b>78</b><i>b </i>of the circuit <b>22</b> fluidly coupled to the hydraulic actuator(s) <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The pilot section <b>70</b> of the circuit <b>22</b> has electro-hydraulic valves <b>80</b><i>a</i>, <b>80</b><i>b </i>(e.g., solenoid valves) and a pilot spool <b>82</b> mechanically connected to a valve spool <b>84</b> of the control valve <b>72</b>. The valve <b>80</b><i>a </i>is a proportional, magnitude valve, and the valve <b>80</b><i>b </i>is an on/off, directional valve. To command operation of the valves <b>80</b><i>a</i>, <b>80</b><i>b</i>, the FHC <b>34</b> outputs to the magnitude valve <b>80</b><i>a </i>a magnitude control signal representative of the displacement of the auxiliary input device <b>28</b>, and outputs to the directional valve <b>80</b><i>b </i>a direction control signal representative of the direction of displacement of the auxiliary input device <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Pilot pressure is provided to the pilot section <b>70</b> by a pilot pressure supply <b>88</b> via a pilot line <b>90</b>. The pilot pressure supply <b>88</b> has a pressure reducing relieving valve <b>92</b> and an accumulator <b>94</b> that stores pilot fluid provided thereto by the valve <b>92</b> at a predetermined pilot pressure (e.g., about 600 psi).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Before going further, it is noted that the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit <b>22</b> may be just one of a plurality of electro-hydraulic circuits onboard the machine <b>10</b>. As noted above, there may two circuits <b>22</b>. Further, there may be a number of other electro-hydraulic circuits onboard. The valves of such circuits may be serviced by common components, such as, for example, the pump <b>74</b>, the tank <b>76</b>, the pilot supply section <b>88</b>, the pilot line or rail <b>90</b>, a supply line or rail <b>96</b> for supplying pressurized fluid from the pump <b>74</b> to the circuits, a return line or rail <b>98</b> for returning hydraulic fluid to the tank <b>76</b>, and a load-sense line or rail <b>106</b> that communicates load-sensing information back to the pump <b>74</b>.

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Continuing on, when both valves <b>80</b><i>a</i>, <b>80</b><i>b </i>are de-energized, the valves <b>80</b><i>a</i>, <b>80</b><i>b </i>assume the normal positions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In these positions, pilot pressure from the pilot line <b>90</b> is blocked from communication to pilot ports <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b</i>.

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">To move the spool <b>84</b> toward its position <b>101</b><i>b</i>, the FHC <b>34</b> de-energizes the direction valve <b>80</b><i>b</i>, but outputs a magnitude control signal, proportional to the displacement of the auxiliary input device <b>28</b>. As a result, the directional valve <b>80</b><i>b </i>assumes its OFF position <b>108</b><i>a</i>, and the magnitude valve <b>80</b><i>a </i>moves proportionally away from its fully closed position <b>110</b><i>a </i>toward its fully opened position <b>110</b><i>b</i>.

Movement of the spool <b>84</b> away from its neutral position toward its position <b>101</b><i>b </i>directs flow of pressurized fluid from the supply line <b>96</b> to the port <b>78</b><i>a </i>and actuator(s) <b>16</b> and directs return flow from the port <b>78</b><i>b </i>and actuator(s) <b>16</b> to the return line <b>98</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">To move the spool <b>84</b> toward its position <b>101</b><i>c</i>, the FHC <b>34</b> energizes both valves <b>80</b><i>a</i>, <b>80</b><i>b</i>.

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In this way, pilot pressure from the pilot line <b>90</b> is communicated through the magnitude valve <b>80</b><i>a </i>and the pilot port <b>100</b><i>a </i>to the chamber <b>112</b><i>a</i>.

Instead, the ON position <b>108</b><i>b </i>establishes communication between the chamber <b>112</b><i>b </i>and the return line <b>98</b>, thereby reducing the pressure in the chamber <b>112</b>. As such, the pilot pressure in the chamber <b>112</b><i>a </i>moves the spool <b>82</b> proportionally downwardly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> so as to move the spool <b>84</b> proportionally toward its position <b>101</b><i>c</i>.

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Thus, in the proportional mode, the magnitude of the flow to the actuator(s) <b>16</b> is thus proportional to the displacement of the auxiliary input device <b>28</b>.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In act <b>218</b>, assuming the machine <b>10</b> is configured for the operator to select a flow setpoint representative of a desired constant magnitude of flow for the continuous mode, the operator inputs the flow setpoint into the FHC <b>34</b> via the operator interface <b>30</b>. The interface <b>30</b> may have, for example, a display <b>118</b> and one or more input devices <b>120</b> for the operator to enter the operator-selected flow setpoint. The input devices <b>120</b> may be, for example, buttons, a dial, a slide, a number keypad for entering a selection, and/or the like. Regardless of how the operator actually enters the selection, the operator-selected flow setpoint is stored in the memory unit of the controller unit <b>24</b>. It may be stored, for example, in the memory device <b>38</b> of the FHC <b>36</b><i>a</i>. The controller unit <b>24</b> then electrically operates the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit <b>22</b> in the continuous mode so as to output flow from the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit <b>22</b> to the auxiliary tool <b>12</b> at the constant magnitude represented by the flow setpoint. A control scheme <b>410</b> discussed below may be incorporated for an operator to select a flow setpoint.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In act <b>220</b>, the FHC <b>34</b> determines whether to commence flow at the constant magnitude stored in the memory unit. A wide variety of flow-commencement criteria may be used by the controller unit <b>24</b> to make the determination whether to commence flow at the constant magnitude. Exemplarily, the FHC <b>34</b> triggers commencement of flow at the constant magnitude in response to a predetermined displacement of the auxiliary input device <b>28</b> from the neutral position. This predetermined displacement occurs, for example, when the input device <b>28</b> has been displaced by an amount equal to at least 50% of its travel range away from the neutral position in the forward direction or the reverse direction, i.e., position <b>54</b><i>d </i>or <b>54</b><i>e</i>, respectively (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). A different percentage or other commencement criteria may be used instead to initiate commencement of flow at the constant magnitude, although this criteria is considered to be particularly useful to an operator since it relates to displacement of the auxiliary input device <b>28</b> in the direction desired.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">If the flow-commencement criteria has not been met, the control scheme <b>210</b> remains in act <b>220</b>, continuing to check if the flow-commencement criteria has been satisfied.

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In act <b>222</b>, the controller unit <b>24</b> electrically operates the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit <b>22</b> so as to cause the circuit <b>22</b> to output the constant magnitude of flow to the actuator(s) <b>16</b> of the tool <b>12</b> in the direction corresponding to the direction of displacement of the auxiliary input device <b>28</b>. As discussed above, this constant magnitude may have been selected by the operator. In other examples, the constant magnitude may have already been previously stored in the memory unit of the controller unit <b>24</b>, such as at the factory at the time of manufacture. Exemplarily, such a pre-set constant magnitude for the continuous mode may be 100% of the available flow.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the continuous mode, the FHC <b>34</b> outputs electrical control signals to the magnitude and directional valves <b>80</b><i>a</i>, <b>80</b><i>b </i>to cause the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit <b>22</b> to output the constant magnitude of flow in the desired direction. When the auxiliary input device <b>28</b> has been displaced in the forward direction by the first predetermined displacement (e.g., 50% of the travel range in the forward direction), the FHC <b>34</b> de-energizes the direction valve <b>80</b><i>b</i>, but outputs a magnitude control signal corresponding to the constant magnitude of flow stored in memory. As a result, the directional valve <b>80</b><i>b </i>assumes its OFF position <b>108</b><i>a</i>, and the magnitude valve <b>80</b><i>a </i>moves away from its fully closed position <b>110</b><i>a </i>toward its fully opened position <b>110</b><i>b </i>to the position corresponding to the constant magnitude. Pilot pressure is routed accordingly causing the pilot spool <b>82</b> to move upwardly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (due to the unequal areas on the ends of the spool <b>82</b>) so as to move the valve spool <b>84</b> toward position <b>101</b><i>b </i>to the position corresponding to the constant magnitude. When the spool <b>84</b> reaches this position, flow of pressurized fluid advances at the constant magnitude from the supply line <b>96</b> to the port <b>78</b><i>a </i>and actuator(s) <b>16</b> at the constant magnitude and return flow is routed from the port <b>78</b><i>b </i>and actuator(s) <b>16</b> to the return line <b>98</b>.

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">When the auxiliary input device <b>28</b> has been displaced in the reverse direction by the predetermined displacement (e.g., 50% of the travel range in the reverse direction), the FHC <b>34</b> energizes both valves <b>80</b><i>a</i>, <b>80</b><i>b</i>. In particular, it outputs to the magnitude valve <b>80</b><i>a </i>a magnitude control signal, and outputs to the directional valve <b>80</b><i>b </i>a direction control signal.

When the spool <b>84</b> reaches this position, flow of pressurized fluid advances at the constant magnitude from the supply line <b>96</b> to the port <b>78</b><i>b </i>and actuator(s) <b>16</b> at the constant magnitude and return flow is routed from the port <b>78</b><i>a </i>and actuator(s) <b>16</b> to the return line <b>98</b>.

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In an example, the operator-selected or pre-set constant magnitude (i.e., predetermined constant magnitude) may be 100% of the available flow. In such a case, the magnitude control signal causes the magnitude valve <b>80</b><i>a </i>to move to its fully opened position which, in turn, causes the pilot spool <b>82</b> to move the valve spool <b>84</b> to one of its extreme positions <b>101</b><i>b </i>or <b>101</b><i>c</i>, depending upon the direction of displacement of the auxiliary input device <b>28</b>. Moreover, the magnitude control signal causes the spool <b>84</b> to remain in that position, so as to produce the constant magnitude of flow, which, in this particular example, would be the maximum constant magnitude.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In act <b>224</b>, the FHC <b>34</b> determines whether to cease flow at the constant magnitude in accordance with predetermined flow-cessation criteria.

If it is not met, the control scheme <b>210</b> continues to operate the circuit <b>22</b> and thus the auxiliary tool <b>12</b> at the constant magnitude in act <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Exemplarily, the controller unit <b>24</b> will cease flow at the constant magnitude in response to a second predetermined displacement of the auxiliary input device <b>28</b> relative to the neutral position in a direction opposite to the direction of the first predetermined displacement.

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In an example, the constant magnitude of flow may be commanded in the forward direction by displacement of the auxiliary input device <b>28</b> at least 50% of the travel range in the forward direction to position <b>54</b><i>d </i>or beyond.

Similarly, the constant magnitude of flow may be commanded in the reverse direction by displacement of the auxiliary input device <b>28</b> at least 50% of the travel range in the reverse direction to position <b>54</b><i>e </i>or beyond, after which the constant magnitude of flow may be commanded to cease by displacement of the auxiliary input device <b>28</b> at least 50% of the travel range in the forward direction to position <b>54</b><i>d </i>or beyond. As such, the first and second predetermined displacements may be equal to one another in magnitude, but opposite in opposite direction.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In act <b>226</b>, after cessation of flow in the continuous mode, the FHC <b>34</b> determines whether to enable further operation of the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit <b>22</b> in accordance with flow-enabling criteria.

Exemplarily, the controller unit <b>24</b> enables further operation of the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit <b>22</b> upon return of the auxiliary input device <b>28</b> to the neutral position. Once the device <b>28</b> is returned to its neutral position, the operator can again activate the circuit <b>22</b> and thus the tool <b>12</b>. Otherwise, the circuit <b>22</b> and tool <b>12</b> remain deactivated.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The FHC <b>34</b> may be configured so as to store the selected mode in the memory unit (e.g., the memory device <b>38</b> of the FHC <b>34</b>) upon shut-down of the work machine <b>10</b>. As such, the selected mode is stored as the default mode for the next power-up of the work machine <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, there is shown another auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit <b>322</b>, which may be used on the work machine <b>10</b> to operate an auxiliary tool <b>12</b> in a continuous manner (i.e., at a substantially constant magnitude of flow) at a constant speed. Exemplarily, the circuit <b>322</b> has an electro-hydraulic valve <b>326</b> (a &#x201c;selective flow control valve&#x201d;) for outputting a substantially constant magnitude of flow in one direction to the tool <b>12</b> to achieve the constant speed. The operator may select a flow setpoint via the operator interface <b>30</b> to set the constant magnitude of flow to a desired constant magnitude of flow to obtain a desired constant speed.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The circuit <b>322</b> may be included onboard the machine <b>10</b> in addition to, or in place of, the circuit(s) <b>22</b>. Exemplarily, in the loader backhoe example, the circuit <b>322</b> is included onboard the machine <b>10</b> in addition to two circuits <b>22</b>. As alluded to above, one of the circuits <b>22</b> may be dedicated to the loader portion <b>18</b> and selectively operable in both proportional and continuous modes by the controller unit <b>24</b>, and the other circuit <b>22</b> may be dedicated to the backhoe portion <b>20</b> but operable by the controller unit <b>24</b> in only the proportional mode.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The circuit <b>322</b> may be added to the backhoe portion <b>20</b> to provide continuous operation of an auxiliary tool <b>12</b> (i.e., substantially constant magnitude of flow to the tool <b>12</b>). In particular, the circuit <b>22</b> for the backhoe portion <b>20</b> may be used to provide only proportional operation of auxiliary tools that lend themselves to proportional operation (such tools being well known to those of ordinary skill in the art), whereas the circuit <b>322</b> for the backhoe portion <b>20</b> may be used to provide only continuous operation of auxiliary tools that lends themselves to continuous operation (such tools being well known to those of ordinary skill in the art). Further, two auxiliary tools <b>12</b> may be attached to the backhoe portion <b>20</b>, one proportionally operable by the circuit <b>22</b> and the other continuously operable by the circuit <b>322</b>. For example, a hammer and a rotary wrist for rotating the hammer to reposition the hammer may be attached to the backhoe portion <b>20</b>. In such a case, the hammer would be operable by the circuit <b>322</b> for continuous operation thereby, and the rotary wrist would be operable by the circuit <b>22</b> for proportional operation thereby.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The controller unit <b>24</b> communicates with the operator interface <b>30</b> and the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit <b>322</b>. Generally, the controller unit <b>24</b> receives from the operator interface <b>30</b> an electrical setpoint signal representative of a flow setpoint selected by an operator via the operator interface <b>30</b>, and electrically operates the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit <b>322</b> so as to output flow from the auxiliary electro-hydraulic circuit <b>322</b> to the auxiliary tool <b>12</b> at a substantially constant magnitude represented by the flow setpoint.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The controller unit <b>24</b> further communicates with another auxiliary input device <b>328</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The auxiliary input device <b>328</b> is provided for activating and deactivating the tool <b>12</b> under the control of the circuit <b>322</b> in an ON/OFF manner. The device <b>328</b> may be, for example, a 3-position rocker switch having a central maintain-OFF position for deactivating the tool <b>12</b> in an ongoing manner, a momentary-ON position to one side of the central maintain-OFF position for momentarily activating the tool <b>12</b>, and a maintain-ON position to the other side of the central maintain-OFF position for activating the tool <b>12</b> in an ongoing manner. Exemplarily, a third or left joystick controller <b>332</b> (&#x201c;JSL&#x201d;) of the controller unit <b>24</b> monitors the output of the device <b>328</b> for a request for activation or deactivation of the circuit <b>322</b> and thus the tool <b>12</b>.

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Exemplarily, the FHC <b>34</b> receives the operator-selected flow setpoint in the form of an electrical setpoint signal, and sends a corresponding flow setpoint signal (e.g., representing a percentage of maximum possible flow setpoint) to a fourth or selective flow controller <b>334</b> of the controller unit <b>24</b> over a communication link (e.g., a second CAN bus) to command the controller <b>334</b> to electrically operate a solenoid of the valve <b>326</b> to obtain the flow setpoint. Pressure sensors <b>327</b>, <b>329</b> sense the pressure in supply and tool work port lines <b>96</b>, <b>99</b>, respectively. The controller <b>334</b> monitors output of these sensors <b>327</b>, <b>329</b>, determines the pressure difference therebetween, and modulates the valve <b>326</b> in response to the pressure difference so as to obtain the flow setpoint commanded by the FHC <b>34</b> via the flow setpoint signal therefrom, thereby accounting for pressure variations in the overall hydraulic system. To reiterate, it is to be understood that the controller unit <b>24</b> may be a single controller, or any number of controllers, that performs all the functions of the controllers mentioned herein (i.e., JSR <b>32</b>, FHC <b>34</b>, JSL <b>332</b>, selective flow controller <b>334</b>) as well as possibly other controllers.</p>
