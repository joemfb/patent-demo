<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority from Japanese application JP2011-079271 filed on Mar. 31, 2011, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference into this application.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an electronic panel such as a display panel or a touch panel.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an electronic panel, such as a liquid crystal display panel or a touch panel, a transparent electrode which is formed of an Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) film is used for a region through which light passes, the drain electrode, the source electrode and the gate electrode of a thin-film transistor are formed of a metal, and metal wirings are connected to the electrodes. The metal wiring includes terminals for connection with the outside, and the terminals are covered with the ITO film in order to prevent corrosion. In detail, plated through holes are formed in an insulation film which covers the terminals of the metal wiring, and the ITO film is formed to close up the plated through holes (JP2005-236123A). Therefore, the terminals of the metal wiring are designed to electrically connect to a connection unit, such as the bump of another electrical component, via the ITO film.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to electrically connect the ITO film to the metal wiring, the size of the plated through hole of the insulation film should be ensured. When the size of the plated through hole is increased, it is necessary to increase the size of the metal wiring and the ITO film which covers the metal wiring. Further, a predetermined degree of length should be ensured for the interval between the connection unit, such as the bump, which is arranged on a single terminal and the ITO film which is formed on a neighboring terminal in order to prevent a short circuit. Therefore, it is difficult to have correspondence to the narrow pitch of the connection unit in a conventional structure.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An object of the present invention is to provide an electronic panel which can correspond to a narrow pitch.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">(1) An electronic panel according to an aspect of the invention includes a substrate, a plurality of metal wirings that are parallel on the substrate; insulation films that cover the plurality of metal wirings and that include plated through holes which expose parts of the respective metal wirings; oxide semiconductor films that are formed on the insulation films and are electrically connected to the respective metal wirings via the plated through holes; and an electrical component that includes electrodes which are electrically connected to the oxide semiconductor films. The oxide semiconductor film may be extended in the direction which is perpendicular to the arrangement direction of the plurality of metal wirings, and may include a first portion and a second portion in which the widths thereof are perpendicular to a lengthwise direction and are different from each other. The width of the first portion may be wider than the width of the second portion. A portion, in which at least both ends of the width of the first portion are removed, may face a part of the metal wiring which is exposed from the plated through hole, and the portion may be electrically connected to the part of the metal wiring. At least a part of the second portion may face the electrode of the electrical component and may be electrically connected to the electrode. According to the aspect of the invention, the oxide semiconductor film can correspond to the plurality of electrodes which are arranged with a narrow pitch because the width of the second portion which is electrically connected to the electrode of the electrical component is narrower than the width of the first portion which is electrically connected to the metal wiring via the plated through hole.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">(2) In the electronic panel according to (1), the electrode may have a width in the direction which is parallel to that of the width of the second portion, and the width of a portion of the second portion which faces the electrode may be narrower than the width of the electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">(3) In the electronic panel according to (2), the portion of the second portion which faces the electrode may be a region over both ends of the width.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">(4) In the electronic panel according to (3), the portion of the second portion which faces the electrode may be overlapped with the electrically connected metal wiring, and the width of each of the metal wirings may be wider than the width of the second portion in a position which is overlapped with the portion of the second portion which faces the electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">(5) In the electronic panel according to (4), the width of each of the metal wirings may be wider than the width of the electrode in the position which is overlapped with the portion of the second portion which faces the electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">(6) In the electronic panel according to (4), the width of each of the metal wirings may be narrower than the width of the electrode in the position which is overlapped with the portion of the second portion which faces the electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">(7) In the electronic panel according to (6), each of the plurality of metal wirings may have the same relative position as the second portion which is arranged to be overlapped therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">(8) In the electronic panel according to (7), the electrical component may include the plurality of electrodes in the same planar shape, and each of the plurality of metal wirings that is arranged to have the same relative position as the second portion may have the same planar shape.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">(9) In the electronic panel according to any one of (1) to (8), the plated through holes which expose parts of neighboring metal wirings may be arranged at positions which deviate in the longitudinal direction of the plurality of metal wirings such that the plated through holes are not adjacent to each other in the arrangement direction of the plurality of metal wirings.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">(10) In the electronic panel according to any one of (1) to (9), the electrode may be a bump.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">(11) The electronic panel according to any one of (1) to (10) may further include an anisotropic conductive material that is interposed between the electrical component and the substrate, and the conductive particles of the anisotropic conductive material may be interposed between the second portion of the oxide semiconductor film and the electrode.</p>

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The oxide semiconductor film <b>24</b> is extended in the direction (in the vertical direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) which is perpendicular to the arrangement direction of the plurality of metal wirings <b>18</b> (in the horizontal direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The oxide semiconductor film <b>24</b> includes a first portion <b>26</b> and a second portion <b>28</b> in which widths, which are perpendicular to a lengthwise direction, are different from each other.

The first portion <b>26</b> comes into contact with the metal wiring <b>18</b> via the plated through hole <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The electrode <b>16</b> (for example, the bump) of the electronic panel has a width W<sub>E </sub>in the direction which is parallel to that of the width W<sub>2 </sub>of the second portion <b>28</b>.

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to the embodiment, the oxide semiconductor film <b>24</b> can correspond to the plurality of electrodes <b>16</b> which are arranged with a narrow pitch because the width W<sub>2 </sub>of the second portion <b>28</b> which is electrically connected to the electrode <b>16</b> of the electrical component <b>14</b> is narrower than the width W<sub>1 </sub>of the first portion <b>26</b> which is electrically connected to the metal wiring <b>18</b> via the plated through hole <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Meanwhile, although the above description corresponds to an example in which the present invention is applied to the side of output (the side of output to an image display region) from the electrical component <b>14</b>, the present invention may be applied to the side of input (the side of input from the outside) to the electrical component <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a view illustrating a first modification of the embodiment.

<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a view illustrating a second modification of the embodiment. In this example, a plurality of plated through holes <b>222</b> are arranged in a zigzag.

According to this, first portions <b>226</b> of neighboring oxide semiconductor films <b>224</b> are arranged at positions which deviate in the longitudinal direction of the plurality of metal wirings <b>218</b> (the vertical direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) such that the first portions <b>226</b> are not adjacent to each other in the arrangement direction (the horizontal direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) of the plurality of metal wirings <b>218</b>. Therefore, even when the interval between the neighboring oxide semiconductor films <b>224</b> is narrow, the short circuit of the neighboring first portions <b>226</b> can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a view illustrating a third modification of the embodiment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a portion of a second portion <b>328</b> of an oxide semiconductor film <b>324</b>, which faces the electrode <b>16</b>, is shown. In this position, a width W<sub>M3 </sub>of a metal wiring <b>318</b> is narrower than a width W<sub>E3 </sub>of the electrode <b>16</b>. When the width W<sub>M3 </sub>of the metal wiring <b>318</b> is narrowed, the pitch of the neighboring metal wirings <b>318</b> can be narrowed.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Each of a plurality of metal wirings <b>318</b> has the same relative position as the second portion <b>328</b> which is arranged to overlap with the metal wiring. For example, the second portion <b>328</b> is formed to pass through the upside of the central portion of the metal wiring <b>318</b>. Further, each of the plurality of metal wirings <b>318</b>, which is arranged to have the same relative position as the second portion <b>328</b>, has the same planar shape.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In this way, a convex portion, which is formed on the surface of an insulation film <b>320</b> to correspond to the metal wiring <b>318</b>, and a convex shape, which is constructed by the external shape of the second portion <b>328</b>, is uniformized with respect to each of the metal wirings <b>318</b>. Therefore, the shapes of target surfaces on which the plurality of electrodes <b>16</b> are bonded are uniformized with respect to the respective electrodes <b>16</b>. That is, pressures, applied to the plurality of electrodes <b>16</b> which are electrically connected to the plurality of second portion <b>328</b>, respectively, are uniformized. Meanwhile, it is assumed that the plurality of electrodes <b>16</b> of the electrical component <b>14</b> have the same planar shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment and various modifications are possible.
