<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which is a diagram of the sensing pixel structure <b>110</b> according to the prior art. The sensing pixel structure <b>110</b> comprises B sense pixels CSU<sub>1</sub>-CSU<sub>B</sub>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in the sensing pixel structure <b>110</b>, each sense pixel CSU<sub>1</sub>-CSU<sub>B </sub>has the same pixel area AREA<sub>OLD</sub>. In other words, sense pixels (e.g. sense pixel CSU<sub>X</sub>) located in the central region of the sensing pixel structure <b>110</b> and sense pixels (e.g. sense pixels CSU<sub>1</sub>, CSU<sub>B</sub>) located in the peripheral region of the sensing pixel structure <b>110</b> have the same pixel area AREA<sub>OLD</sub>. In other words, the same number of sense pixels correspond to the peripheral region of the optical lens <b>120</b> as to the central region of the optical lens <b>120</b>. Due to resolution of the central region of the optical lens <b>120</b> being better than that of the peripheral region of the optical lens <b>120</b>, and the number of sense pixels corresponding to the peripheral region of the optical lens <b>120</b> is the same as to the central region of the optical lens <b>120</b>. Thus, resolution of the sense image SIM generated by the sensing pixel structure <b>110</b> receiving light through the optical lens <b>120</b> is uneven (resolution of the central region is better than resolution of the peripheral region). For example, using the optical sensor <b>100</b> to sense a scene P shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the optical sensor <b>100</b> generates the sense image SIM shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> that the peripheral region and the central region have the same square patterns in the scene P, but because the central region of the optical sensor <b>100</b> has better resolution than the peripheral region, the square patterns in the peripheral region of the sense image SIM are distorted. Thus, when the user wants to perform further image processing on the sense image SIM, because the resolution of the sense image SIM is non-uniform, processing methods used on the peripheral region of the sense image SIM must be different from those used on the central region. This causes difficulty when the user performs image processing on the sense image SIM.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to an embodiment, a sensing pixel structure used in an optical sensor is for generating a sense image with uniform resolution and is placed corresponding to an optical lens. The sensing pixel structure comprises a plurality of first pixels and a plurality of second sense pixels. The plurality of first sense pixels is located in a central region of the optical sensor corresponding to a central region of the optical lens. Each first sense pixel of the plurality of first sense pixels has a first pixel area. The plurality of second sense pixels is located in a peripheral region of the optical sensor, relative to the central region of the optical sensor, and corresponding to a peripheral region of the optical lens. Each second sense pixel of the plurality of second sense pixels has a second pixel area. The first pixel area is greater than the second pixel area for the peripheral region of the optical lens to correspond to more sense pixels than the central region of the optical lens for the optical sensor to generate a sense image with uniform resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an embodiment, an optical sensor for generating a sense image with uniform resolution comprises an optical lens, and a sensing pixel structure. A central region of the sensing pixel structure is positioned corresponding to a central region of an optical lens. A peripheral region of the sensing pixel structure is positioned corresponding to a peripheral region of the optical lens. The sensing pixel structure is used for receiving light through the optical lens to generate a sense image with uniform resolution, and the sensing pixel structure comprises M sense pixels. When resolution of the central region of the optical lens is better than resolution of the peripheral region of the optical lens, in the M sense pixels, sense pixels located in the central region of the sensing pixel structure have larger pixel area than sense pixels located in the peripheral region of the sensing pixel structure, and the peripheral region of the optical lens corresponds to more sense pixels than the central region of the optical lens for the sense image to have uniform resolution.

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In light of the above issues, a sensing pixel structure and optical sensor are provided that are for generating a sense image with uniform resolution that aids the user in later image processing.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which is a diagram of a sensing pixel structure <b>510</b> according to an embodiment. The sensing pixel structure <b>510</b> is used in an optical sensor <b>500</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The sensing pixel structure <b>510</b> is placed corresponding to an optical lens <b>520</b>. More specifically, a central region of the sensing pixel structure <b>510</b> is positioned corresponding to a central region of the optical lens <b>520</b>, and a peripheral region of the sensing pixel structure <b>510</b> is positioned corresponding to a peripheral region of the optical lens <b>520</b>. The sensing pixel structure <b>510</b> is used for receiving light through the optical lens <b>520</b> to generate a sense image SIM. The sensing pixel structure <b>510</b> comprises a plurality of first sense pixels and a plurality of second sense pixels. The plurality of first sense pixels is located in the central region of the optical sensor <b>500</b>, e.g. sense pixels CSU<sub>X</sub>-CSU<sub>X+3 </sub>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and is positioned corresponding to the central region of the optical lens <b>520</b>, each first sense pixel having pixel area AREA<sub>C1</sub>. The plurality of second sense pixels is positioned in the peripheral region of the optical sensor <b>500</b> (sense pixels other than sense pixels CSU<sub>X</sub>-CSU<sub>X+3 </sub>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are all second sense pixels), and is positioned corresponding to the peripheral region of the optical lens <b>520</b>, each second sense pixel having pixel area AREA<sub>C2</sub>. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the pixel area AREA<sub>C1 </sub>of the first sense pixels is greater than the pixel area AREA<sub>C2 </sub>of the second sense pixels. Thus, the peripheral region of the optical lens <b>520</b> corresponds to more sense pixels than the central region of the optical lens <b>520</b>. In this embodiment, the optical lens <b>520</b> and the optical lens <b>120</b> have similar structure and principle of operation, where the central region has better resolution than the peripheral region. However, compared to the optical sensor <b>100</b>, in the present embodiment, the peripheral region of the optical lens <b>520</b> corresponds to more sense pixels than the central region of the optical lens <b>520</b>. In other words, in the present embodiment, resolution of the peripheral region and the central region of the sense image SIM can be adjusted by adjusting pixel area of the first sense pixels and pixel area of the second sense pixels to adjust the number of sense pixels that the peripheral region and the central region of the optical lens <b>520</b> correspond to.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, which is a diagram illustrating designing the pixel areas AREA<sub>C2</sub>, AREA<sub>C1 </sub>to cause the sense image to have uniform resolution. Generally speaking, image resolution can be described in terms of a relationship between contrast and spatial frequency. For example, when special frequency is fixed, as contrast increases, image resolution also increases. Thus, to say that the sense image SIM has uniform resolution means that the relationship between the contrast and spatial frequency in the central region of the sense image SIM is approximately the same as the relationship between the contrast and spatial frequency in the peripheral region of the sense image SIM. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, CV<sub>1 </sub>represents the relationship curve between the contrast and spatial frequency of images corresponding to the central region of the optical sensor <b>500</b> in the sense image SIM when the pixel area of sense pixels in the central region of the sensing pixel structure <b>510</b> is AREA<sub>C2</sub>, where according to known techniques, image contrast can be represented by a modulation transfer function (MTF), and the spatial frequency can be represented by number of unit length line-pairs, e.g. lp/mm in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> representing number of millimeter unit line-pairs. CV<sub>2 </sub>represents the relationship curve between the contrast and spatial frequency of images corresponding to the peripheral region of the optical sensor <b>500</b> in the sense image SIM when the pixel area of sense pixels in the peripheral region of the sensing pixel structure <b>510</b> is AREA<sub>C2</sub>. Due to the central region having better resolution than the peripheral region in the optical lens <b>520</b>, when the pixel area of sense pixels in the central region of the sensing pixel structure <b>510</b> and the pixel area of sense pixels in the peripheral region of the sensing pixel structure <b>510</b> are both AREA<sub>C2</sub>, in the sense image SIM, resolution of images corresponding to the central region of the optical sensor <b>500</b> is better than resolution of images corresponding to the peripheral region of the optical sensor <b>500</b> (CV<sub>1</sub>&#x3e;CV<sub>2</sub>). If the pixel area of sense pixels in the central region of the sensing pixel structure <b>510</b> is increased, number of sense pixels corresponding to the central region of the optical lens <b>520</b> can be reduced, such that resolution of images in the central region of the optical sensor <b>500</b> (CV<sub>1</sub>) can also be reduced. It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> that when the pixel area of sense pixels in the central region of the sensing pixel structure <b>510</b> is increased to AREA<sub>C1</sub>, resolution of images corresponding to the central region of the optical sensor <b>500</b> (relationship curve CV<sub>3</sub>) and resolution of images corresponding to the peripheral region of the optical sensor <b>500</b> (relationship curve CV<sub>1</sub>) are approximately the same. In other words, by designing the pixel area of sense pixels in the central region of the sensing pixel structure <b>510</b> to be AREA<sub>C1</sub>, and designing the pixel area of sense pixels in the peripheral region of the sensing pixel structure <b>510</b> to be AREA<sub>C2</sub>, the optical sensor <b>500</b> can generate the sense image SIM with uniform resolution. Using the optical sensor <b>500</b> to sense the scene P shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the optical sensor <b>500</b> will generate the sense image SIM shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Relative to the sense image SIM in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> generated by the optical sensor <b>100</b>, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, resolution in the central region and the peripheral region of the optical sensor <b>500</b> is approximately the same, so the square patterns in the peripheral region and the central region of the sense image SIM have approximately the same amount of distortion. In other words, when the user wants to perform further processing on the sense image SIM generated by the optical sensor <b>500</b>, the same processing methods can be used on both the central region and the peripheral region of the sense image SIM.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Further, compared to the sensing pixel structure <b>110</b>, in the sensing pixel structure <b>510</b>, the pixel area of sense pixels in the central region of the sensing pixel structure <b>510</b> is increased, while the pixel area of sense pixels in the peripheral region of the sensing pixel structure <b>510</b> is kept the same. In other words, compared to the sensing pixel structure <b>110</b>, the sensing pixel structure <b>510</b> has fewer sense pixels, i.e. M&#x3c;B. Thus, by using the sensing pixel structure <b>510</b>, area of downstream processing circuits of the optical sensor <b>500</b>, e.g. sense pixel readout circuits, can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, which is a diagram of a sensing pixel structure <b>910</b> according to another embodiment. The sensing pixel structure <b>910</b> may be used for realizing the sensing pixel structure <b>510</b> of the optical sensor <b>500</b>. The sensing pixel structure <b>910</b> comprises sense pixels CSU<sub>1</sub>-CSU<sub>M</sub>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, in the sense pixels CSU<sub>1</sub>-CSU<sub>M</sub>, sense pixels located in the central region of the sensing pixel structure <b>910</b>, e.g. sense pixel CSU<sub>X</sub>, have greater pixel area than sense pixels located in the peripheral region of the sensing pixel structure <b>910</b>, e.g. sense pixels CSU<sub>1</sub>, CSU<sub>Y</sub>, CSU<sub>M</sub>. Thus, the peripheral region of the optical lens <b>510</b> corresponds to relatively more sense pixels than the central region of the optical lens <b>510</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, which is a diagram of a sense image SIM generated by the sensing pixel structure <b>910</b>. The sense image SIM can be divided into regions R<sub>1</sub>-R<sub>N </sub>(in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, different regions are depicted by different hatching orientations). For example, region R<sub>1 </sub>is formed by images generated by sense pixels in the upper-left corner of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>; region R<sub>4 </sub>is formed of images generated by sense pixels in the lower-left corner of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In order to make the resolution the same in all regions R<sub>1</sub>-R<sub>N </sub>of the sense image SIM, the sensing pixel structure <b>910</b> can be designed so that sense pixels nearer to the central region of the sensing pixel structure <b>910</b> have larger pixel area, and sense pixels further from the central region of the sensing pixel structure <b>910</b> have smaller pixel area. More specifically, when designing sensing pixel structure <b>910</b>, pixel area AREA<sub>X </sub>of sense pixels of the central region of the sensing pixel structure <b>910</b> (e.g. sense pixel CSU<sub>X</sub>) and pixel area AREA<sub>Y </sub>of sense pixels of the peripheral region of the sensing pixel structure <b>910</b> (e.g. sense pixel CSU<sub>Y</sub>) can be determined according to the method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. At this time, pixel area AREA<sub>Z </sub>of sense pixels between the central region and the peripheral region of the sensing pixel structure <b>910</b> (e.g. sense pixel CSU<sub>Z</sub>) can be determined according to the pixel areas AREA<sub>X</sub>, AREA<sub>Y</sub>, distance D<sub>XY </sub>between the sense pixels CSU<sub>X</sub>, CSU<sub>Y</sub>, and distance D<sub>XZ </sub>between the sense pixels CSU<sub>X</sub>, CSU<sub>Z</sub>. More specifically, the pixel area AREA<sub>Z </sub>of sense pixels between the central region and the peripheral region of the sensing pixel structure <b>910</b> can be determined by the following equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>(AREA<sub>X</sub>&#x2212;AREA<sub>Z</sub>)/(<i>D</i><sub>XZ</sub><sup>2</sup>)=(AREA<sub>X</sub>&#x2212;AREA<sub>Y</sub>)/(<i>D</i><sub>XY</sub><sup>2</sup>)&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In this way, pixel area of all sense pixels located between the central region and the peripheral region of the sensing pixel structure <b>910</b> can be determined according to equation (1). Sense pixels closer to the central region of the sensing pixel structure <b>910</b> have larger pixel area, and sense pixels further from the central region of the sensing pixel structure <b>910</b> have smaller pixel area. Thus, in the optical lens <b>520</b>, areas with poorer resolution (e.g. areas near the peripheral region, such as those corresponding to regions R<sub>1</sub>-R<sub>4</sub>) correspond to a greater number of sense pixels, and areas with better resolution (e.g. areas near the central region, such as those corresponding to regions R<sub>L</sub>-R<sub>(L+1)</sub>) correspond to fewer sense pixels. In this way, relationship curves CV<sub>R1</sub>-CV<sub>RN </sub>between the contrast and spatial frequency of each region R<sub>1</sub>-R<sub>N </sub>of the sense image SIM can be approximately the same (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). In other words, the sense image SIM has uniform resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, which is a diagram of a sensing pixel structure <b>1210</b> according to another embodiment. The sensing pixel structure <b>1210</b> can be used to realize the sensing pixel structure <b>510</b> of the optical sensor <b>500</b>. Compared to the above embodiments, in the present embodiment, it is assumed that resolution in the peripheral region of the optical lens <b>520</b> is better than resolution in the central region of the optical lens <b>520</b>. The sensing pixel structure <b>1210</b> comprises sense pixels CSU<sub>1</sub>-CSU<sub>M</sub>. Different from the sensing pixel structure <b>910</b>, in the sensing pixel structure <b>1210</b>, sense pixels in the central region of the sensing pixel structure <b>1210</b> central region (e.g. sense pixel CSU<sub>X</sub>) have smaller pixel area than sense pixels in the peripheral region of the sensing pixel structure <b>1210</b> (e.g. sense pixels CSU<sub>1</sub>, CSU<sub>M</sub>). Thus, the central region of the optical lens <b>510</b> corresponds to a greater number of sense pixels relative to the peripheral region of the optical lens <b>510</b>. In the present embodiment, resolution of the peripheral region of the optical lens <b>520</b> is better than resolution of the central region of the optical lens <b>520</b>. However, by using the sensing pixel structure <b>1210</b>, the central region of the optical lens <b>520</b> corresponds to more sense pixels than the peripheral region of the optical lens <b>520</b>. Thus, the optical sensor <b>500</b> can still generate the sense image SIM with uniform resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the above embodiments, the sensing pixel structure adjusts pixel area of sense pixels in the central region and peripheral region of the sensing pixel structure to adjust number of sense pixels corresponded to by the central region and the peripheral region of the optical sensor, thereby causing the optical sensor to generate the sense image with uniform resolution. In this way, when the user desires to perform further processing on the sense image, the same processing method can be used for both the central region and the peripheral region of the sense image. Thus, using the sensing pixel structure and optical sensor provided by the above embodiments can reduce difficulty encountered by the user in performing processing on the sense image. Further, the sensing pixel structure of the above embodiments allows processing circuit area of the optical sensor to be reduced, which saves cost.</p>
