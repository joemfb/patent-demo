<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority under 35 U.S.C 119(a) to Korean Application No. 10-2010-0075740, filed on Aug. 5, 2010, in the Korean intellectual property Office, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate generally to a semiconductor technology, and more particularly, to a semiconductor package which is capable of selecting chips by using through-vias.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many attempts have been made to develop a package technology which can provide improved electric performance, store large amounts of data, rapidly process the stored data and provide a slim, compact and lightweight semiconductor device. A semiconductor package technology has been proposed which improves a storage capacity and a processing speed by stacking a plurality of semiconductor chips. Various techniques for electrically coupling the stacked semiconductor chips have been proposed. One of effective techniques is to mutually connect the stacked chips using through-vias, such as through-silicon vias (TSVs), which pass through the semiconductor chips.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a semiconductor package in which stacked semiconductor chips are electrically connected together using through-vias, the through-vias passing through the chips form electrical connection paths and thus the electrical connection paths are shortened. Due to the shortened electrical connection paths, the semiconductor package is advantageous in processing a large amount of data at a high speed. Nevertheless, since the stacked semiconductor chips are connected by the through-vias, it is difficult to select a specific chip among the stacked semiconductor chips during data processing. To select a specific chip, the stack structure of the semiconductor chips is modified to connect a signal wire and a specific chip, or the arrangement of the through-vias formed in the individual semiconductor chips is modified to form a signal path composed of through-vias connected to only a specific chip. However, in a case in which the stack structure of the chips is modified to connect a separate signal wire and a specific chip, it is structurally difficult to stack chips and configure a package. In a case in which a connection path of through-vias connected to a specific chip is separately provided, the arrangement of through-vias must be differently modified at each semiconductor chip.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An embodiment of the present invention provides a semiconductor package which is capable of selecting a specific chip using a through-via while stacking the same semiconductor chips.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to accompanying drawings. However, the embodiments are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Embodiments of the present invention provide a construction of a semiconductor package in which semiconductor chips equally manufactured are stacked and wherein a specific semiconductor chip may be selected using through-electrodes or through-vias passing through the semiconductor chips. Since the semiconductor chips are manufactured in the same configuration, the arrangement or shapes of the through-vias passing through the semiconductor chips are also identical. Also, the arrangement or shape of chip selection vias provided in the form of through-vias is also identical, and chip selection logic units integrated into the semiconductor chips in order for chip selection are also equally configured.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a case in which the semiconductor chips are stacked and electrically connected using through-vias, if layers on which the semiconductor chips are stacked are simply connected using the through-vias, all the stacked semiconductor chips are electrically connected together by a single through-via. Since chip selection signals outputted from the chip selection logic units are also equal, it is difficult to select a specific chip. In embodiments of the present invention, the interlayer connection of the chip selection vias between the layers of the stacked semiconductor chips are modified such that multi signals inputted to the chip selection vias of the lowermost layer are differently applied to the stacked semiconductor chips. For example, even though multi signals &#x201c;A, B, C, D&#x201d; are inputted to the chip selection vias of the lowermost semiconductor chip, different signals such as &#x201c;D, C, B, A&#x201d; may be inputted to the upper stacked semiconductor chips. At this time, &#x201c;A, B, C, D&#x201d; may be &#x201c;0&#x201d; meaning a low state or &#x201c;1&#x201d; meaning a high state. Accordingly, although the semiconductor package is configured by stacking the same semiconductor chips, a specific semiconductor chip may be selected using multi signals.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a semiconductor chip <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention has a front side with active regions in which memory banks such as DRAM devices are located. Elements such as transistors may be integrated within the active regions. A chip selection logic unit may also be integrated. In regions, except for the active regions, through-vias <b>200</b> may be formed as chip connection terminals. The through-vias <b>200</b> may be first to fourth chip selection vias <b>201</b>, <b>203</b>, <b>205</b> and <b>207</b>, or may be through-vias for address/power input and data read. The through-vias <b>200</b> may be provided with through silicon vias (TSV) passing from the front side to the rear side of the semiconductor chip <b>200</b>. The chip selection vias <b>200</b> (<b>201</b>, <b>203</b>, <b>205</b>, <b>207</b>) for the input of signals related to the chip selection may be sequentially arranged in one direction with respect to the front side of the semiconductor chip <b>200</b>. The number of the chip selection vias <b>200</b> may be determined depending on the number of semiconductor chips <b>100</b> to be stacked. For example, the chip selection vias <b>200</b> are provided as many as the semiconductor chips <b>100</b> to be stacked.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, semiconductor chips <b>100</b> (<b>101</b>, <b>103</b>, <b>105</b>, <b>107</b>) each having the arrangement of chip selection vias <b>200</b> (<b>201</b>, <b>203</b>, <b>205</b>, <b>207</b>) are stacked. The first semiconductor chip <b>101</b> is stacked on a printed circuit board (PCB) <b>300</b> with built-in lines and is electrically connected to solder balls <b>310</b> through the lines built in the PCB <b>300</b>. The solder balls <b>310</b> are external connection terminals attached to the bottom of the PCB <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The chip selection vias <b>200</b> may be mutually connected between the layers of the semiconductor chips <b>100</b> by a first connection unit <b>401</b> and a second connection unit <b>403</b>. In the embodiment of the present invention, the first connection unit <b>401</b> and the second connection unit <b>403</b> mutually connect the chip selection vias <b>200</b> in different manners. The first connection unit <b>401</b> is provided between the first semiconductor chip <b>101</b> and the second semiconductor chip <b>103</b> adjacently stacked, and connects the chip selection vias <b>200</b> of the first semiconductor chip <b>101</b> and the chip selection vias <b>200</b> of the second semiconductor chip <b>103</b> in inverse order of arrangement. For example, the first connection unit <b>401</b> is provided to connect the first chip selection via <b>201</b> of the first semiconductor chip <b>101</b> and the fourth chip selection via <b>207</b> of the second semiconductor chip <b>103</b>, connect the second chip selection via <b>203</b> of the first semiconductor chip <b>101</b> and the third chip selection via <b>205</b> of the second semiconductor chip <b>103</b>, connect the third chip selection via <b>205</b> of the first semiconductor chip <b>101</b> and the second chip selection via <b>203</b> of the second semiconductor chip <b>103</b>, and connect the fourth chip selection via <b>207</b> of the first semiconductor chip <b>101</b> and the first chip selection via <b>201</b> of the second semiconductor chip <b>103</b>. The third chip <b>105</b> is stacked on the second chip <b>103</b>, and the fourth chip <b>107</b> is stacked on the third chip <b>105</b>. The first connection unit <b>401</b> is provided between the third semiconductor chip <b>105</b> and the fourth semiconductor chip <b>107</b>, and connects the chip selection vias <b>200</b> of the third semiconductor chip <b>105</b> and the chip selection vias <b>200</b> of the fourth semiconductor chip <b>107</b> in inverse order of arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Multi signals inputted to the chip selection vias <b>200</b> of the first semiconductor chip <b>101</b> are transferred to other chip selection vias <b>200</b> by the first connection unit <b>401</b>. That is, when the multi signals inputted to the chip selection vias <b>200</b> of the first semiconductor chip <b>101</b> are &#x201c;1, 1, 0, 0&#x201d;, the inverted multi signals &#x201c;0, 0, 1, 1&#x201d; are inputted to the second semiconductor chip <b>103</b>. Since the first chip selection via <b>201</b> of the first semiconductor chip <b>101</b> is connected to the fourth chip selection via <b>207</b> of the second semiconductor chip <b>103</b>, the signal inputted to the first chip selection via <b>201</b> of the first semiconductor chip <b>101</b> is equally transferred to the fourth chip selection via <b>207</b> of the second semiconductor chip <b>103</b> by the first connection unit <b>401</b>. Likewise, the multi signals inputted to the third chip <b>105</b> are inversely transferred to the fourth semiconductor chip <b>107</b> by the first connection unit <b>401</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The second connection unit <b>403</b> is provided between the second semiconductor chip <b>103</b> and the third semiconductor chip <b>105</b> adjacently stacked. The second connection unit <b>403</b> connects some of the chip selection vias <b>200</b> of the second semiconductor chip <b>103</b> and the chip selection vias <b>200</b> of the third semiconductor chip <b>105</b>, and disconnects the others of the chip selection vias <b>200</b> of the second semiconductor chip <b>103</b> and the chip selection vias <b>200</b> of the third semiconductor chip <b>105</b>. In this embodiment, the interlayer connection of the chip selection vias <b>200</b> of the semiconductor chips <b>100</b> is achieved by the first connection unit <b>401</b> and the second connection unit <b>403</b>. The second connection unit <b>403</b> partially makes a connection and partially makes a disconnection, so that signals different from the multi signals inputted to the second chip <b>103</b> are inputted to the chip selection vias <b>200</b> of the third chip <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">When the multi signals inputted to the first to fourth chip selection vias <b>201</b>, <b>203</b>, <b>205</b> and <b>207</b> of the second semiconductor chip <b>103</b> are &#x201c;0, 0, 1, 1&#x201d;, the second connection unit <b>403</b> connects the first chip selection via <b>201</b> of the second semiconductor chip <b>103</b> and the first chip selection via <b>201</b> of the third semiconductor chip <b>105</b>, connects the third chip selection via <b>205</b> of the second semiconductor chip <b>103</b> and the third chip selection via <b>205</b> of the third semiconductor chip <b>105</b>, and disconnects the others. Therefore, the signals &#x201c;0, 0, 1, 0&#x201d; are inputted to the chip selection vias <b>200</b> of the third semiconductor chip <b>103</b> by the second connection unit <b>403</b>. Since the interlayer connection of the second chip selection via <b>203</b> and the fourth chip selection via <b>207</b> of the third semiconductor chip <b>105</b> is disconnected by the second connection unit <b>403</b>, the second chip selection via <b>203</b> and the fourth chip selection via <b>207</b> of the third semiconductor chip <b>105</b> may be in a state of &#x201c;0&#x201d;. Therefore, the different chip selection multi signals are inputted to the third semiconductor chip <b>105</b> and the second semiconductor chip <b>103</b>. Due to the first connection unit <b>401</b>, the third semiconductor chip <b>105</b> and the fourth semiconductor chip <b>107</b> have an inversion relationship. Consequently, the signals &#x201c;0, 1, 0, 0&#x201d; are inputted to the fourth semiconductor chip <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As such, the first connection unit <b>401</b> and the second connection unit <b>403</b> change the connection order of the chip selection vias <b>200</b> between the layers of the stacked semiconductor chips <b>100</b>, so that the different chip selection multi signals are inputted to the semiconductor chips <b>100</b>. Using this, a specific one of the semiconductor chips <b>100</b> may be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Even though the same chip selection multi signals are inputted to the semiconductor package through the solder ball <b>310</b>, different chip selection signals may be inputted to the respective stacked semiconductor chips <b>100</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, even though the semiconductor chips <b>100</b> are the same type of chips each including the chip selection logic unit <b>190</b>, different signals may be inputted to the chip selection logic units <b>190</b> of the respective chips <b>100</b>. That is, even though the first to fourth chip selection logic units <b>191</b>, <b>193</b>, <b>195</b> and <b>197</b> provided in each of the first to fourth semiconductor chips <b>100</b> are equally configured, different signal values are inputted to the respective chip section logic units <b>190</b>. Therefore, a specific chip can be selected by the chip selection vias <b>200</b>, even though the same semiconductor chips <b>100</b> are stacked.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The first and second connection units <b>401</b> and <b>403</b> may be provided in the form of a redistributed layer (RDL). When considering that the semiconductor chips <b>100</b> have the same configuration, depositing and patterning different types of redistributed layers on the semiconductor chips <b>100</b> may require unnecessary additional processes. Therefore, in this embodiment, the first connection unit <b>401</b> is configured using a flip chip stacking technology, and the second connection unit <b>403</b> is configured in a film or spacer form including an insulation layer through which the connection vias pass. Using the flip chip stacking technology, the first connection unit <b>401</b> directly connects the chip selection vias <b>200</b> by applying a technology for directly connecting the semiconductor chips <b>100</b>, for example, a connection technology using bumps or solder balls. The second connection unit <b>403</b> may be manufactured in a film or sheet form and provided between the chips <b>100</b>. Thus, slightly cumbersome processes such as deposition or patterning of redistribution layers may be omitted. Therefore, when implementing the connection structure of the second connection unit <b>403</b>, a wider degree of freedom may be ensured, thereby achieving cost reduction.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a semiconductor package according to an embodiment of the present invention includes semiconductor chips <b>100</b> (<b>101</b>, <b>103</b>, <b>105</b>, <b>107</b>) each having the arrangement of chip selection vias <b>200</b> (<b>201</b>, <b>203</b>, <b>205</b>, <b>207</b>). The semiconductor chips <b>100</b> are stacked on a PCB <b>300</b> with built-in lines and are electrically connected to solder balls <b>310</b> through the lines built in the PCB <b>300</b>. The solder balls <b>310</b> are external connection terminals attached to the bottom of the PCB <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The first semiconductor chip <b>101</b> and the second semiconductor chip <b>103</b> are stacked in a flip chip type such that the front sides thereof face each other. Therefore, the chip selection vias <b>201</b>, <b>203</b>, <b>205</b> and <b>207</b> of the first semiconductor chip <b>101</b> and the chip selection vias <b>201</b>, <b>203</b>, <b>205</b> and <b>207</b> of the second semiconductor chip <b>103</b> are connected in inverse order of arrangement. Due to such a flip chip stacking, the inverse connection of the chip selection vias <b>200</b> can be achieved as proposed in the first connection unit (<b>401</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>). Likewise, the third semiconductor chip <b>105</b> and the fourth semiconductor chip <b>107</b> are stacked in a flip chip type such that the rear sides thereof face each other. Therefore, the chip selection vias <b>200</b> of the third semiconductor chip <b>105</b> and the chip selection vias <b>200</b> of the fourth semiconductor chip <b>107</b> are connected in inverse order of arrangement, as proposed in the first connection unit <b>401</b>. Meanwhile, the third semiconductor chip <b>105</b> may be stacked on the second semiconductor chip <b>103</b> in a flip chip type such that the front side of the third semiconductor chip <b>105</b> faces the rear side of the second semiconductor chip <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A connection unit <b>430</b> is provided between the second semiconductor chip <b>103</b> and the third semiconductor chip <b>105</b>, and alternately connects and disconnects the chip selection vias <b>200</b> of the second and third semiconductor chips <b>103</b> and <b>105</b>. The connection unit <b>430</b> may include an insulation layer <b>431</b> insulating the second semiconductor chip <b>103</b> and the third semiconductor chip <b>105</b>. The connection unit <b>430</b> may be provided in a sheet or film form including connection vias <b>437</b> passing through the insulation layer <b>431</b> and corresponding to the chip selection vias <b>200</b> to be connected. The connection unit <b>430</b> implements the connection relationship of the second connection unit <b>403</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. In order to alternately connect and disconnect the chip selection vias <b>200</b>, the connection vias <b>437</b> include a first connection via <b>433</b> disposed at a position which mutually connects the fourth chip selection vias <b>207</b> of the second and third semiconductor chips <b>103</b> and <b>105</b>, and a second connection via <b>435</b> disposed at a position which mutually connects the second chip selection vias <b>203</b> of the second and third semiconductor chips <b>103</b> and <b>105</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">From the result of Table 1 above, considering the selection signals (select 1, 2, 3, 4) applied to the first, second, third and fourth chip selection vias <b>201</b>, <b>203</b>, <b>205</b> and <b>207</b>, when the multi signals &#x201c;0, 1, 1, 1&#x201d; are inputted, the selection signals applied to the first, second, third and fourth chip selection vias <b>201</b>, <b>203</b>, <b>205</b> and <b>207</b> of the first semiconductor chip <b>101</b> of the first layer are &#x201c;0, 1, 1, 1&#x201d;, but different selection signals are applied to the second, third and fourth semiconductor chips <b>103</b>, <b>105</b> and <b>107</b> of the second, third and fourth layers. Since the first and third chip selection vias <b>201</b> and <b>205</b> of the third semiconductor chip <b>105</b> of the third layer are disconnected by the insulation layer <b>431</b> of the connection unit <b>430</b>, a value of &#x201c;0&#x201d; is given thereto. Accordingly the second and fourth chip selection vias <b>203</b> and <b>207</b> of the fourth semiconductor chip <b>107</b> of the fourth layer are disconnected, a value of &#x201c;0&#x201d; is given thereto. Since different signal values are applied to the semiconductor chips <b>100</b> of each layer, the first semiconductor chip <b>101</b> of the first layer can be selected. Likewise, when different multi signal values of &#x201c;0, 0, 1, 1&#x201d;, &#x201c;1, 0, 1, 1&#x201d;, and &#x201c;1, 0, 0, 1&#x201d; are given in order to select the semiconductor chips <b>100</b> of the second, third and fourth layers, different signal values are applied to the semiconductor chips <b>100</b> of each layer.

In such a three-layer semiconductor package structure, chip selection using multi signals can be achieved through chip selection vias <b>200</b>. In this case, at least four chip selection vias <b>200</b> may be provided for applying the multi signals.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, although a first semiconductor chip <b>131</b> and a second semiconductor chip <b>133</b> are stacked in a flip chip type such that the front sides thereof face each other, a first connection unit <b>450</b> may be provided in a sheet or film form such that chip selection vias <b>201</b>, <b>203</b>, <b>205</b> and <b>207</b> of the first semiconductor chip <b>131</b> and chip selection vias <b>201</b>, <b>203</b>, <b>205</b> and <b>207</b> of the second semiconductor chip <b>133</b> are mutually connected in inverse order of arrangement. In this case, the chip selection vias <b>201</b>, <b>203</b>, <b>205</b> and <b>207</b> of the first semiconductor chip <b>131</b> and the chip selection vias <b>201</b>, <b>203</b>, <b>205</b> and <b>207</b> of the second semiconductor chip <b>133</b> are inversely arranged, but, in some cases, their positions may not be directly vertically overlapped but may be mismatched when viewed in a vertical direction. When the overlap positions are mismatched, a first connection unit <b>450</b> may be provided in a multi-layer to mutually connect the chip selection vias <b>200</b> located at the mismatched positions.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The first connection unit <b>450</b> is provided between the first semiconductor chip <b>131</b> and the second semiconductor chip <b>133</b> in an interpose film or sheet. The first connection unit <b>450</b> may include: a first insulation layer <b>451</b> and a second insulation layer <b>452</b>; first vertical connection vias <b>453</b> and first oblique connection vias <b>455</b> passing through the first insulation layer <b>451</b> and connected to the chip selection vias <b>200</b> of the first semiconductor chip <b>131</b>; and second vertical connection vias <b>454</b> and second oblique connection vias <b>456</b> passing through the second insulation layer <b>452</b> and connected to the first oblique connection vias <b>455</b> and the chip selection vias <b>200</b> of the second semiconductor chip <b>133</b>. The arrangements of the vertical connection vias <b>453</b> and <b>454</b> and the oblique connection vias <b>455</b> and <b>456</b> in the first insulation layer <b>451</b> and the second insulation layer <b>452</b> may be substantially equal to each other. By sequentially stacking the first insulation layer <b>451</b> and the second insulation layer <b>452</b>, the vertical connection vias <b>453</b> and <b>454</b> and the oblique connection vias <b>455</b> and <b>456</b> are mutually connected. Thus, the first chip selection via <b>201</b> of the first semiconductor chip <b>131</b> and the fourth chip selection via <b>207</b> of the second semiconductor chip <b>133</b>, which are mismatched at the overlap position thereof, may be mutually connected. As such, the first connection unit <b>450</b> may be provided by combining the stacking of films or sheets and may mutually connect the chip selection vias <b>200</b> more simply, even though the chip selection vias <b>200</b> are overlapped and stacked in a mismatched manner when viewed in a vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">A second connection unit <b>470</b> is provided between the second semiconductor chip <b>133</b> and the third semiconductor chip <b>135</b> and alternately connects and disconnects the chip selection vias <b>200</b> of the second and third semiconductor chips <b>133</b> and <b>135</b>. The second connection unit <b>470</b> includes a film- or sheet-type insulation layer <b>471</b> for insulating the semiconductor chips and the connection vias. Also, the second connection unit <b>450</b> may include vertical connection vias <b>473</b> passing through the insulation layer <b>471</b> and corresponding to the chip selection vias <b>200</b> to be connected, and oblique connection vias <b>475</b>. The oblique connection vias <b>475</b> disconnect the upper and lower chip selection vias <b>200</b> due to their oblique shape. That is, the oblique connection vias <b>475</b> serve as disconnection vias. The oblique connection vias <b>475</b> may be used as connection vias which mutually connect the upper and lower chip selection vias <b>200</b> when they are mismatched at their overlap positions. In this case, the vertical connection vias serve as disconnection vias.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">When the four semiconductor chips <b>100</b> are stacked, the semiconductor package according to the embodiment of the present invention can select the stacked individual semiconductor chips by using the chip selection vias <b>200</b> and the multi signals. Therefore, the stacked semiconductor chips <b>100</b> may be configured with the substantially identical chips, and the chip selection vias need not be differently formed at each semiconductor chip. Meanwhile, although the semiconductor package structure in which the four semiconductor chips are stacked is provided in the embodiment of the present invention, the invention can also be applied to a case in which more semiconductor chips are stacked. For example, a semiconductor package structure in which eight semiconductor chips <b>100</b> are stacked is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The 8-layer semiconductor package may be divided into a first block <b>301</b> in which first to fourth chip selection vias <b>211</b> to <b>214</b> are disposed in a sequential direction of the lowermost layer, i.e., the first semiconductor chip <b>151</b>, and a second block <b>303</b> in which fifth to eighth chip selection vias <b>215</b> to <b>218</b> are disposed.

At this time, the fifth semiconductor chip <b>155</b> may be stacked in a flip chip type in inverse order with respect to the underlying fourth semiconductor chip <b>154</b>.

Also, the interlayer connection structure of the fifth to eighth semiconductor chips <b>155</b>, <b>156</b>, <b>157</b> and <b>158</b> is substantially identical to those of the first to fourth semiconductor chips <b>151</b>, <b>152</b>, <b>153</b> and <b>154</b>, but the structure in the first block <b>301</b> and the second block <b>303</b> has an inverse relationship to that of the first to fourth semiconductor chips <b>151</b>, <b>152</b>, <b>153</b> and <b>154</b>.
