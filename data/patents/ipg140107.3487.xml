<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This is a Continuation of application Ser. No. 12/654,212 filed Dec. 14, 2009, which claims the benefit of Japanese Application No. 2008-323654 filed Dec. 19, 2008. The disclosure of the prior applications is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to battery packs, and in particular to battery packs for power tools including a battery cell holder for holding a plurality of battery cells, discharge terminals for connecting the battery cells to the power tools or charge terminals for connecting to a battery charger, and a controller for monitoring a charge condition or a discharge condition of the battery cells based on signals from the battery cells.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2000-188091 discloses a known battery pack having a battery cell holder and a case body. The battery cell holder holds a plurality of vertically oriented battery cells and is received within the case body together with the battery cells.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to the known battery pack, at least part of the battery cell holder contacts with an inner wall of the case body. Therefore, for example, in the case that an impact force is applied to the case body from the outer side, the impact force may be applied to the internally disposed battery cells and the battery cell holder without being sufficiently absorbed. As a result, there is a possibility of causing damage on the battery cells and improper contact of terminals associated with the battery cells.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, there is a need in the art for a battery pack for a power tool, which can attenuate or absorb potential impacts or shocks that may be applied to a battery pack and a battery cell holder disposed within a case body.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One aspect according to the present invention includes a battery pack and a shock absorbing device or a damping device interposed between a battery cell holder and a case body and capable of keeping the battery cell holder and the battery cells not to directly contact with an inner surface of the case body.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Each of the additional features and teachings disclosed above and below may be utilized separately or in conjunction with other features and teachings to provide improved battery packs for power tools. Representative examples of the present invention, which examples utilize many of these additional features and teachings both separately and in conjunction with one another, will now be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings. This detailed description is merely intended to teach a person of skill in the art further details for practicing preferred aspects of the present teachings and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention. Only the claims define the scope of the claimed invention. Therefore, combinations of features and steps disclosed in the following detailed description may not be necessary to practice the invention in the broadest sense, and are instead taught merely to particularly describe representative examples of the invention. Moreover, various features of the representative examples and the dependent claims may be combined in ways that are not specifically enumerated in order to provide additional useful embodiments of the present teachings.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one embodiment, a battery pack includes a case body, a battery cell holder configured to hold a plurality of battery cells, terminals including discharge terminals for connecting the battery cells to a power tool or charge terminals for connecting the battery cells to a battery charger, a control device capable of controlling a charge process or a discharge process of the battery cells, and a shock absorbing device (or a damping device) interposed between the battery cell holder and the case body and capable of keeping the battery cell holder and the battery cells not to directly contact with an inner surface of the case body.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">With this arrangement, potential impacts or shocks applied to the case body can be effectively attenuated or absorbed by the shock absorbing device. Therefore, impacts or shocks transmitted to the battery cells and the battery cell holder can be reduced or minimized. As a result it is possible to prevent the battery cells from being damaged by the impacts or shocks and to prevent improper electrical connection of the terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The shock absorbing device may include a first shock absorbing device including four shock absorbing blocks that are positioned at upper four corners of the battery cell holder, respectively. Therefore, it is possible to effectively absorb potential impacts or shocks by using a minimum volume of shock absorbing material.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The shock absorbing blocks may include bearings, into which shafts provided on the battery cell holder are fitted, respectively. This arrangement enables to reliably fix the shock absorbing blocks in position.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The shock absorbing device may further include a second shock absorbing device including a shock absorbing sheet that is laid on a bottom of the case body and is capable of supporting at least lower corners of the battery cell holder. This arrangement enables to effectively absorb impacts or shocks applied in the vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The control device may include a left control circuit board and a right control circuit board positioned on a left side and a right side of the battery cell holder, respectively. The terminals may be provided on a terminal base plate positioned on an upper side of the battery cell holder.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The terminal base plate may be electrically connected to the terminal base plate via an electrically conductive flexible plate. This arrangement allows minimizing a necessary wiring space in comparison with the case where the terminal base plate is connected to the control circuit boards via a plurality of cables.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The flexible plate may be shaped to be able to expand and contract. This shape of the flexible plate ensures electrical connection of the flexible plate with the control circuit boards and the terminal base plate.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The terminal base plate may be movable relative to the battery cell holder.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The shock absorbing device may include a third shock absorbing device interposed between an upper surface of the battery cell holder and the terminal base plate.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The battery cell holder may be configured to receive the battery cells oriented in a horizontal direction and the battery cell holder may be separated into a first holder member and a second holder member that can be joined to each other. With this configuration of the battery cell holder, it is possible to easily position the battery cells within the battery cell holder.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Each of the first holder member and the second holder member may be configured as a case having a bottom on a first side, an opening defined by an open edge on a second side opposite to the first side, and a side wall. The open edges of the first and second holder members can contact with each other. The side wall of each of the first and second holder members is shaped to have a waveform with concave and convex portions to substantially conform to the outer circumferential configurations of the battery cells. The open edges of the first and second holder members can be joined to each other by fasteners at the concave portions of the side walls. With this arrangement, fasteners, such as screws, may not protrude outward from the side wall of the battery cell holder. Therefore, it is possible to minimize the size of the battery cell holder.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The battery pack may further include a first electrical insulation sheet and a second electrical insulation sheet. The first electrical insulation sheet has elasticity and is interposed between an inner bottom surface of the bottom of the first holder member and first end surfaces of the battery cells. The second electrical insulation sheet also has elasticity and is interposed between an inner bottom surface of the bottom of the second holder member and second end surfaces opposite to the first surfaces of the battery cells. Therefore, it is possible to reliably prevent electrical circuiting of the battery cells. In addition it is possible to prevent the battery cells from moving within the battery cell holder.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">An electrical insulation paper may be attached to a surface of each of the first and second electrical insulation sheets, so that the electrical insulation ability of the electrical insulations sheets can be further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A first embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 14</figref>. This embodiment relates to a battery pack that can be used for a large-size power tool and can be recharged by a battery charger.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">&#x3c;General Construction of Battery Pack&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a battery pack <b>10</b> according to this embodiment includes a case body <b>12</b> having an upper opening <b>12</b> and a cover <b>14</b> for covering the opening <b>12</b>. Each of the case body <b>12</b> and the cover <b>14</b> has a substantially rectangular configuration in plan view. The cover <b>14</b> can be fixedly to the case body <b>12</b> at eight positions along the circumference by using screws (not shown). In this embodiment, the case body <b>12</b> and the cover <b>14</b> constitute a battery pack body.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A rubber sheet <b>15</b> is laid on an inner bottom surface <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the case body <b>12</b>. A battery cell holder <b>30</b> that holds a plurality of battery cells Se is received within the case body <b>12</b>. In this embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, twenty cylindrical battery cells Se (No. 1 to No. 20 battery cells Se) are stacked in a three-tiered manner. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11(A) and 11(B)</figref>, each two of the twenty battery cells Se are connected parallel to each other and ten sets of the two battery cells Se connected parallel to each other are connected in series with each other. A positive side (&#x201c;+&#x201d; side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11(A) and 11(B)</figref>) of an electrically connected bundle of the twenty battery cells Se is electrically connected to a positive side charge and discharge terminal Pt via a positive side cable P and a fuse F. A negative side (&#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11(A) and 11(B)</figref>) of the bundle of the battery cells Se is electrically connected to a negative side charge and discharge terminal Nt via a negative side cable N. The positive side and negative side charge and discharge terminals Pt and Nt can be connected to positive and negative side plate-like terminals of a battery charger (not shown), respectively, and/or to positive and negative side plate-like terminals of an electric power tool (not shown).</p>

The terminal base plate <b>22</b> extends horizontally on the rear portion of the upper surface of the battery cell holder <b>30</b>. An output connector <b>23</b> of a control circuit for controlling a charge process and/or a discharge process of the battery cells Se is mounted to the terminal base plate <b>22</b> at a position between the positive side and negative side charge and discharge terminals Pt and Nt. The control circuit will not be described in detail, because such a control circuit for controlling a charge process and/or a discharge process of battery cells is known in the art. The output connector <b>23</b> is formed to be oriented forwardly, so that a corresponding connector of the charging device or the power tool can be connected to the output connector <b>23</b> from the front side. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the terminal base plate <b>22</b> is placed on the rear portion of the upper surface of the battery cell holder <b>30</b> with an intervention of a rubber plate <b>31</b> between the terminal base plate <b>22</b> and the upper surface of the battery cell holder <b>30</b>, so that the terminal plate <b>22</b> can move horizontally by a suitable distance relative to the battery cell holder <b>30</b>. The rubber plate <b>31</b> serves as a shock absorbing member (or a damper) as will be hereinafter described.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, left and right parallel slide rails <b>16</b> are formed on an upper surface of the cover <b>14</b> of the battery pack <b>10</b> and extend in forward and rearward directions. Each of the slide rails <b>16</b> includes a rail body <b>16</b><i>m </i>and a linear projection <b>16</b><i>t </i>extending outwardly in a widthwise direction by a predetermined distance from an upper surface of the rail body <b>16</b><i>m</i>. A stopper portion <b>16</b><i>u </i>is formed on the rear end portion of the rail body <b>16</b><i>m. </i></p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A connecting portion (not shown) provided on the charging device or the power tool can be fitted to the left and right slide rails <b>16</b> of the cover <b>14</b> from the front side and can then slide rearwardly along the slide rails <b>16</b> (while maintaining the fitting state with the slide rails <b>16</b>) until the connecting portion abuts to the stopper portions <b>16</b><i>u. </i></p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">On the inner side with respect to the widthwise direction of the left and right slide rails <b>16</b>, left and right guide slits <b>17</b> are formed in the upper surface of the cover <b>14</b> for guiding the plate-like terminals of the charging device or the power tool to the positive side and negative side charge and discharge terminals Pt and Nt, respectively. In addition, an opening <b>14</b><i>x </i>is formed in the upper surface of the cover <b>14</b> at a position between the left and right guide slits <b>17</b> for exposing the output connector <b>23</b> of the control circuit to the out side.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">With this construction, the connecting portion of the charging device or the power tool can be fitted to the slide rails <b>16</b> of the cover <b>14</b> from the front side and can be slid rearwardly until abutting to the stopper portions <b>16</b><i>u</i>, so that the plate-like terminals of the charging device or the power tool can be electrically connected to the charge and discharge terminals Pt and Nt of the battery pack <b>10</b>, respectively, and the connector of the charging device or the power tool can also be electrically connected to the output connector <b>23</b> of the battery pack <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">&#x3c;Battery Cell Holder&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the battery cell holder <b>30</b> includes a flow control plate <b>40</b>, left and right electrical insulation plates <b>51</b>, a plurality of electrically conductive lead plates <b>101</b> to <b>120</b>, left and right electrical insulation sheets <b>52</b> and left and right holder members <b>33</b> and <b>34</b>. The flow control plate <b>40</b> can hold the bundle of the horizontally oriented battery cells Se in a three-tiered manner and can produce a substantially uniform flow of air around the bundle of the battery cells Se. The left insulation plate <b>51</b> can cover the circumferences of the electrodes exposed at the left end surfaces of the battery cells Se. Similarly, the right insulation plate <b>51</b> can cover the circumferences of electrodes exposed at the right end surfaces of the battery cells Se. The lead plates <b>101</b> to <b>120</b> are made of electrically conductive material and can electrically connect the battery cells Se in a manner as described above at their left and right end sides. The left insulation sheet <b>52</b> covers the left end surfaces of the battery cells Se from the outer side of the corresponding lead plates <b>101</b> to <b>110</b>. Similarly, the right insulation sheet <b>52</b> covers the right end surfaces of the battery cells Se from the outer side of the corresponding lead plates <b>111</b> to <b>120</b>. The left holder member <b>33</b> and the right holder member <b>34</b> cover the left side half and the right side half of the bundle of the battery cells Se, respectively.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">&#x3c;Flow Plate&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, the flow plate <b>40</b> includes a first plate portion <b>41</b>, a second plate portion <b>42</b> and a third plate portion <b>43</b>. The first plate portion <b>41</b> covers the upper side of No. <b>14</b> to No. <b>20</b> battery cells Se positioned at the top stage of the battery cell bundle. The second plate portion <b>42</b> is interleaved between No. <b>14</b> to No. <b>20</b> battery cells Se and No. <b>8</b> to No. <b>13</b> battery cells Se positioned at the middle stage of the battery cell bundle. The third plate portion <b>43</b> is interleaved between No. <b>8</b> to No. <b>13</b> battery cells Se positioned at the middle stage and No. <b>1</b> to No. <b>7</b> battery cells Se positioned at the bottom stage. The upper surfaces of the rear portions of the left and right holder members <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> include portions that jointly form an air inlet <b>35</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The first plate portion <b>41</b> serves to facilitate the air entering air inlet <b>35</b> to flow forwardly. More specifically, the first plate portion <b>41</b> has a width that gradually increases in the front side direction and has a waveform to extend along upper portions of the outer circumferential surfaces of No. <b>14</b> to No. <b>20</b> battery cells Se positioned at the top stage. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, left and right guide walls <b>41</b><i>w </i>are formed on the left and right edge portions of the first plate portion <b>41</b>, respectively, in order to guide the flow of air in the front and rear side directions. Slots <b>41</b><i>a</i>, <b>41</b><i>b </i>and <b>41</b><i>c </i>are formed in the first plate portion <b>41</b> to extend therethrough at suitable positions in the front and rear side directions in order to allow the air to flow downward through the slots <b>41</b><i>a</i>, <b>41</b><i>b </i>and <b>41</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The second plate portion <b>42</b> has a rectangular configuration as viewed in plan view and has a waveform to extend along lower portions of the outer circumferences of No. <b>14</b> to No. <b>20</b> battery cells Se and upper portions of the outer circumferences of No. <b>8</b> to No. <b>13</b> battery cells Se. The third plate portion <b>43</b> also has a rectangular configuration as viewed in plan view and has a waveform to extend along lower portions of the outer circumferences of No. <b>8</b> to No. <b>13</b> battery cells Se and upper portions of the outer circumferences of No. <b>1</b> to No. <b>7</b> battery cells Se. The second plate portion <b>42</b> has a plurality of slots <b>42</b><i>h </i>and a plurality of separators <b>42</b><i>s</i>. The slots <b>42</b><i>h </i>extend through the second plate portion <b>42</b> for allowing the air to flow therethrough in the vertical direction. The separators <b>42</b><i>s </i>serve to guide the flow of air in the front side and rear side directions.

The slots <b>43</b><i>h </i>extend through the third plate portion <b>43</b> for allowing the air to flow therethrough in the vertical direction. The separators <b>43</b><i>s </i>serve to guide the flow of air in the front side and rear side directions.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">&#x3c;Lead Plates&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(A)</figref>, the lead plates <b>101</b> to <b>120</b> are classified into eighteen intermediate lead plates (lead plates <b>102</b> to <b>105</b> and <b>107</b> to <b>120</b>) electrically connecting the twenty battery cells Se to each other, one positive side lead plate (lead plate <b>101</b>) and one negative side lead plate (lease plate <b>106</b>) for the bundle of the twenty battery cells Se.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Because the eighteen intermediate lead plates <b>102</b> to <b>105</b> and <b>107</b> to <b>120</b> have the same configuration, only the configuration of the lead plate <b>102</b> will be described. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>11</b>(A), the lead plate <b>102</b> connects between a negative electrode of No. <b>2</b> battery cell Se positioned at the bottom stage and a positive electrode of No. <b>9</b> battery cell Se positioned at the intermediate stage. The lead plate <b>102</b> is configured to enable a voltage signal transmitting therethrough to be inputted into the control circuit that includes circuit portions provided on left and right circuit boards <b>26</b> that will be explained later. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(A)</figref>, the lead plate <b>102</b> includes a lead plate body <b>102</b><i>m </i>and a band-like signal terminal <b>102</b><i>s </i>connected to the circuit portion of the corresponding control circuit board <b>26</b> for transmitting the voltage signal.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The signal terminal <b>102</b><i>s </i>has a base end portion including a first bent portion <b>102</b><i>u </i>and a second bent portion <b>102</b><i>v </i>that are bent relative to each other in a stepwise manner. The signal terminal <b>102</b><i>s </i>is further bent at a third bent portion <b>102</b><i>w </i>positioned on the side of the leading end portion away from the base end portion, so that a portion of the signal terminal <b>102</b><i>s </i>extending further from the third bent portion <b>102</b><i>w </i>away from the base end portion is positioned substantially at a right angle relative to the lead plate body <b>102</b><i>m</i>. The leading end portion of the signal terminal <b>102</b><i>s </i>is turned back at a turn-back portion <b>102</b><i>x </i>for connecting to the circuit portion of the corresponding control circuit board <b>26</b>. At the boundary region between the signal terminal <b>102</b><i>s </i>and the lead plate body <b>102</b><i>m</i>, substantially semicircular cut portions <b>102</b> are formed on opposite sides of the base end portion of the signal terminal <b>102</b><i>s</i>. Therefore, it is possible to disperse a potential stress that may be applied to the boundary region. In addition, because the signal terminal <b>102</b><i>s </i>is bent into a substantially Z-shape by the first, second and third bent portions <b>102</b><i>u</i>, <b>102</b><i>v </i>and <b>102</b><i>w</i>, it is possible to absorb potential impacts or shocks applied to the signal terminal <b>102</b><i>s </i>by these bent portions.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In an alternative configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(B)</figref>, the signal terminal <b>102</b><i>s </i>is bent to have a substantially semi circular arc-shaped configuration instead of the Z-shaped configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The configurations of the positive side lead plate <b>101</b> and the negative side base plate <b>106</b> are the same with each other. Therefore, only the configuration of the positive side lead plate <b>101</b> will be described as a representative. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>11</b>(A), the positive side lead plate <b>101</b> is made of electrically conductive material and electrically connects between a positive electrode of No. <b>1</b> battery cell Se positioned at the bottom stage and a positive electrode of No. <b>8</b> battery cell Se positioned on the intermediate stage. The positive side lead plate <b>101</b> further electrically connects the positive electrodes of No. <b>1</b> and No. <b>8</b> battery cells Se to the positive side cable P.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the positive side lead plate <b>101</b> includes a lead plate body <b>101</b><i>m </i>and a pair of power source terminals <b>101</b><i>p</i>. The lead plate body <b>101</b><i>m </i>connects between the positive electrodes of No. <b>1</b> and No. <b>8</b> battery cells Se. Each of the power source terminals <b>101</b><i>p </i>can be used for connecting the positive side cable P. By providing two power source terminals <b>101</b><i>p </i>in this way, it is possible to reduce the size in width of each power source terminal <b>101</b><i>p</i>, so that a soldering operation of the positive side cable P to the positive side lead plate <b>101</b> can be easily performed.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The base end portion of each of the power source terminals <b>101</b><i>p </i>is formed with an arc-shaped bent portion <b>101</b><i>r</i>, so that a portion of the power source terminal <b>101</b><i>p </i>extending from the bent portion <b>101</b><i>r </i>away from the base end portion is positioned at a substantially right angle relative to the lead plate body <b>101</b><i>m</i>. In addition, the leading end portion of each of the power source terminals <b>101</b><i>p </i>is turned back at a turn-back portion <b>101</b><i>x </i>for connecting to the positive side cable P. At the boundary region between each of the power source terminals <b>101</b><i>p </i>and the lead plate body <b>101</b><i>m</i>, substantially semicircular cut portions <b>101</b><i>c </i>are formed on opposite sides of the base end portion of each of the power source terminals <b>101</b><i>p</i>. Therefore, it is possible to disperse a potential stress that may be applied to the boundary regions. In addition, because the base end portion of each of the power source terminals <b>101</b><i>p </i>is bent into an arc-shape, it is possible to absorb potential impacts or shocks applied to the power source terminals <b>101</b><i>p. </i></p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">&#x3c;Insulation Sheets&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in the state that the intermediate lead plates <b>102</b> to <b>105</b> and <b>107</b> to <b>120</b>, the positive side lead plate <b>101</b> and the negative side lead plate <b>106</b> are positioned to be opposed to the left end surfaces and the right end surfaces of No. <b>1</b> to No. <b>20</b> battery cells Se, the lead plates <b>101</b> to <b>120</b> are covered by the insulation sheets <b>52</b>. The left side insulation sheet <b>52</b> is interleaved between the bottom surface of the left holder member <b>33</b> and the left end surfaces of No. <b>1</b> to No. <b>20</b> battery cells Se. The right side insulation sheet <b>52</b> is interleaved between the bottom surface of the right holder member <b>34</b> and the right end surfaces of No. <b>1</b> to No. <b>20</b> battery cells Se. The insulation sheets <b>52</b> serve to prevent potential shifting movement of the battery cells Se between the left and right holder members <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> and to prevent potential short-circuiting between the lead plates <b>101</b> to <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Each of the insulations sheets <b>52</b> has openings <b>52</b><i>h </i>at positions opposed to the signal terminals <b>102</b><i>s </i>and the power source terminals <b>101</b><i>p </i>of the lead plates <b>101</b> to <b>120</b> in order to allow passage of the signal terminals <b>102</b><i>s </i>and the power source terminals <b>101</b><i>p. </i></p>

In this connection, a plurality of positioning projections <b>33</b><i>p </i>(one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(A)</figref>) are formed on the open edge <b>33</b><i>e </i>of the left holder member <b>33</b> and can be fitted into a plurality of positioning recesses <b>34</b><i>h </i>formed in the open edge <b>34</b><i>e </i>of the right holder member <b>34</b>, With this arrangement, it is possible to join the open edge <b>33</b><i>e </i>of the left holder member <b>33</b> and the open edge <b>34</b><i>e </i>of the right holder member <b>34</b> to each other always in a predetermined positional relationship. In this way, the left holder member <b>33</b> and the right holder member <b>34</b> serve as first holder member and a second holder member, respectively, which constitutes the battery cell holder <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The left holder member <b>33</b> and the right holder member <b>34</b> are configured to be symmetrical with each other except for the positioning projections <b>33</b><i>p </i>and the positioning recesses <b>34</b>. Therefore, the details of the left and right holder members <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> will be explained only in connection with the right side holder member <b>34</b> as a representative.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the right holder member <b>34</b> is configured as a case having an open end and a closed end on the opposite side of the open end. The right holder member <b>34</b> serves to receive the right half of the bundle of No. <b>1</b> to No. <b>20</b> battery cells Se held in a three-tiered manner by the flow plate <b>40</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8(A) and 8(B)</figref>, the right holder member <b>34</b> has a bottom plate <b>340</b> and a side plate <b>345</b> that is formed to have a waveform to extend along the outer circumferential surfaces of the battery cells Se and the upper surface of the flow plate <b>40</b>. The side plate <b>345</b> has an inlet half portion <b>35</b><i>a </i>constituting a right side half of the air inlet <b>35</b> and positioned at a rear part of a portion of the side plate <b>345</b> defining a left side part of the upper surface of the battery cell holder <b>30</b>. In addition, and engaging claw portion <b>346</b> is provided on the side wall <b>345</b> at a position on the front side of the inlet half portion <b>35</b><i>a </i>for engaging with an engaging hole <b>22</b><i>h </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(A)</figref>) formed in the terminal base plate <b>22</b>, so that the terminal base plate <b>22</b> can be held against the battery cell holder <b>30</b>. In this embodiment, the size of the engaging hole <b>22</b><i>h </i>is set to allow the movement of the terminal base plate <b>22</b> both in the right and left directions and in the front and rear directions on the condition that the engaging hole <b>22</b><i>h </i>is engaged with the engaging claw <b>346</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The bottom plate <b>340</b> of the right holder member <b>34</b> is configured to be covered by the left insulation sheet <b>52</b> and has openings <b>343</b> formed at positions corresponding to the openings <b>52</b><i>h </i>of the left insulation sheet <b>52</b>. The openings <b>343</b> are configured to allow passage of the signal terminals <b>102</b><i>s </i>and the power source terminals <b>101</b><i>p </i>of the lead plates <b>101</b> to <b>120</b> and each has a circumferential edge raised to protrude forwardly from the front surface of the bottom plate <b>340</b> by a small distance as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(C)</figref>. On the other hand, the backside of the circumferential edge of each of the openings <b>343</b> is depressed from the rear surface of the bottom plate <b>340</b> to define a quadrangular prism-shaped recess <b>343</b><i>k </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(D)</figref>. Therefore, when the right side half of the bundle of No. <b>1</b> to No. <b>20</b> battery cells Se is received within the right holder member <b>34</b>, the signal terminals <b>102</b><i>s </i>and the power source terminals <b>101</b><i>p </i>of the lead plates <b>101</b> to <b>120</b> can easily pass through the corresponding openings <b>343</b> of the bottom plate <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>8</b>(A) and <b>8</b>(B), tabs <b>347</b> having screw insertion holes for insertion of shanks of screws are formed on the open edge <b>34</b><i>e </i>of the right holder member <b>34</b> at positions corresponding to bottoms of concave portions of the waveform of the side plate <b>345</b>. The screws can be engaged with threaded holes of screw engaging portions formed on the open edge <b>33</b><i>e </i>of the right holder member <b>33</b>, so that the open edge <b>34</b><i>e </i>of the right holder member <b>34</b> and the open edge <b>33</b><i>e </i>of the left holder member <b>33</b> can be joined to each other by using the screws. In this embodiment, the sum of the depths of the right holder member <b>34</b> and the left holder member <b>33</b> is set to be slightly smaller than the distance between the outer surface (left surface) of the left insulation sheet <b>52</b> covering the left end surfaces of the battery cells Se and the outer surface (right surface) of the right insulation sheet <b>52</b> covering the right end surfaces of the battery cells Se. Therefore, the left and right insulation sheets <b>52</b> are compressed in the thickness direction due to elastic deformation when the open edge <b>34</b><i>e </i>of the right holder member <b>34</b> and the open edge <b>33</b><i>e </i>of the left holder member <b>33</b> are joined to each other by tightening the screws after inserting the bundle of the battery cells Se into the right holder member <b>34</b> and the left holder member <b>33</b>. As a result, it is possible to prevent the battery cells Se from moving relative to the left and right holder members <b>33</b> and <b>34</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3(A)</figref>, the circuit portions of the left and right control circuit boards <b>26</b> are electrically connected to the terminal base plate <b>22</b> having the output connector <b>23</b> via a flexible base plate <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 14</figref>, the flexible base plate <b>60</b> includes a film-like base plate body <b>62</b> and a plurality of signal lines (not shown) embedded within the base plate body <b>62</b>. The base plate body <b>62</b> includes a main base plate portion <b>63</b> and a branched base plate portion <b>64</b> branched from the main base plate portion <b>63</b>. The main base plate portion <b>63</b> is positioned on the front side of the terminal base plate <b>22</b> and extends in right and left directions over the upper surface of the battery cell holder <b>30</b>.

A leading end of the branched base plate portion <b>64</b> is formed with a central connector portion <b>66</b> for connecting to the terminal base plate <b>22</b>. A substantially U-shaped bent portion <b>63</b><i>u </i>is provided at a midway position of the main base plate <b>63</b>, so that the man base plate portion <b>63</b> can extend and contract in the longitudinal direction (left and right directions). In addition, at a midway position of the branched base plate portion <b>64</b>, a substantially S-shaped bent portion <b>64</b><i>s </i>is provided, so that the branched base plate portion <b>64</b> can extend and contract in the longitudinal direction (left and right directions).</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">&#x3c;Shock Absorbing Mechanism&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Two shock absorbers <b>70</b> are provided at upper two corners of each of the control circuit boards <b>26</b>, so that four shock absorbers <b>70</b> are provided at four corners of the battery cell holder <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3(A) and 3(B)</figref>, each of the shock absorber <b>70</b> includes a shaft <b>71</b> and an L-shaped wall <b>73</b> that are fixedly mounted to the side surface of the corresponding holder member (i.e., the outer surface of the bottom plate <b>340</b> of the right holder member <b>34</b> or the outer surface of the bottom plate <b>330</b> of the left holder member <b>33</b>). The shaft <b>71</b> and the L-shaped wall <b>73</b> extend perpendicular to the corresponding control circuit board <b>26</b> (corresponding side surface of the battery cell holder <b>30</b>). The L-shaped wall <b>73</b> surrounds the shaft <b>71</b> from two different sides. A rectangular shock absorbing block (or a damper block) <b>75</b> is mounted to the shaft <b>71</b>. For example, the shock absorbing block <b>75</b> may be made of rubber. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(B)</figref>, the shock absorbing block <b>75</b> has a bearing portion <b>75</b><i>j </i>at its central portion, so that the shaft <b>71</b> extends through the bearing portion <b>75</b><i>j</i>. An outer circumferential surface <b>75</b><i>r </i>of the shock absorbing block <b>75</b> is configured to be able to contact with a plurality of linear projections <b>73</b><i>t </i>formed on the inner side surface of the L-shaped wall <b>73</b>. Here, the L-shaped wall <b>73</b> protrudes outwardly beyond the corresponding control circuit board <b>26</b>. In addition, an outer end surface <b>75</b><i>t </i>of the shock absorbing block <b>75</b> protrudes outwardly beyond the L-shaped wall <b>73</b> and is tapered toward the outer side.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the four shock absorbing blocks <b>75</b> positioned at the upper four corners of the battery cell holder <b>30</b> are configured such that the end surfaces <b>75</b><i>t </i>of these shock absorbing blocks <b>75</b> contact the inner side surface of the case body <b>12</b> when the battery case <b>30</b> is received within the case body <b>12</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Thus, the outer side surface of the battery cell holder <b>30</b> does not directly contact with the inner side surface of the case body <b>12</b>. In addition, because the rubber sheet <b>15</b> is laid on the inner bottom surface <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the case body <b>12</b> so as to be interleaved between the lower surface of the battery cell holder <b>30</b> and the inner bottom surface <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the case body <b>12</b>, the lower surface of the battery cell holder <b>30</b> does not directly contact with the inner bottom surface <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the case body <b>12</b>. In this way, the battery cell holder <b>30</b> is received within the case body <b>12</b> in a manner floating therewithin by way of the shock absorbers <b>70</b> and the rubber sheet <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(A) and 2(B)</figref>, block contacting portions <b>78</b> for contacting with the shock absorbing blocks <b>75</b> of the shock absorbers <b>70</b> are formed at four corners of the inner surface of the cover <b>14</b> of the case body <b>12</b>. Each of the block receiving portions <b>78</b> includes an upper contact surface <b>78</b><i>u </i>for contacting with the corresponding shock absorbing block <b>75</b> and a side contact surface <b>78</b><i>y </i>for contacting with the L-shaped wall <b>73</b> from the front side direction or the rear side direction. Therefore, when the cover <b>14</b> is mounted to and fixed in position relative to the case body <b>12</b>, the battery cell holder <b>30</b> is held in the floating state also by the cover <b>14</b>. In this way, the shock absorbing blocks <b>75</b> serve as a first shock absorbing device disposed on an upper side of the battery cell holder <b>30</b> and the rubber sheet <b>15</b> serves as a second shock absorbing device disposed on the lower side of the battery cell holder <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">&#x3c;Advantages of Battery Pack&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">According to the battery pack <b>10</b> of this embodiment, the battery cell holder <b>30</b> is received inside of the case body <b>12</b> with an intervention of the shock absorbers <b>70</b> (first shock absorbing device) and the rubber sheet <b>15</b> (second shock absorbing device) between the battery cell holder <b>30</b> and the case body <b>12</b>, so that the battery cell holder <b>30</b> does not directly contact with the inner surface of the case body <b>12</b>. Therefore, when impacts or shocks are externally applied to the case body <b>12</b> of the battery pack <b>10</b>, such impacts or shocks may be absorbed by the elastic deformation of the shock absorbers <b>70</b> and the rubber plate <b>15</b>. As a result, it is possible to attenuate or reduce potential impacts applied to the battery cells Se and the battery cell holder <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In addition, because the shock absorbers <b>70</b> are disposed at four upper corners of the battery cell holder <b>30</b>, it is possible to efficiently absorb potential impacts by using a minimum number of the absorbers and a minimum volume of materials required for absorbing impacts.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In addition, potential impacts that may be applied to the battery cell holder <b>30</b> in the vertical direction can be effectively absorbed by the rubber sheet <b>15</b> laid on the inner bottom surface <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the case body <b>12</b> and supporting the battery cell holder <b>30</b> from the lower side.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Further, because the circuit portions of the left and right control circuit boards <b>26</b> are connected to the terminal base plate <b>22</b> via the flexible base plate <b>60</b>, it is possible to minimize a wiring space in comparison with a case in which the circuit portions are connected to the terminal base plate <b>22</b> via a plurality of cables.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Furthermore, because the flexible base plate <b>60</b> can expand and contract in the longitudinal direction, it is possible to reliably prevent potential improper electrical connection of the flexible base plate <b>60</b> to the control circuit boards <b>26</b> and the terminal base plate <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Furthermore, the battery cell holder <b>30</b> receives the battery cells Se in a state where the battery cells Se extend horizontally, and the battery cell holder <b>30</b> has the left holder member <b>33</b> and the right holder member <b>34</b> that can be separated and joined to each other in the horizontal direction. Therefore, it is possible to easily position the battery cells Se within the battery cell holder <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Furthermore, each of the side plate <b>345</b> of the right holder member <b>34</b> and a side plate (corresponding to the side plate <b>345</b>) of the left holder member <b>33</b> is formed to have a waveform to extend along the outer circumferential surfaces of the battery cells Se, and the left holder member <b>33</b> and the right holder member <b>34</b> are joined to each other by screws at tabs <b>347</b> positioned to correspond to bottoms of concave portions of the waveforms of the side plate <b>345</b> and the side plate of the left holder member <b>33</b>. Therefore, the screws do not protrude from the circumference of the battery cell holder <b>30</b>. As a result, it is possible to minimize the size of the battery cell holder <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Furthermore, the electrical insulation sheets <b>52</b> are positioned between the bottom plate of the left holder <b>33</b> and the left end surfaces of the battery cells Se and between the bottom plate of the right holder <b>34</b> and the right end surfaces of the battery cells Se. Therefore, it is possible to reliably prevent the battery cells Se from short-circuiting therebetween and it is also possible to prevent potential axial movement of the battery cells Se relative to the battery cell holder <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">It may be possible to attach an electrical insulating paper to the surface of the insulation sheet <b>52</b> in order to improve the insulating performance.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">&#x3c;alternative embodiments&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The present invention may not be limited to the above embodiment but may be modified in various ways. For example, although the battery pack <b>10</b> of the above embodiment includes twenty battery cells Se, the number of the battery cells Se may not be limited to twenty and may be suitable determined.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In addition, although the shock absorber <b>70</b> is constituted by the shaft <b>71</b>, the L-shaped wall <b>73</b> and the rectangular shock absorbing block <b>75</b>, the L-shaped wall <b>73</b> may be replaced with a wall having a different shape and the rectangular shock absorbing block <b>75</b> may be replaced with a shock absorbing block having a different shape.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Furthermore, although the rubber sheet <b>15</b> is interleaved between the lower surface of the battery cell holder <b>30</b> and the inner bottom surface <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the case body <b>12</b>, the rubber sheet <b>15</b> may be replaced with rubber blocks or the like positioned at four lower corners of the battery cell holder <b>30</b>.</p>
