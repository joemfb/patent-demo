<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An instrument is disclosed that is capable of detecting and graphically displaying channel usage and the number of access points operating on each channel of interest. By using a module that counts the number of elapsed clock cycles, the total cumulative duration of detected frames, and the number of channel in-use cycles, the instrument can determine the percentage of time a channel is in use, the percentage of time of IEEE 802.11 usage on a channel, and the percentage of time of non-IEEE 802.11 usage on a channel. Further, channels are scanned for access point activity using a scanning algorithm that interleaves scanning channels at a first duration longer than the beacon interval and scanning channels at a second shorter duration.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of the following application which is incorporated by reference in its entirety, U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/256,291, entitled &#x201c;SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR MEASURING AND DISPLAYING PRESENCE OF WIRELESS LOCAL AREA NETWORK DEVICES,&#x201d; filed Oct. 29, 2009.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">When a network technician services a local area network, such as an IEEE 802.11 network, it may be advantageous to assess various operational parameters of the network. Such parameters may include, for example, how crowded the channels in the intended operating band are in the local area, whether there is too much noise, and which channels might be assigned a new access point (AP) based upon respective levels of network traffic. These parameters may be particularly relevant, for example, when troubleshooting slow networks or otherwise evaluating where to install an additional access point for the local area network. Typically, additional devices should not be added to a channel that is already overused or has too many APs on it.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For an IEEE 802.11 network, the two main operating bands over which the IEEE 802.11 set of standards presently are controlling are at 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. These operating bands may become crowded with devices that operate using the IEEE 802.11 protocol, as well as with devices that operate using non-IEEE 802.11 protocol or other devices that contribute noise within these bands. Accordingly, network technicians that service IEEE 802.11 networks may utilize testing equipment including network diagnostic instruments to assess various conditions associated with the network.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The following description is generally directed to systems and methods that may be utilized in connection with analyzing network devices and networks, including, for example, local area networks such as one operating in accordance with the IEEE 802.11 network protocol.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Various aspects and examples of the invention will now be described. The following description provides specific details for a thorough understanding and enabling description of these examples. One skilled in the art will understand, however, that the invention may be practiced without many of these details. Additionally, some well-known structures or functions may not be shown or described in detail, so as to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the relevant description.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The terminology used in the description presented below is intended to be interpreted in its broadest reasonable manner, even though it is being used in conjunction with a detailed description of certain specific examples of the invention. Certain terms may even be emphasized below; however, any terminology intended to be interpreted in any restricted manner will be overtly and specifically defined as such in this Detailed Description section.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A wireless network diagnostics instrument is described below that provides an easily-interpreted, graphical view of the usage of wireless channels in a local environment. The channels that can be monitored include, but are not limited to, the 2.4 GHz and the 5 GHz spectral bands. For each of the wireless channels of a particular band or bands, the instrument can provide an indication of the presence of signals that follow IEEE 802.11 protocol, non-IEEE 802.11 protocol signals (e.g., Bluetooth devices, microwave ovens, cordless telephones, video phones, wireless cameras, and noise that are present within the band(s)), and the number of access points (APs) that are operating on each channel. This information can be used diagnostically for many purposes, such as for determining whether a particular channel's bandwidth is overused, especially when communication to a specific client is slow. It can also be utilized for selecting a channel or channels for installing new APs. The indication of the presence of signals that do not follow IEEE 802.11 protocol permits the identification of sources of interference to IEEE 802.11 protocol signals. Further, the presentation of information can indicate which channels are legally available for use in a particular region and/or country for determining whether detected access points are operating on permitted frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Channel utilization in a local area network, such as in the IEEE 802.11 operating bands, can be determined in a conventional manner with a tunable radio frequency (RF) detector and an oscilloscope. For example, IEEE 802.11 network data transmitted at two different frequencies are detected via an RF detector and displayed in two different oscilloscope traces, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, where time is shown on the horizontal axis, and RF power is shown on the vertical axis. Each spike in the oscilloscope traces represents a packet of IEEE 802.11 data. Each channel frequency is shared by multiple users (as indicated by a user name in the figures) and/or APs, and the users and/or APs take turns transmitting over the channel. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, there are only two user devices, User Device <b>1</b> and User Device <b>2</b>, sharing the channel with at least one, and possibly more, APs. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, for the same time period, there are 18 user devices sharing the channel with one or more APs. Thus, the oscilloscope traces show that the channel monitored in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is much less crowded than the channel monitored in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. However, RF detectors and oscilloscopes are not usually available to a network technician for performing network analysis. Moreover, while oscilloscope traces provide some information as to which channels are in use, the traces do not provide an easy way to interpret usage of the entire frequency spectrum of a local area network (such as the IEEE 802.11 frequency spectrum), nor does it provide information regarding the number of APs that are already assigned to a particular channel.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Atheros Communications of Santa Clara, Calif. is a manufacturer of chipsets (for example, the 9000 series chipset) that can scan and monitor wireless communication channels. The chipsets include a plurality of counters, including a cycle counter, a received-frames counter, and a channel-not-clear counter. Each of these counters can be set to monitor a particular channel, and the counters continue to monitor that channel until given a command to monitor a different channel. Each counter stores its information in a read/write register inside the chip, and the data is available in binary format from the registers. A processor in the wireless network diagnostics instrument accesses the registers of the chipset through the chip's bus interface. Alternatively or additionally, other counters may be supported by the chipset.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The cycle counter continuously counts every clock cycle that elapses from when the counter is initialized; the received-frames counter counts the total cumulative duration of detected IEEE frames; and the channel-not-clear counter counts the number of clock cycles over which a particular channel is in use either due to detected IEEE frames or interference. When the processor in the wireless network diagnostics instrument is ready to begin acquiring data from the counters, it commands the counters to monitor a particular channel and then writes a zero to each of the registers in quick succession. The counters each count their respective data, and after a suitable measurement period has elapsed, the processor reads the information from each of the registers, again in quick succession.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In accordance with an exemplary embodiment as described, the counter information provided by an IEEE 802.11n connectivity chipset to the processor of the wireless network diagnostics instrument can be processed and provided in a useful visual display for network technicians. In one embodiment, the counter functions provided by the chipset can be performed by other hardware and/or software modules. Upon receiving the counter information, in one embodiment, the information is broken down into channel usage time for transmissions that follow IEEE 802.11 protocol as well as transmissions that do not follow IEEE 802.11 protocol. The durations over which the various transmissions are present over a particular channel are accumulated over a fixed measurement period, and then a duty cycle of percentage of usage during the measurement period is calculated. Each channel is scanned for a period of time, and the results for each channel are processed to provide an average usage that is presented to the network technician in a graphical manner that is simple to interpret.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">An exemplary wireless network diagnostics instrument is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. Selection of the &#x201c;Channels&#x201d; function on the instrument prompts the instrument to provide a display of overall channel usage, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. The display in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> provides information about channel usage for each channel in a band, for example, the percentage of time a channel is used for transmissions that follow IEEE 802.11 protocol, the percentage of time the channel is used for transmissions that do not follow IEEE 802.11 protocol, and the number of APs operating on the channel. Certain channels may be designated by a country's regulations as illegal for use for IEEE 802.11 signal transmission in a particular region or the entire country. These Illegal channels can be identified using a different color on the display shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, for example, red, to make it easy to determine which channels are permitted for operating APs and transmitting IEEE 802.11 signals.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The &#x201c;usage legend&#x201d; in the exemplary screen depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> indicates that IEEE 802.11 usage is shown as a shaded area <b>221</b>, and non-IEEE 802.11 usage is shown as a cross-hatched area <b>222</b>. Easy to distinguish colors, such as blue and gray, can be used on the screen as an alternative to shaded and cross-hatched areas. Each AP detected on a channel is depicted using an AP symbol <b>220</b>. A different color that is easy to distinguish, such as black, can be used for the AP symbol.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Wireless utilization information is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> in a stacked bar format. The bars are linearly scaled to represent approximate percentage of channel usage. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> indicates that there are seven APs <b>232</b> operating on channel 11 <b>230</b>, and IEEE 802.11 network traffic <b>234</b> is using approximately 50% of the available capacity of the channel. The screen additionally indicates that there is some non-IEEE 802.11 interference <b>240</b>, <b>242</b>, <b>244</b> on channels 2, 3, and 6, respectively, that occupy available channel capacity. In the exemplary screen, illegal channel numbers <b>250</b>, <b>251</b>, <b>252</b>, <b>253</b>, <b>254</b> are shown in a different color. The example view shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> can provide visual feedback to the network technician as to the state of the wireless environment in the surrounding area.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The examples of visual displays shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref> show possible embodiments of presentation of channel usage information to network technicians. Other embodiments that can provide a useful display of channel usage are possible including, but not limited to, pie charts, horizontal bar charts, and stacked area charts. Similarly, other types of markers and different color or shading schemes can be used with any of these different types of displays.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows a detailed view of channel usage as a function of time for a specific channel whose channel usage is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. The view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, shows channel usage as a function of time along the horizontal axis. This view is useful, for example, to support further trouble shooting or investigation of channels. A network technician uses the key pad on the instrument to highlight a desired channel, for example channel 11 as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> and then presses &#x201c;Select&#x201d; to bring up the channel usage details screen shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. This screen provides a graph of channel usage as a function of time that shows both 802.11 usage <b>310</b> (in a first color or shading) and non-IEEE 802.11 usage <b>320</b> (in a different color or shading) on top of the IEEE 802.11 usage for the selected channel. In particular, this view can be helpful to detect intermittent channel availability.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Having the ability to detect and display non-IEEE 802.11 usage can be very useful for troubleshooting wireless connectivity problems. For example, consider a wireless client who normally connects to an AP on channel 1 of the 2.4 GHz band. If the client installs a common wireless camera and then experiences wireless bandwidth and connection issues, the problem would be immediately evident with a wireless network diagnostics instrument which provides the display shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Channels 1, 2, and 3 are filled with non-IEEE 802.11 signals <b>410</b>, <b>420</b>, <b>430</b>, and virtually no bandwidth is available to the client on channel 1. This information assists the network technician in looking for the source of the problem and would likely allow the technician to quickly spot the wireless camera that had just been installed.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The presence of APs operating on a particular channel is detected by receiving a regular beacon sent out by each of the APs. An AP sends out a beacon approximately every 100 ms to provide information such as a time stamp, supported rates, capability information, and channel numbers. In the 2.4 GHz band, for example, there are up to 14 channels that can be used. Thus, if a system were to scan all 14 channels, it would have to scan each channel for at least 100 ms, the beacon interval, to guarantee that the beacon from each AP is received and detected, and it would take at least 1.4 seconds to consecutively scan all 14 of the channels. In one embodiment, each channel can be scanned for a time greater than the beacon interval, for example up to 110 ms, in order to not miss any beacons. In this scenario, if a device, such as a microwave oven, were turned on and contributed noise on one or more of the channels, it could take up to a few seconds before a network technician scanning the channels would be aware of the noise emanating from the microwave. Ideally, scanning each of the channels should be done as fast as possible to gather accurate usage information, but the dwell time at each channel should be long enough in order to receive the beacon from any AP operating on the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In order to provide timely and useful channel usage information, in one embodiment, the channels are scanned using a scanning algorithm that incorporates at least two different measurement periods, a longer period, for example 100 ms, and a shorter period, for example 10 ms. In one embodiment, the shorter period can be, for example up to 20 ms, in order to minimize the time spent scanning channels in between the scans of the channels at the longer period. Then the scanning algorithm interleaves the long and short measurement periods such that all of the channels are monitored in less than 1.4 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts a flow diagram illustrating an exemplary process <b>500</b> of scanning channels to determine channel usage, including detecting the presence of APs on the channels, according to an embodiment of the disclosure. For clarity of explanation, the 14 available channels in the 2.4 GHz band will be used to describe the algorithm. At block <b>505</b>, a first channel is scanned at the longer measurement period, for example 100 ms, to detect usage of the channel and any AP beacons. Any activity detected on the first channel is stored. In one embodiment, the usage display is immediately updated. Alternatively or additionally, the usage display can be updated after a fixed duration has elapsed or after all 14 channels have been scanned.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Then at block <b>510</b>, one of the remaining 13 channels is quickly scanned at the shorter measurement period, and information about channel activity is stored. At decision block <b>515</b> the system decides if there are any more channels to be scanned at the short measurement period. There are more channels to be scanned if not all 13 of the remaining channels have been scanned at the short measurement period. If there are more channels to scan (block <b>515</b>&#x2014;Yes), the process returns to block <b>510</b> where another one of the 13 channels is scanned. If there are no more channels left to scan (block <b>515</b>&#x2014;No), the process continues to block <b>520</b> to scan the next channel at the long measurement period. The loop between block <b>510</b> and decision block <b>515</b> scans all of the 13 channels at the short measurement period, for example 10 ms, resulting in a total time of 130 ms. Thus, all 14 of the channels are scanned, at least quickly, in a total of 230 ms between block <b>505</b> and prior to starting block <b>520</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">At block <b>520</b>, the next channel in the 2.4 GHz band is scanned at the long measurement period. Again, any activity detected on this channel is stored. In order to scan all of the channels in the least amount of time, this channel should not be the same as the first channel scanned at block <b>505</b>; it should be one of the other 13 channels in the band. However, in one embodiment, all of the channels to be monitored can be scanned in any order.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">At block <b>525</b>, one of the channels is scanned at the short measurement period, and the information about channel activity is stored. Then at decision block <b>530</b>, the system determines if there are any more channels to scan at the short measurement period. The same criterion is used as with decision block <b>515</b>. If there are more channels to scan at the short measurement period (block <b>530</b>&#x2014;Yes), the process returns to block <b>525</b> to scan the next channel at the short measurement period. If all 13 of the other channels have been scanned at the short measurement period (block <b>530</b>&#x2014;No), the process continues to decision block <b>535</b> where the system determines if there are any more channels to scan at the long measurement period. If there are more channels to scan at the long measurement period (block <b>535</b>&#x2014;Yes), the process returns to block <b>520</b> to scan the next channel using the long measurement period. If there are no more channels to scan at the long measurement period (block <b>535</b>&#x2014;No), the process returns to block <b>505</b> to start the entire scan process again.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Essentially, in process <b>500</b>, each of the 14 channels in the band is scanned at the long measurement period, and interleaved between the scanning of each channel at the long measurement period, the other channels in the band are scanned at the short measurement period. In one embodiment, all of the other channels in the band are scanned at the short measurement period. However, the algorithm can be adjusted to scan fewer than all of the other channels in the band.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It may take (230 ms&#xd7;13 channels)+100 ms or more than three seconds to scan each of the 14 channels for 100 ms to check for all AP beacons in the operating band while interleaving with scans of the channels at the short measurement period. In one embodiment, before implementing the faster scanning algorithm just described, all of the channels are scanned for 100 ms to ensure that all APs are accounted for in as short a time as possible. Measurement periods different from 100 ms and 10 ms can be used, as long as one of the measurement periods is long enough to capture all AP beacons on any particular channel. Further, it is possible to use more than two different measurement periods in a scanning algorithm. The above-described algorithm is intended to be a non-limiting example of a scanning algorithm that is faster than an algorithm that scans each channel in the band for a fixed duration that is longer than the beacon interval.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> depicts a flow diagram illustrating an exemplary process <b>600</b>A of determining IEEE 802.11 usage, non-IEEE 802.11 usage, and the number APs operating on each channel in a band of interest, according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">At block <b>605</b> the system scans the wireless channels in the band of interest for operating access points. Because each access point transmits a beacon at regular beacon intervals, the system can determine the number of APs using a particular wireless channel by counting the number of unique AP beacons that are detected. This process was described in detail above with the channel scanning process <b>500</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">At block <b>606</b>, the system sets the counters to monitor a first channel. The counters continue to monitor this channel until commanded to monitor a different channel. Then at block <b>608</b>, the system resets the counter registers to zero to begin monitoring the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">At block <b>610</b>, the system reads and stores the data from the counter registers from a chipset or other counting module or modules. The chipset or counting module is adapted to receive transmissions over wireless channels in at least the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands. More details about block <b>610</b> are given by the receiving process <b>600</b>B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. At block <b>670</b>, the system reads the cycle counter register to obtain the number of clock cycles that have elapsed since the counter was set to zero. At block <b>672</b>, the system reads the received-frames register to obtain the total cumulative duration of detected IEEE frames since the counter was set to zero. And at block <b>674</b>, the system reads the channel-not-clear counter to obtain the number of clock cycles over which the particular wireless channel was in use since the counter was set to zero. The process of reading counting information ends at block <b>698</b>. Other information not described herein relating to the wireless channels in the band of interest can also be provided by the chipset or counting module(s) to the system. The period over which the chipset or other module(s) accumulates the counting information can occur simultaneously during the scanning for AP beacons. Alternatively, this counting period can occur separately.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Returning to block <b>615</b> of process <b>600</b>A, the system processes the received counting information. More details about block <b>615</b> are given by the calculating process <b>600</b>C shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>. At block <b>680</b>, the system determines the percentage of time that a wireless channel is in use by dividing the number of in-use clock cycles received at block <b>674</b> by the total number of elapsed clock cycles received at block <b>670</b>. At block <b>682</b>, the system determines the percentage of time that a wireless channel is used for IEEE 802.11 transmissions by dividing the cumulative duration of detected IEEE frames obtained at block <b>672</b> by the total number of clock cycles received at block <b>670</b> times the duration of the clock cycle. Then at block <b>684</b>, the system subtracts the percentage of time that the wireless channel is used for IEEE 802.11 transmissions (calculated at block <b>682</b>) from the percentage of time that the same wireless channel is in use (calculated at block <b>680</b>) to determine the percentage of time that the wireless channel is used by non-IEEE 802.11 transmissions. The process of calculating counting information ends at block <b>699</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Returning to process <b>600</b>A, at decision block <b>620</b>, the system determines if there are any other channels in the band of interest for which calculations of counting information is needed. If the system determines that there are other channels for which calculations of counting information is needed (block <b>620</b>&#x2014;Yes), the process returns to block <b>606</b> to set the counters to monitor another channel. If the system determines that there are no other channels for which calculations of counting information is needed (block <b>620</b>&#x2014;No), the process continues to block <b>625</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">At block <b>625</b>, the system accesses information about which channels in the band are permitted to be legally used in the region in which the wireless network diagnostics instrument is being operated. The information on permitted frequencies and/or the region of operation of the instrument can be stored in a memory unit within the wireless network diagnostics instrument and/or in a database that is external to the wireless network diagnostics instrument. At decision block <b>630</b>, the system determines if any of the channels in the band of interest are not permitted to be used in the location that the instrument is operating. If the system determines that all of the channels are permitted to be used (block <b>630</b>&#x2014;No), the process displays the channel usage information without indicating that any channels are restricted. The process returns to block <b>605</b> for the next cycle for determining which wireless channels in the band of interest are being used.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">If the system determines that one or more of the channels are not permitted to be used (block <b>630</b>&#x2014;Yes), at block <b>635</b> the process stores the information on which channels are illegal. Then the process continues to block <b>640</b> where the channel usage information is displayed, and the display also indicates which channels are being illegally used.</p>
