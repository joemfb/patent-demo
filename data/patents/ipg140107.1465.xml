<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to protective covers, and particularly to a cushioned cover for traffic structures that provides an elastomeric or pneumatically cushioned cover for traffic structures, such as concrete barriers, stanchions, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A number of different configurations of traffic structures have been developed over the years, including metal guardrails, cables either with or without chain link fencing installed therewith, and various other structures. Two very common types of traffic structures are the massive concrete traffic barriers (often called &#x201c;Jersey walls&#x201d; or &#x201c;Jersey barriers&#x201d;) and vertical columns, posts, stanchions, and the like used to support overpasses and highway signs and lights. These two types of traffic structures comprise perhaps the majority of traffic structures, particularly in urban areas, and are nearly universally formed of hard, rigid materials that do not flex or yield significantly when they receive a significant impact force, as when struck by a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">While some thought and effort has gone into the design of &#x201c;Jersey wall&#x201d; type barriers in efforts to minimize the severity of vehicle accidents after contacting such barriers, the barriers generally do not serve particularly well in this regard. Most such barriers have outwardly sloped bases intended to cause the tire of a vehicle to ride slightly up the base upon impact and to turn the vehicle back into the traffic lane(s). While this serves to prevent the vehicle from crossing the barrier and impacting stationary objects to the side of the road or perhaps entering traffic flowing in the opposite direction, it does nothing to prevent perhaps extensive damage to the vehicle. Moreover, the deflection of the vehicle back into the traffic lane(s) often leads to multiple vehicle crashes as the deflected vehicle veers out of control back into perhaps heavy traffic.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Other traffic structures such as support columns, stanchions, posts, and the like, generally have little or no capability to reduce damage to either the traffic structure or to the vehicle upon impact. In fact, the solid, rigid materials of which these various traffic structures are made generally result in significant damage to a vehicle striking the structure. The structure itself generally fares no better, and generally requires replacement after a major impact. This often holds true even for massive concrete traffic barriers after a major impact, as well as for columns, stanchions and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Some effort has gone into the development of traffic barriers and other traffic structures, as noted further above. One example of such effort is found in Japanese Patent Publication No. 9-100,517, published on Apr. 15, 1997. This reference describes (according to the drawings and English abstract) a decorative overlay for a guardrail. The overlay comprises a rubber baseboard, a transparent barrier layer, a &#x201c;drawing sheet&#x201d; of artwork or the like, and another transparent protective layer for the &#x201c;drawing sheet&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">None of the above inventions and patents, taken either singly or in combination, is seen to describe the instant invention as claimed. Thus, a cushioned cover for traffic structures solving the aforementioned problems is desired.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The cushioned cover for traffic structures is a cover that incorporates a plurality of resilient layers. In one embodiment, an innermost layer or ply of natural or synthetic rubber has a plurality of closely spaced, generally hemispherical (or other suitable shape) elements extending outwardly therefrom, and an outer layer or ply of natural or synthetic rubber overlaying the hemispherical elements. The hemispherical elements are preferably formed of a highly resilient polybutadiene elastomer used to manufacture a toy ball known as a &#x201c;bouncy ball.&#x201d; The inner and outer layers are preferably formed of recycled tires for economy of manufacture and to reduce environmental impact.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A second embodiment includes the inner and outer rubber layers of the first embodiment, but employs a medial layer having a plurality of closely spaced, pneumatically interconnected inflatable hemispheres (or other suitable shape). The inflatable elements may be inflated to any suitable pressure as desired by means of a suitable conventional air pump.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Either of the above embodiments may be configured for installation to one or both sides of a concrete traffic barrier, a/k/a a &#x201c;Jersey wall,&#x201d; or the like, or may be configured to wrap around a vertical column, stanchion, post, or the like, as in a bridge support column, traffic light, sign, or signal, etc. The thickness of the multiple rubber layers, particularly when continued over the top of a traffic barrier from one side of the barrier to the other, enables the material to be cut out and a planter box receptacle or the like to be formed therein. Alternatively, solar panels may be set into the upper surface to charge a conventional storage battery, which may then be used to power lighting set in the side(s) of the cover. A tread pattern may be formed in the outer surface of the outer layer of material when the cover is configured for installation over a concrete traffic barrier. Various means may be used to attach the cover to different traffic structures, depending upon the configuration of the traffic structures.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">These and other features of the present invention will become readily apparent upon further review of the following specification and drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The cushioned cover for traffic structures is a flexible, resilient cover having multiple layers or plies of material. An intermediate layer may have various configurations to provide suitable resilience, and the cover may be configured to attach to or fit over or around various different traffic structures, such as concrete &#x201c;Jersey walls,&#x201d; bridge support columns, stanchions, and other traffic structures.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> of the drawings provides an environmental perspective view of a first embodiment <b>110</b> of a cushioned cover for traffic structures, shown installed upon a concrete traffic barrier or &#x201c;Jersey wall&#x201d; B, the cover <b>110</b> being shown partially broken away in order to show its internal structure. The cover <b>110</b> includes a continuous and unbroken outer layer <b>112</b> and a continuous and unbroken inner layer <b>114</b>, the two layers <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> being preferably formed of a resilient elastomer material, such as natural or synthetic rubber, or a combination of the two. A rubber or elastomer with a relatively high durometer is suitable to provide good durability for the cover <b>110</b>. Such materials as recycled vehicle tires are suitable for the manufacture of the two layers <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> of the cover 10, as the use of such recycled materials provides greater economy of manufacture and is also more environmentally beneficial. The two layers <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> are preferably molded or otherwise formed to conform to the general shape of the Jersey barrier B or other structure to which the cover <b>110</b> is to be applied. The two layers <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> are preferably bonded or otherwise joined to one another along their mutual edges <b>116</b>. The outer layer <b>112</b> may include some form of tread pattern <b>118</b> disposed thereon in any pattern as desired, with an exemplary tread pattern <b>118</b> being shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A large number of closely spaced, solid (i.e., not hollow) resilient elements <b>120</b> are disposed upon the inner layer <b>114</b> and extend outwardly therefrom, i.e., captured between the two layers <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>. Alternatively, the resilient elements <b>120</b> may be attached to an intermediate sheet of resilient material, the intermediate sheet being captured between the outer and inner layers <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>. Such a configuration is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for an alternative resilient intermediate layer. The resilient elements <b>120</b> may each have generally hemispherical configurations, as shown, or may have some other configuration or combination of configurations. The resilient elements <b>120</b> are preferably formed of a somewhat softer and more resilient elastomer than the outer and inner layers <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>, thus allowing the outer layer <b>112</b> to collapse more readily inwardly and to rebound more readily to its original shape when struck by a vehicle. The resilient elements <b>120</b> may be formed of a highly resilient polybutadiene elastomer, such as that used in the manufacture of Superball&#xae; toys, more generically known as &#x201c;bouncy balls.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> of the drawings provides an environmental perspective view of an alternative embodiment of a cushioned cover <b>210</b> for traffic structures, the various layers of the cover <b>210</b> being progressively broken away to show the internal structure thereof. The cushioned cover or cover <b>210</b> is constructed somewhat like the cover <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and discussed above, i.e., having an outer layer <b>212</b> and an inner layer <b>214</b> configured to fit closely over a concrete traffic barrier B or &#x201c;Jersey wall&#x201d; and having their mutual edges <b>216</b> bonded or otherwise secured together. The outer and inner layers <b>212</b> and <b>214</b> may be formed of the same materials as used for the manufacture of the two layers <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> of the first embodiment cushioned cover <b>210</b> discussed further above, i.e., natural or synthetic rubber, which may include recycled rubber from used tires and/or other sources. The outer layer <b>212</b> may include a tread pattern disposed thereon or therein, as in the case of the outer layer <b>112</b> of the embodiment <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Such a tread pattern is optional, and is not shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for clarity in the drawing.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The cushioned cover for traffic structures <b>210</b> includes an intermediate or medial layer <b>218</b> disposed between the outer and inner layers <b>212</b> and <b>214</b>, the medial layer <b>218</b> having a large number of generally hemispherical (or other shape), hollow, pneumatically inflated, resilient cells <b>220</b> disposed thereon. The inflatable cells <b>220</b> are pneumatically interconnected with one another by a pneumatic manifold <b>222</b>, which, in turn, connects to an air valve <b>224</b> extending to the outside of the cover <b>210</b>. Alternatively, each row of cells <b>220</b> may be provided with its own air valve to provide greater adjustability of the air pressure within the cover <b>210</b>. The air valve <b>224</b> allows the cells <b>220</b> to be inflated to any practicable air pressure, depending upon the requirements of the cover <b>210</b> installation. An intermediate cover sheet or ply <b>226</b> may be provided over the medial layer <b>218</b> and its pneumatic cells <b>220</b> and manifold <b>222</b>, the medial layer <b>218</b> and its cover sheet <b>226</b> being sealed or bonded together along their mutual edges <b>228</b>. It will be noted that the edges <b>228</b> of the intermediate layer <b>218</b> and its cover sheet <b>226</b> are separate from the edges <b>216</b> of the outer and inner layers <b>212</b> and <b>214</b>. This allows the medial layer <b>218</b> with its pneumatic cells <b>220</b> and cover sheet <b>226</b> (if installed) to be removed from between the outer and inner layers <b>212</b> and <b>214</b> for repair or replacement, as required.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> are end elevation views in section showing means of positively securing the cushioned covers to a concrete traffic barrier. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the cushioned cover <b>310</b> includes an outer layer <b>312</b> and an inner layer <b>314</b> substantially identical to the corresponding components of the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. The resilient intermediate elements <b>316</b> may comprise solid resilient components, as in the embodiment <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, or may comprise inflatable components, as in the embodiment <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The cushioned cover for traffic structures <b>310</b> is configured to secure over a concrete traffic barrier B, substantially as in the cases of the first two embodiments <b>110</b> and <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. This is accomplished by providing an upper panel <b>318</b> for the outer layer <b>312</b> and an upper panel <b>320</b> for the inner layer <b>314</b>, the two upper panels <b>318</b>, <b>320</b> being bonded or otherwise joined directly to one another, generally as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The two upper panels <b>318</b> and <b>320</b> are configured to drape or otherwise be disposed across or over the upper part of the barrier B, as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a clamp <b>322</b> of unitary, monolithic structure extends across the top of the barrier B and the upper panels <b>318</b> and <b>320</b> of the cushioned cover <b>310</b> to secure the cover <b>310</b> to the barrier B. The clamp <b>322</b> may be formed of a sturdy, slightly resilient plastic material, or as a thinner device formed of spring steel or other suitable material. The jaws of the clamp <b>322</b> may thus be spread slightly to grip the upper panels <b>318</b> and <b>320</b> of the cover <b>310</b> against the upper portion of the barrier B.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a cushioned cover <b>410</b> having substantially the same configuration as the cover <b>310</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, shown installed over a concrete traffic barrier B. The cushioned cover <b>410</b> includes an outer layer <b>412</b> and an inner layer <b>414</b>, substantially identical to the corresponding components of the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref>. The resilient intermediate elements <b>416</b> may comprise solid resilient components as in the embodiment <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, or may comprise inflatable components, as in the embodiment <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The cushioned cover for traffic structures <b>410</b> is configured to secure over a concrete traffic barrier B, substantially as in the cases of the first two embodiments <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, and <b>310</b>, respectively, of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref>. This is accomplished by providing an upper panel <b>418</b> for the outer layer <b>412</b> and an upper panel <b>420</b> for the inner layer <b>414</b>, the two upper panels <b>418</b>, <b>420</b> being bonded or otherwise joined directly to one another, generally as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The two upper panels <b>418</b> and <b>420</b> are configured to drape or otherwise be disposed across or over the upper part of the barrier B, as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a clamp <b>422</b> extends across the top of the barrier B and the upper panels <b>418</b> and <b>420</b> of the cushioned cover <b>410</b> to secure the cover <b>410</b> to the barrier B. The clamp <b>422</b> is generally in the form of a C-clamp or the like, but includes mutually opposed first and second threadably adjustable members <b>424</b><i>a </i>and <b>424</b><i>b</i>. Either or both members <b>424</b><i>a</i>, <b>424</b><i>b </i>may be adjusted to grip the upper panels <b>418</b> and <b>420</b> of the cover <b>410</b> against the upper portion of the barrier B. Alternatively, one of the two adjustable members <b>424</b><i>a </i>or <b>424</b><i>b </i>may be eliminated, and a single adjustable member may be provided to secure the clamp <b>422</b> across the upper portions of the cover <b>410</b> and the underlying barrier B.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> provides an end elevation view in section of an alternative embodiment of a cushioned cover for traffic structures, designated as cover <b>510</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the cover <b>510</b> is configured to cover only one side of the barrier B. Such a configuration may be desirable where such concrete barriers B are placed along the outer edge of the traffic lane(s) to separate the traffic lane(s) from pedestrian traffic and/or other non-motor vehicle environment. In such a case it is not necessary to provide resilient coverage of the side or surface of the barrier B opposite the motor vehicle traffic, and thus the cover <b>510</b> may be manufactured more economically than a two-sided cover. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the cover <b>510</b> has a single-sided outer layer <b>512</b> and a corresponding single-sided inner layer <b>514</b>, and a plurality of intermediate resilient elements <b>516</b> (either solid or pneumatically inflated) captured therebetween. Upper and lower hooks <b>518</b> and <b>520</b> are installed in the concrete barrier B, the cover <b>510</b> having corresponding passages <b>522</b> and <b>524</b> therethrough for installing the cover removably over the hooks. The outer layer <b>512</b> may optionally include an upper panel <b>526</b> (shown in broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) that passes over the top of the barrier B to secure to an opposite upper hook <b>528</b> extending from the opposite upper side of the barrier, as shown in broken lines.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> of the drawings is an environmental perspective view illustrating additional alternative features of the cushioned cover for traffic structures. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, two cushioned covers <b>610</b> are connected together end-to-end over an assembly of concrete barriers B. Each of the covers <b>610</b> includes an outer layer <b>612</b> and inner layer <b>614</b> (seen in edge view to the left end of the assembly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), and an intermediate layer of resilient elements (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, but corresponding to such elements as illustrated in previous drawings). Each of the covers <b>610</b>, or more specifically the outer layers <b>612</b> thereof, has a first end and an opposite second end <b>616</b> and <b>618</b>. Mating connector straps <b>620</b> and <b>622</b> extend from the ends <b>616</b> and <b>618</b> of the outer layer <b>612</b> of each cover <b>610</b>, one of the connector straps having a series of pins or posts extending therefrom and the opposite strap having mating holes or passages. (The various connector straps illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> are shown only generally, and may be adjusted or configured for universal attachment around the end of a barrier B or to an adjacent cover.) The connector straps of adjacent ends of adjacent covers releasably connect to one another to connect the adjacent covers <b>610</b> to one another, generally as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Alternative cover connection means may be provided, e.g., buckles, etc., if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> also illustrates additional alternative features for the cushioned cover <b>610</b>, it being understood that these additional features may optionally be incorporated in one or more of the previously discussed embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</figref>. The upper panel <b>624</b> generally includes at least two thicknesses or layers of material, and is thus relatively thick. Additional plies or layers of material may be provided in the upper panel <b>624</b>, if desired. The resulting thickness is sufficient to allow one or more accessory receptacles <b>626</b> to be formed therein, e.g., for a planter box, as shown in the left side cover of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, or for the installation of one or more solar cells <b>628</b> therein, as shown in the right side cover of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The solar cells <b>628</b> are connected conventionally to appropriate circuitry for charging a conventional electrical storage battery (not shown), the battery providing electrical power to one or more electric lights <b>630</b> disposed in the outer layer <b>612</b> of the cover <b>610</b>. Such lights provide warning and illumination for traffic traveling at night or in dim conditions adjacent to such lighted covers.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates yet another embodiment of a cushioned cover for traffic structures, designated as cover <b>710</b>. The basic structure of the cushioned cover <b>710</b> is generally similar to that of the other covers <b>110</b> through <b>610</b> described further above, incorporating an outer layer <b>712</b>, an inner layer <b>714</b>, and a plurality of intermediate resilient elements (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, but substantially as shown and described for other embodiments). Rather than having an upper extension or panel that extends over the top of a structure, such as a traffic barrier, the cover <b>710</b> has a relatively flat configuration when spread on a planar surface. As in the case of other embodiments, the cover <b>710</b> includes mutually opposed first and second ends <b>716</b> and <b>718</b>, and one or more first connector straps <b>720</b> extending from the first end <b>716</b> and corresponding second connector straps <b>722</b> extending from the outer layer <b>712</b> of the cover adjacent its second end <b>718</b>. The first connector straps <b>720</b> may have a plurality of holes or passages (not shown) therein, with the second connector straps having a corresponding plurality of buttons or posts <b>724</b> extending therefrom. This allows the resilient cover <b>710</b> to be wrapped or secured about a traffic structure, such as a column C, to form a closed, generally cylindrical configuration, the two ends <b>716</b> and <b>718</b> abutting or overlapping one another and the straps <b>720</b> extending from the first end <b>716</b> being releasably secured to the pins or buttons <b>724</b> of the second straps <b>722</b> extending from the opposite second end <b>718</b>.</p>
