<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The numerous innovative teachings of the present application will be described with particular reference to the presently preferred exemplary embodiments. However, it should be understood that this class of embodiments provides only a few examples of the many advantageous uses of the innovative teachings herein. In general, statements made in the specification of the present application do not necessarily limit any of the various claimed systems, methods or computer-readable media. Moreover, some statements may apply to some inventive features but not to others.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a particular embodiment of a set-top box device <b>102</b>. The set-top box device <b>102</b> includes processing logic <b>104</b> and memory <b>106</b> accessible to the processing logic <b>104</b>. The set-top box device <b>102</b> also includes a network interface <b>108</b> that is adapted to facilitate communication between the set-top box device <b>102</b> and a video head-end (VHE) <b>152</b> associated with a television service provider via an access network <b>150</b>, such as a cable network, satellite network or Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) network. In addition, the set-top box device <b>102</b> includes a display interface <b>110</b> adapted to facilitate communication between the set-top box device <b>102</b> and a display device, such as the television <b>112</b>. The set-top box device <b>102</b> also includes a remote interface <b>114</b> that is adapted to communicate with a remote control device <b>116</b>. Further, the set-top box device <b>102</b> can include a digital video recorder (DVR) <b>109</b>. In alternative embodiments, the set-top box device <b>102</b> can be coupled to an external DVR.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a particular embodiment, the memory <b>106</b> includes a plurality of modules <b>124</b>-<b>134</b>. The modules <b>124</b>-<b>134</b> can include computer instructions that are readable and executable by the processing logic <b>104</b> to implement various functions of the set-top box device <b>102</b> with respect to applying user profiles. For example, the modules <b>124</b>-<b>134</b> can represent various aspects of one or more software applications, operating systems, or other computer programs. In other embodiments, the modules <b>124</b>-<b>134</b> can be implemented as hardware logic or a combination of hardware logic and computer instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The memory <b>106</b> includes a profile module <b>124</b> that is executable by the processing logic <b>104</b> to receive and store data associated with a plurality of user profiles. The plurality of user profiles includes a default profile and at least one supplemental profile, such as a vacation profile, a holiday profile, a weekend profile, a weekday profile, a daytime profile, a prime time profile, a night profile, another time-based profile, or any combination thereof. In one example, the profile module <b>124</b> is executable by the processing logic <b>104</b> to provide a graphical user interface (GUI) at the display device <b>112</b> and to receive profile data from a user via the GUI. Examples of GUIs that are adapted to receive profile data from a user are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7-8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Profile data can include, for example, data indicating one or more channels that are restricted for viewing; data indicating one or more channels that are not restricted for viewing; data indicating whether electronic program guide (EPG) data is to be restricted based on channel restrictions; data indicating whether recommendations of television content are to be provided; data indicating whether recommendations of television content are to be restricted based on channel restrictions; data indicating one or more television programs to be recorded; data indicating one or more restricted genres of television content; data indicating one or more restricted television content ratings; or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In addition, the profile data includes data indicating one or more times at which each supplemental profile is to be applied to one or more actions of the set-top box device, such as recording television content, providing EPGs in response to EPG requests, restricting television content, providing television content recommendations, responding to channel requests, other actions, or any combination thereof. Such times can include a start time and an end time associated with each supplemental profile, such as a start time and en end time corresponding to a recurrent time period, such as a daily, weekly, monthly, or annual time period; a non-recurrent time period; or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The memory <b>106</b> includes a time module <b>126</b> that is executable by the processing logic <b>104</b> to determine whether a starting time associated with a supplemental profile has occurred, such as a particular day, date, other time, or any combination thereof, and to make the supplemental profile active when the starting time has occurred. Additionally, the time module <b>126</b> is executable by the processing logic <b>104</b> to determine whether a starting time associated with a supplemental profile has occurred and to automatically make a default profile active when the end time has occurred. Alternatively, when the end time of a first supplemental profile coincides with a start time of a second supplemental profile, the time module <b>126</b> is executable by the processing logic <b>104</b> to make the second supplemental profile active when the end time of the first supplemental profile has occurred. The set-top box device <b>102</b> is adapted to apply an active profile to one or more set-top box actions according to information included in the active profile.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an illustrative embodiment, the memory <b>106</b> includes a DVR module <b>128</b> that is executable by the processing logic <b>104</b> to record television content indicated by an active profile at the DVR <b>109</b> or at a DVR that is external to the set-top box device <b>102</b>. For example, the DVR module <b>128</b> can be executable by the processing logic <b>104</b> to record one or more television programs indicated by a default profile until a supplemental profile becomes active (i.e., a start time associated with the supplemental profile occurs). The DVR module <b>128</b> is executable by the processing logic <b>104</b> to record one or more television programs indicated by the supplemental profile after the start time occurs and to not record any television programs that are not indicated by the supplemental profile while the supplemental profile is active. The DVR module <b>128</b> is executable by the processing logic <b>104</b> to automatically record the television program(s) indicated by the default profile when the supplemental profile is no longer active (i.e., after the end time associated with the supplemental profile occurs). Alternatively, when the end time of a first supplemental profile coincides with a start time of a second supplemental profile, the DVR module <b>128</b> is executable by the processing logic <b>104</b> to record one or more television programs indicated by the second supplemental profile until an end time associated with the second supplemental profile occurs.</p>
