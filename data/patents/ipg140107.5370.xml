<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a reversible permeability measuring device, and more particularly, to a reversible permeability measuring device for measuring magnetic characteristics and magnetic flux change in a specimen, as one of a plurality of non-destructive methods for evaluating mechanical properties.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Since mechanical properties of structural steel, turbine rotor steel, or the like, are associated with magnetic characteristics, the mechanical properties are evaluated by non-destructively measuring magnetic characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A coil used for a magnetic characteristic measuring device for measuring the magnetic characteristics is largely classified into a surface type probe measuring the change in a magnetic flux generated from a specimen by vertically disposing a coil on a surface of a specimen to be measured and an encircling type probe winding a coil around a round bar or a flake type specimen. The former is used to measure Barkhausen noise (BN) or harmonics and the latter is used to measure a magnetic hysteresis curve in addition to the BN or the harmonics. Among others, the former is usefully used for the magnetic evaluation of a non-destructively operated material.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An example of the reversible permeability measuring device was disclosed in paper &#x201c;Nondestructive evaluation of aged 1Cr-1Mo-0.25V steel by harmonic analysis of induced voltage&#x201d; (JMMM, Volume 231, 2001. 3) published in Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials by the inventors.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The paper defines the correlation capable of measuring Vickers hardness, yield strength, and tensile strength, all of which are mechanical properties of artificially deteriorated 1Cr-1Mo-0.225V steel, non-destructively measuring reversible permeability that is a primary harmonic of an AC magnetic field with the surface type probe, and inferring mechanical properties with a coercive force that is &#xbd; of a peak interval of reversible magnetic permeability.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A system of measuring reversible permeability with the surface type probe used in the paper was shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The surface type probe is manufactured by winding a pick up coil to a yoke and then, winding an AC driving coil and a DC driving coil thereto. Meanwhile, a direct current is applied by power-amplifying a function generated from an I/O acquisition board with a power amplifier and an AC magnetic field applies a function generated from a function generator. The reversible permeability induced to the pick up coil is measured by a lock-in amplifier using a frequency of the AC magnetic field as a reference signal and values read by a shunt and the lock-in amplifier are measured through an input side of the I/O acquisition board and are then processed as data in a computer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The magnetic characteristic measuring device having the above-mentioned structure uses a manner that obtains current from the voltage measured in the shunt to indirectly calculate a magnetic field H through the following Equation 1.</p>

<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The correlation capable of inferring the mechanical properties with a coercive force that is &#xbd; of a peak interval of reversible magnetic permeability (PIRMP) using the magnetic characteristic measuring device having the above-mentioned structure is obtained, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In this case, the measurement of the coercive force that is &#xbd; of the peak interval of reversible magnetic permeability (PIRMP) is made as shown in a graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.

<p id="p-0028" num="0033">The surface type probe <b>10</b> is configured to include the DC driving coil <b>11</b>, the AC driving coil <b>12</b>, the pick up coil <b>13</b>, and the yoke <b>14</b> wound with the coils <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, and <b>13</b>, wherein the pick up coil <b>13</b>, the AC driving coil <b>12</b>, and the DC driving coil <b>11</b> are sequentially wound from the inner side of the yoke <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0034">The DC driving coil <b>11</b> is wound to the outermost side of the yoke <b>14</b> and applies the DC magnetic field. In this case, the applied DC magnetic field is applied through the power amplifier <b>70</b> in the DC magnetic field function applied from the I/O acquisition board.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0035">The AC driving coil <b>12</b> is wound to the inner side of the DC driving coil <b>11</b> and serves to induce the AC perturbing magnetic field to the applied DC magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0036">The pick up coil <b>13</b> is wound to the inner side of the AC driving coil <b>12</b> and detects the DC magnetic field and the reversible permeability of the specimen induced by the AC perturbing magnetic field by the lock-in amplifier <b>40</b> using the frequency of the AC perturbing magnetic field as the reference signal.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0037">The yoke <b>14</b> is wound with the coils <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, and <b>13</b> and spaces the specimen <b>1</b> from the coils <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, and <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0038">The magnetic potentiometer <b>20</b> is provided in the inner side of the surface type probe <b>10</b> and serves to detect the magnetic field induced from the surface of the specimen <b>1</b>. In this case, the magnetic potentiometer <b>20</b> may be provided in the inner side of the yoke <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0039">The function generator <b>30</b> serves to apply the AC magnetic field function to the AC driving coil <b>12</b>. The DC magnetic field applied from the DC driving coil <b>11</b> applies the AC magnetic field from the AC function generator <b>30</b> to induce the AC perturbing magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0040">The lock-in amplifier serves to measure the reversible permeability of the specimen induced to the pick up coil <b>13</b> using the frequency of the AC magnetic field function as the reference signal.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0041">The fluxmeter <b>50</b> serves to directly measure the magnetic field induced from the surface of the specimen <b>1</b> detected from the magnetic potentiometer <b>20</b>. Therefore, when the magnetic field H generated from the surface of the specimen is calculated, the related art calculates the magnetic field generated from the surface of the specimen through the indirect calculation manner rather than through the direct calculation manner, while the present invention directly measures the magnetic field generated from the surface of the specimen, thereby making it possible to obtain the accurate measured values and improve the reliability of deterioration evaluation on materials.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0042">The I/O acquisition board <b>60</b> applies the DC magnetic field function to the DC driving coil <b>11</b> and applies the reversible permeability induced to the pick up coil <b>13</b> and the reversible permeability induced from the surface of the specimen <b>1</b> measured in the fluxmeter <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0043">The power amplifier <b>70</b> serves to apply power in the function applied from the I/O acquisition board <b>60</b> to the DC driving coil <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0044">The microcomputer <b>80</b> directly calculates the reversible permeability induced to the pick up coil <b>13</b>, which is input to the I/O acquisition board <b>60</b>, and the magnetic field induced from the surface of the specimen <b>1</b> measured in the fluxmeter <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a graph measuring the reversible permeability using the reversible permeability measuring device according to the present invention, wherein the reversible permeability of the specimen is measured according to the change in DC magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0046">As shown, it can be appreciated that the graph has result values of the left and right symmetrical structure. As such, as the graph has the left and right symmetrical structure, the coercive force that is &#xbd; of the peak interval of reversible magnetic permeability (PIRMP) can be more accurately measured and the mechanical properties can be more accurately inferred.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0047">The present invention improves the problem in that the measured value of the magnetic field is inaccurate and the reliability of deterioration evaluation on materials is degraded, due to the magnetic field H calculated by the indirect calculation manner. That is, the present invention directly measures the magnetic field generated on the surface of the specimen by using the magnetic potentiometer and the fluxmeter, thereby making it possible to more accurately evaluate the deterioration of the material.</p>
