<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This U.S. non-provisional patent application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2011-0024428, filed on Mar. 18, 2011, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Various embodiments described herein relate generally to semiconductor devices and methods of fabricating the same. More particularly, various embodiments described herein relate to semiconductor devices that can provide improved p-type metal-oxide-semiconductor (PMOS) performance, and methods of fabricating the same.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">With increasing demand for high speed semiconductor devices, a metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) including a high-k gate insulating layer and a metal gate electrode has been extensively studied. Recently, a way of changing a crystal structure of a channel region of MOSFET has been proposed, using tensile and/or compressive stress layers, so as to improve an electric characteristic of MOSFET. However, there have been some technical difficulties in enhancing the electric characteristics for both types of MOSFET (i.e., n- and p-type MOSFETs).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various embodiments described herein can provide semiconductor devices with improved PMOS performance.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various other embodiments described herein can provide methods of fabricating semiconductor devices with improved PMOS performance.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to various embodiments described herein, a method of fabricating a semiconductor device may include providing a substrate including a silicon channel layer and a silicon-germanium channel layer, forming gate structures disposed on the silicon channel layer and the silicon-germanium channel layer, respectively, forming a first protection layer on the substrate, including on the gate structures, and injecting hydrogen and/or an isotope thereof into the silicon-germanium channel layer.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, the first protection layer may comprise a tensile material.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the injecting of hydrogen and/or an isotope thereof may be followed by the forming of the first protection layer. In other embodiments, the injecting of hydrogen and/or an isotope thereof may follow the forming of the first protection layer.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In yet other embodiments, the injecting of hydrogen and/or an isotope thereof may be performed by a chemical vapor deposition in which a process gas includes the hydrogen and/or the isotope thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In even other embodiments, the injecting of hydrogen and/or an isotope thereof may include forming a second protection layer on the gate structures, wherein the first and second protection layers comprise tensile materials. For instance, the first and second protection layers may comprise silicon nitride, and the second protection layer may have a greater process-induced charging property than the first protection layer.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In still further embodiments, before forming the first protection layer, the methods may further include forming gate spacers on sidewalls of the gate structures to spatially separate the first protection layer from the sidewalls of the gate structures.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In yet further embodiments, the forming of the gate structures may include forming a metal oxide layer on the substrate, forming a metal layer on the metal oxide layer, and patterning the metal layer to form a metal gate electrode crossing over the silicon channel layer or the silicon-germanium channel layer.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to various other embodiments described herein, a semiconductor device may include an n-type MOS (NMOS) transistor including a channel layer and a gate structure on the channel layer and a PMOS transistor including a channel layer and a gate structure on the channel layer. The channel layers of the NMOS and PMOS transistors may have channel directions of &#x3c;100&#x3e;. The channel layer of the NMOS transistor may comprise silicon, and the channel layer of the PMOS transistor may comprise silicon-germanium that includes therein hydrogen and/or an isotope thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the device may further include a first protection layer on the NMOS and PMOS transistors including the gate structures, and the first protection layer comprises a tensile material.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In other embodiments, the device may further include a second protection layer on the first protection layer. Here, the second protection layer may comprise a material having a higher content of hydrogen and/or an isotope thereof than the first protection layer. In other embodiments, the second protection layer may comprise a material having a greater process-induced charging property than the first protection layer.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In still other embodiments, the first and second protection layers may comprise tensile materials.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In yet other embodiments, the device may further include gate spacers disposed on sidewalls of the gate structures of the NMOS and PMOS transistors, respectively, to spatially separate the first protection layer from the sidewalls of the gate structures. The gate spacer may comprise silicon oxide, silicon nitride and/or silicon oxynitride.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In even other embodiments, the gate structure may include a metal gate electrode including a metallic material and a metal oxide layer interposed between the metal gate electrode and the channel region.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to various other embodiments described herein, a semiconductor device comprises a PMOS transistor including a channel layer and a gate structure on the channel layer. The channel layer of the PMOS transistor comprises silicon-germanium, and includes therein hydrogen and/or an isotope thereof. Thus, various embodiments described herein may apply to PMOS transistors independent of their combination with NMOS transistors. These embodiments may also include a first protection layer, a second protection layer and/or gate spacers, as described above.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;connected&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; to another element, it can be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly connected&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled&#x201d; to another element, there are no intervening elements present. Other words used to describe the relationship between elements or layers should be interpreted in a like fashion (e.g., &#x201c;between&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly between,&#x201d; &#x201c;adjacent&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly adjacent,&#x201d; &#x201c;on&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly on&#x201d;). As used herein the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">It will be understood that, although the terms &#x201c;first&#x201d;, &#x201c;second&#x201d;, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another element, component, region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of example embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements or features would then be oriented &#x201c;above&#x201d; the other elements or features. Thus, the exemplary term &#x201c;below&#x201d; can encompass both an orientation of above and below. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of example embodiments. As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Various embodiments described herein are described herein with reference to cross-sectional illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments (and intermediate structures) of example embodiments. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, example embodiments of the inventive concepts should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, an implanted region illustrated as a rectangle may have rounded or curved features and/or a gradient of implant concentration at its edges rather than a binary change from implanted to non-implanted region. Likewise, a buried region formed by implantation may result in some implantation in the region between the buried region and the surface through which the implantation takes place. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the actual shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of various embodiments described herein.</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</figref> are sectional views illustrating methods of fabricating a semiconductor device according to various embodiments described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a PMOS channel layer <b>110</b> may be formed on a PMOS region of a substrate <b>100</b> that is divided into NMOS and PMOS regions. The semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> may include a single element and/or compound semiconductor material in bulk wafer and/or epitaxial layer form. The substrate <b>100</b> may be formed of a single-crystalline silicon layer. For instance, the substrate <b>100</b> may be provided as a silicon wafer or a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer. In some embodiments, the PMOS channel layer <b>110</b> may be an epitaxial layer grown on the substrate <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The PMOS channel layer <b>110</b> may be a silicon germanium layer, which is grown from silicon atoms of the substrate <b>100</b> using an epitaxial technique, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. As a result, a lattice structure of the PMOS channel layer <b>110</b> may be determined by a lattice structure of the substrate <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the PMOS channel layer <b>110</b> may include about 30 atomic percent germanium. Meanwhile, the PMOS channel layer <b>110</b> may include dangling bonds that can deteriorate electrical properties of a channel region, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. According to various embodiments described herein, the number of the dangling bonds can be effectively reduced by a hydrogen injection process, which will be described, for example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The substrate <b>100</b> may further include a NMOS region, in which NMOS field effect transistors (FETs) are disposed. As noted above, the PMOS channel layer <b>110</b> may comprise a silicon germanium layer. Furthermore, the PMOS channel layer <b>110</b> may be locally formed on the PMOS region to expose the NMOS region of the substrate <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the PMOS channel layer <b>110</b> may be formed using a selective epitaxial technique such that it can be prevented from being formed on the NMOS region. In other embodiments, the PMOS channel layer <b>110</b> may be entirely formed on the substrate <b>100</b> using an epitaxial or deposition technique and partially removed from the NMOS region to expose a top surface of the substrate <b>100</b> thereunder.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a gate insulating layer <b>120</b>, a lower gate layer <b>130</b> and an upper gate layer <b>140</b> may be sequentially formed on the resultant structure including the PMOS channel layer <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The gate insulating layer <b>120</b> may be in direct contact with a top surface of the substrate <b>100</b> in the NMOS region and with a top surface of the PMOS channel layer <b>110</b> in the PMOS region.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The gate insulating layer <b>120</b> may comprise at least one oxide. The gate insulating layer <b>120</b> may comprise an insulating material having a higher dielectric constant than silicon oxide, commonly referred to as a &#x201c;high-k&#x201d; material. In some embodiments, the gate insulating layer <b>120</b> may include a metal oxide (for instance, hafnium oxide).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The lower gate layer <b>130</b> may include metallic materials. For instance, the lower gate layer <b>130</b> may include tantalum nitride (TaN), titanium nitride (TiN), tungsten (W), tungsten nitride (WN), molybdenum nitride (MoN), molybdenum aluminum nitride (MoAlN), platinum (Pt), nickel (Ni), ruthenium (Ru), titanium aluminum nitride (TiAlN), tantalum carbide (TaC), tantalum silicon nitride (TaSiN), and/or titanium aluminide (TiAl).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, the lower gate layer <b>130</b> on the NMOS region may comprise a different material from that of the PMOS region. In other embodiments, the lower gate layer <b>130</b> on the NMOS region may comprise the same material as that of the PMOS region.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The upper gate layer <b>140</b> may include at least one conductive material. For example, the upper gate layer <b>140</b> may comprise a doped or un-doped silicon layer.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, gate structures GS may be formed on the substrate <b>100</b> and source and drain regions S/D may be formed in the substrate <b>100</b>. The gate structure GS may include an upper gate electrode <b>145</b> and a lower gate electrode <b>135</b>, which may be formed by pattering the upper gate layer <b>140</b> and the lower gate layer <b>130</b>. The source and drain regions S/D may be formed by an ion implantation process using the gate structure GS as an ion implantation mask. In other words, the source and drain regions S/D may be formed in the substrate <b>100</b> at both sides of the gate structure GS, respectively, and a channel region CH may be defined in a portion, below the gate structure GS, of the substrate <b>100</b> (i.e., between the source and drain regions S/D).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, the gate structure GS may further include a gate insulating layer pattern <b>125</b>, which may be formed by patterning the gate insulating layer <b>120</b>. For example, the formation of the gate structure GS may include etching the upper gate layer <b>140</b>, the lower gate layer <b>130</b>, and the gate insulating layer <b>120</b>, sequentially and anisotropically, using the same etch mask. In this case, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the upper gate electrode <b>145</b>, the lower gate electrode <b>135</b>, and the gate insulating layer pattern <b>125</b> may be formed to have sidewalls aligned with each other. In other words, the sidewalls thereof may be substantially coplanar with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, the PMOS channel layer <b>110</b> may be etched during the formation of the gate structure GS. In this case, a localized PMOS channel pattern <b>115</b> may be formed below the gate structure GS. In other embodiments, the PMOS channel pattern <b>115</b> may remain on the source and drain regions S/D.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some modified embodiments, after the formation of the gate structure GS, gate spacers <b>155</b> may be formed on sidewalls of the gate structure GS. The PMOS channel pattern <b>115</b> may be localized during the formation of the gate spacers <b>155</b>. For instance, the PMOS channel pattern <b>115</b> may include an extended portion (not shown) interposed between the gate spacer <b>155</b> and the substrate <b>100</b>. The gate spacers <b>155</b> may comprise silicon oxide, silicon nitride and/or silicon oxynitride.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The source and drain regions S/D may be formed by an ion implantation process using the gate spacer <b>155</b> as an ion implantation mask. For instance, the formation of the source and drain regions S/D may include first and second ion implantation processes performed before and after the formation of the gate spacer <b>155</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The source and drain regions S/D in the NMOS region may have a different conductivity type from the source and drain regions S/D in the PMOS region. For instance, the source and drain regions S/D may be p-type in the PMOS region and n-type in the NMOS region. The PMOS channel pattern <b>115</b> may have the same conductivity type as a portion of the substrate <b>100</b> disposed thereunder but may have a different conductivity type from the source and drain region S/D disposed adjacent thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Meanwhile, the gate structure GS may be patterned in such a way that the channel region CH defined by the gate structure GS can be oriented along a &#x3c;100&#x3e; direction. For example, the gate structure GS or the channel region CH may be formed on a 45 degree rotated wafer or substrate. In other words, the PMOS and NMOS transistors may be formed with a &#x3c;100&#x3e; crystal channel orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a first protection layer <b>160</b> may be formed on the resultant structure provided with the source and drain regions S/D. The first protection layer <b>160</b> may comprise a tensile material. For instance, the first protection layer <b>160</b> may include a material with a tensile stress of about 0.5 GPa to about 3 GPa. In some embodiments, the first protection layer <b>160</b> may be a single layer structure, not a multilayer structure. For instance, the first protection layer <b>160</b> may be a single layer of silicon nitride.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the case that the first protection layer <b>160</b> comprises a tensile material, a tensile stress may be applied to the channel regions CH of the NMOS and PMOS regions. A carrier mobility in the channel region CH of the NMOS region can be improved by the tensile stress, while the PMOS region may be insensitive to the tensile stress.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The first protection layer <b>160</b> may reduce or prevent elements or layers located therebelow from being damaged during a subsequent process of forming a contact hole. For instance, in the case that the first protection layer <b>160</b> comprises silicon nitride, it may have an etch selectivity with respect to silicon oxide, which may be conventionally used as an interlayer dielectric. Thus, the contact hole penetrating the interlayer dielectric can be formed to expose the source and drain regions S/D or the gate structures GS, which are disposed below the first protection layer <b>160</b>, without an excessive etch damage.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, after the formation of the first protection layer <b>160</b>, a hydrogen injection process HIP may be performed to inject hydrogen (H) and/or an isotope thereof, such as deuterium (D) into the PMOS channel pattern <b>115</b>. For instance, a process gas containing hydrogen or deuterium may be used for the hydrogen injection process HIP.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the hydrogen and/or its isotopes may fill at least some vacant sites of the PMOS channel pattern <b>115</b>. This enables a reduction of the number of dangling bonds that may exist in the PMOS channel pattern <b>115</b>. In other words, after the hydrogen injection process HIP, the PMOS channel pattern <b>115</b> may comprise a silicon-germanium layer containing hydrogen and/or an isotope thereof. In some embodiments, a hydrogen and/or its isotope content in the PMOS channel pattern <b>115</b> may be in a range of about 0.001 atomic percent to about 1 atomic percent.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In addition, the hydrogen injection process HIP may be performed under a plasma or thermal environment. In certain embodiments, the hydrogen injection process HIP may be performed under a process condition that can reduce or prevent an additional layer from being formed on the first protection layer <b>160</b>. For example, the hydrogen injection process HIP may be performed without source gases used to deposit such additional layer. Thus, a carrier gas may be supplied on the resultant structure provided with the first protection layer <b>160</b>, along with the hydrogen or its isotopes during the hydrogen injection process HIP.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In other embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a second protection layer <b>170</b> may be formed on the first protection layer <b>160</b> during the hydrogen injection process HIP. For instance, the second protection layer <b>170</b> may be formed by a chemical vapor deposition technique using a process gas containing hydrogen and/or its isotopes. In other words, the hydrogen injection process HIP may serve as a part of a chemical vapor deposition process for forming the second protection layer <b>170</b>. In this case, the second protection layer <b>170</b> may have a higher hydrogen and/or deuterium content, compared with the first protection layer <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">According to various embodiments described herein, the hydrogen and/or its isotope included in the PMOS channel pattern <b>115</b> may be originated from a hydrogen and/or its isotope containing process gas that is supplied during the formation of the second protection layer <b>170</b>, rather than from a hydrogen or its isotope included in the second protection layer <b>170</b> after the formation of the second protection layer <b>170</b>. The plasma or thermal environment produced during the chemical vapor deposition process may facilitate the diffusion or infiltration of hydrogen and/or deuterium into the PMOS channel pattern <b>115</b>. As a result, hydrogen and/or its isotopes can be easily diffused or infiltrated into the PMOS channel pattern <b>115</b>, compared with when the deposited second protection layer <b>170</b> is used as a source of hydrogen or its isotopes.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The second protection layer <b>170</b> may comprise at least one tensile material. For example, the second protection layer <b>170</b> may include a material with a tensile stress of about 0.5 GPa to about 3 GPa. Thus, a resulting force of tensile stresses from the first and second protection layers <b>160</b> and <b>170</b> may be exerted on the channel region CH. In some embodiments, the first protection layer <b>160</b> may be three to ten times thicker than the second protection layer <b>170</b>. However, various embodiments described herein may not be limited thereto; for instance, the first protection layer <b>160</b> may be thinner than the second protection layer <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">According to various embodiments described herein, the gate spacers <b>155</b> may be also formed of at least one tensile material. For instance, in some embodiments, the gate spacers <b>155</b> and the first and second protection layers <b>160</b> and <b>170</b> may be formed of tensile materials.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a sectional view illustrating methods of fabricating a semiconductor device according to various other embodiments described herein, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a sectional view illustrating methods of fabricating a semiconductor device according to various other embodiments described herein. For concise description, overlapping description of elements previously described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 8</figref> may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In various embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the hydrogen injection process HIP may be performed before the formation of the first protection layer <b>160</b>. In other words, hydrogen and/or its isotopes supplied during the hydrogen injection process HIP can be diffused or infiltrated into the PMOS channel pattern <b>115</b> without being blocked by the first protection layer <b>160</b> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 8</figref>. Accordingly, in the present embodiments, the hydrogen injection process HIP can be performed under an alleviated or soft plasma or thermal environment.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some modified embodiments, the hydrogen injection process HIP may serve as a part of a process for forming the gate spacer <b>155</b>. For example, the gate spacer <b>155</b> may be formed by anisotropically etching a gate spacer layer (not shown) conformally covering the gate structure GS, and the hydrogen injection process HIP may be performed as a part of a deposition process for forming the gate spacer layer. Alternatively, the anisotropic etching of the gate spacer layer may be performed in a dry etching manner using plasma, and the hydrogen injection process HIP may be performed by supplying hydrogen and/or its isotopes as a part of a process gas of the dry etching process.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, according to these embodiments, the hydrogen injection process HIP may be performed before the formation of the first protection layer <b>160</b> as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, but a second protection layer <b>170</b> may be formed between the gate spacer <b>155</b> and the first protection layer <b>160</b> during the hydrogen injection process HIP. As shown, the second protection layer <b>170</b> may be thinner than the first protection layer <b>160</b>. For instance, a thickness ratio of the second protection layer <b>170</b> to the first protection layer <b>160</b> may be about 1:3 to about 1:10. However, various embodiments described herein may not be limited thereto; for instance, the second protection layer <b>170</b> may be thicker than the first protection layer <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> are graphs showing experimental results related to the first and second protection layers <b>160</b> and <b>170</b> of a semiconductor device according to various embodiments described herein. In more detail, first and second layers were formed on a substrate and the interfacial properties thereof were measured, where the first layer was a silicon nitride layer that does not undergo the aforementioned hydrogen injection process HIP and the second layer was a silicon nitride layer formed by a deposition process including the aforementioned hydrogen injection process HIP. In other words, the first layer and the second layer corresponded to the first and second protection layer <b>160</b> and <b>170</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows an experimental result obtained by measuring a plasma damage monitor (PDM) voltage, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows an experiment result obtained by measuring a defect density at interfaces between the respective first and second layer and the underlying layer. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, the reference numerals M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> denote measurement data obtained from the first layer and the second layer, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The PDM voltage for a specific layer increases with increasing of a charging effect or a process-induced charging property, which may occur during the formation of the layer. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the second layer exhibited a higher PDM voltage than the first layer. In other words, the second layer exhibited an increased process-induced charging property compared with the first layer. This result shows that the hydrogen injection process HIP can contribute to produce more ions.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a defect density was lower in experiments of the second layer than in experiments of the first layer. This result shows that interfacial defects (e.g., dangling bonds) can be effectively reduced or removed by a layer-forming process including the hydrogen injection process HIP.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> are graphs showing electric characteristics of a semiconductor device according to various embodiments described herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> show electric currents measured from NMOS and PMOS FETs, respectively, where vertical and horizontal axes represent off- and on-currents, I<sub>off </sub>and I<sub>on </sub>respectively.

In other words, the reference numeral M<b>3</b> denotes data obtained from samples, which did not undergo the hydrogen injection process HIP.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">For NMOS FETs, there was no meaningful difference in an electric current property, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. However, for PMOS FETs, samples M<b>4</b>, which underwent the hydrogen injection process, exhibited an improved electric current property, compared with other samples M<b>3</b>, which did not undergo the hydrogen injection process, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. In more detail, at the same off-current (I<sub>off</sub>), the samples denoted by the reference numeral M<b>4</b> exhibited a 12% increase in an on-current (I<sub>on</sub>), compared with the samples denoted by the reference numeral M<b>3</b>. From these experiment results, it can be seen that the hydrogen injection process HIP contributes to improve the electric current property of a PMOS FET.</p>
