<p id="p-0003" num="0001">The invention relates to a novel fused aromatic derivative which is useful as a material for an organic electroluminescence device, and an organic electroluminescence device using the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">An organic electroluminescence device (hereinafter the term &#x201c;electroluminescence&#x201d; is often abbreviated as &#x201c;EL&#x201d;) is a self-emission device utilizing the principle that an emission material emits light by the recombination energy of holes injected from an anode and electrons injected from a cathode when an electric field is impressed.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">An organic EL device has made a remarkable progress. In addition, since an organic EL device has characteristics such as low voltage driving, high luminance, variety in emission wavelength, high response and capability of fabricating a thin and lightweight emitting device, its application to a wide range of fields is expected.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">Emission materials used in an organic EL device have conventionally been studied actively since they influence largely the color of light emitted by a device or on emission life.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">As the emission material, a chelate complex such as tris(8-quinolinolato)aluminum complex, a coumarin derivative, a tetraphenylbutadiene derivative, a bisstyrylarylene derivative and an oxadiazole derivative are known. By using such emission materials, emission in a visible range from blue to red can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">Use of a phosphorescent compound as an emission material for utilizing triplet energy for emission has been studied. For example, it is known that an organic EL device using an iridium complex as an emission material exhibits a high luminous efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">An organic EL device using polyphenylene vinylene (PPV) as a conjugated polymer is known. In this device, PPV is applied and formed into a single film and this device is confirmed to emit light.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008">In Patent Document 1, an anthracene derivative is used as a material for an organic EL device.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">In Patent Document 2, a compound having a triphenyl group is used as a material for an organic EL device.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0010">In patent Document 3, an aminoanthryl derivative is used as a material for an organic EL device.

<p id="h-0038" num="0000">(ii) Transporting function: function of moving injected carriers (electrons and holes) due to the force of an electric field</p>
<p id="h-0039" num="0000">(iii) Emission function: function of recombining electrons and holes to emit light</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0145">As the method of forming the emitting layer, a known method such as deposition, spin coating, or an LB method may be applied. It is preferable that the emitting layer be a molecular deposition film. The molecular deposition film is a film formed by deposition of a material compound in a gas phase, or by solidification of a material compound in the form of a solution or in a liquid phase. The molecular deposition film can be usually distinguished from a thin film (molecular accumulation film) formed using the LB method by the difference in aggregation structure or higher order structure or the difference in function due to the difference in structure.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0146">The emitting layer may also be formed by dissolving a binder such as a resin and a material compound in a solvent to obtain a solution, and forming a thin film from the solution by spin coating or the like.</p>

Preferable ligands include compounds having a phenylpyridine skeleton, a bipyridyl skeleton or a phenanthroline skeleton, 2-phenylpyridine, 7,8-benzoquinoline, 2-(2-thienyl)pyridine, 2-(1-naphthyl)pyridine and 2-phenylquinoline derivatives. These ligands may have a substituent, if necessary. Ligands to which fluorides, e.g. a trifluoromethyl group, being introduced as a substituent are particularly preferable as a blue dopant. As an auxiliary ligand, preferred are ligands other than the above-mentioned ligands, such as acetylacetonate and picric acid may be contained.</p>

When the content of a phosphorescent compound is less than 0.1 mass %, emission may be weak and the advantages thereof may not be sufficiently obtained. When the content exceeds 70 mass %, the phenomenon called concentration quenching may significantly proceed, thereby degrading the device performance.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0153">As for the fluorescent dopant, it is preferable to select a compound from amine-based compounds, aromatic compounds, chelate complexes such as tris(8-quinolilate)aluminum complexes, coumarin derivatives, tetraphenylbutadiene derivatives, bisstyrylarylene derivatives, oxadiazole derivatives or the like, taking into consideration required emission colors. Of these, styrylamine compounds, styryldiamine compounds, arylamine compounds and aryldiamine compounds are further preferable. Fused polycyclic aromatic compounds which are not an amine compound are also preferable. These fluorescent dopants may be used singly or in combination of two or more. The content of a fluorescent dopant in the emitting layer is not particularly limited and can be appropriately selected according to purposes; for example, it is 0.1 to 70 mass %, preferably 1 to 30 mass %.</p>

<p id="p-0204" num="0205">A preferred embodiment of the organic EL device is a device containing a reducing dopant in an electron-transferring region or in an interfacial region between a cathode and an organic layer. The reducing dopant is defined as a substance which can reduce an electron-transferring compound. Accordingly, various substances which have given reducing properties can be used. For example, at least one substance can be preferably used which is selected from the group consisting of alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, rare earth metals, alkali metal oxides, alkali metal halides, alkaline earth metal oxides, alkaline earth metal halides, rare earth metal oxides, rare earth metal halides, alkali metal carbonates, alkaline earth metal carbonates, rare earth metal carbonates, alkali metal organic complexes, alkaline earth metal organic complexes, and rare earth metal organic complexes.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0206">More specific examples of the preferred reducing dopants include at least one alkali metal selected from the group consisting of Na (work function: 2.36 eV), K (work function: 2.28 eV), Rb (work function: 2.16 eV) and Cs (work function: 1.95 eV), and at least one alkaline earth metal selected from the group consisting of Ca (work function: 2.9 eV), Sr (work function: 2.0 to 2.5 eV), and Ba (work function: 2.52 eV). Metals having a work function of 2.9 eV or less are particularly preferred. Among these, a more preferable reducing dopant is at least one alkali metal selected from the group consisting of K, Rb and Cs. Even more preferable is Rb or Cs. Most preferable is Cs. These alkali metals are particularly high in reducing ability. Thus, the addition of a relatively small amount thereof to an electron-injecting zone improves the luminance of the organic EL device and make the lifetime thereof long. As a reducing agent having a work function of 2.9 eV or less, combinations of two or more alkali metals are preferable, particularly combinations including Cs, such as Cs and Na, Cs and K, Cs and Rb, or Cs, Na and K are preferable. The combination containing Cs makes it possible to exhibit the reducing ability efficiently. The luminance of the organic EL device can be improved and the lifetime thereof can be made long by the addition thereof to its electron-injecting zone.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0207">An electron-injecting layer made of an insulator or a semiconductor may further be provided between a cathode and an organic layer. By forming the electron-injecting layer, a current leakage can be effectively prevented and electron-injecting properties can be improved. If the electron-injecting layer is an insulating thin film, more uniformed thin film can be formed whereby pixel defects such as a dark spot are decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0208">As the insulator, at least one metal compound selected from the group consisting of alkali metal calcogenides, alkaline earth metal calcogenides, halides of alkali metals and halides of alkaline earth metals can be preferably used. When the electron-injecting layer is formed of the alkali metal calcogenide or the like, the injection of electrons can be preferably further improved. Specifically preferable alkali metal calcogenides include Li<sub>2</sub>O, K<sub>2</sub>O, Na<sub>2</sub>S, Na<sub>2</sub>Se and Na<sub>2</sub>O and preferable alkaline earth metal calcogenides include CaO, BaO, SrO, BeO, BaS and CaSe. Preferable halides of alkali metals include LiF, NaF, KF, CsF, LiCl, KCl and NaCl. Preferable halides of alkaline earth metals include fluorides such as CaF<sub>2</sub>, BaF<sub>2</sub>, SrF<sub>2</sub>, MgF<sub>2 </sub>and BeF<sub>2 </sub>and the other halides corresponding to the fluorides.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0209">Semiconductors forming an electron-injecting layer include one or combinations of two or more of oxides, nitrides, and oxidized nitrides containing at least one element of Ba, Ca, Sr, Yb, Al, Ga, In, Li, Na, Cd, Mg, Si, Ta, Sb and Zn. An inorganic compound forming an electron-injecting layer is preferably a microcrystalline or amorphous insulating thin film.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0210">For the cathode, the following may be used: an electrode substance made of a metal, an alloy or an electroconductive compound, or a mixture thereof which has a small work function (for example, 4 eV or less). Specific examples of the electrode substance include sodium, sodium-potassium alloy, magnesium, lithium, cesium, magnesium/silver alloy, aluminum/aluminum oxide, Al/Li<sub>2</sub>O, Al/LiO, Al/LiF, aluminum/lithium alloy, indium, and rare earth metals.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0211">The cathode is formed from these electrode materials by vapor deposition, sputtering or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0212">In the case where emission from the emitting layer is outcoupled through the cathode, it is preferred to make the transmittance of the cathode to the emission larger than 10%. The sheet resistance of the cathode is preferably several hundreds &#x3a9;/&#x25a1; or less, and the film thickness thereof is usually from 10 nm to 1 &#x3bc;m, preferably from 50 to 200 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0213">Generally, in the organic EL device, pixel defects based on leakage or a short circuit are easily generated since an electric field is applied to the super thin film. In order to prevent this, it is preferred to insert an insulating thin layer between the pair of electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0214">Examples of the material used in the insulating layer include aluminum oxide, lithium fluoride, lithium oxide, cesium fluoride, cesium oxide, magnesium oxide, magnesium fluoride, calcium oxide, calcium fluoride, aluminum nitride, titanium oxide, silicon oxide, germanium oxide, silicon nitride, boron nitride, molybdenum oxide, ruthenium oxide, and vanadium oxide. A mixture or laminate thereof may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0215">As for the method for fabricating the organic EL device, it can be fabricated by forming necessary layers sequentially from the anode using the materials and the method as mentioned above, and finally forming the cathode. The organic EL device can be fabricated in the order reverse to the above, i.e., the order from the cathode to the anode.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0216">An example of the fabrication of the organic EL device will be described below which has a structure wherein the following are successively formed on a transparent substrate: anode/hole-injecting layer/emitting layer/electron-injecting layer/cathode.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0217">At first, a thin film formed of an anode material is formed on a transparent substrate by vapor deposition or sputtering to form an anode.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0218">Next, a hole-injecting layer is formed on this anode. As described above, the hole-injecting layer can be formed by vacuum deposition, spin coating, casting, LB technique, or some other method. Vacuum deposition is preferred since a homogenous film is easily obtained and pinholes are not easily generated. In the case where the hole-injecting layer is formed by vacuum deposition, conditions for the deposition vary depending upon a compound used (a material for the hole-injecting layer), a desired structure of the hole-injecting layer, and others. In general, the conditions are preferably selected from the following: deposition source temperature of 50 to 450&#xb0; C., vacuum degree of 10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>to 10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>Torr, vapor deposition rate of 0.01 to 50 nm/second, and substrate temperature of &#x2212;50 to 300&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0219">Next, an emitting layer is formed on the hole-injecting layer. The emitting layer can also be formed by making a luminescent material into a thin film by vacuum vapor deposition, sputtering, spin coating, casting or some other method. Vacuum vapor deposition is preferred since a homogenous film is easily obtained and pinholes are not easily generated. In the case where the emitting layer is formed by vacuum vapor deposition, conditions for the deposition, which vary depending on a compound used, can be generally selected from conditions similar to those for the hole-injecting layer.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0220">Next, an electron-injecting layer is formed on the emitting layer. Like the hole-injecting layer and the emitting layer, the layer is preferably formed by vacuum vapor deposition because a homogenous film is required. Conditions for the deposition can be selected from conditions similar to those for the hole-injecting layer and the emitting layer.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0221">Lastly, a cathode is stacked thereon to obtain an organic EL device. The cathode can be formed by vapor deposition or sputtering. However, vapor vacuum deposition is preferred in order to protect underlying organic layers from being damaged when the cathode film is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0222">For the organic EL device fabrication described above, it is preferred that the formation from the anode to the cathode is continuously carried out, using only one vacuuming operation.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0223">The method for forming each of the layers in the organic EL device is not particularly limited. An organic thin film layer containing the compound of the invention can be formed by a known method such as vacuum vapor deposition, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), or an applying coating method using a solution in which the compound is dissolved in a solvent, such as dipping, spin coating, casting, bar coating, or roll coating.</p>
