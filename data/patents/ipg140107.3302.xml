<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to an integrated circuit packaging system, and more particularly to a system for an integrated circuit packaging system with encapsulation.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Increased miniaturization of components, greater packaging density of integrated circuits (&#x201c;ICs&#x201d;), higher performance, and lower cost are ongoing goals of the computer industry. Semiconductor package structures continue to advance toward miniaturization, to increase the density of the components that are packaged therein while decreasing the sizes of the products that are made therefrom. This is in response to continually increasing demands on information and communication products for ever-reduced sizes, thicknesses, and costs, along with ever-increasing performance.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">These increasing requirements for miniaturization are particularly noteworthy, for example, in portable information and communication devices such as cellular phones, hands-free cellular phone headsets, personal data assistants (&#x201c;PDA's&#x201d;), camcorders, notebook computers, and so forth. All of these devices continue to be made smaller and thinner to improve their portability. Accordingly, large-scale IC (&#x201c;LSI&#x201d;) packages that are incorporated into these devices are required to be made smaller and thinner. The package configurations that house and protect LSI require them to be made smaller and thinner as well.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Consumer electronics requirements demand more integrated circuits in an integrated circuit package while paradoxically providing less physical space in the system for the increased integrated circuits content. Continuous cost reduction is another requirement. Some technologies primarily focus on integrating more functions into each integrated circuit. Other technologies focus on stacking these integrated circuits into a single package. While these approaches provide more functions within an integrated circuit, they do not fully address the requirements for performance, integration, and cost reduction.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, a need still remains for an integrated circuit packaging system providing improved chip interconnection, space savings, and low cost manufacturing. In view of the ever-increasing need to improve performance, integration, and cost reduction, it is increasingly critical that answers be found to these problems. In view of the ever-increasing commercial competitive pressures, along with growing consumer expectations and the diminishing opportunities for meaningful product differentiation in the marketplace, it is critical that answers be found for these problems. Additionally, the need to reduce costs, improve efficiencies and performance, and meet competitive pressures adds an even greater urgency to the critical necessity for finding answers to these problems.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Solutions to these problems have been long sought but prior developments have not taught or suggested any solutions and, thus, solutions to these problems have long eluded those skilled in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention provides a method of manufacture of an integrated circuit packaging system including: providing a base substrate; attaching a base integrated circuit on the base substrate; attaching a base barrier on the base substrate adjacent a base perimeter thereof; mounting a stack substrate over the base substrate, the stack substrate having a stack substrate aperture with the stack substrate having an inter-substrate connector thereon; and dispensing a connector underfill through the stack substrate aperture encapsulating the inter-substrate connector, overflow of the connector underfill prevented by the base barrier.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides an integrated circuit packaging system, including: a base substrate; a base integrated circuit on the base substrate; a base barrier on the base substrate adjacent a base perimeter thereof; a stack substrate over the base substrate, the stack substrate having a stack substrate aperture with the stack substrate having an inter-substrate connector thereon; and a connector underfill through the stack substrate aperture encapsulating the inter-substrate connector, overflow of the connector underfill prevented by the base barrier.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The following embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to make and use the invention. It is to be understood that other embodiments would be evident based on the present disclosure, and that system, process, or mechanical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the following description, numerous specific details are given to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be apparent that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In order to avoid obscuring the present invention, some well-known circuits, system configurations, and process steps are not disclosed in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The drawings showing embodiments of the system are semi-diagrammatic and not to scale and, particularly, some of the dimensions are for the clarity of presentation and are shown exaggerated in the drawing FIGs. Similarly, although the views in the drawings for ease of description generally show similar orientations, this depiction in the FIGs. is arbitrary for the most part. Generally, the invention can be operated in any orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Where multiple embodiments are disclosed and described having some features in common, for clarity and ease of illustration, description, and comprehension thereof, similar and like features one to another will ordinarily be described with similar reference numerals. The embodiments have been numbered first embodiment, second embodiment, etc. as a matter of descriptive convenience and are not intended to have any other significance or provide limitations for the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">There are increasing expectation and requirements for semiconductor devices having better mechanical performance, especially for hand held and portable device applications. In current package-on-package (PoP) structures, solder interconnects of a top package can be directly exposed to environment without any reinforcement layers.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The solder interconnects can have joints that are not sufficiently robust to cope with reliability test requirements such as temperature cycling tests or mechanical impact tests. The current PoP structures are not amenable or not readily complied to introduce the reinforcement layers (e.g. underfill materials) in the package-to-package standoff gap, particularly for PoP stacking structures that have same sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The current PoP structures can be mounted on printed circuit boards (PCBs) with underfill tongues formed around the PCBs' peripheries. Long underfill overspreads (or tongues) can be formed around the peripheries of the current PoP structures if conventional dispensing techniques are employed to provide underfill materials between inter-package standoff gaps and the current PoP structures' board-level mounting standoff gaps.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The current PoP structures have a number of disadvantages or problems. The problems can include a high amount of wasted underfill materials, a long dispensing time for double-layer standoff gaps, or a large PCB keep-out zone required to accommodate the long underfill overspreads.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Additional problems that need to be addressed can include inadequate thermal performance of top packages in the current PoP structures, since peripheral balls can insufficiently or ineffectively dissipate heat through substrates of bottom packages in the current PoP structures. Embodiments of the present invention provide answers or solutions to these problems by providing various form factors, which can include ascending, descending, or straight profile in structure.</p>
