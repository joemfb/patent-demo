<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to padlocks, or more particularly, to a system and method for displaying a padlock.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Padlocks are commonly sold in hardware and home improvement stores. A padlock is generally packaged in plastic, or what is commonly referred to as a &#x201c;clam shell package.&#x201d; A clam shell package generally includes two pieces of clear, pre-formed plastic (e.g., a front contoured sheet and a back sheet). Once the item (e.g., a padlock) is placed between the two pieces of plastic, the plastic sheets are fused together at their edges.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One drawback of a clam shell package is that it is generally very difficult to open, often times requiring the use of either a knife or scissors. In fact, clam shell packages are so difficult to open, over 6,000 Americans per year visit the emergency room after opening (or attempting to open) a clam shell package.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another drawback of a clam shell package is that it does not allow the consumer to touch or feel the item without first removing the item from its package. This is important because some consumers are more comfortable buying an item after they have had an opportunity to touch it. By touching the item, the consumer may be able to detect certain features, e.g., whether the item is solid or hollow, plastic or metal, sturdy or flimsy, etc. Because a clam shell package is difficult to open, a consumer generally has to buy the item, take it home and destroy the package (e.g., with a knife or scissors) in order to touch the item. If the consumer is dissatisfied with the item, the consumer then has to return the item to the store. The item is then sent back to the manufacturer, where it is inspected and repackaged. Not only does this result in a waste of time for the consumer, but it also results in a waste of time and money for the store and the manufacturer.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A potential solution would be to construct a package that can be easily opened, thereby allowing the consumer to open the package at the store. While this would allow the consumer to touch the item before buying it, it would also increase the risk of selling an item with missing pieces (e.g., missing instructions, warranties, fasteners, keys, etc.). Not only is such a situation frustrating to the consumer, but it also reflects poorly on the store and the manufacturer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, it would be advantageous to provide a system and method for packaging a padlock that overcomes at least some of the foregoing drawbacks. For example, it would be beneficial to retain a padlock in a package that would allow a consumer to touch and feel at least a portion of the padlock without having to remove the padlock from its package.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention provides a system and method for displaying a padlock. Preferred embodiments of the present invention operate in accordance with a card, a back plate and/or a padlock.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment of the present invention, the system includes a padlock, a card and a back plate, wherein the card includes a front side, a back side and an aperture sized to receive the padlock, and the back plate is configured to be attached to the back side of the card. The card further includes a plurality of retaining tabs that extend from the front and/or back side of the card and are used to retain the padlock by restricting movement of the padlock in a direction orthogonal and/or parallel to the face of the card. Each retaining tab is configured to retain (or support) the padlock by providing at least one retaining surface. For example, a first retaining tab may have a first (curved) surface and a second surface substantially parallel to the face of the card, wherein the first surface restricts movement of the padlock in a direction parallel to the face of the card (i.e., prevents the padlock from moving side to side) and the second surface restricts movement of the padlock in a direction orthogonal to the face of the card (i.e., prevents the padlock from moving out, away from the face of the card).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Once the padlock is placed in the aperture and the back plate is attached to the card, the padlock is secured (e.g., between at least one retaining tab and the back plate) and ready to be displayed. In one embodiment of the present invention, the card further includes a second aperture configured to mate with a hook on a display rack. In another embodiment of the present invention, the card further includes at least one foot (e.g., a foot extending from a front side of the card, a foot extending from a back side of the card, etc.) that is substantially tangential to (or aligned with) a bottom of the card, thereby allowing the system to be placed on a horizontal shelf and supported in a substantially vertical position.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another embodiment of the present invention, the system includes a card and a back plate, wherein the card includes a front side, a back side and a plurality of retaining tabs and the back plate is configured to be attached to a back side of the card. As before, the retaining tabs extend from the front and/or back side of the card and are used to retain a padlock by restricting movement of the padlock in a direction orthogonal and/or parallel to the front side of the card. Each retaining tab is configured to retain (or support) the padlock by providing at least one retaining surface. For example, a first retaining tab may have a first (curved) surface and a second surface substantially parallel to the front side of the card, wherein the first surface restricts movement of the padlock in a direction parallel to the front side of the card (i.e., prevents the padlock from moving side to side) and the second surface restricts movement of the padlock in a direction orthogonal to the front side of the card (i.e., prevents the padlock from moving out, away from the front side of the card).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with this embodiment, the card further includes an aperture that is sized to receive at least a body of the padlock. This may be accomplished, for example, by (i) positioning the padlock behind the card, (ii) placing a shackle of the padlock through the aperture (e.g., from the back side of the card), (iii) moving the shackle upward, toward the front side of the card, and (iv) and moving the body of the padlock through the aperture until the body comes into contact with at least one retaining tab.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one embodiment of the present invention, the card and back plate further include, respectively, a first set of coupling portions and a second set of coupling portions, wherein the first set of coupling portions are configured to mate with the second set of coupling portions. For example, a first coupling portion of the card may be configured to mate with a first coupling portion of the back plate, a second coupling portion of the card may be configured to mate with a second coupling portion of the back plate, etc. In one embodiment of the present invention, the first set of coupling portions include at least one coupling tab and the second set of coupling portions include at least one coupling ledge, wherein the coupling tab is configured to mate with the coupling ledge.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another embodiment of the present invention, the back plate further includes a front side and at least one retaining surface. Like the retaining tabs, the retaining surface is used to retain the padlock by restricting movement of the padlock in a direction parallel to the front side of the card. In contradistinction, the front side of the back plate is used to retain the padlock by restricting movement of the padlock in a direction orthogonal to the front side of the card.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another embodiment of the present invention, the back plate further includes a recess, preferably shaped to receive at least one key, and/or a post configured to mate with at least one aperture in the key(s). By placing the padlock into the aperture of the card, placing the key(s) into the recess of the back plate and/or over the post of the back plate, and attaching the back plate to the card, both the padlock and the key are secured (or retained) and ready to be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment of the present invention, the card further includes a second aperture configured to mate with a hook on a display rack. By placing the second aperture over the hook, the card can be supported in a substantially vertical position. In another embodiment of the present invention, the card further includes at least one foot that is substantially tangential to (or aligned with) a bottom of the card, thereby allowing the system to be placed on a horizontal shelf (or surface) and supported in a substantially vertical position.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the foregoing embodiments, by limiting the size and/or number of retaining tabs, the consumer can freely touch portions of the padlock (e.g., portions of the body, the shackle, etc.) without having to remove the padlock from its package (e.g., the card and the back plate).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a method for displaying a padlock includes placing at least a body of a padlock through an aperture in a card. In one embodiment, this is accomplished by (i) placing the shackle of the padlock through the aperture (e.g., from a back side of the card), (ii) rotating the shackle upward (e.g., toward a front side of the card), and (iii) placing the body of the padlock inside the aperture of the card. If the padlock includes a key, then the key is placed inside a back plate (e.g., inside a recess in the back plate, over a post on the back plate, etc.). The back plate is then attached to the card by mating a first set of coupling portions on the card (e.g., coupling tabs) with a second set of coupling portions on the back plate (e.g., coupling apertures). This results in the padlock body being retained between the card (e.g., a retaining tab portion of the card) and the back plate. It also results in the key being retained between the padlock body and the back plate (e.g., a front side of the back plate, a recess in the back plate, etc.). The package can then be placed on either a hook (e.g., via an aperture in the card) or on a shelf (e.g., via a front foot and/or a rear foot).</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present invention provides a system and method for displaying a padlock. In the detailed description that follows, like element numerals are used to describe like elements illustrated in one or more figures.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>show a system for displaying a padlock in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The system <b>10</b> includes a padlock <b>120</b> and a card <b>110</b> having a plurality of retaining tabs (e.g., <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> and <b>116</b>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the padlock <b>40</b> may include a shackle <b>410</b> and a body <b>420</b> having a front side <b>450</b>, a back side <b>430</b>, and a bottom <b>440</b>. While the shackle <b>410</b> is generally constructed out of metal, the body may be constructed out of metal or a combination of materials (e.g., metal, non-metallic materials, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, the retaining tabs are used to retain the padlock <b>120</b> by restricting movement of the padlock <b>120</b> in a direction orthogonal and/or parallel to a face (or front side) of the card <b>110</b>. Each retaining tab is configured to retain (or support) the padlock by providing at least one retaining surface. For example, retaining tab <b>112</b> has a first (curved) surface that extends from a face of the card <b>110</b> and a second surface that extends from the first surface and is substantially parallel the face of the card <b>110</b> (adjacent a front side of the padlock <b>120</b>), wherein the first surface restricts movement of the padlock <b>120</b> in a direction parallel to the face of the card <b>110</b> (i.e., prevents the padlock from moving side to side) and the second surface restricts movement of the padlock <b>120</b> in a direction orthogonal to the face of the card (i.e., prevents the padlock from moving out, away from the face of the card). Retaining tab <b>114</b> is similar to retaining tab <b>112</b> in that it includes a first (curved) surface for restricting movement of the padlock <b>120</b> in a direction parallel to the face of the card <b>110</b> and a second surface for restricting movement of the padlock <b>120</b> in a direction orthogonal to the face of the card <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It should be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to any particular type of card, and includes all substrates (rigid or flexible, flat or contoured, plastic or cardboard, etc.) generally known to those skilled in the art. It should also be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to any particular type of padlock, and includes all padlocks (keyed or combination, residential or commercial, rectangular or round, etc.) generally known to those skilled in the art. It should further be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to the particular type and number of retaining tabs illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>. Thus, for example, a card having additional (or fewer) retaining tabs is within the spirit and scope of the present invention. By way of another example, a system having retaining tabs that are manufactured together with the card (e.g., formed together using injection molding, etc.) or separate from the card (e.g., configured to mate with the card, etc.) is within the spirit and scope of the present invention. It should also be appreciated that while the system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>only uses retaining tabs to retain a body of the padlock, the present invention is not so limited. For example, a system that includes retaining tabs to retain a body of a padlock, a shackle of a padlock or both a body and a shackle of a padlock, is within the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, the system <b>10</b> further includes a back plate <b>118</b> that is configured to mate (or connect) with the card <b>110</b> (e.g., via coupling portions; see discussion below), thereby retaining the padlock <b>120</b> between at least one retaining tab (e.g., <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>) and the back plate <b>118</b>. It should be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to any particular type of back plate, and includes all substrates (rigid or flexible, flat or contoured, plastic or cardboard, etc.) generally known to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>, the card <b>110</b> further includes a front side (or face) <b>160</b>, a back side <b>130</b>, a bottom <b>140</b>, a plurality of front feet <b>170</b>, <b>172</b> that extend from the front side <b>160</b> of the card <b>110</b> and a plurality of back feet <b>150</b>, <b>152</b> that extend from the back side <b>130</b> of the card <b>110</b>. Preferably, the feet <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>, <b>170</b> and <b>172</b> are substantially tangential to (or aligned with) the bottom <b>140</b> of the card <b>110</b>, thereby allowing the system <b>10</b> to be placed on a horizontal shelf (not shown). By configuring the feet <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>, <b>170</b> and <b>172</b> to rest on top of the shelf (or similar structure), the system <b>10</b> can be supported in a substantially vertical position.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>and <b>3</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>show a system for displaying a padlock in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a </i>shows a card <b>20</b> having a front side <b>220</b> and a plurality of retaining tabs (e.g., <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> and <b>216</b>). As before, the retaining tabs are used to retain a padlock (not shown) by restricting movement of the padlock in a direction orthogonal and/or parallel to the front side <b>220</b> of the card <b>20</b>. Each retaining tab is configured to retain (or support) the padlock by providing at least one retaining surface. For example, retaining tab <b>212</b> has a first (curved) surface that extends from the front side <b>220</b> of the card <b>20</b> and a second surface that extends from the first surface and is parallel to the front side <b>220</b> of the card <b>20</b>, wherein the first surface restricts movement of the padlock in a direction parallel to the front side <b>220</b> of the card <b>20</b> (i.e., prevents the padlock from moving side to side) and the second surface restricts movement of the padlock in a direction orthogonal to the front side <b>220</b> of the card <b>20</b> (i.e., prevents the padlock from moving out, away from the front side of the card). Retaining tab <b>214</b> has surfaces that are similar to (but opposite) retaining tab <b>212</b>. Retaining tab <b>216</b> has a first (curved) surface that extends from a back side <b>230</b> of the card <b>20</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>) and a second surface that extends from the first surface and is parallel to the front side <b>220</b> of the card <b>20</b>. Retaining tab <b>216</b> is configured to support the bottom of the padlock and restrict movement of the padlock in directions both parallel and orthogonal to the front side <b>220</b> of the card <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As previously stated, the present invention is not limited to any particular type of card, and includes all substrates (rigid or flexible, flat or contoured, plastic or cardboard, etc.) generally known to those skilled in the art. It should further be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to the particular type and number of retaining tabs illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>. Thus, for example, a card having additional (or fewer) retaining tabs and/or different types of retaining tabs (e.g., different shapes, different surfaces, etc.) is within the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>, the card <b>20</b> further includes an aperture <b>260</b> that is sized to receive at least a body of the padlock (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> at <b>420</b>). In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the padlock is placed in the aperture <b>260</b> by first (i) positioning the padlock behind the card, (ii) placing the shackle of the padlock through the aperture <b>260</b> (e.g., from the back side of the card), (iii) moving the shackle upward, toward the front side <b>220</b> of the card <b>20</b>, and (iv) and moving the body of the padlock through the aperture <b>260</b> until the body comes into contact with at least one retaining tab (e.g., <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> and <b>216</b>). Depending on the size of the body of the padlock, a portion of the body may be protruding out a front side of the aperture <b>260</b> and a portion of the body may be protruding out a back side of the aperture <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>show a back plate <b>30</b> that is configured to mate (or connect) with the card <b>20</b>. Specifically, the back plate <b>30</b> includes a back side <b>330</b>, a bottom <b>340</b> and a plurality of coupling portions (e.g., <b>372</b> and <b>382</b>) that are configured to mate with a plurality of coupling portions (e.g., <b>282</b>, <b>284</b>, <b>286</b> and <b>288</b>) on the card <b>20</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>). More particularly, coupling portion <b>382</b> is configured to mate with coupling portions <b>282</b> and <b>284</b>, and coupling portion <b>372</b> is configured to mate with coupling portions <b>286</b> and <b>288</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one embodiment of the present invention, the coupling portions on the card (e.g., <b>282</b>, <b>284</b>, <b>286</b> and <b>288</b>) are coupling tabs, and the coupling portions on the back plate (e.g., <b>372</b> and <b>382</b>) are coupling ledges. Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, the back plate <b>30</b> includes a first edge <b>370</b> having a rear surface comprising a first coupling ledge <b>372</b> and a second edge <b>380</b> having a rear surface comprising a second coupling ledge <b>382</b>. In another embodiment of the present invention, each tab (e.g., <b>282</b>, <b>284</b>, <b>286</b> and <b>288</b>) includes a protruding head attached to a resilient arm. Once the head is placed over a corresponding ledge, the resiliency of the arm prevents the back plate <b>30</b> from being removed from the card <b>20</b> until an external force is applied to either the head or the arm.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">It should be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to the types of coupling portions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>b </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i>. For example, a card having coupling tabs, coupling ledges, coupling apertures, a combination of coupling tabs, ledges and/or apertures, or any other type of connector (or combination of connectors) generally known to those skilled in the art, is within the spirit and scope of the present invention. By way of example only, a back plate having a hinge on one side (e.g., connected to both the back plate and the card) and at least one coupling portion on the other is within the spirit and scope of the present invention. It should also be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to the number of coupling portions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>b </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i>. For example, a card having additional (or fewer) coupling portions is within the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, the back plate <b>30</b> further includes a front side <b>320</b> and at least one retaining surface (e.g., <b>360</b>). Like the retaining tabs, the retaining surface is used to retain the padlock by restricting movement of the padlock in a direction parallel and orthogonal to the front side <b>220</b> of the card <b>20</b>. In contradistinction, the front side <b>320</b> of the back plate <b>30</b> is used to retain the padlock by restricting movement of the padlock in a direction orthogonal to the front side <b>220</b> of the card <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, the back plate <b>30</b> may further include a recess <b>390</b>, preferably shaped to receive at least one key, and/or a post <b>392</b> configured to fit inside an aperture of at least one key. By moving the padlock into the aperture <b>260</b> of the card <b>20</b>, placing the key(s) into the recess <b>390</b> and/or over the post <b>392</b> of the back plate <b>30</b>, and mating the back plate <b>30</b> to the card <b>20</b>, both the padlock and the key(s) can be retained (or secured). In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the padlock is retained between at least one retaining tab (e.g., <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> and <b>216</b>) and the front side <b>320</b> of the back plate <b>30</b>, and the key(s) is retained between the back side of the padlock and the front side <b>320</b> (or recess <b>390</b>) of the back plate <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, the card <b>20</b> further includes a plurality of front feet <b>270</b>, <b>272</b> and a plurality of rear feet <b>250</b>, <b>252</b>, thereby allowing the card <b>20</b> to be placed on a horizontal shelf (not shown). Preferably, the front feet extend from the front side <b>220</b> of the card <b>20</b>, are orthogonal to the front side <b>220</b> of the card <b>20</b>, and are substantially tangential to (or aligned with) the bottom <b>240</b> of the card <b>20</b>, and the rear feet extend from the rear side <b>230</b> of the card, are orthogonal to the rear side <b>230</b> of the card <b>20</b>, and are substantially tangential to (or aligned with) the bottom <b>240</b> of the card <b>20</b>. By configuring the feet <b>250</b>, <b>252</b>, <b>270</b> and <b>272</b> to rest on top of the shelf (or similar structure), the card <b>20</b> can be supported in a substantially vertical position.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In another embodiment of the present invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>, the card <b>20</b> further includes a second aperture <b>262</b> configured to mate with a hook (not shown) (e.g., as found on a display rack). By placing the aperture <b>262</b> over the hook, the card <b>20</b> can be supported in a substantially vertical position.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It should be appreciated that while the foregoing embodiments are directed toward packages for retaining a single padlock, the present invention is not so limited. For example, a system that includes a card, a back plate and at least two padlocks is within the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> provides a method of displaying a padlock in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Starting at step <b>500</b>, at least a body of the padlock is placed through an aperture in a card at step <b>502</b>, preferably until the body comes into contact with at least one retaining tab. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the shackle of the padlock is placed through the aperture (from a back side of the card) and rotated upward (toward a front side of the card), allowing the body of the padlock to be placed inside the aperture of the card. At step <b>503</b>, if the padlock includes at least one key, then, at step <b>504</b>, the key(s) is placed inside a recess in a back plate and/or over a post on the back plate. At step <b>506</b>, the back plate is then attached to the card by mating at least one coupling portion of the card (e.g., a coupling tab) with at least one coupling portion of the back plate (e.g., a coupling ledge). This results in the padlock body being retained between the card (e.g., at least one retaining tab) and the back plate. It also results in the key(s) being retained between the padlock body and the back plate (e.g., a front side of the back plate, a recess in the back plate, etc.). The package can then be placed on either a hook or a shelf at step <b>508</b>. If the package is to be placed on a hook, then an aperture in the card is placed over the hook at step <b>510</b>. If, however, the package is to be placed on a shelf, then at least one foot is placed on top of the shelf at step <b>512</b>, ending the method at step <b>514</b>. By hanging the card from a hook or placing the card on a shelf (or similar horizontal structure, e.g., horizontal display rack, etc.), the card can be supported in a substantially vertical position.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Having thus described several embodiments of a system and method for displaying a padlock, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that certain advantages of the system and method have been achieved. For example, by limiting the size and/or number of retaining tabs, the consumer can freely touch portions of the padlock (e.g., portions of the body, the shackle, etc.) without having to remove the padlock from its package. It should also be appreciated that various modifications, adaptations, and alternative embodiments thereof may be made within the scope and spirit of the present invention. The invention is solely defined by the following claims.</p>
