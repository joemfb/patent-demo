<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to liquid aeration systems, and more particularly to an aerator air distribution manifold that has a plurality of radially disposed diffuser pipes or tubes extending from a central plenum.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The contamination of various bodies of water by various means is an increasingly serious problem worldwide. The most widespread contaminants may be organic materials that enter the water system due to pollution from human habitation, either directly or indirectly, e.g., pollution from farms and the like. Such pollution can affect inland fresh water supplies (lakes and rivers), and can also be carried to the sea by inland rivers and waterways or by direct discharge of sewage and/or other pollutants into the sea. Organic material in the sewage of treatment plants is another example of such pollution, although contained for processing. The biochemical processes that occur in water due to such organic pollution are known to decrease the oxygen content of the water, thereby reducing or even destroying fish and other aquatic life in the contaminated body of water. Even if some fish remain in the polluted water, they are almost certainly unfit for human consumption, if caught.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is generally considered that the most effective means of eliminating such pollutants in contaminated water is by bacteriological processing, wherein bacteria process the contaminants to break them down into harmless organic materials. However, such bacteria are aerobic, i.e., they require oxygen for their metabolism. This is well known in the sewage treatment field, where water is commonly treated by aeration after solids are removed by settling or other means. Such aeration is generally accomplished by mechanical means, e.g., pumping the water up for dispensing into the air from spray booms and nozzles, or by forcing air through underwater pipes for the air to bubble up through the water. Such mechanical systems are relatively costly to operate and require relatively high energy and manpower costs. Even if such systems were less costly to operate, a huge drawback is that they cannot be readily transported to a pollution site for operation at that site. Rather, the water must be transported to the location of the aeration system, a process that is clearly unworkable on a very large scale and/or over very long distances.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another consideration is the frequent need to position the air diffuser(s) at a constant depth below the surface of the water in which the aerator is installed in order to simplify pressure regulation of the airflow. This is not a significant problem in settling ponds and the like, but can be a significant problem in bodies of water wherein the level changes from time to time, as in reservoirs with controlled outlets and bodies of water influenced by tidal action.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, an aerator air distribution manifold solving the aforementioned problems is desired.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The aerator air distribution manifold is used on at least one buoyant aerator for aerating a body of water. The air distribution manifold of each of the aerators comprises a central plenum disposed at the lower end of a concentric rigid downpipe or duct, and a radial array of diffuser tubes extending from the plenum. As the aerators are buoyant, the aeration tubes are deployed at a constant, uniform depth below the surface of the water at all times, regardless of the water level. All of the manifolds receive their air supply from a remotely disposed air source. The air source may be based on shore, or may be based upon a ship or other floating vessel. A flexible air supply line or hose extends from the air supply to each of the buoyant aerators. The hose is supported by one or more rigid columns or poles anchored into the bottom of the body of water in which the aerators are placed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A first embodiment of the buoyant aerator has a toroidal float and a plurality of legs extending down from the periphery of the float. The air distribution manifold comprises a radial array of aeration tubes or nozzles affixed at the lower end of a down tube, pipe, or duct disposed between the legs and below the float. A second embodiment of the buoyant aerator is anchored to a non-buoyant, sunken base that is permanently placed upon the floor of a body of water. A plurality of substantially vertical guide columns extends upward from the base. The toroidal float is installed and captured between the guide columns. The float is free to float up and down along the guide columns as the water level changes. The down tube or pipe depends through the center of the toroidal float, and moves up and down between the guide columns as the float moves up and down. The air distribution manifold and its plurality of radial diffuser pipes extend from the lower end of the down tube.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As the float remains atop the water in both aerator embodiments, the radial array of aeration tubes remains at a constant depth below the surface, so that the air supply remains at a constant pressure with no need for variance. A plurality of such buoyant aerators may be placed in a body of water, all of the aerators receiving their air supply from a single remotely located source.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">These and other features of the present invention will become readily apparent upon further review of the following specification and drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The aerator air distribution manifold is installed upon various embodiments of buoyant aerators with remote air supplies. Different means are provided for securing the aerators to the floor of the body of water in which they are installed and different air supply sources are provided, but all of the embodiments make use of the same air distribution manifold configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> of the drawings provides a perspective view of a first buoyant aerator <b>10</b>. This aerator comprises a buoyant toroidal float <b>12</b> having a periphery <b>14</b> and a plurality of leg attachment points or fittings <b>16</b> installed thereon. Corresponding rigid support legs <b>18</b> extend from the fittings. Each leg has a support pad or foot <b>20</b> at the base thereof. Corresponding anchor cables or lines <b>22</b> extend from the leg attachment points <b>16</b>. The distal ends <b>24</b> of the cables <b>22</b> are anchored into the floor F of the body of water W to prevent the aerator <b>10</b> from drifting from its installed position. Each of the legs <b>18</b> has a fixed length, so that the support pads <b>20</b> remain clear of the floor F of the body of water W when the water depth is greater than the vertical lengths of the legs <b>18</b>. If the water depth becomes less than the vertical lengths of the legs <b>18</b>, e.g., due to tidal action, change in level in a reservoir, etc., the support pads <b>20</b> rest upon the floor F of the body of water W to support the aerator structure at a predetermined height above the floor F to preclude its contamination with mud or other bottom debris.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The aerator <b>10</b> has a single central air delivery column <b>26</b> extending substantially vertically through the center hole or passage of the toroidal float <b>12</b>. The upper end <b>28</b> of the column <b>26</b> is preferably immovably affixed to the float <b>12</b> by suitable braces or the like (not shown) where it passes through the center of the float <b>12</b>, and by additional similar but longer braces <b>30</b> extending from the lower portion or end <b>32</b> of the column to each of the support legs <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">An aeration outlet <b>34</b> is immovably affixed to the lower end <b>32</b> of the air delivery column <b>26</b>, and thus to the remaining structure of the aerator <b>10</b>. The aeration outlet <b>34</b> comprises a relatively flat or thin circular central plenum <b>36</b> and a plurality of radially disposed and perforated aeration tubes or nozzles <b>38</b> extending therefrom. A circular brace <b>40</b> is disposed concentrically about the aeration or diffuser tubes <b>38</b> and spaced outwardly from the plenum <b>36</b>, tying the tubes <b>38</b> together for greater security. Since the aeration outlet <b>34</b> is immovably affixed to the remaining structure of the aerator <b>10</b>, including its float <b>12</b>, it will be seen that the aeration tubes <b>38</b> remain at a constant fixed depth below the float <b>12</b>. Thus, as the float <b>12</b> rides upon the surface of the water (assuming adequate water depth so that the legs <b>18</b> are not resting upon the floor F of the body of water W), the aeration tubes <b>38</b> also remain at a constant fixed depth below the surface of the water. Since this depth is fixed, the water pressure or head at the depth of the aeration tubes is also fixed, thus requiring a constant air pressure from the air supply of either <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. No adjustment of the air pressure is required for the aerator <b>10</b> once the pressure has been set.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> of the drawings provides a perspective view of another buoyant aerator, designated as aerator <b>110</b>. The aerator <b>110</b> includes many components that correspond to those like components of the buoyant aerator <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and described above. The aerator <b>110</b> has a buoyant toroidal float <b>112</b> having a periphery <b>114</b> and a plurality of leg attachment passages <b>116</b> installed thereon. Corresponding parallel rigid vertical guides <b>118</b> have lower ends <b>120</b><i>a </i>anchored or immovably affixed in a heavy base <b>120</b><i>b </i>of concrete or the like. The base of the aerator <b>110</b> rests immovably upon the floor F of the body of water W, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. This structure allows the float <b>112</b> to move vertically between the guides <b>118</b> as the water level changes, the leg attachment passages <b>116</b> sliding vertically along the guides <b>118</b>. Corresponding anchor cables or lines <b>122</b> extend from the leg attachment passages <b>116</b>. The distal ends <b>124</b> of the cables <b>22</b> are anchored into the floor F of the body of water W (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>) to provide further security for the aerator <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The aerator <b>110</b> has a single central air delivery column <b>126</b> extending substantially vertically through the center hole or passage of the toroidal float <b>112</b>. The upper end <b>128</b> of the column <b>126</b> is preferably immovably affixed to the float <b>112</b> by suitable conventional braces or the like (not shown) where it passes through the center of the float <b>112</b>. An aeration outlet <b>134</b> is immovably affixed to the lower end <b>132</b> of the air delivery column <b>126</b>, and thus to the remaining structure of the aerator <b>110</b>. The aeration outlet <b>134</b> comprises a relatively flat or thin circular central plenum <b>136</b> and a plurality of radially disposed and perforated aeration tubes or nozzles <b>138</b> extending therefrom. A circular brace <b>140</b> is disposed concentrically about the aeration or diffuser tubes <b>138</b> and spaced outwardly from the plenum <b>136</b>, tying the tubes <b>138</b> together for greater security.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the position of the float <b>112</b>, air delivery column <b>126</b>, and aeration outlet <b>134</b> is shown with the float positioned near the upper ends of the vertical guides <b>118</b> in solid lines, as would be the case with a relatively high water level. If the water level decreases, the float <b>112</b> with its attached air delivery column <b>126</b> and aeration outlet <b>134</b> will descend with the water level, thus lowering the float, column, and aerator outlet, as shown in broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Since the aeration outlet <b>134</b> is immovably affixed to the lower end <b>132</b> of the air delivery column <b>126</b> and the air delivery column <b>126</b> is immovably affixed to the float <b>112</b>, it will be seen that the aeration tubes <b>138</b> remain at a constant fixed depth below the float <b>112</b>. Thus, as the float <b>112</b> rides upon the surface of the water (assuming adequate water depth so that the aeration outlet <b>134</b> is not resting upon the anchor base <b>120</b><i>b</i>), the aeration tubes <b>138</b> also remain at a constant fixed depth below the surface of the water. Since this depth is fixed, the water pressure or head at the depth of the aeration tubes is also fixed, thus requiring a constant air pressure from the air supply of either <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. No adjustment of the air pressure is required for the aerator <b>110</b> once the pressure has been set.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> of the drawings is a pictorial illustration of a buoyant aerator array, showing a plurality of different types of buoyant aerators receiving their air supplies from a single land-based source. The source of air for the buoyant aerators includes a compressor <b>210</b> driven by a suitable power source <b>212</b> (e.g., gasoline or diesel engine, electric motor, etc.). The compressor <b>210</b> delivers air to an air tank <b>214</b> to supply the offshore buoyant aerators. The compressor <b>210</b>, power source <b>212</b>, and air tank <b>214</b> are all installed and based upon the shore or land mass L, clear of the water W. Air is delivered to the various aerators by a separate flexible air delivery line <b>216</b> extending from the air tank <b>214</b> to each of the aerators, so that each aerator has its own air delivery line <b>216</b>. Each of the delivery lines <b>216</b> is supported above the surface S of the water W by one or more support columns <b>218</b>. Each of the support columns <b>218</b> is immovably affixed and anchored in the underlying land mass L or the floor F of the body of water W.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> of the drawings is a pictorial illustration of another buoyant aerator array, showing a plurality of different types or embodiments of buoyant aerators receiving their air supplies from a single floating vessel-based source. The source of air for the buoyant aerators includes a compressor <b>310</b> driven by a suitable power source <b>312</b> (e.g., gasoline or diesel engine, electric motor, etc.). The compressor <b>310</b> delivers air to an air tank <b>314</b> to supply the offshore buoyant aerators. The compressor <b>310</b>, power source <b>312</b>, and air tank <b>314</b> are all installed and based upon the floating vessel V in the water W. Air is delivered to the various aerators by a separate flexible air delivery line <b>316</b> extending from the air tank <b>314</b> to each of the aerators, so that each aerator has its own air delivery line <b>316</b>. Each of the delivery lines <b>316</b> is supported above the surface S of the water W by one or more support columns <b>318</b>. Each of the support columns <b>318</b> is immovably affixed and anchored in the floor F of the body of water W.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">While each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> shows only three aerators, it will be seen that more aerators may be supplied by a single air source, depending upon the amount of air used by each aerator and the capacity of the air supply.</p>
