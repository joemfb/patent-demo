<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The purpose of an integrated passive device (IPD) resides in combining multiple passive elements on a substrate to provide an integrated device module of a specific function. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref> illustrate a current method for forming a package structure including electronic elements. Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which discloses a multilayer structure <b>101</b> with composite material layers. Such multilayer structure <b>101</b> with composite material layers includes a conductive substrate <b>110</b>, a corresponding circuit <b>121</b>, an electronic element <b>122</b>, a resin material <b>130</b> and a transparent layer <b>140</b>. The conductive substrate <b>110</b> which is illustrated here is a semi-conductive substrate such as Si. The electronic element <b>122</b> may be a photosensor, and the electronic element <b>122</b> and the corresponding circuit <b>121</b> are electrically connected to each other and together disposed on the conductive substrate <b>110</b>. The resin material <b>130</b> covers the corresponding circuit <b>121</b> and the electronic element <b>122</b>. The resin material <b>130</b> may be an epoxy resin. There is an additional transparent layer <b>140</b>, such as glass, on the resin material <b>130</b> to allow the photosensor to pick up optical signals.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Second, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, first the conductive substrate <b>110</b> is polished to reduce its thickness, then an etching step is carried out to define the scrub lines <b>150</b> on the conductive substrate <b>110</b>.

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The examples of the present invention propose a package structure which is different from the traditional package structure with electronic devices. The package structure of the present invention includes a non-conductive substrate, a conductive element, a passivation layer, a jointed side, a conductive layer, a solder and a solder mask. The conductive element is disposed on a surface of the non-conductive substrate and substantially consists of a passive element and a corresponding circuit. The passivation layer completely covers the conductive element and the non-conductive substrate so that the conductive element is sandwiched between the passivation layer and the non-conductive substrate. The jointed side exposes part of the corresponding circuit so that the conductive layer which covers the jointed side extends beyond the jointed side to be electrically connected to the corresponding circuit. The solder is disposed outside the jointed side and directly electrically connected to the conductive layer. The solder mask which fills up the jointed side completely covers the conductive layer and selectively exposes the solder.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another example of the present invention proposes a method for forming a package structure. First, a multilayer structure is provided. The multilayer structure includes a non-conductive substrate and a passivation layer so that a conductive element is sandwiched between the non-conductive substrate and the passivation layer. The conductive element is disposed on a surface of the non-conductive substrate and substantially consists of a passive element and a corresponding circuit. Second, a notch is formed so that the bottom of the notch exposes at least one of and part of the passive element and the corresponding circuit. Then a conductive layer is formed to cover the notch, to electrically connect at least one of the passive element and the corresponding circuit and to extend beyond the notch. Next, a solder mask is formed to completely fill up the notch and to selectively expose the conductive layer. Later, a solder which is disposed outside the notch is formed to directly electrically connect to the exposed conductive layer.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the method for forming a package structure of the present invention, in one aspect the non-conductive substrate may completely cover the passivation layer without contacting the conductive element. In another aspect, the notch may exhibit various embodiments. For example, the notch has a tapered sidewall or a vertical sidewall. Further, the notch may penetrate or further enter the multilayer structure from the non-conductive substrate. In the meantime, the notch may merely penetrate the non-conductive substrate and render the passive element exposed. Moreover, the bottom of the notch may enter the passivation layer. Or the notch may further enter part of the non-conductive substrate in addition to penetrating the non-conductive substrate and the passivation layer.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In still another aspect, the notch may go deeper into the multilayer structure from a non-conductive carrier side. On one hand, the notch may merely penetrate the non-conductive carrier. On the other hand, the notch may further enter the passivation layer in addition to penetrating the non-conductive carrier. Alternatively, the notch may further penetrate the passivation layer of the multilayer structure. The package structure after the method of the present invention the conductive element is always disposed on a surface of the non-conductive substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">These and other objectives of the present invention will no doubt become obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art after reading the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment that is illustrated in the various figures and drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The following description is of the best-contemplated mode of carrying out the invention. This description is made for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of the invention and should not be taken in a limiting sense. The scope of the invention is best determined by reference to the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is understood, that the following disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of the invention. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numbers and/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and/or configurations discussed. Furthermore, descriptions of a first layer &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;overlying,&#x201d; (and like descriptions) a second layer, include embodiments where the first and second layers are in direct contact and those where one or more layers are interposing the first and second layers.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A chip package according to an embodiment of the present invention may be used to package an integrated passive device. However, embodiments of the invention are not limited thereto. For example, the chip package of the embodiments of the invention may be applied to a sensor chip, active or passive devices, or electronic components with digital or analog circuits, such as opto electronic devices, micro electro mechanical systems (MEMS), micro fluidic systems, and physical sensors for detecting heat, light, or pressure. Particularly, a wafer scale package (WSP) process may be applied to package semiconductor chips, such as image sensor devices, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), solar cells, RF circuits, accelerators, gyroscopes, micro actuators, surface acoustic wave devices, pressure sensors, ink printer heads, or power IC modules.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The wafer scale package process mentioned above mainly means that after the package process is accomplished during the wafer stage, the wafer with chips is cut to obtain separate independent packages. However, in a specific embodiment, separate independent chips may be redistributed overlying a supporting wafer and then be packaged, which may also be referred to as a wafer scale package process. In addition, the above mentioned wafer scale package process may also be adapted to form chip packages of multi-layer integrated circuit devices by stacking a plurality of wafers having integrated circuits</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">One example of the present invention demonstrates a method for forming a package structure in order to obtain a package structure. First, the method will be explained and various embodiments as well as modifications will be elaborated on. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-10</figref> illustrate the method for forming a package structure, various embodiments as well as modifications of the present invention. Firstly, please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a multilayer structure <b>201</b> is provided. The multilayer structure <b>201</b> includes at least a non-conductive substrate <b>210</b> and a passivation layer <b>230</b>. In addition, the multilayer structure <b>201</b> further includes a conductive element <b>220</b>. The conductive element <b>220</b> in the multilayer structure <b>201</b> is disposed on a surface of non-conductive substrate <b>210</b> so the conductive element <b>220</b> is sandwiched between the non-conductive substrate <b>210</b> and the passivation layer <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The non-conductive substrate <b>210</b> may be a transparent substrate, for example an insulting substrate such as glass, or an opaque substrate such as a ceramic substrate. The thickness of the non-conductive substrate <b>210</b> may be about 300 &#x3bc;m-50 &#x3bc;m. The passivation layer <b>230</b> is also a non-conductive material, such as silicon nitride, silicon oxide, epoxy resin or polyimide, to protect the conductive element <b>220</b> and from the damages of the environment to the conductive element <b>220</b>. The conductive element <b>220</b> of the present invention substantially consists of a passive element <b>222</b>, such as an electric resistance, a capacitor and an inductance, as well as a corresponding circuit <b>221</b> which is electrically connected to the passive element <b>222</b> and the conductive element <b>220</b> is free of any active element.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Second, please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a non-conductive carrier <b>240</b> is provided and a combining material (not shown) is used so that the non-conductive carrier <b>240</b> completely covers the passivation layer <b>230</b> and combines with it. Due to the isolation and segregation of the passivation layer <b>230</b>, the non-conductive carrier <b>240</b> does not contact the conductive element <b>220</b>. The non-conductive carrier <b>240</b> may include at least one of ceramic and glass. The thickness of the non-conductive carrier <b>240</b> may usually be greater than about 300 &#x3bc;m. The non-conductive carrier <b>240</b> and the non-conductive substrate <b>210</b> usually respectively represent the two opposite surfaces of the multilayer structure <b>201</b>. Besides, optionally the thickness of the non-conductive substrate <b>210</b> may be suitably reduced to about 20 &#x3bc;m-70 &#x3bc;m for example, by polishing.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Then, a notch is formed in the multilayer structure <b>201</b> and to make the bottom of the notch expose part of the corresponding circuit <b>221</b>. Part of the multilayer structure <b>201</b> may be removed by at least one of an etching procedure or a mechanical dicing procedure from the non-conductive carrier <b>240</b> side or from the non-conductive substrate <b>210</b> side to respectively obtain the needed notches. In accordance with different embodiments, such as different depth or different shapes of the notches, there are various examples of the notches in the present invention to have a vertical sidewall or a tapered sidewall. Different embodiments are given as follows to elaborate the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, illustrating to remove some of the multilayer structure <b>201</b> from the non-conductive substrate <b>210</b> side and to form the notch <b>250</b>. The notch <b>250</b> has a substantially vertical sidewall <b>252</b>, for example the notch <b>250</b> includes a notch bottom <b>251</b> and a notch sidewall <b>252</b>. In this embodiment, the consequently formed notch <b>250</b> may merely penetrate the non-conductive substrate <b>210</b> upwards and makes the passive element <b>222</b> or the corresponding circuit <b>221</b> exposed. For example, if the thickness of the non-conductive substrate <b>210</b> is about 50 &#x3bc;m, the depth of the notch <b>250</b> is also around 50 &#x3bc;m so that the notch <b>250</b> does not substantially enter the passivation layer <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Later, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a conductive layer <b>223</b> is formed on one side of the non-conductive substrate <b>210</b> with the notch <b>250</b>. In one aspect, the conductive layer <b>223</b> covers the non-conductive substrate <b>210</b> and the notch <b>250</b>, and simultaneously is electrically connected to the corresponding circuit <b>221</b>. In another aspect, the conductive layer <b>223</b> extends outwards and beyond the notch <b>250</b>. The conductive layer <b>223</b> may be formed by deposition totally. The electric connection between the conductive layer <b>223</b> and the corresponding circuit <b>221</b> form a T section. The conductive layer <b>223</b> is usually a metal, such as Cu or Al.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, an insulting layer, such as a solder mask <b>260</b> is formed on the bottom of the non-conductive substrate <b>210</b>. Apart from completely filling up the notch <b>250</b>, the solder mask <b>260</b> also selectively exposes the conductive layer <b>223</b> to leave some places for solders (not shown). Preferably, before the solder mask <b>260</b> is formed, the conductive layer <b>223</b> may be patterned in advance so that the conductive layer <b>223</b> which electrically connects different passive elements <b>222</b> may not mutually connect with one another to avoid shorting of passive elements <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Later, please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a solder <b>224</b> is formed on the exposed conductive layer <b>223</b> conventionally. The location of the solder <b>224</b> is always outside the notch <b>250</b> and directly electrically connected to the exposed conductive layer <b>223</b>. By means of the conductive layer <b>223</b>, the solder <b>224</b> serves as the media which electrically connects the corresponding circuit <b>221</b> in the multilayer structure <b>201</b> outwards. The solder <b>224</b> is usually a conductive material, such as metal.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, illustrating another example to remove some of the multilayer structure <b>201</b> from the non-conductive substrate <b>210</b> side and to form the notch <b>250</b>. The notch <b>250</b> has a tapered sidewall <b>252</b>, for example the notch <b>250</b> includes a bottom <b>251</b> and a tapered sidewall <b>252</b>. In this second embodiment, the consequently formed notch <b>250</b> not only penetrates the non-conductive substrate <b>210</b> upwards and makes the passive element <b>222</b> or the corresponding circuit <b>221</b> exposed, but also further enters the passivation layer <b>230</b>. Please refer to the first embodiment for the other steps of the second embodiment to form the conductive layer, the solder mask and the solder.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Third Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, illustrating another example to remove some of the multilayer structure <b>201</b> from the non-conductive substrate <b>210</b> side and to form the notch <b>250</b>. The notch <b>250</b> has a tapered sidewall <b>252</b>, for example the notch <b>250</b> includes a bottom <b>251</b> and a tapered sidewall <b>252</b>. In this third embodiment, the notch <b>250</b> which starts upwards from the bottom of the non-conductive substrate <b>210</b> not only penetrates the non-conductive substrate <b>210</b> and the passivation layer <b>230</b>, to make the passive element <b>222</b> or the corresponding circuit <b>221</b> exposed, but also at the same time the bottom <b>251</b> may further enter part of the non-conductive carrier <b>240</b>. Please refer to the first embodiment for the other steps of the third embodiment to form the conductive layer, the solder mask and the solder.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Fourth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>, illustrating another example to remove some of the multilayer structure <b>201</b> from the non-conductive carrier <b>240</b> side to form the notch <b>250</b>. The notch <b>250</b> has a substantially vertical sidewall <b>252</b>, for example the notch <b>250</b> includes a bottom <b>251</b> and a sidewall <b>252</b>. In this fourth embodiment, the notch <b>250</b> which starts downwards from the top surface of the non-conductive carrier <b>240</b> penetrates the non-conductive carrier <b>240</b> and the passivation layer <b>230</b> at the same time to make the passive element <b>222</b> or the corresponding circuit <b>221</b> exposed. Similarly, the thickness of the non-conductive carrier <b>240</b> may be optionally and suitably reduced to about 100 &#x3bc;m for example in advance before the notch <b>250</b> is formed. Please refer to the first embodiment for the other steps of the fourth embodiment to form the conductive layer, the solder mask and the solder.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Fifth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7E</figref>, illustrating another example to remove some of the multilayer structure <b>201</b> to form the notch <b>250</b>. In this fifth embodiment, there is no non-conductive carrier to be formed as described earlier but a passivation layer of composite structure is formed instead. For example, a second passivation layer <b>232</b> is formed on top of a first passivation layer <b>231</b>. Optionally, the first passivation layer <b>231</b> may be patterned in advance before the second passivation layer <b>232</b> is formed. The second passivation layer <b>232</b> may include polyimide.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Next, the notch <b>250</b> which starts downwards from the second passivation layer <b>232</b> side is formed. The notch <b>250</b> has a substantially vertical sidewall <b>252</b>, for example the notch <b>250</b> includes a bottom <b>251</b> and a sidewall <b>252</b>. In this embodiment, the notch <b>250</b> penetrates the first passivation layer <b>231</b> and the second passivation layer <b>232</b> at the same time to make the passive element <b>222</b> or the corresponding circuit <b>221</b> in the multilayer structure <b>201</b> exposed. Please refer to the first embodiment for the other steps of the fifth embodiment to form the conductive layer, the solder mask and the solder.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">After the previous steps, the package-ready multilayer structure <b>201</b> is obtained. Next, a subsequent dicing procedure, for example traditional processing procedures such as etching or mechanical methods is carried out through the notch <b>250</b> in the aligned and package-ready multilayer structure <b>201</b> or through the edges of the notch <b>250</b> to obtain multiple packaged multilayer structure <b>202</b> in single pieces, an integrated passive device (IPD) for instance. Optionally, the non-conductive carrier <b>240</b> may be removed after the subsequent dicing procedure is completed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A</figref>, <b>11</b>B, <b>11</b>C <b>11</b>D and <b>11</b>E each illustrates the results of the above-mentioned first embodiment, second embodiment, third embodiment, fourth embodiment and fifth embodiment after the dicing procedure is completed.</p>
