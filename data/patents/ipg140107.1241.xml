<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to airbag assemblies generally, more particularly to an assembly with a heat shield and diffuser combination affixed to an inflator.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Gas generators are commonly used to provide inflation gas to fill the inflatable cushion or airbag. These inflators come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Some use pressurized fluids contained inside the inflator, some use solid propellants, others use a combination of both of these.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">When the solid propellant is ignited using an electrical discharge to fire a squib, large amounts of inflation gases are generated very quickly. The inflator rapidly experiences a high pressure and rapid heating. Hot gases are expelled through outlets and fill the airbag rapidly. In addition to the hot gases burning particles and small debris also can be expelled. In some cases internal filters are used to capture the debris. The internal surface of the cushion is often coated with a heat resistant barrier to protect the cushion. In many cases the inflator is placed in a housing structure to secure the inflator and further protect the cushion airbag and the surrounding area.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In seat airbag designs, the inflator is tubular in shape. This inflator is held by a steel stamped retainer bracket and clamp ring with clinched studs and locking washers as shown in prior art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. This assembly requires several components that contribute to cost and assembly complexity.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an object of the present invention to eliminate components and to provide a superior heat shield protection against hot gases and burning particles. It is a further objective to have this heat shield function as a diffuser that can allow gases to be directed outwardly to fill the cushion.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">These and other objectives are achieved by the present invention as described and shown.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An airbag assembly has an airbag, a tubular inflator and a rolled heat shield wrapped about the inflator and interposed between the inflator and the airbag. The rolled heat shield completes at least one full wrap around and encircling a portion of the inflator wherein the portion of the inflator wrapped by the heat shield includes one or more gas outlets. The heat shield preferably is a fabric material.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The fabric material can be made in layers or wrapped about the inflator a plurality of times to form layers. The inner layers are sacrificial layers destroyed as inflation gases are expelled. The fabric material has a 840 denier or greater.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The inflator has a housing with two studs for attachment to a vehicle structure. The heat shield is secured to at least one of said studs. The heat shield has two or more openings for positioning over the at least one stud.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The heat shield is a fabric material with a length and a width and upon assembly to the inflator the length is wrapped a plurality of times about the inflator to form layers and the width of the fabric is sized to extend covering at least a portion of the inflator having gas outlets. The airbag has a neck portion with an opening to receive the inflator with the wrapped heat shield.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a seat airbag assembly <b>100</b> is shown in an exploded view. The airbag assembly <b>100</b> has a wiring harness <b>30</b>, a retainer clamp bracket <b>90</b>, a ring clamp <b>92</b> with projecting stud for passing through the retainer clamp bracket <b>90</b>, a lock washer <b>91</b> and an inflator <b>200</b>. In addition, the airbag cushion <b>40</b> is shown in a folded state represented by the rectangular box to the right of the inflator <b>200</b>. Upon assembly, the inflator <b>200</b> is passed into the clamp ring <b>92</b> and the nozzle end is inserted through an end of the bracket <b>90</b> in such a way to hold it into position; then the entire assembly is connected and mounted into a structure of a vehicle seat. As can be appreciated, these several components require additional manufacturing costs and time during the assembly process.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a new concept for a seat airbag assembly <b>10</b> is shown using the same wiring harness <b>30</b>; however, in this case the inflator <b>20</b> has a housing structure <b>21</b> with two studs <b>22</b> welded to the structure <b>21</b> and the airbag cushion <b>40</b> is shown again as a rectangular box. This creates an entire assembly <b>10</b> for the seat airbag design.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In order to use this new design, it is important that the nozzle end <b>24</b> of the inflator <b>20</b> be covered or protected in such a fashion that particles and burnt debris do not spew outward during emission of the gas generating inflator <b>20</b> that would cause the particles to burn through the airbag cushion <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an enlarged view of the inflator <b>20</b> is shown wherein the studs <b>22</b> are shown welded to the housing <b>21</b> and at the one end is the gas discharge nozzle <b>24</b>. It is from this discharge nozzle <b>24</b> that the inflation gases spew outward to fill the airbag cushion <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a heat shield wrap <b>50</b> is shown wrapped about the end of the inflator <b>20</b> with the nozzle <b>24</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, this heat shield wrap <b>50</b> encircles the entire nozzle end <b>24</b> and is wrapped in several layers; each layer is secured and positioned over a stud <b>22</b> on the inflator <b>20</b> housing structure <b>21</b>. This insertion over the stud <b>22</b> through openings <b>52</b> in the heat shield wrap <b>50</b> allows the wrap <b>50</b> to be securely positioned on the inflator <b>20</b> such that upon assembly to the seat when the studs <b>22</b> are bolted to the seat, the heat shield wrap <b>50</b> is simultaneously secured to the structure between the seat and the inflator <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, to better appreciate how this works the inflator is shown inside the neck <b>11</b> of an airbag cushion <b>40</b>. The inflator <b>20</b> with the heat shield wrap <b>50</b> is positioned inside the airbag <b>40</b>, the stud <b>22</b> projects through a reinforcement member <b>14</b> on the airbag <b>40</b> as illustrated to help secure the airbag cushion <b>40</b> to the seat assembly. The reinforcement member <b>14</b> can use any acceptable method of reinforcement such as an additional layer. In the illustrated embodiment, the reinforcement member <b>14</b> is a strap.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the heat shield wrap <b>50</b> is shown in a plan view. As illustrated, there is a plurality of holes <b>52</b> spaced in such a fashion that as the heat shield <b>50</b> is wrapped about the inflator <b>20</b> the holes <b>52</b> will align with the stud <b>22</b> and will be inserted over the stud <b>22</b>. This ensures that the entire heat shield wrap <b>50</b> can be wound several times about the inflator <b>20</b>, thus covering that portion of the inflator <b>20</b> with the nozzle or gas discharge opening <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Upon initiation of the inflator <b>20</b>, a pyrotechnic squib is fired through the wiring harness <b>30</b> in such a fashion that the propellant inside the inflator <b>20</b> is ignited generating gases. These gases spew out of the nozzle <b>24</b> and burnt particles and other debris may also be ejected from the inflator <b>20</b>. The heat shield <b>50</b>, being formed out of a fabric material wound in layers about the inflator <b>20</b>, creates sacrificial layers that may be destroyed adjacent the inflator <b>20</b> as the gases are being discharged; however, due to the fact that the heat shield <b>50</b> is wrapped, the gases are not prevented from spewing into the airbag as the wrap can be loosely or semi loosely wound about the inflator <b>20</b> so that between the adjacent layers on the inflator <b>20</b> there are sufficient gaps to allow the inflation gases to be expelled quickly into the airbag <b>40</b>, thus not limiting the time to fill the airbag <b>40</b>, but rather providing tremendous protection against flying burnt particles which impinge the inner layers of the heat shield <b>50</b>. It is important that the wrap <b>50</b> provide not only heat shield protection, but act as a diffuser for the gases exiting the nozzle <b>24</b>. This diffuser function can greatly be achieved by the tightness of the wrap by having the wrap wound sufficiently tight to keep it secure and yet sufficiently loose so the space between the inflator <b>20</b> and the adjacent layers allows the gases to freely permeate out through the ends of the heat shield <b>50</b> rapidly when filling the airbag <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As can be easily appreciated, the fabric material can be provided as an open woven material that easily lets gas expel or can be provided with some heat shield coating if so desired or believed needed. It is important to understand that the wrap <b>50</b> only needs to cover a small portion of the inflator <b>20</b>, that portion that allows the escaping gases to exit the device. As a result, it is believed that if the length of the fabric is sufficient to wrap two or more times, preferably three or more times, then a sufficient number of layers will be achieved. The width accordingly only needs to be as wide as needed to cover the escaping gases. As shown in the exemplary of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the length is approximately 330 mm and the width is approximately 60 mm. The width and length dimensions are only one example, these dimensions can be any suitable measurement for the particular application being used to provide the necessary heat shielding capability. As shown openings <b>52</b> are provided along the length so that the wrap <b>50</b> can be secured over the studs <b>22</b>. These openings <b>52</b> are approximately 6.5 mm in diameter and will fit over the studs <b>22</b> very conveniently. These dimensions are exemplary and it is understood can vary based on the shape and size of the inflator <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">This invention has benefit with an out-of-position occupant <b>2</b>, for example one seated on a seat <b>4</b> leaning on a window. The looped construction of the heat shield urges inflation gas to flow up and down and avoids accelerating the bag toward the occupant in view of the directions of gas flow. Therefore, this wrapped fabric works as a countermeasure to direct the deploying airbag <b>40</b> acceleration up and down as inflation gases flow outward of the inflator <b>20</b> and wrapped heat shield <b>50</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>.</p>
