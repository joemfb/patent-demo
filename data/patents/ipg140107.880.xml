<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Face masks find utility in a variety of medical, industrial and household applications by protecting the wearer from inhaling dust and other harmful airborne contaminates through their mouth or nose. The use of face masks is a recommended practice in the healthcare industry to help prevent the spread of disease. Face masks worn by healthcare providers help reduce infections in patients by filtering the air exhaled from the wearer thus reducing the number of harmful organisms or other contaminants released into the environment. Additionally, face masks protect the healthcare worker by filtering airborne contaminants and microorganisms from the inhaled air.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The section of the face mask that covers the nose and mouth is typically known as the body portion. The body portion of the mask may be comprised of several layers of material. At least one layer may be composed of a filtration material that prevents the passage of germs and other contaminants therethrough but allows for the passage of air so that the user may comfortably breathe. The porosity of the mask refers to how easily air is drawn through the mask. A more porous mask is easier to breathe through. The body portion may also contain multiple layers to provide additional functionality or attributes to the face mask. For example, many face masks include one or more layers of material on either side of the filtration media layer. Further components may be attached to the mask to provide additional functionality. A clear plastic face shield intended to protect the user's face from splashed fluid is one example.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">When using a properly donned face mask, the heat and moisture of the user's exhaled breath tends to concentrate inside. As this humidified air escapes the face mask, it can condense on the user's eye wear or face shield causing fogging which may hamper the sight of the healthcare worker.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A method to eliminate fogging of eye wear or face shields resides in providing a seal across the upper edge of the face mask and the user's face to prevent moisture from escaping upwards. Aside from being uncomfortable, the seal on the face of the user is not always complete and moisture may be able to escape therethrough. Additionally, moisture may escape through the body portion of the face mask and subsequently condense on the eye wear or face shield.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another attempt to reduce fogging has been made by providing an absorbent core between an inner and outer layer of the face mask. This approach may be problematic, for example, in that moisture may propagate along the inner surface of the inner layer of the face mask and exit therefrom so as to condense on the eye wear or face shield without contacting the absorbent core.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Various features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the following description, or may be obvious from the description, or may be learned from practice of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A face mask is provided in one exemplary embodiment that includes a body portion with an outer surface and an inner surface oppositely disposed to the outer surface. The face mask may also include an absorbent element located on at least one of the surfaces of the body portion. The absorbent element may be capable of absorbing at least 3.5 grams of water. The face mask is advantageous in that moisture and/or condensation produced through human respiration and/or perspiration may be absorbed by the absorbent element when the face mask is worn so as to reduce or eliminate fogging that may occur on eye wear worn by the user and/or to reduce condensation build-up on the face of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another exemplary embodiment of the face mask includes a body portion configured to be placed over the mouth and at least part of the nose of the user. The body portion isolates the mouth and the at least part of the nose of the user from the environment so that respiration air is drawn through the body portion and subsequently exhaled by the user through the body portion. The body portion has an outer surface that faces away from the user when worn and an inner facing surface that faces towards the user when worn. A fastening member may be included and may be attached to a body portion and configured for retaining the body portion onto the face of a user.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Definitions</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As used herein, the term &#x201c;nonwoven fabric or web&#x201d; means a web having a structure of individual fibers or threads which are interlaid, but not in an identifiable manner as in a knitted fabric. Nonwoven fabrics or webs have been formed from various processes such as, for example, meltblowing processes, spunbonding processes, and bonded carded web processes. The basis weight of nonwoven fabrics is usually expressed in ounces of material per square yard (osy) or grams per square meter (gsm) and the fiber diameters are usually expressed in microns. (Note that to convert from osy to gsm, multiply osy by 33.91).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As used herein, the term &#x201c;ultrasonic bonding&#x201d; refers to a process in which materials (fibers, webs, films, etc.) are joined by passing the materials between a sonic horn and anvil roll. An example of such a process is illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,374,888 to Bornslaeger, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As used herein, the term &#x201c;thermal point bonding&#x201d; involves passing materials (fibers, webs, films, etc.) to be bonded between a heated calender roll and a heated anvil roll. The calender roll is usually, though not always, engraved with a pattern in some way such that the entire fabric is not bonded across its entire surface. The surface of the anvil roll is usually flat and/or smooth. As a result, various patterns for calender rolls have been developed for functional as well as aesthetic reasons. Typically, the percent bonding area varies from around 10 percent to around 30 percent of the area of the fabric laminate. The bonded areas are typically discrete points or shapes and not interconnected. As is well known in the art, thermal point bonding holds the laminate layers together and imparts integrity and strength to the nonwoven material by bonding filaments and/or fibers together thereby limiting their movement.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As used herein, the term &#x201c;thermal pattern bonding&#x201d; involves passing materials (fibers, webs, films, etc.) to be bonded between a heated calender roll and an anvil roll as with thermal point bonding. The difference is that the bonded areas are interconnected producing discrete areas of unbonded fibers. Various patterns for calender rolls have been developed for functional as well as aesthetic reasons. Typically, the percent bonding area varies from around 10 percent to around 30 percent of the area of the fabric laminate.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As used herein, the term &#x201c;electret&#x201d; or &#x201c;electret treating&#x201d; refers to a treatment that imparts a charge to a dielectric material, such as a polyolefin. The charge includes layers of positive or negative charges trapped at or near the surface of the polymer, or charge clouds stored in the bulk of the polymer. The charge also includes polarization charges which are frozen in alignment of the dipoles of the molecules. Methods of subjecting a material to electret treating are well known by those skilled in the art. These methods include, for example, thermal, liquid-contact, electron beam, and corona discharge methods. One particular technique of subjecting a material to electret treating is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,401,466 to Foltz, the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes. This technique involves subjecting a material to a pair of electrical fields wherein the electrical fields have opposite polarities.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As used herein, the term &#x201c;spunbonded fibers&#x201d; refers to small diameter fibers which are formed by extruding molten thermoplastic material as filaments from a plurality of fine, usually circular capillaries of a spinneret with the diameter of the extruded filaments then being rapidly reduced to fibers as by, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,340,563 to Appel et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 3,692,618 to Dorschner et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,802,817 to Matsuki et al., U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,338,992 and 3,341,394 to Kinney, U.S. Pat. No. 3,502,763 to Hartman, and U.S. Pat. No. 3,542,615 to Dobo et al., the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes. Spunbond fibers are generally continuous and have diameters generally greater than about 7 microns, more particularly, between about 10 and about 40 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As used herein, the term &#x201c;meltblown fibers&#x201d; means fibers formed by extruding a molten thermoplastic material through a plurality of fine, usually circular, die capillaries as molten threads or filaments into converging high velocity, usually hot, gas (e.g. air) streams which attenuate the filaments of molten thermoplastic material to reduce their diameter, which may be to microfiber diameter. Thereafter, the meltblown fibers are carried by the high velocity gas stream and are deposited on a collecting surface to form a web of randomly disbursed meltblown fibers. Such a process is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,849,241 to Butin et al., the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes. Meltblown fibers are microfibers which may be continuous or discontinuous with diameters generally less than 10 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As used herein, the term &#x201c;stretch bonded laminate&#x201d; refers to a composite material having at least two layers in which one layer is a gatherable layer and the other layer is an elastic layer. The layers are joined together when the elastic layer is extended from its original condition so that upon relaxing the layers, the gatherable layer is gathered. Such a multilayer composite elastic material may be stretched to the extent that the nonelastic material gathered between the bond locations allows the elastic material to elongate. One type of stretch bonded laminate is disclosed, for example, by U.S. Pat. No. 4,720,415 to Vander Wielen et al., the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes. Other composite elastic materials are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,789,699 to Kieffer et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,781,966 to Taylor and U.S. Pat. No. 4,657,802 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,652,487 to Morman and U.S. Pat. No. 4,655,760 to Morman et al., the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;necking&#x201d; or &#x201c;neck stretching&#x201d; interchangeably refer to a method of elongating a nonwoven fabric, generally in the machine direction, to reduce its width (cross-machine direction) in a controlled manner to a desired amount. The controlled stretching may take place under cool, room temperature or greater temperatures and is limited to an increase in overall dimension in the direction being stretched up to the elongation required to break the fabric, which in most cases is about 1.2 to 1.6 times. When relaxed, the web retracts toward, but does not return to, its original dimensions. Such a process is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,443,513 to Meitner and Notheis, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,965,122, 4,981,747 and 5,114,781 to Morman and U.S. Pat. No. 5,244,482 to Hassenboehler Jr. et al., the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As used herein, the term &#x201c;necked material&#x201d; refers to any material which has undergone a necking or neck stretching process.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As used herein, the term &#x201c;reversibly necked material&#x201d; refers to a material that possesses stretch and recovery characteristics formed by necking a material, then heating the necked material, and cooling the material. Such a process is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,965,122 to Morman, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As used herein, the term &#x201c;neck bonded laminate&#x201d; refers to a composite material having at least two layers in which one layer is a necked, non-elastic layer and the other layer is an elastic layer. The layers are joined together when the non-elastic layer is in an extended (necked) condition. Examples of neck-bonded laminates are such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,226,992, 4,981,747, 4,965,122 and 5,336,545 to Morman, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As used herein, the term &#x201c;coform&#x201d; means a meltblown material to which at least one other material is added during the meltblown material formation. The meltblown material may be made of various polymers, including elastomeric polymers. Various additional materials may be added to the meltblown fibers during formation, including, for example, pulp, superabsorbent particles, cellulose or staple fibers. Coform processes are illustrated in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 4,818,464 to Lau and U.S. Pat. No. 4,100,324 to Anderson et al., the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As used herein, the term &#x201c;stitchbonded&#x201d; refers to a process in which materials (fibers, webs, films, etc.) are joined by stitches sewn or knitted through the materials. Examples of such processes are illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,891,957 to Strack et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 4,631,933 to Carey, Jr., the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As used herein, the term &#x201c;elastic&#x201d; refers to any material, including a film, fiber, nonwoven web, or combination thereof, which upon application of a biasing force, is stretchable to a stretched, biased length which is at least about 150 percent, or one and a half times, its relaxed, unstretched length, and which will recover at least 15 percent of its elongation upon release of the stretching, biasing force.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As used herein, the term &#x201c;extensible and retractable&#x201d; refers to the ability of a material to extend upon stretch and retract upon release. Extensible and retractable materials are those which, upon application of a biasing force, are stretchable to a stretched, biased length and which will recover a portion, preferably at least about 15 percent, of their elongation upon release of the stretching, biasing force.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;elastomer&#x201d; or &#x201c;elastomeric&#x201d; refer to polymeric materials that have properties of stretchability and recovery.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As used herein, the term &#x201c;stretch&#x201d; refers to the ability of a material to extend upon application of a biasing force. Percent stretch is the difference between the initial dimension of a material and that same dimension after the material has been stretched or extended following the application of a biasing force. Percent stretch may be expressed as [(stretched length B initial sample length)/initial sample length]&#xd7;100. For example, if a material having an initial length of one (1) inch is stretched 0.50 inch, that is, to an extended length of 1.50 inches, the material can be said to have a stretch of 50 percent.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As used herein, the term &#x201c;recover&#x201d; or &#x201c;recovery&#x201d; refers to a contraction of a stretched material upon termination of a biasing force following stretching of the material by application of the biasing force. For example, if a material having a relaxed, unbiased length of one (1) inch is elongated 50 percent by stretching to a length of one and one half (1.5) inches the material would have a stretched length that is 150 percent of its relaxed length. If this exemplary stretched material contracted, that is recovered to a length of one and one tenth (1.1) inches after release of the biasing and stretching force, the material would have recovered 80 percent (0.4 inch) of its elongation.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As used herein, the term &#x201c;composite&#x201d; refers to a material which may be a multicomponent material or a multilayer material. These materials may include, for example, spunbond-meltblown-spunbond, stretch bonded laminates, neck bonded laminates, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As used herein, the term &#x201c;polymer&#x201d; generally includes but is not limited to, homopolymers, copolymers, such as for example, block, graft, random and alternating copolymers, terpolymers, etc. and blends and modifications thereof. Furthermore, unless otherwise specifically limited, the term &#x201c;polymer&#x201d; shall include all possible geometrical configurations of the molecule. These configurations include, but are not limited to isotactic, syndiotactic and random symmetries.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">These terms may be defined with additional language in the remaining portions of the specification.</p>

Such elastic materials have been incorporated into composites, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,681,645 to Strack et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,493,753 to Levy et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,100,324 to Anderson et al., and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,540,976 to Shawver et al, the entire contents of these patents are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes. In an exemplary embodiment where an elastic film is used on or in the body portion <b>12</b>, the film may be sufficiently perforated to ensure that the user <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) can breathe through the body portion <b>12</b> if the face mask <b>10</b> is desired to be breathable in this location.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The intermediate layer <b>34</b> when configured as a filtration layer may be a meltblown nonwoven web and, in some embodiments, is electret treated. Electret treatment results in a charge being applied to the intermediate layer <b>34</b> that further increases filtration efficiency by drawing particles to be filtered toward the intermediate layer <b>34</b> by virtue of their electrical charge. Electret treatment can be carried out by a number of different techniques. One technique is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,401,446 to Tsai et al., the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes. Other methods of electret treatment are known in the art, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,215,682 to Kubik et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 4,375,718 to Wadsworth; U.S. Pat.

The expanded polytetrafluoroethylene membrane may be incorporated into a multi-layer composite, including, but not limited to, an outer nonwoven web layer <b>36</b>, an extensible and retractable layer, and an inner layer <b>32</b> comprising a nonwoven web.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">SMS may be used to comprise the layers <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>. SMS is a material that is made of meltblown fibers between two spunbond layers made of spunbonded fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Multiple layers of the face mask <b>10</b> may be joined by various methods, including adhesive bonding, thermal point bonding, or ultrasonic bonding. Although shown as having three layers <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>, it is to be understood that in other exemplary embodiments of the present invention, that the body portion <b>12</b> and/or the entire face mask <b>10</b> may be made of any number of layers.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The body portion <b>12</b> of the face mask <b>10</b> may be made of inelastic materials. Alternatively, the material used to construct the body portion <b>12</b> may be comprised of elastic materials, allowing for the body portion <b>12</b> to be stretched over the nose, mouth, and/or face of the user <b>14</b>. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) The face mask <b>10</b> of the present invention may be made of an elastic material that allows the face mask <b>10</b> to stretch in one or more directions. The use of an elastic material incorporated into the body portion <b>12</b> may allow for fuller coverage of the user's <b>14</b> face and provide for more flexibility in accommodating variously sized faces of the users <b>14</b>. Alternatively, the body portion <b>12</b> may be made of an inelastic material. As such, the material that makes up the face mask <b>10</b> may exhibit elastic or inelastic characteristics depending upon the user's <b>14</b> needs.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The body portion <b>12</b> of the face mask <b>10</b> may be configured so that it is capable of stretching across the face of the user <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) from ear to ear and/or nose to chin. The ability of the body portion <b>12</b> to stretch and recover may provide the face mask <b>10</b> with better sealing capabilities and a more comfortable fit than face masks <b>10</b> that have an inelastic body portion <b>12</b>. In order for the body portion <b>12</b> to stretch and recover, the body portion <b>12</b> may have at least one layer or a material that has stretch and recovery properties. Additionally, the entire face mask <b>10</b> may be composed of a material that has stretch and recovery properties in other exemplary embodiments. In certain exemplary embodiments, the percent recovery is about 15% and the percent stretch is between about 15-65%, in other embodiments the percent recovery is between about 20-40% stretch, and in still other embodiments the percent recovery is between about 25-30% stretch.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Elastomeric thermoplastic polymers may be used in the face mask <b>10</b> and may include block copolymers having the general formula A-B-A&#x2032; or A-B, where A and A&#x2032; are each a thermoplastic polymer endblock which contains a styrenic moiety such as a poly (vinyl arene) and where B is an elastomeric polymer midblock such as a conjugated diene or a lower alkene polymer. Block copolymers of the A-B-A&#x2032; type can have different or the same thermoplastic block polymers for the A and A&#x2032; blocks, and the present block copolymers are intended to embrace linear, branched and radial block copolymers. Examples of useful elastomeric resins include those made from block copolymers such as polyurethanes, copolyether esters, polyamide polyether block copolymers, ethylene vinyl acetates (EVA), block copolymers having the general formula A-B-A&#x2032; or A-B like copoly(styrene/ethylene-butylene), styrene-poly(ethylene-propylene)-styrene, styrene-poly(ethylene-butylene)-styrene, (polystyrene/poly(ethylene-butylene)/polystyrene, poly(styrene/ethylene-butylene/styrene) and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">One or more layers <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> of the face mask <b>10</b> may be made of a composite that is a neck bonded laminate in certain exemplary embodiments. The neck bonded laminate may utilize a necked material or a reversibly necked material. The necking process typically involves unwinding a material from a supply roll and passing it through a brake nip roll assembly at a given linear speed. A take-up roll or nip, operating at a linear speed greater than that of the brake nip roll, draws the material and generates the tension needed to elongate and neck the fabric. When a reversibly necked material is desired, the stretched material is heated and cooled while in a stretched condition. The heating and cooling of the stretched material causes additional crystallization of the polymer and imparts a heat set. The necked material or reversibly necked material is then bonded to an elastic material. Afterwards, the layer may be folded in order to form folds <b>28</b>. The resulting necked composite is extensible and retractable in the cross-machine direction, that is the direction perpendicular to the direction the material is moving when it is produced. Upon extension and release, the elastic material provides the force needed for the extended composite to retract.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In another exemplary embodiment, the composite making up one or more of the layers <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> may be a stretch bonded laminate. A stretch bonded laminate is formed by providing an elastic material, such as a nonwoven web, filaments, or film, extending the elastic material, attaching it to a gatherable material, and releasing the resulting laminate. A stretch bonded laminate is extensible and retractable in the machine direction, that is the direction that the material is moving when it is produced. A composite with multiple layers may be formed by providing the elastic layer and the gatherable layers, and subjecting it to this process either simultaneously or stepwise. The stretch bonded laminate may also include a necked material that is extensible and retractable in the cross-direction such that the overall laminate is extensible and retractable in at least two dimensions. As an illustration, to construct a two-layer composite that is extensible and retractable in at least two dimensions, an elastomeric meltblown nonwoven web is provided, the elastomeric meltblown nonwoven web is then extended in the machine direction, and the necked spunbonded nonwoven material is attached to the elastomeric meltblown nonwoven web by thermal bonding while the elastomeric meltblown web is extended. When the biasing force is released, the resulting composite is extensible and retractable in both the cross-direction and machine direction, due to the extensibility of the necked material and the use of the stretch bonding process, respectively.

<p id="p-0095" num="0094">A face mask <b>10</b> that included an absorbent element <b>22</b> in the form of an absorbent foam was attached to a breathing mannequin head. The breathing mannequin head exhaled warm, moist air in order to simulate human respiration. Eye wear was placed on the mannequin and the performance of the face mask was evaluated. The absorbent element <b>22</b> was found to successfully absorb moisture exhaled by the mannequin. The absorbent element <b>22</b> was an absorbent foam material.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">A face mask <b>10</b> was also provided with an absorbent element <b>22</b> that was an absorbent laminate. The face mask <b>10</b> was applied to the head of a mannequin capable of exhaling warm, moist air in order to simulate human respiration. Eye wear were placed on the mannequin and the performance of the face mask <b>10</b> was evaluated. The absorbent laminate making up the absorbent element <b>22</b> was found to successfully redirect airflow away from the eye wear resulting in fewer incidences of fogging, and the absorbent element <b>22</b> was found to successfully absorb moisture from the exhaled air of the mannequin.</p>
