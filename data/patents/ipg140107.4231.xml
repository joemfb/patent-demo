<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Manufacturing circuits with reference plane voids over vias with a strip segment interconnect permits routing critical signal paths over vias, while increasing via insertion capacitance only slightly. The transmission line reference plane defines voids above (or below) signal-bearing plated-through holes (PTHs) that pass through a rigid substrate core, so that the signals are not degraded by an impedance mismatch that would otherwise be caused by shunt capacitance from the top (or bottom) of the signal-bearing PTHs to the transmission line reference plane. In order to provide increased routing density, signal paths are routed over the voids, but disruption of the signal paths by the voids is prevented by including a conductive strip through the voids that reduces the coupling to the signal-bearing PTHs and maintains the impedance of the signal path conductor.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to integrated circuit internal package interconnects, and more particularly, to a methodology and multi-layer substrate that has improved signal integrity and impedance matching.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">High-density interconnect schemes for processor packages, as well as other very-large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits typically use a large number of circuit layers to connect one or more dies to electrical terminals disposed on one or more surfaces of the package, as well as to interconnect multiple dies in multi-die packages.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A typical stack-up for a present-day VLSI circuit substrate is fabricated in very thin layers on one or both sides of a rigid core that provides stiffness and stability to integrated circuit substrates, which may then be encapsulated after dies are attached. The core typically includes pass-through vias that have a larger diameter than the vias used between the thin circuit layers and that pass between thin insulating layers. For example, in a substrate having a core 800 &#x3bc;m thick, the diameter of the through vias may be 500 &#x3bc;m in diameter, while the outer layer interconnects may have vias only 50 &#x3bc;m in diameter. The reason for the larger diameter holes through the core is the relative thickness of the core, which makes reliable fabrication and resin/conductive filling of the vias more difficult than for vias between the thin insulating layers in the outer circuit layers that are laminated on the core.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Since the interconnect routing density directly determines the required size of the final package, routing resources are critical in an integrated circuit package and space is at a premium. However, for critical signal paths such as clock and high-speed logic signal distribution, transmission lines must be maintained throughout the signal path in order to prevent signal degradation. Therefore, a reference voltage plane (e.g., ground) metal layer is provided on the surface of the core, with voids around the via and interconnect areas at the surface(s) of the core so that a transmission line is provided for the next signal layer above/below the core surface metal layer(s). As a result, signal path conductors must be routed around the large diameter vias passing through the core which are not connected to the metal layer. Further, the signal path conductors must also be routed away from discontinuities in the metal layers(s) caused by the voids through which the vias pass, since the lack of reference voltage plane metal will cause a change in impedance of the transmission line. Therefore, the number of signal routing channels is severely limited by the presence of the large-diameter vias that extend through the core that provide signal paths, and the large-diameter vias that provide voltage planes other than the voltage plane connected to the core surface metal layer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The above-incorporated U.S. patent application provides additional routing channels by providing continuous reference plane metal adjacent to conductive signal paths, and frees additional signal routing channels over reference voltage vias by providing reference plane metal between the ends of the vias and any signal paths routed above or below the via ends. Disruption of signals carried by signal-bearing vias is avoided by providing voids in the reference plane metal above or below the ends of the signal-bearing vias. However, in such designs, routing is still critically limited by the inability to route signal paths over the signal-bearing vias.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is therefore desirable to provide a multi-layer integrated circuit, substrate and method that maintain signal integrity and impedance matching in an integrated circuit package while providing an increased amount of signal routing channels, including channels routed over signal-bearing vias.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The objective of improving signal integrity and impedance matching in a multi-layer integrated circuit substrate while permitting routing over signal bearing vias is provided in an integrated circuit substrate, and methods for making and designing the integrated circuit substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The substrate includes a core having large diameter vias and at least one signal layer having signal conductors having a width substantially smaller than the diameter of the large diameter vias. The signal conductors are connected to large diameter vias by a small diameter portion passing through a first insulating layer disposed between the core and a transmission line reference plane metal layer, and a second insulating layer disposed between the transmission line reference plane metal layer and the signal layer.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The transmission line reference plane metal layer defines voids having an area larger than the area of signal-bearing large diameter vias, so that the presence of the transmission line reference plane metal layer does not cause substantial insertion capacitance with respect to critical signals. For signal-bearing vias over which critical signal paths are routed, a conductive stripe extends across the voids to isolate the critical signal conductive paths from the ends of the signal-bearing vias. The width of the stripes may be equal to the width of the critical signal conductive paths, or the width may be determined by the relative criticality of the signals. The more critical the signal borne by the conductive path is to the signal borne by the conductive via, the wider the stripe and vice-versa.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present invention concerns integrated circuit package substrates and methods of designing and making the substrates provide for routing of conductive signal paths over signal-bearing vias, while solving impedance matching and isolation problems associated with prior art substrates. As in the above-incorporated U.S. patent application &#x201c;MULTI-LAYER CIRCUIT SUBSTRATE AND METHOD HAVING IMPROVED TRANSMISSION LINE INTEGRITY AND INCREASED ROUTING DENSITY&#x201d;, metal reference planes are used to provide transmission line characteristics for signal paths and voids are included in the metal reference planes over signal-bearing vias to prevent insertion capacitance mismatches. However, in the present invention, voids over which conductive signal paths are routed include conductive &#x201c;stripes&#x201d; extending across the vias in line with the conductive signal path, effectively splitting the voids into two voids (or more if multiple signal paths are routed over the via, as a strip could be provided for each signal path). The stripes also reduce cross-coupling between the signal path and the via, as the fields associated with the signal path are more contained due to the presence of the stripe.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The stripe width is generally equal to that of the conductive signal path, but may be altered to reduce fringing effects on impedance or may be tailored to the relative criticality of the individual signals on the via and the conductive signal path. Since the ideal condition for proper impedance matching along the conductive signal path is the absence of any void at all, and the ideal condition for eliminating insertion capacitance at the ends of the void is the absence of the metal reference plane (or at least a complete void), the present invention involves a trade-off between preserving the signal on the conductive signal path and preserving the signal on the signal-bearing via. Therefore, since the width of the stripe is proportional to the performance of one signal and inversely proportional to the other signal, the relative criticality of the signals can be used to determine the appropriate width.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The stripe is also generally centered in the void (or, in other terms, between the two partial voids formed by splitting the void), but that is not a limitation of the present invention. Signal routing considerations may require an offset from a central diameter of the void, or the direction of the signal path and stripe may change as the signal crosses the void. In general, the shape and position of the stripe may reflect any shape and position of the conductive signal path in order to maintain a level of impedance matching that is improved over the performance obtainable in the absence of the stripe.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, an integrated circuit package substrate in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is shown. The substrate includes a core <b>10</b> including through-via conductors provided by resin-filled plated-through hole (RFPs) <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>C. Metal layers are formed by plating, deposition or laminating on both sides of core <b>10</b> containing jog stubs <b>14</b>A-<b>14</b>C and areas of reference voltage plane layer <b>11</b>, with an insulating layer <b>15</b> laminated above stubs <b>14</b>A-<b>14</b>C and reference voltage plane layer <b>11</b>. A transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>17</b> is laminated, or otherwise deposited, above insulating layer <b>15</b> and a second insulating layer <b>19</b> is laminated, or otherwise deposited, above transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>17</b>. A signal layer including signal path conductors <b>18</b> is laminated or otherwise deposited above insulating layer <b>19</b>. For each critical signal-bearing RFP <b>12</b>A, large-diameter voids <b>13</b> in transmission line reference plane metal layers <b>17</b> are provided above and below ends of signal-bearing RFPs <b>12</b>A, which reduces the shunt capacitance from signal-bearing RFP <b>12</b>A to transmission line reference plane metal layers <b>17</b>. In the present invention, a stripe <b>20</b> extends across the void <b>13</b> above signal-bearing RFP <b>12</b>A, which provides some shunt (insertion) capacitance, as mentioned above. However, stripe <b>20</b> reduces coupling between a signal path conductor <b>18</b>A that is routed above signal-bearing RFP <b>12</b>A, and further provides a much-improved impedance profile to signal path conductor <b>18</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">While the void portions surrounding stripe <b>20</b> are devoid of metal, in practice, the void portions will generally be filled with dielectric, lamination adhesive or other non-conductive material.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Signal-bearing RFPs <b>12</b>A are connected to signal path conductors <b>18</b> by stubs <b>14</b>A and small-diameter vias <b>16</b>A. Without large diameter voids <b>13</b>, the shunt capacitance from the ends of signal-bearing RFP <b>12</b>A to transmission line reference plane metal layers <b>17</b> will cause signal degradation greater than that caused by the presence of stripe <b>20</b>. Voltage plane RFPs <b>12</b>B and <b>12</b>C (and optionally RFPs bearing non-critical signals) have no corresponding large-diameter voids in transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>17</b>, which increases their distributed capacitance by the shunt capacitance from RFPs <b>12</b>B, <b>12</b>C to transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>17</b>, which is generally desirable. Therefore, the stripes of the present invention are generally used over signal-bearing vias, and generally only when a conductive signal path is routed over a signal-bearing via.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Reference plane RFP <b>12</b>B, which corresponds to the voltage plane to which transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>17</b> is connected, has a stub <b>14</b>B connecting to transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>17</b> through a small via <b>16</b>B. Blind vias connected to transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>17</b> can further be used in connections to signal path layers added above the layer containing signal conductors <b>18</b>, to provide electrical connection to the particular voltage plane connected to transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>17</b>, if needed. Therefore, no void (and therefore, no stripe) is needed in transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>17</b> above reference plane RFP <b>12</b>B. Other voltage plane RFPs <b>12</b>C will generally require formation of vias <b>16</b>C extending to other layers above transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>17</b> from stubs <b>14</b>C. Small-diameter voids <b>13</b>A provide connection to other voltage plane RFPs <b>12</b>C and extend only above the ends of stubs <b>14</b>C, for signal routing channels above transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>17</b> above the top ends (and beneath the bottom ends for layers applied beneath core <b>10</b>, not specifically shown) of other voltage plane RFPs <b>12</b>C. The voltage plane used to provide a reference to transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>17</b> may be a power supply voltage supplying the input/output drivers (the I/O signal reference and/or return voltage) or ground.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a top view of the integrated circuit package substrate of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is shown. Voids <b>13</b> are defined by transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>17</b>, with additional metal removed above signal path stubs <b>14</b>A and small diameter voids <b>13</b>A for vias <b>16</b>A that connect signal path stubs <b>14</b>A to other signal layers. The resulting integrated circuit package substrate has improved isolation between signal path conductors <b>18</b> routed over the continuous portions of transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>17</b>, while eliminating the shunt capacitance from signal-bearing RFPs <b>12</b>A to metal layer <b>17</b>, when no stripe is present and reducing the shunt capacitance when a stripe is present. Large diameter via <b>12</b>A is illustrated with a conductive signal path <b>18</b>A routed above and a stripe <b>20</b> included in void <b>13</b>B. Stripe <b>20</b> has been widened slightly for illustrative purposes, and another strip <b>20</b>A is shown without a corresponding conductive path or via for clarity.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Thus, in the present invention increased routing channels are provided in the regions extending over the top ends (or bottom ends) of all of RFPs <b>12</b>A, <b>12</b>B and <b>12</b>C. Thus, the substrate of the present invention provides improved signal performance in signal paths, providing for higher processor or other VLSI circuit operating frequencies, while providing increased routing flexibility by providing more routing channels that can have adequate signal performance no matter whether signal paths are routed above core RFPs that carry power distribution and/or non-critical signals as described in the above-incorporated U.S. patent application, or routed above signal bearing RFPs such as RFP <b>12</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2G</figref>, a method of making an integrated circuit substrate and integrated circuit in accordance with an embodiment of the invention is shown. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, starting from a core dielectric layer <b>40</b> having via holes <b>41</b> formed therein, holes <b>41</b> are filled with resin/metal to form PTHs <b>42</b>. Stubs <b>44</b> and reference plane areas <b>43</b> are formed on both surfaces of core <b>40</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. An insulating layer <b>45</b> is then applied to one or both sides of the core dielectric layer <b>40</b>, over stubs <b>44</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>. Next, insulating layer <b>45</b> is opened to generate small-diameter via holes, forming insulating layer <b>55</b>. Then, metal is added in the small-diameter via holes to form small vias <b>56</b> to connect to voltage plane RFPs as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>. Next, a transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>58</b> with voids <b>57</b> and stripes <b>58</b>A-<b>58</b>C is applied as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>. Stripes <b>58</b>A and <b>58</b>C illustrate stripe for conductive paths extending perpendicular to the page of the Figure, and stripe <b>58</b>B illustrates a stripe for a conductive path extending along the plane of the Figure. Voids <b>57</b>, including the void portions around stripes <b>58</b>A-<b>58</b>C will generally be filled with dielectric insulating material or lamination adhesive as described above. Both the insulating layer <b>55</b> and transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>58</b> may be applied as laminates, or the insulating layer may be deposited and/or transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>58</b> may be plated atop insulating layer <b>55</b>. Voids <b>57</b> and stripes <b>58</b>A-<b>58</b>C may be pre-formed in transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>58</b> or etched. Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>, another insulating layer <b>60</b> is applied in a manner similar to that for insulating layer <b>55</b>, and small voids <b>62</b> are formed or pre-formed in insulating layer <b>60</b> for connection to signal RFPs. Finally, blind vias <b>64</b> and a signal layer <b>66</b> are formed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref> that provide electrical connection to signal RFPs. Conductive signal path <b>66</b>A corresponding to stripe <b>58</b>A, conductive signal path <b>66</b>B corresponding to stripe <b>58</b>B and conductive signal path <b>66</b>C corresponding to stripe <b>58</b>C are also shown, which form part of signal layer <b>66</b>. Blind vias <b>64</b> and signal layer <b>66</b> may be formed at the same time, for example, by plating, or blind vias <b>64</b> may be formed first by filling or plating and then signal layer <b>66</b> laminated or plated to connect to blind vias <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref>, an integrated circuit in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is shown. The substrate of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref> is further modified by adding further signal layers, and optionally voltage plane layers on one or both sides of the core dielectric layer <b>40</b>. As illustrated another insulating layer <b>55</b>A and signal layer <b>76</b>A are added, but in practice, numerous other layers may be added. A semiconductor die <b>70</b> is attached to lands or other structures accessible from the top layer of the substrate shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref> and terminals or lands (not shown) may similarly be added to the bottom side of the substrate after other circuit layers are added. Alternatively, lands can be formed directly on the bottom side of core dielectric layer <b>40</b> or terminals may be attached to the bottom side of RFPs <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, performance benefits and trade-offs of the present invention are shown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a reflection trace <b>80</b>A representing performance of a 28 &#x3bc;m wide conductive signal path routed over a via that is 150 &#x3bc;m in diameter and including a 28 &#x3bc;m wide stripe under the conductive signal path. An improvement of 3 dB at 10 GHz is shown (in reduction of reflection) over reflection trace <b>80</b>B, which is for the same configuration without the stripe. However, as mentioned above, including the stripe changes the performance of the signal-bearing via. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a reflection trace <b>82</b>A for the configuration including the stripe, which is approximately 3 dB higher in reflection at 10 GHz for the configuration without the stripe, which is illustrated by reflection trace <b>82</b>B. However, as is noted from the Figures, the effect of the void/via on performance of the signal path routed over the via is greater than the effect of the stripe on the performance of the signal path that includes the via. Therefore, absolute reflection level and improvement should be taken into account in any design, as well as optionally the relative criticality of the signals.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a workstation computer system <b>100</b> is shown in which the methods of the present invention are carried out in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, according to program instructions that may be embodied in a computer program product in accordance with a present invention, for example program instructions stored on a CD-ROM disc CD. Workstation computer system includes a processor <b>102</b> for executing the program instructions coupled to a memory <b>104</b> for storing the program instructions, data and results used in designing integrated circuit substrates in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. Workstation computer system <b>100</b> also includes peripheral devices such as CD-ROM drive <b>105</b> for reading discs such as CD in order to load the program instructions into workstation computer <b>100</b>. Input devices, such as a keyboard <b>107</b>A and a mouse <b>107</b>B are coupled to workstation computer system <b>100</b> for receiving user input. A graphical display <b>106</b> for displaying results such as the layout of metal layer <b>17</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1B</figref>, substrate layer designs as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2G</figref> and test data or simulations such as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref>. The depicted workstation computer <b>100</b> is only exemplary and illustrates one type of computer system and arrangement suitable for carrying out the design methods of the present invention. The design methods generally identify the locations of signal bearing vias and generate a mask design for a transmission line reference plane metal layer that includes voids around the profile of the signal-bearing vias so that capacitive coupling between the ends of the signal-bearing vias and the transmission line reference plane metal layer is substantially reduced. The locations of conductive signal paths routed over the signal-bearing vias is also identified and stripes inserted to reduce coupling and match impedance of the conductive signal path. The design methods may also consider the relative criticality of signals on the signal-bearing voids and conductive signal path and adjust the width of the stripes to optimize trade-offs in performance.</p>
