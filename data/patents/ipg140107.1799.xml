<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">People rely on disposable absorbent products in their everyday lives, including such articles as adult incontinence products, enuresis pants, training pants, and diapers. Many manufacturers seek to better meet the needs of users of such products. For example, there is a need to further improve fit, discretion, and leakage protection for many products. With certain products, such as adult incontinence underwear and enuresis pants, it is important that the garment feel as much as possible like &#x201c;regular&#x201d; underwear to promote an improved sense of normalcy to the wearer who suffers from incontinence or enuresis. Many conventional pant-like, pull-on style absorbent garments currently on the market employ a product chassis in which multiple threads of elastic are sandwiched between two nonwoven fabric layers. The strands extend around the body, such that the elastic forces extend primarily around the wearer's waist, as is the case with traditional cloth briefs. This design can provide good fit and leakage performance, but has the potential to be further improved in terms of looking and feeling even more like &#x201c;regular&#x201d; cloth underwear. In many instances, it is possible to also sandwich leg elastic strands between the nonwoven fabric layers.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">One class of materials that offers the potential to make absorbent garments more &#x201c;underwear-like&#x201d; is that of elastomeric film laminates. Elastomeric film laminates are typically elastomeric films sandwiched between two nonwoven fabric layers. The films provide elastic properties similar to elastic threads, but offer a smoother, more uniform appearance. Some products currently on the market employ such elastomeric laminates, and utilize a &#x201c;three-piece&#x201d; pant construction in which front and back body panels are each constructed of an elastomeric film laminate and are connected together via an absorbent insert that extends between them. Such designs, however, can in certain instances introduce a difficulty. It is frequently desirable to include additional elasticization around the leg openings. In certain configurations, it may not be possible to simply sandwich additional leg elastic threads between the two nonwoven layers, such as when the elastomeric film laminate is a &#x201c;pre-laminated&#x201d; sandwich of an elastomeric film layer between two nonwoven layers. Instead, the leg elastic threads must be affixed to an outer surface of the elastomeric film laminate. In such instances, it is usually necessary to provide an additional layer of material to seal around the elastic threads and any associated adhesive, thereby holding the elastic threads in place on the elastomeric film laminate. Various efforts have been made to achieve this end, but they have been unsatisfactory. What is needed is improved methods of securing leg elastics to elastomeric film laminate body panels in disposable absorbent garments, in part to help, in certain instances, to simplify and improve the high speed manufacture of such garments.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To meet the above-described unmet needs in the art, a new process for making pant-like disposable garments, and a garment made thereby, has been invented.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one aspect, the present invention relates to a method to incorporate leg elastic members into pant-like disposable absorbent garments. In particular embodiments, the method includes supplying an elastomeric film laminate first body panel web and an elastomeric film laminate second body panel web, both webs traveling in a machine direction, the first body panel web being spaced from the second body panel web in a cross-machine direction, the elastomeric film laminate first body panel web and the elastomeric film laminate second body panel web each comprising an elastomeric film layer and at least one nonwoven layer. The method can further include supplying a continuous first leg elastic member and a continuous second leg elastic member, both leg elastic members traveling in the machine direction. The method can further include attaching the first leg elastic member to the first body panel web and attaching the second leg elastic member to the second body panel web. The method can further include supplying a continuous leg elastic covering web traveling in the machine direction. The method can further include attaching the leg elastic covering web to both the first body panel web and the second body panel web so as to sandwich the first leg elastic member between the first body panel web and the leg elastic covering web and so as to sandwich the second leg elastic member between the second body panel web and the leg elastic covering web, thereby creating a composite web.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another aspect, the present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a plurality of pant-like disposable absorbent garments. In particular embodiments, the method includes supplying an elastomeric film laminate first body panel web traveling in a machine direction and defining a waist edge extending in the machine direction and a leg edge extending in the machine direction. The method can further include supplying an elastomeric film laminate second body panel web traveling in the machine direction and defining a waist edge extending in the machine direction and a leg edge extending in the machine direction, the elastomeric film laminate first body panel web and the elastomeric film laminate second body panel web each comprising an elastomeric film layer sandwiched between two nonwoven facing layers. The method can further include positioning the first and second body panel webs in a non-overlapping relationship such that their respective leg edges are spaced apart from each other in a cross-machine direction a first distance, and such that their respective waist edges are spaced apart from each other in the cross-machine direction a second distance. The method can further include supplying a continuous first leg elastic member and a continuous second leg elastic member, both leg elastic members traveling in the machine direction. The method can further include attaching the first leg elastic member to the first body panel web at least partially adjacent the leg edge of the first body panel web, and attaching the second continuous leg elastic member to the second body panel web at least partially adjacent the leg edge of the second body panel web. The method can further include supplying a continuous leg elastic covering web traveling in the machine direction and which defines a first edge, a second edge, and a width extending between the first edge and the second edge in the cross-machine direction, wherein the covering web width is greater than said first distance and less than said second distance. The method can further include superposing the leg elastic covering web over the first and second body panel webs. The method can further include attaching the leg elastic covering web to both the first body panel web and the second body panel web so as to sandwich the first leg elastic member between the first body panel web and the leg elastic covering web and so as to sandwich the second leg elastic member between the second body panel web and the leg elastic covering web. The method can further include attaching an absorbent composite to the leg elastic covering web to create a composite garment web. The method can further include folding the composite garment web along a centerline that extends in the machine direction, such that the first body panel web waist edge is brought into close proximity with the second body panel web waist edge; attaching the first body panel web to the second body panel web along a series of garment side seam bonds spaced apart in the machine direction; and cutting the composite garment web at a series of cut locations spaced apart in the machine direction to create the plurality of pant-like disposable absorbent garments.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In yet another aspect, the present invention relates to a pant-like disposable absorbent garment. In particular embodiments, the garment defines a longitudinal direction and a lateral direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction. The garment has a front region defining a front waist end edge, a back region defining a back waist end edge, and a crotch region longitudinally between the front and back regions. The crotch region defines two laterally opposed crotch side edges, and the garment defines a garment length extending from the front waist end edge to the back waist end edge. The garment includes an elastomeric film laminate front panel which defines a front panel waist edge, a front panel leg edge spaced longitudinally inward from the front panel waist edge, and first and second laterally opposed front panel side edges which extend longitudinally between the front panel waist edge and the front panel leg edge. The garment further includes an elastomeric film laminate back panel which defines a back panel waist edge, a back panel leg edge spaced longitudinally inward from the back panel waist edge, and first and second laterally opposed back panel side edges which extend longitudinally between the back panel waist edge and the back panel leg edge. The front panel is longitudinally spaced apart from the back panel. The garment further includes at least one front leg elastic member disposed adjacent the front panel leg edge, and at least one back leg elastic member disposed adjacent the back panel leg edge. The garment further includes a leg elastic covering panel which extends between and interconnects the front panel to the back panel such that the front leg elastic member is sandwiched between the leg elastic covering panel and the front panel and such that the back leg elastic member is sandwiched between the leg elastic covering panel and the back panel. A length of the leg elastic covering panel is less than the garment length. The garment can further include an absorbent composite attached to the leg elastic covering panel, as well as a pair of side seams connecting the front region to the back region, thereby defining a waist opening and a pair of leg openings.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In particular embodiments, the present invention can provide an efficient and process friendly technique to cover and hold in place leg elastic members in a pant-style disposable garment that employs elastomeric film laminates, particularly &#x201c;pre-made&#x201d; or &#x201c;pre-laminated&#x201d; elastomeric film laminates.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref> shall be made in describing various aspects and embodiments of the invention. It should be noted that the embodiments depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref> are merely representative examples of the process and garment aspects of the invention. Although for illustrative purposes certain features of the present invention shall be described and illustrated with respect to an adult incontinence garment, the various aspects and embodiments of the present invention are also suitable for use with disposable diapers, disposable swim pants, disposable training pants, disposable enuresis garments, and the like. Unless otherwise stated, all length and width dimensions referred to herein contemplate that such dimensions are measured while the garment or web is in a laid-flat and fully stretched condition, and prior to (in the case of garment dimensions) the joining of the front and back regions along side seams. Furthermore, unless otherwise stated, if a length or width measurement varies depending on where the measurement is taken (for example, if a scalloped edge causes a dimension to vary depending on where along the scalloped edge the measurement is taken), the length or width measurement for purposes herein is the maximum length or width that can be measured for that feature.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The present invention relates in certain aspects to techniques to incorporate leg elastic members into pant-like disposable absorbent garments, and to methods for manufacturing a plurality of pant-like disposable absorbent garments employing such techniques. In particular embodiments, as representatively illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the method <b>100</b> includes supplying an elastomeric film laminate first body panel web <b>110</b> (such as via roll supply <b>115</b>) and an elastomeric film laminate second body panel web <b>120</b> (such as via roll supply <b>125</b>), both webs traveling in a machine direction <b>102</b>. The first body panel web <b>110</b> is spaced from the second body panel web <b>120</b> in a cross-machine direction <b>103</b>. The elastomeric film laminate first body panel web <b>110</b> and the elastomeric film laminate second body panel web <b>120</b> each comprise an elastomeric film layer <b>105</b> and at least one nonwoven layer <b>106</b>. Preferably, the elastomeric film layer <b>105</b> is sandwiched between two nonwoven layers <b>106</b>, <b>106</b>. U.S. Patent Application Publications US 2008/0095978 and US 2009/0197041, both assigned to Kimberly-Clark Worldwide, Inc. and incorporated by reference herein to the extent not inconsistent herewith, provide examples of technology suitable for use in creating elastomeric film laminates suitable for use with the present invention, although other elastomeric film laminates can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In particular embodiments, the elastomeric film laminate first body panel web <b>110</b> defines a waist edge <b>111</b> that extends in the machine direction <b>102</b> and a leg edge <b>112</b> that extends in the machine direction <b>102</b>. Similarly, the elastomeric film laminate second body panel web <b>120</b> in particular embodiments defines a waist edge <b>121</b> that extends in the machine direction <b>102</b> and a leg edge <b>122</b> that extends in the machine direction <b>102</b>. The method further can comprise positioning the first and second body panel webs <b>110</b>/<b>120</b> in a non-overlapping relationship such that their respective leg edges <b>112</b>/<b>122</b> are spaced apart from each other in a cross-machine direction <b>103</b> a first distance <b>130</b>, and such that their respective waist edges <b>111</b>/<b>121</b> are spaced apart from each other in the cross-machine direction <b>103</b> a second distance <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In particular embodiments, the method further includes supplying a continuous first leg elastic member <b>140</b> and a continuous second leg elastic member <b>142</b>, both leg elastic members <b>140</b>/<b>142</b> traveling in the machine direction <b>102</b>. Each leg elastic member <b>140</b>/<b>142</b> can comprise a single ribbon, strand, or thread (or the like) of elastic material, or each can comprise two (as shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>), three, or more ribbons, strands, or threads (or the like) of elastic material. The method further includes attaching the first leg elastic member <b>140</b> to the first body panel web <b>110</b> and attaching the second leg elastic member <b>142</b> to the second body panel web <b>120</b>. Desirably, as representatively illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the first leg elastic member <b>140</b> is attached to the first body panel web <b>110</b> at least partially adjacent the leg edge <b>112</b> of the first body panel web <b>110</b>, and the second continuous leg elastic member <b>142</b> is attached to the second body panel web <b>120</b> at least partially adjacent the leg edge <b>122</b> of the second body panel <b>120</b>. In certain embodiments, the first leg elastic member <b>140</b> extends in the machine direction <b>102</b> in a straight-line path, and the second leg elastic member <b>142</b> extends in a non-straight-line path in the machine direction <b>102</b>. In other embodiments, such as that representatively illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, both the first leg elastic member <b>140</b> and the second leg elastic member <b>142</b> extend in a non-straight-line path in the machine direction <b>102</b>. Elastic ribbons, strands, threads, and the like suitable for use in disposable absorbent garments are known in the art, one example being LYCRA brand elastic filaments, available from the Dupont Corporation. In certain embodiments, it may be desirable to reduce or eliminate the ability of the elastic strands to impart gathering forces in selected regions of an absorbent garment. For example, if it is desired to reduce or eliminate the gathering capacity of the elastic strands in the laterally central region of the garment (such as over the absorbent composite <b>50</b>), the elastic strands may be severed, such as via front leg elastic chopper <b>141</b> and back leg elastic chopper <b>143</b>, so that the elastic strands &#x201c;snap back&#x201d; a selected distance and such that the elastic strands do not pass over the laterally central region of the garment. Such configuration is depicted in FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b>-<b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The method further comprises supplying a continuous leg elastic covering web <b>150</b> traveling in the machine direction <b>102</b>. The leg elastic covering web <b>150</b> may comprise, for example, any suitable nonwoven material, such as spunbond, spunbond-meltblown laminates, bonded-carded webs, and the like. In particular embodiments, such as that representatively illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the leg elastic covering web <b>150</b> defines a first edge <b>151</b>, a second edge <b>153</b>, and a width <b>155</b> extending between the first edge <b>151</b> and the second edge <b>153</b> in the cross-machine direction, and the covering web width <b>155</b> is greater than the first distance <b>130</b> and less than the second distance <b>132</b>. After superposing the leg elastic covering web <b>150</b> over (or under) the first and second body panel webs <b>110</b>/<b>120</b>, the method further comprises attaching the leg elastic covering web <b>150</b> to both the first body panel web <b>110</b> and the second body panel web <b>120</b> so as to sandwich the first leg elastic member <b>140</b> between the first body panel web <b>110</b> and the leg elastic covering web <b>150</b> and so as to sandwich the second leg elastic member <b>142</b> between the second body panel web <b>120</b> and the leg elastic covering web <b>150</b>, thereby creating a composite web <b>160</b>. The composite web defines a composite web width <b>162</b> which extends in the cross-machine direction <b>103</b>, which is the width between the two transversely outermost edges of the composite process web assembly. In particular embodiments, the composite web width <b>162</b> is greater than the cross-machine direction width <b>155</b> of the leg elastic covering web <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In particular embodiments, the method can comprise supplying a first waistband web <b>170</b> (such as via roll supply <b>171</b>) and a second waistband web <b>180</b> (such as via roll supply <b>181</b>), and can further comprise attaching the first waistband web <b>170</b> to the first body panel <b>110</b> (such as at attachment station <b>172</b>) and attaching the second waistband web <b>180</b> to the second body panel <b>120</b> (such as at attachment station <b>182</b>). The waistband webs can be inherently elastomeric (such as via the use of an elastomeric film laminate material). Alternatively, waist elastic strands could be affixed to the front and/or back waistband webs to impart elasticity thereto. For example, the waistband webs could be inherently non-elastomeric but made to be elastomeric by affixing elastic strands thereto (such as by sandwiching elastic strands between two nonwoven webs or by enveloping elastic strands within a single, &#x201c;C-folded&#x201d; nonwoven web). Each first elastic waistband web defines a proximal edge <b>173</b> and a distal edge <b>174</b>, and each second waistband web defines a proximal edge <b>183</b> and a distal edge <b>184</b>. In embodiments that include waistband webs, the width <b>162</b> of the composite web <b>160</b> is the width extending in the cross-machine direction between the first waistband web distal edge <b>174</b> and the second waistband web distal edge <b>184</b>, as is representatively illustrated depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
