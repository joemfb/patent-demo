<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the priority of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2011-0144221 filed on Dec. 28, 2011, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a transformer and to a power module having the same and, more particularly, to a transformer capable of securing insulating reliability and a power module having the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various kinds of power supplies are required in various electronic devices such as a TV (Television), a monitor, a personal computer (PC), an office automation (OA) device, and the like. Therefore, these electronic devices generally include power supplies converting alternating current (AC) power supplied from the outside into power having an appropriate level for individual electronic appliances.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Recently, among power supply devices, a power supply device using a switching mode (e.g., a switched mode power supply (SMPS)) has been commonly used, and such an SMPS generally includes a switching transformer.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In general, a switching transformer converts AC power of 85V-265V into DC power of 3V-30V by high frequency oscillations of 25 KHz-100 KHz. Thus, in comparison to a general transformer which converts AC power of 85V-265V into AC power of 3V-30V by frequency oscillations of 50 Hz-60 Hz, the size of a core and a bobbin of a switching transformer can be significantly reduced, and since a switching transformer stably supplies DC power having low voltage and low current to electronic application devices, a switching transformer is extensively used in electronic application devices, the trend of which is reductions in size.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A switching transformer may have high energy conversion efficiency when designed to have low leakage inductance. However, as the size of a switching transformer is reduced, it may be difficult to design a switching transformer having low leakage inductance.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Also, when a compact transformer is fabricated, a primary coil and a secondary coil are disposed to be significantly adjacent, making it difficult to secure (or ensure) insulating reliability therebetween.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>

Here, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, a core is omitted for the sake of explanation.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4B</figref>, a transformer <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention is an insulation type switching transformer including a bobbin <b>10</b>, a core <b>40</b>, and a coil <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The bobbin <b>10</b> includes a winding unit <b>12</b> around which the coil <b>50</b> is wound, and a terminal fastening unit <b>20</b> formed at one end of the winding unit <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The winding unit <b>12</b> may include a body portion <b>13</b> having a cylindrical shape and a flange portion <b>15</b> extending from both ends thereof <b>13</b> in a outer diameter direction.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">A through hole <b>11</b> is formed within the body portion to allow a portion of the core <b>40</b> to be inserted thereinto, and at least one partition wall <b>14</b> may be formed on an outer circumferential surface of the body portion <b>13</b> to partition space in a length direction of the body portion <b>13</b>. Here, the coil <b>50</b> may be wound in each space partitioned by the partition wall <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The winding unit <b>12</b> according to the present embodiment includes a single partition wall <b>14</b>. Thus, the winding unit <b>12</b> according to the present embodiment includes two partitioned spaces <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b</i>. However, the present invention is not limited thereto and varying amounts of spaces may be formed by varying amounts of partition walls <b>14</b> and used as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Also, the partition wall <b>14</b> according to the present embodiment includes at least one skip groove <b>14</b><i>a </i>allowing the coil <b>50</b> wound in a particular space (e.g., an upper winding space <b>12</b><i>a</i>) to skip the partition wall <b>12</b> so as to be wound in an adjacent different space (e.g., a lower winding space <b>12</b><i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The skip groove <b>14</b><i>a </i>may be formed by completely removing a portion of the partition wall <b>14</b> such that an outer surface of the body portion <b>13</b> is exposed. Also, a width of the skip grooves <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>may be greater than a thickness (i.e., a diameter) of the coil <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Two skip grooves <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>may be formed to correspond to positions of the terminal fastening units <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b</i>. In detail, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the skip grooves <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>include a first skip groove <b>14</b><i>a </i>allowing a primary coil to be led out therethrough and a second skip groove <b>14</b><i>b </i>allowing a secondary coil to be led out therethrough. Namely, in the transformer according to the present embodiment, the primary coil and the secondary coil are led out through the different skip grooves <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">When the primary coil and the secondary coil are led out through the same skip grooves <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b</i>, the primary coil and the second coil may be in contact in an intersecting manner within the skip grooves <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, in the transformer <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment, an insulating member is not interposed between the primary coil <b>51</b> and the secondary coil <b>52</b>. Thus, when the primary coil <b>51</b> and the secondary coil <b>52</b> are in contact under tension, the primary coil <b>51</b> and the secondary coil <b>52</b> are required to be formed such that an intersecting angle at a contact point is less than 45&#xb0; in order to secure insulating reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">However, in the transformer <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment, as the body portion <b>13</b> is formed extendedly, the primary coil <b>51</b> and the secondary coil <b>52</b> in contact within the skip grooves <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>are highly likely to have an intersection angle of 45&#xb0; or more.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Thus, in order to avoid such a problem, the transformer <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment is configured such that the primary coil and the secondary coil are led out through different skip grooves <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Meanwhile, in the present embodiment, a case in which the first skip groove <b>14</b><i>a </i>and the second skip groove <b>14</b><i>b </i>are formed at positions corresponding to withdrawal openings <b>25</b><i>a </i>(to be described to later) is taken as an example. However, the present invention is not limited thereto and a plurality of skip grooves may be formed in various positions as necessary, so long as the primary coil and the second coil can pass over or pass through different skip grooves <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The partition wall <b>14</b> according to the present embodiment is provided to allow the coil <b>50</b> to be substantially uniformly disposed within the partitioned winding spaces <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b </i>and evenly wound therein. Namely, the partition wall <b>14</b> is provided to prevent the coil <b>50</b> wound within the entire winding space <b>12</b><i>c </i>from leaning or being inclined to one side.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Thus, if the width of the entire winding space <b>12</b><i>c </i>is very narrow or if there is no possibility in which the coil <b>50</b> is leaned or inclined to one side within the winding space <b>12</b><i>c</i>, the partition wall <b>14</b> may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The partition wall <b>14</b> may have various thicknesses and may be made of various materials so long as the configuration thereof can be maintained. Also, in the present embodiment, a case in which the partition wall <b>14</b> and the bobbin <b>10</b> are integrally formed is taken as an example, but the present invention is not limited thereto and various applications may be implemented. For example, the partition wall <b>14</b> may be formed as a separate member and coupled to the bobbin <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The partition wall <b>14</b> according to the present embodiment may have the substantially same shape as that of the flange portion <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The flange portion <b>15</b> is protruded to extend from both ends thereof <b>13</b>, namely, from upper and lower end portions of the body portion <b>13</b>, in an outer diameter direction. The flange portion <b>15</b> according to the present embodiment may be classified into an upper flange portion <b>15</b><i>a </i>and a lower flange portion <b>15</b><i>b</i>, according to formation positions.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Also, a space formed between the outer circumferential surface of the body portion <b>13</b> and the upper and lower flange portions <b>15</b><i>a </i>and <b>15</b><i>b </i>form partitioned winding spaces <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b </i>in which the coil <b>50</b> is wound. Thus, the flange portion <b>15</b> serves to support the coil <b>50</b> wound in the partitioned winding spaces <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b </i>from both edges, protect the coil <b>50</b> against the outside, and secure insulating characteristics between the outside and the coil <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The terminal fastening unit <b>20</b> may be formed on the lower flange portion <b>15</b><i>b</i>. In detail, the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b> according to the present embodiment may be protruded from the lower flange portion <b>15</b><i>b </i>in an outer diameter direction in order to secure an insulating distance.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">However, the present invention is not limited thereto and the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b> may be protruded in a downward direction from the lower flange portion <b>15</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Meanwhile, with reference to the drawings, since the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b> according to the present embodiment is formed to partially extend from the lower flange portion <b>15</b><i>b</i>, it may be difficult to discriminate the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b> from the lower flange portion <b>15</b><i>b</i>. Thus, in the present embodiment, the lower flange portion <b>15</b><i>b </i>itself may be considered to be the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">An external connection terminal <b>30</b> (to be described later) may be fastened to the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b> such that it is protruded to the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Also, the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b> may include a primary terminal fastening unit <b>20</b><i>a </i>and a secondary terminal fastening unit <b>20</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As described above, the transformer <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment does not have an insulating member between the primary coil and the secondary coil. Thus, in order to secure insulating reliability, preferably, the primary coil and the secondary coil are disposed such that they are in contact or intersect each other at a minimum level.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">To this end, the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b> of the transformer <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment is divided into the primary terminal fastening unit <b>20</b><i>a </i>and the secondary terminal fastening unit <b>20</b><i>b</i>. The primary coil is led out from the primary terminal fastening unit <b>20</b><i>a </i>and the secondary coil is led out from the secondary terminal fastening unit <b>20</b><i>b</i>, so as to be connected to corresponding external connection terminals <b>30</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Meanwhile, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in the present embodiment, a case in which the primary terminal fastening unit <b>20</b><i>a </i>and the secondary terminal fastening unit <b>20</b><i>b </i>extend from both ends of the lower flange portion <b>15</b><i>b </i>exposed to the outside of the core <b>40</b> is taken as an example. However, the present invention is not limited thereto and the primary terminal fastening unit <b>20</b><i>a </i>and the secondary terminal fastening unit <b>20</b><i>b </i>may be variably applied, as long as insulating characteristics therebetween are ensured. Namely, the primary terminal fastening unit <b>20</b><i>a </i>and the secondary terminal fastening unit <b>20</b><i>b </i>may be formed to be parallel on any step or formed at adjacent positions.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b> may include a withdrawal opening <b>25</b>, a catching groove <b>26</b>, a guide protrusion <b>27</b>, and a stopping protrusion <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The withdrawal opening <b>25</b> is used to allow a lead wire (L in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the coil <b>50</b> to be led to a lower side of the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b>. To this end, the withdrawal opening <b>25</b> according to the present embodiment may be formed by completely removing portions of the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b> and the lower flange portion <b>15</b><i>b </i>such that an outer surface of the body portion <b>13</b> is exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Also, the width of the withdrawal opening <b>25</b> may be greater than the thickness (i.e., the diameter) of the primary coil <b>51</b> and the secondary coil <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In particular, in the present embodiment, the withdrawal opening <b>25</b> is formed is formed at a position corresponding to the skip groove <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the foregoing partition wall <b>14</b>. In detail, the withdrawal opening <b>25</b> may be formed at a position at which the skip groove <b>14</b><i>a </i>is projected in a downward direction.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Like the foregoing skip grooves <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b</i>, two withdrawal openings <b>25</b> may be provided to allow the primary coil and the secondary coil to be led out therethrough, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Namely, in the present embodiment, the transformer <b>100</b> includes at least two withdrawal openings <b>25</b> in order to prevent the primary coil and the second coil from being in contact in an intersecting manner otherwise in a single withdrawal opening <b>25</b> when led out therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Thus, the two withdrawal openings <b>25</b> may be classified into a first withdrawal opening <b>25</b><i>a </i>through which the primary coil is led out and a second withdrawal opening <b>25</b><i>b </i>through which the secondary coil is led out.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Meanwhile, in the present embodiment, the case in which the withdrawal openings <b>25</b> are formed in the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b> is taken as an example, but the present invention is not limited thereto and a plurality of withdrawal openings may be formed in various positions as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The catching groove <b>26</b> is formed within the withdrawal opening <b>25</b>. The catching groove <b>25</b> is formed by extending the width of the withdrawal opening <b>25</b>. Namely, the catching groove <b>26</b> is formed extendedly in a traversing manner in the withdrawal opening <b>25</b> and has a width allowing the coil <b>50</b> to pass therethrough so as to be led out.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Also, the catching groove <b>26</b> may be formed by removing both lateral portions of the withdrawal opening <b>25</b> in a width direction or may be formed by removing only one lateral portion of the withdrawal opening <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">A corner portion of the catching groove <b>26</b> connected to the lower portion, namely, the lower surface, of the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b> may be formed to have a sloped face or a curved face through chamfering, or the like. Accordingly, a phenomenon in which the lead wire L led out through the catching groove <b>26</b> is bent by the corner portion of the catching groove <b>26</b> can be minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Also, in the present embodiment, the catching groove <b>26</b> may be formed by removing portions of the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b> in a direction (or a tangent direction of the coils <b>50</b>) in which the respective coils <b>50</b> are wound at a lower side of the primary coil <b>51</b> and the secondary coil <b>52</b> continuously wound in the winding unit <b>12</b>. Namely, in the present embodiment, the catching groove <b>26</b> is formed to have a linear shape, but the present invention is not limited thereto and the catching groove <b>26</b> may be formed by removing portions of the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b> in an arc shape according to the shape of the coil <b>50</b> wound in an annular shape.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Accordingly, when the lead wire L of the coil (e.g., the primary coil; Np<b>2</b>, Np<b>3</b>) is led out from the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b> along the catching groove <b>26</b> from the interior of the winding unit <b>12</b>, it is led out by traversing (or crossing) the catching groove <b>26</b> in the length direction of the catching groove <b>26</b> (namely, it traverses the catching groove <b>26</b> in the length direction of the catching groove <b>26</b> so as to be led out), and accordingly, the lead wire L is led out at an angle of less than 45&#xb0; with respect to the other order of coil (e.g., the secondary coil; Ns<b>4</b>) wound in the winding unit <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Also, the catching groove <b>26</b> according to the present embodiment includes two stopping openings <b>26</b><i>a </i>and <b>26</b><i>c </i>formed in the first withdrawal opening <b>25</b><i>a </i>through which the primary coil <b>51</b> is led out and one catching groove <b>26</b><i>b </i>formed in the second withdrawal opening <b>25</b><i>b </i>through which the secondary coil <b>52</b> is led out. The configuration of the catching groove <b>26</b> will be described in detail in describing the coil <b>50</b> later.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Meanwhile, leakage inductance generated when the transformer <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment is driven can be minimized by virtue of the withdrawal opening <b>25</b> and the catching groove <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In the case of the related art transformer, generally, a lead wire of a coil is led out along an internal wall surface in a space in which the coil is wound, and thus, the wound coil and the lead wire of the coil may be in contact.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Thus, the coil is wound to be bent at a point at which the coil is in contact with the lead wire, and such a bent portion of the coil, namely, an uneven winding, results in an increase in leakage inductance.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">However, in the transformer <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment, the lead wire L of the coil <b>50</b> is directly led out to the outside of the winding unit <b>12</b>, namely, downwardly from the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b>, in a vertical direction through the withdrawal opening <b>25</b> and the catching groove <b>26</b> from the position which the coil <b>50</b> is wound, rather than being disposed within the winding unit <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Thus, the coil <b>50</b> wound within the winding unit can be uniformly wound overall, and thus, leakage inductance otherwise generated as the coil <b>50</b> is bent, or the like, can be minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">A plurality of catching grooves <b>28</b> may be formed to be protruded from one surface of the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b>, and in the present embodiment, a case in which the plurality of catching grooves <b>28</b> are protruded downwardly from an outer surface (i.e., lower surface) of the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b> is taken as an example.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the catching grooves <b>28</b> serve to guide the lead wire L of the coil <b>50</b> wound in the winding unit <b>12</b> such that the lead wire L is easily disposed on the external connection terminal <b>30</b> at a lower side of the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b>. Thus, the catching protrusion <b>28</b> may be protruded to be greater than the diameter of the lead wire L of the coil <b>50</b> in order to firmly support the coil <b>50</b> caught thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Owing to the catching grooves <b>28</b>, a disposition direction of the lead wires L led out from the catching groove <b>26</b> may be changed in various directions as necessary. This will be described in detail as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, in the transformer <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment, preferably, the lead wires L of the coil <b>50</b> are led out (or led in) in a tangent direction (or in the winding direction) with respect to the outer circumferential surface of the coils <b>50</b> wound in the winding space (<b>12</b><i>c </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>). This is to prevent the lead wire L of the coil <b>50</b> from being led out at an angle of 45&#xb0; or more from the winding space <b>12</b><i>c </i>in a state of being in contact with the other order of coil <b>50</b> wound in the winding space <b>12</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As mentioned above, when the primary coil <b>51</b> and the secondary coil <b>52</b> are in contact under tension, it is required for an intersecting angle at a portion in which the primary coil <b>51</b> and the secondary coil <b>52</b> are in contact to be less than 45&#xb0; in order to secure (or ensure) insulating reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Thus, as described above, when the lead wires L of the coil <b>50</b> are configured to be led out (or led in) in the tangent direction (or in the winding direction) with respect to the outer circumferential surface of the coils wound in the winding space <b>12</b><i>c</i>, the lead wires L of the coil <b>50</b> and the coils <b>50</b> wound in the winding space <b>12</b><i>c </i>are naturally at an angle less than 45&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">To this end, in the transformer <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment, the catching groove <b>26</b> are formed extendedly in the direction in which the lead wires L are led so that the lead wires L of the coil <b>50</b> can be easily led out in the tangent direction (or in the winding direction), and here, the lead wires L are led out by traversing the catching groove <b>26</b> in the length direction of the catching groove <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Meanwhile, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 4B</figref>, when the lead wires L of the coil <b>50</b> are led in the tangent direction (or in the winding direction <b>0</b>, some lead wires (L<b>2</b>) may be led out in a direction opposite to the direction in which the external connection terminal <b>30</b>, to which the lead wires (L<b>2</b>) are to be connected, is disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In this case, the path should be changed after the lead wires L<b>2</b> are completely led out downwardly of the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b>. To this end, in the transformer <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment, the disposition path of the lead wires L<b>2</b> is changed by using the catching grooves <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Thus, like the secondary terminal fastening unit <b>20</b><i>b </i>according to the present embodiment, when the external connection terminals <b>30</b>, to which the respective lead wires L are to be connected, are disposed in the direction in which the lead wires L are led out from the catching groove <b>26</b><i>b</i>, such catching grooves <b>28</b> may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">However, like the primary terminal fastening unit <b>20</b><i>a</i>, when the corresponding external connection terminals <b>30</b> are disposed in a direction opposite to the direction in which the lead wires L<b>2</b> are led out, the lead wires L<b>2</b> support the catching grooves <b>28</b> and a disposition path thereof may be changed.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The lead wires L<b>2</b>, having changed in a disposition direction into the direction opposite to the withdrawal direction while supporting the catching grooves <b>28</b>, may be changed again in the disposition direction into a direction in which the external connection terminals <b>30</b> are fastened, while supporting other catching grooves <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Thus, in order to allow the lead wires L led out from the catching groove <b>26</b> to be easily changed in the disposition direction, at least one of the catching grooves <b>28</b> according to the present embodiment may be disposed to be adjacent to the catching groove <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Meanwhile, at least one of the catching grooves <b>28</b> may be configured to have a step formed on at least one lateral face. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, a catching protrusion having a step (hereinafter, referred to as a &#x2018;double catching protrusion <b>29</b>&#x2019;) may include a base protrusion <b>29</b><i>a </i>and a support protrusion <b>29</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The base protrusion <b>29</b><i>a </i>is formed to be protruded to have an end having a size with a certain area. Thus, the base protrusion <b>29</b><i>a </i>may support the lead wires through the end, as well as supporting the lead wires through a side wall thereof, like the other catching grooves <b>28</b> do. Namely, the base protrusion <b>29</b><i>a </i>can support at least two lead wires simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The support protrusion <b>29</b><i>b </i>is formed to be further protruded from any one portion of the end of the base protrusion <b>29</b><i>a</i>. The support protrusion <b>29</b><i>b </i>may be formed to be similar in shape, size, and the like, to the other catching grooves <b>29</b> and only different in that it is protruded from the end of the base protrusion <b>29</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">A movement of the lead wire L, which is supported by the end of the base protrusion <b>29</b><i>a </i>by the support protrusion <b>29</b><i>b</i>, in a particular direction may be fixed. Also, the lead wire L supported by the side wall of the base protrusion <b>29</b><i>a </i>is prevented from being easily released from the double catching protrusion <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The double catching protrusion <b>29</b> configured as described above according to the present embodiment is provided to prevent the lead wires L from being in contact in an intersecting manner when the lead wires L are disposed on a lower surface of the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, as the disposition path of the lead wires L is complicated, the lead wires L may be disposed to be in contact in an intersecting manner. Thus, in order to avoid this, the transformer <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment includes and uses the double catching protrusion <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Since the double catching protrusion <b>29</b> is provided, a particular lead wire L<b>1</b> led out from the catching groove <b>26</b> may be changed in a disposition direction thereof, while being supported by the side wall formed by the base protrusion <b>29</b><i>a </i>and the support protrusion <b>29</b><i>b </i>in conjunction.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Also, the other lead wire L<b>2</b> may be disposed to intersect the particular lead wire L<b>1</b>, while being supported by the end of the base protrusion <b>29</b><i>a</i>. Accordingly, the particular lead wire L<b>1</b> and the other lead wire L<b>2</b> are spaced apart by the base protrusion <b>29</b><i>a </i>and intersect each other, thus minimizing interference therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">A plurality of guide protrusions <b>27</b> are formed to be protruded in parallel from one surface of the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b>. In the present invention, a case in which the guide protrusions <b>27</b> are protruded downwardly from the lower surface of the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b> is taken as an example.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The guide protrusions <b>27</b> are protruded in parallel to correspond to the fastening positions of the external connection terminals <b>30</b>. Here, the respective guide protrusions <b>27</b> may have an identical shape or may have various shapes as necessary like the guide protrusions <b>27</b> formed on the secondary terminal fastening unit <b>20</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the guide protrusions <b>27</b> serve to guide the lead wires L of the coil <b>50</b> led out from the catching groove <b>26</b> or the catching grooves <b>28</b> such that the lead wires L are easily disposed on the external connection terminals <b>30</b>. Thus, the guide protrusions <b>27</b> may be protruded to be greater than the diameter of the lead wires L of the coil <b>50</b> in order to firmly support and guide the coil <b>50</b> disposed therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The lead wires L led out from the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b> by way of the catching groove <b>26</b> by the guide protrusions <b>27</b> are changed in the disposition direction, while supporting the catching grooves <b>28</b>, and then, electrically connected to the external connection terminals <b>30</b> through the space between the guide protrusions <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The configuration of the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b> according to the present embodiment, configured as described above, is devised in consideration of a case in which the coil <b>50</b> is automatically wound around the bobbin <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Namely, owing to the configuration of the bobbin <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment, a process of winding the coil <b>50</b> around the bobbin <b>10</b>, a process of passing the lead wires L of the coil <b>50</b> to a lower side of the bobbin <b>10</b> through the withdrawal opening <b>25</b> and the catching groove <b>26</b>, a process of drawing out the lead wires L in the direction in which the external connection terminals <b>30</b> are formed by changing the path of the lead wires L through the guide protrusions <b>27</b>, and then, fastening the lead wires L to the external connection terminals <b>30</b>, and the like, may be automatically performed by automatic winding equipment (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The plurality of external connection terminals <b>30</b> may be fastened to the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b>. The external connection terminals <b>30</b> are formed to be protruded from the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b> and may have various shapes according to a shape or structure of the transformer <b>100</b> or according to a structure of a substrate on which the transformer <b>100</b> is mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Namely, the external connection terminals <b>30</b> according to the present embodiment are fastened to the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b> such that they are protruded from the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b> in an outer diameter direction of the body portion <b>13</b>. However, the present invention is not limited thereto and the external connection terminals <b>30</b> may be formed in various positions as necessary. For example, the external connection terminals <b>30</b> may be fastened to be protruded downwardly from the lower surface of the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Also, the external connection terminals <b>30</b> according to the present embodiment may include an input terminal <b>30</b><i>a </i>and an output terminal <b>30</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The input terminal <b>30</b><i>a </i>is fastened to the primary terminal fastening unit <b>20</b><i>a </i>and connected to the lead wire L of the primary coil <b>51</b> to supply power thereto.

<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The external connection terminals <b>30</b> according to the present embodiment include a plurality of (e.g., four) input terminals <b>30</b><i>a </i>and a plurality of (e.g., seven) output terminals <b>30</b><i>b</i>. This configuration is devised as the transformer <b>100</b> is configured such that a plurality of coils <b>50</b> may be wound in a stacked manner in the single winding unit <b>12</b>. Thus, the external connection terminals <b>30</b> in the transformer <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention are not limited to the foregoing amount.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">The input terminals <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the output terminals <b>30</b><i>b </i>may have the same shape or may have different shapes as necessary.

<p id="p-0135" num="0134">In the bobbin <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment configured as described above, the primary coil <b>51</b> and the secondary coil <b>52</b> are wound in a stacked manner in the internal winding space <b>12</b><i>c</i>, but there is no insulating member between the primary coil <b>51</b> and the secondary coil <b>52</b>. Thus, in order to secure insulating reliability at the point in which the primary coil <b>51</b> and the secondary coil <b>52</b> are in contact, an intersecting angle at the point in which the primary coil <b>51</b> and the secondary coil <b>52</b> are in contact should necessarily be less than 45&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Namely, when the primary coil <b>51</b> and the secondary coil <b>52</b> cross to the maximum level in the single winding space, the intersecting angle between the primary coil <b>51</b> and the secondary coil <b>52</b> should be maintained at less than 45&#xb0;.</p>

<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Like the bobbin <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, when the body portion <b>13</b> is formed to have a small diameter W<sub>b </sub>and a length T<sub>s </sub>(i.e., the width of the winding space) similar to the diameter W, a maximum intersecting angle &#x3b8; between the primary coil <b>51</b> and the secondary coil <b>52</b> is highly likely to be 45&#xb0; or more.</p>

<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Also, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, when at least any one (e.g., the primary coil) of the coils is wound in a diagonal direction of the body portion <b>13</b> across the skip groove <b>14</b><i>a</i>, the primary coil <b>51</b> and the secondary coil <b>52</b> may intersect at an angle of &#x3b8;<sub>m</sub>.

<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Here, the thickness T<sub>s </sub>of the entire winding space is calculated to be double of the thickness T<sub>s </sub>of the individual winding space and the thickness by the partition wall <b>14</b> was disregarded.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Also, instead of the diameter W<sub>b </sub>of the body portion, the diameter R formed by the inner winding Np<b>2</b> may be substituted. However, when the diameter R formed by the inner winding Np<b>2</b> is substituted, since it is included in conditional expression 7, conditional expression 7 was obtained based on the diameter W<sub>b </sub>of the body portion <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Also, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref>, a case in which the coils <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> are wound to intersect at an intersecting angle &#x3b8;<sub>n </sub>around the bobbin <b>10</b> formed to have a plurality of winding areas <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b </i>may be considered.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">In this case, the intersecting angle &#x3b8;<sub>n </sub>between the primary coil <b>51</b> and the secondary coil <b>52</b> is about 1.5 times the intersecting angle &#x3b8;<sub>m </sub>of the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Thus, in order for the intersecting angle to be maintained at less than 45&#xb0;, the intersecting angle &#x3b8;<sub>m </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> should be less than 30&#xb0;.

<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Thus, conditional equation 8 shown below can be obtained.

<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Here, the thickness T<sub>s </sub>of the entire winding space <b>12</b><i>c </i>does not include the thickness of the partition wall <b>14</b>.

For example, the thickness T<sub>s </sub>of the entire winding space <b>12</b><i>c </i>may be about 0.55 times the diameter W<sub>b </sub>of the body portion <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">Meanwhile, when conditional expression 7 and conditional expression 8 are considered together, it can be seen that conditional expression 7 is included in the range of conditional expression 8.

<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Accordingly, in the transformer <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment, although an insulating member is omitted between the primary coil <b>51</b> and the secondary coil <b>52</b> and the coil <b>50</b> is wound around the bobbin <b>10</b> through automatic winding equipment, or the like, insulating reliability between the primary coil <b>51</b> and the secondary coil <b>52</b> can be easily secured.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Meanwhile, in the foregoing conditional expressions, in most cases, the size of the partitioned winding spaces <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b</i>, and <b>12</b><i>c </i>is limited.

<p id="p-0185" num="0184">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, in the present embodiment, as the primary coil <b>51</b>, the coils Np<b>1</b>, Np<b>2</b>, and Np<b>3</b> having a similar thickness are used.

<p id="p-0187" num="0186">In this manner, in the transformer <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment, since the primary coil <b>51</b> is configured by the plurality of coils Np<b>1</b>, Np<b>2</b>, and Np<b>3</b>, various voltages can be applied, and accordingly, various voltages can be extracted through the secondary coil <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">Meanwhile, in the present embodiment, the primary coil <b>51</b> is not limited to the three independent coils Np<b>1</b>, Np<b>2</b>, and Np<b>3</b>, and varying amounts of coils may be used as necessary.</p>

<p id="p-0190" num="0189">Like the primary coil <b>51</b>, the secondary coil <b>52</b> may be formed as a plurality of coils electrically insulated from each other are wound.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">In detail, in the present embodiment, a case in which the secondary coil <b>52</b> includes four independent coils Ns<b>1</b>, Ns<b>2</b>, Ns<b>3</b>, and Ns<b>4</b> which are electrically insulated from each other is taken as an example. Thus, a total of eight strands of lead wires L may be led out from the secondary coil <b>52</b> and connected to the external connection terminals <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">Also, as the respective coils Ns<b>1</b>, Ns<b>2</b>, Ns<b>3</b>, and Ns<b>4</b> of the secondary coil <b>52</b>, coils having the same thickness or coils having different thicknesses may be selectively used, and the amounts of windings of the respective coils Ns<b>1</b>, Ns<b>2</b>, Ns<b>3</b>, and Ns<b>4</b> may be equal or different as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">Individual coils Np<b>1</b>-Np<b>4</b> according to the present embodiment may be substantially uniformly distributed and wound within the spaces <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b </i>partitioned by the partition wall <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">In detail, the same amounts of respective coils Np<b>1</b>-Ns<b>4</b> are wound in the upper winding space <b>12</b><i>a </i>and the lower winding space <b>12</b><i>b</i>, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the respective coils Np<b>1</b>-Ns<b>4</b> are disposed to form the vertically identical layers. Accordingly, the respective coils Np<b>1</b>-Ns<b>4</b> wound in the upper winding space <b>12</b><i>a </i>and the lower winding space <b>12</b><i>b </i>have the same shape.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">Here, when the amount of windings of the respective coils Np<b>1</b>-Ns<b>4</b> is set to be an odd number, the corresponding coils Np<b>1</b>-Ns<b>4</b> may be wound by making a difference in the amount of windings at a ratio of 10% of the entire winding amounts.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">Such a configuration aims at minimizing a generation of leakage inductance in the transformer <b>100</b> according to a winding state of the coil <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">In general, when the coil is wound in the winding unit of the bobbin, if the coil is not uniformly wound on the whole but would to be inclined to one side or non-uniformly disposed and wound, leakage inductance is increased in the transformer. This problem may be aggravated when the space of the winding unit is large.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">Thus, in order to minimize leakage inductance generated due to the foregoing reasons, the winding unit <b>12</b> is divided into several partitioned spaces <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b </i>by using the partition wall <b>14</b> in the transformer <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment. The coil <b>50</b> is evenly wound to the maximum in the respective partitioned spaces <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">In this connection, for example, when the total amount of windings of the coil Ns<b>1</b> is 18 times, the coil Ns<b>1</b> may be wound nine times in the upper winding space <b>12</b><i>a </i>and nine times in the lower winding space <b>12</b><i>b </i>so as to be uniformly distributedly disposed, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">Also, when the amount of windings is set to be an odd number (e.g., 50 times), a difference may be made at a ratio of some 10% such that the coil is disposed 23 times in the upper winding space <b>12</b><i>a </i>and 27 times in the lower winding space <b>12</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">Meanwhile, with reference to the drawings, in the present embodiment, the coil Ns<b>1</b> is not densely or compactly wound, and wound 8 times in the first layer and 10 times in the second layer. Thus, two lead wires (not shown) of the coil Ns<b>1</b> are all directed to a lower side of the winding unit <b>12</b>, so they can be easily led out from the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b> and connected to the external connection terminals <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">In the present embodiment, the foregoing winding structure is illustrated only for the coil Ns<b>1</b> for the sake of explanation, but the present invention is not limited thereto and the winding structure may also be easily applied to the other coils.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">In this manner, in the transformer <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment, although the winding amount or the thickness of the coils is small in comparison to the partitioned winding spaces <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b </i>(e.g., the coil Ns<b>1</b>) so the coils are not densely or tightly wound in the winding unit <b>12</b>, since the winding unit <b>12</b> is divided into the plurality of partitioned spaces <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b</i>, the coil (e.g., Ns<b>1</b>) can be wound to be distributedly disposed in the same position within the respective partitioned spaces <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b</i>, without being inclined to one side.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">In this manner, in the transformer <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment, the independent coils Np<b>1</b>-Ns<b>4</b> are uniformly distributed and disposed in the upper winding space <b>12</b><i>a </i>and the lower winding space <b>12</b><i>b </i>according to the structure and winding scheme of the bobbin <b>10</b> as described above. Thus, the coils Np<b>1</b>-Ns<b>4</b> are prevented from being inclined to one side and wound or non-uniformly separated and wound on the whole, and accordingly, leakage inductance generated as the coils Np<b>1</b>-Ns<b>4</b> are wound irregularly can be minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">Meanwhile, as shown In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the catching groove <b>26</b> according to the present embodiment is formed to correspond to contact surfaces C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> of the primary coil <b>51</b> and the secondary coil <b>52</b> continuously wound in a stacked manner in the winding unit <b>12</b>, namely, a position from which the lead wires L are led.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">Here, outer and inner circumferential surfaces of the primary coil <b>51</b> and the secondary coil <b>52</b> which are continuously wound refer to annular outer and inner circumferential surfaces formed as the coils <b>50</b> are wound in the winding unit <b>12</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0208" num="0207">In the present embodiment, the Np<b>2</b> of the primary coil <b>51</b> is wound separately from Np<b>3</b> and Np<b>1</b> of the primary coils, so the primary coils <b>51</b> has a total of two outer circumferential surfaces and a total of two inner circumferential surfaces (i.e., the outer and inner circumferential surfaces by Np<b>2</b> and the outer and inner circumferential surfaces by the Np<b>1</b> and Np<b>3</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">Meanwhile, four individual coils Ns<b>1</b>-Ns<b>4</b> of the secondary coils <b>52</b> are continuously wound in a stacked manner, so the secondary coils <b>52</b> have a total of one outer circumferential surface (i.e., an outer circumferential surface by Ns<b>4</b>) and a total of one inner circumferential surface (i.e., an inner circumferential surface by Ns<b>1</b>). Here, the outer circumferential surface C<b>2</b> and inner circumferential surface C<b>1</b> of the secondary coils <b>52</b> are formed as the contact surfaces C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0213" num="0212">Accordingly, the lead wires L of the coils (e.g., the primary coils Np<b>2</b> and Np<b>3</b>) led out of the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b> along the catching groove <b>26</b> within the winding unit <b>12</b> are led out by traversing (or crossing) the catching groove <b>26</b> in the length direction of the catching groove <b>26</b>, and thus, the lead wire L is led out at an angle less than 45&#xb0; with respect to the other order of coil (e.g., the secondary coil Ns<b>4</b>) wound in the winding unit <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">The configuration of the catching groove <b>26</b> according to the present embodiment aims at securing insulating reliability between the primary coil <b>51</b> and the second coil <b>52</b> with respect to the lead wires L led out from the winding unit <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">As described above, when the primary coil <b>51</b> and the secondary coil <b>52</b> are in contact under tension, an angle (i.e., an acute angle) at which the primary coil <b>51</b> and the secondary coil <b>52</b> intersect while being in contact should be set to be less than 45&#xb0; in order to ensure insulating reliability. Namely, when the angle formed between the primary coil <b>51</b> and the secondary coil <b>52</b> is 45&#xb0; or more, it is difficult to secure insulating reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">To this end, in the transformer <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment, the lead wires L are led out from the outer surface of the terminal fastening unit <b>20</b> and then fastened to the external connection terminal <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">Here, if the lead wires (e.g., the lead wires of Np<b>3</b> as a primary coil) are immediately led out directly to the lower side from the contact surface (C<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>), the lead wires are led at an angle of 90&#xb0; in a state being in contact with the different order of coil (e.g., Ns<b>4</b> as a secondary coil) which is continuously wound.

<p id="p-0218" num="0217">Thus, in order to solve the problem, in the transformer according to the present embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the lead wire L of the coil (e.g., Np<b>2</b>) is led out in a manner of traversing the catching groove <b>26</b> in the length direction of the catching groove <b>26</b> (namely, the lead wire L of the coil traverses the catching groove <b>26</b> in the length direction of the catching groove <b>26</b> so as to be led out). Namely, the lead wire L is slopingly led out with a certain inclination in the winding direction, rather than being led out directly to a lower side from the winding unit <b>12</b>. Here, as described above, the length S of the catching groove <b>26</b> is greater than the thickness D of the terminal fastening unit <b>30</b>, so the lead wire L can be led out at an angle less than 45&#xb0; with respect to a different order of coil (e.g., Ns<b>4</b>) wound in the winding unit <b>12</b>. Accordingly, insulating reliability can be ensured.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">Through such a configuration, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, at least two lead wires led out through the single catching groove <b>26</b> may be disposed to cross in an X form within the single catching groove <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">Also, as the coils Np<b>1</b>-Ns<b>4</b> according to the present embodiment, general insulated coils (e.g., polyurethane wire) or a stranded type coil formed by twisting several strands of wires (e.g., Litz wire, etc.) may be used. Also, a multi-insulated wire (e.g., triple insulated wire (TIW), etc.) having high insulating characteristics, or the like, may be selectively used as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">In particular, in the transformer <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment, the entirety (or a portion) of the individual coils are configured as multi-insulated wires, and thus, insulating characteristics can be ensured between the individual coils. Thus, the insulating tape used to insulate the coils in the related art transformer can be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">The multi-insulated wire is a coil formed by forming several layers (e.g., three layers) of insulators on outside of a conductor to have increased insulating characteristics, and the use of triple insulated coil <b>51</b><i>b </i>can easily secure insulating characteristics between the conductor and the outside, minimizing the insulating distance between coils. However, the multi-insulated wire incurs high fabrication costs in comparison to the general insulated coil (e.g., a polyurethane wire).</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">Thus, in order to minimize fabrication costs and shorten the fabrication process, the multi-insulated coil may be used only as any one of the primary coil <b>51</b> and the secondary coil <b>52</b> in the transformer according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">With reference back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the transformer <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment employs the primary coil <b>51</b> as a multi-insulated coil. In this case, the multi-insulated coil as the primary coil <b>51</b> may be stacked in the winding unit <b>12</b> and disposed at the innermost and outermost edges of the wound coils <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">When the multi-insulated coil is disposed at the innermost and outermost edges of the wound coils <b>50</b>, the multi-insulated coil as the primary coil <b>51</b> serves as an insulating layer between the secondary coil <b>52</b> as a general insulated coil and the outside. Accordingly, insulating characteristics between the outside and the secondary coil <b>52</b> can be easily secured.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">Meanwhile, in the present embodiment, the case in which the multi-insulated coil as the primary coil <b>51</b> is disposed at both the innermost and outermost edges of the coils <b>50</b> is taken as an example, but the present invention is not limited thereto. Namely, the multi-insulated coil may be selectively disposed only at one of the inner side and outer side as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is an exploded perspective view schematically illustrating a flat display device according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a flat display device <b>1</b> may include a display panel <b>4</b>, a power module <b>5</b> with the transformer <b>100</b> mounted thereon, and covers <b>2</b> and <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">The covers <b>2</b> and <b>8</b> include a front cover <b>2</b> and a back cover <b>8</b>. The front cover <b>2</b> and the back cover <b>8</b> may be coupled to form an internal space therein.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">The display panel <b>4</b> is disposed in the internal space formed by the covers <b>2</b> and <b>8</b>. As the display panel <b>4</b>, various flat display panels such as a liquid crystal display (LCD), a plasma display panel (PDP), an organic light emitting diode (OLED), and the like, may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">The power module (or SMPS) <b>5</b> provides power to the display panel <b>4</b>. The power module <b>5</b> may be formed by mounting a plurality of electronic components on a substrate <b>6</b>, and in particular, the transformer <b>100</b> may be mounted thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">The power module <b>5</b> may be fixed to a chassis <b>7</b> and may be fixedly disposed along with the display panel <b>4</b> within the internal space formed by the covers <b>2</b> and <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">Here, in the transformer <b>100</b> mounted on the power module <b>5</b>, the coil (<b>50</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is wound in a direction parallel to the substrate <b>6</b>. Also, when viewed from the plane of the substrate <b>6</b> (i.e., in a Z direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), the coil <b>50</b> is wound in a clockwise direction or counterclockwise direction. Accordingly, a portion (i.e., an upper surface) of the core <b>40</b> is provided in parallel to the back cover <b>8</b>, forming a magnetic path.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">Accordingly, in the transformer <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment, as for magnetic flux formed between the back cover <b>8</b> and the transformer <b>100</b> and included in a magnetic field generated by the coil <b>50</b>, since a magnetic path is mostly formed within the core <b>40</b>, a generation of a leakage magnetic flux between the back cover <b>8</b> and the transformer <b>100</b> can be minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">Thus, in the transformer <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment, although a shielding device (e.g., a shielding unit, or the like) is not employed at an outer side of the transformer <b>100</b>, vibration of the back cover <b>8</b> caused by interference between leakage magnetic flux of the transformer <b>100</b> and the back cover <b>8</b> made of a metallic material can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">Thus, when the transformer <b>100</b> is mounted in a thin electronic device such as the flat display device <b>1</b> to make the space between the back cover <b>8</b> and the transformer <b>100</b> very narrow, a generation of noise due to vibration of the back cover <b>8</b> can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">As set forth above, in the transformer according to an embodiment of the present invention configured as described above, the winding space of the bobbin is uniformly divided into a plurality of partitioned spaces, and the respective individual coils are uniformly distributed and wound in the partitioned winding spaces. Also, the respective individual coils are wound in a stacked manner. Thus, individual coils can be prevented from being inclined to one side or non-uniformly separated to be wound within the winding unit <b>12</b>, and thus, leakage inductance generated as coils are irregularly wound can be minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">Also, in the transformer according to an embodiment of the present invention, a multi-insulated wire may be used as at least any one of a primary coil and a secondary coil. In this case, insulation between the primary coil and the secondary coil can be secured by the high insulating characteristics of the multi-insulated wire without having to use an insulating member (e.g., an insulating tape).</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">Thus, the insulating tape interposed between the primary coil and the secondary coil in the related art can be omitted, and since a process of attaching the insulating tape is omitted, fabrication costs and fabrication time can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">Also, the transformer is configured to fit an automated fabrication method. In detail the transformer according to an embodiment of the present invention can omit the related art insulating tape wound to be interposed between the coils through a manual operation.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">In the related art using insulating tape, coils are wound around a bobbin, insulating tape is attached through a manual operation, and then, the coils are wound again, and this process is repeatedly performed. Thus, a great amount of fabrication time is required and a large amount of costs are incurred.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">However, in the transformer according to an embodiment of the present invention, the process of attaching an insulating tape is omitted, so individual coils can be continuously wound in a stacked manner on a bobbin through automated winding equipment. Thus, costs and time required for fabrication can be significantly reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">Also, in the transformer according to an embodiment of the present invention, the primary coil and the secondary coil are connected to external connection terminals through different paths (e.g., a skip groove, a withdrawal opening, etc.). Also, the width T of the winding space is less than 0.45 times the diameter W of the winding space.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">Thus, although an insulting member is omitted between the primary coil and the secondary coil, the primary coil and the secondary coil can be prevented from intersecting at an angle of 45&#xb0; or more, securing insulating reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">In addition, the lead wires of the coil according to an embodiment of the present invention are led out along a tangent direction of the coils wound in the winding space and led out in a manner of traversing the catching groove in a length direction of the stopping opening.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">Thus, since the lead wires are led out at an angle less than 45&#xb0; with respect to the coils wound in the winding unit <b>12</b>, insulating reliability can be secured.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">The transformer according to embodiments of the present invention is not limited to the foregoing embodiments but may be variably modified. For example, in the foregoing embodiment, the flange portion and the partition wall of the bobbin are formed to have a circular shape, but the present invention is not limited thereto and the flange portion and the partition wall of the bobbin may be configured to have various shapes, such as a polygonal shape, an oval shape, or the like, as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">Also, in the foregoing embodiment, the body portion of the bobbin has a circular section, but the present invention is not limited thereto and the body portion of the bobbin may be variably applicable. For example, the body portion of the bobbin may have an oval or polygonal section, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">Also, in the foregoing embodiment, the terminal fastening unit is formed on a lower flange portion, but the present invention is not limited thereto and the terminal fastening unit may be variably applicable. For example, the terminal fastening unit may be formed on an upper flange portion.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">Also, in the foregoing embodiment, the withdrawal opening and the catching groove are formed together in the terminal fastening unit. However, the present invention is not limited thereto and the withdrawal opening and the catching groove may be variably applicable. For example, only the catching groove may be formed, or the withdrawal opening and the catching groove may be independently formed.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">Also, in the foregoing embodiments, the insulating type switching transformer is illustrated as an example, but the present invention is not limited thereto and may be extensively applied to a transformer, a coil component, an electronic device in which a plurality of coils are wound.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">While the present invention has been shown and described in connection with the embodiments, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that modifications and variations can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
