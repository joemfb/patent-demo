<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is directed to a coating composition comprising polyurea and polythiourea.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Coating compositions comprising polyureas are used in a wide variety of industries such as automotive, watercraft, aircraft, industrial, construction, military, recreational equipment including sports equipment and the like. In these industries, considerable efforts have been made to develop coating compositions that will impart the desired properties to the substrate or article being coated. For example, coatings are used to protect against damage due to corrosion, abrasion, impact, chemicals, ultraviolet light, flame, heat, and/or other environmental exposure. In addition to any of these functional properties, coatings can also be used for decorative purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Sulfur-containing compounds are known to be well suited for use in aerospace sealants due to their fuel resistant nature upon crosslinking. For example, polysulfide sealants can offer high tensile strength, high tear strength, thermal resistance and resistance to high ultraviolet light. Such sealants can also offer resistance to fuel and maintain their adhesion upon exposure to fuel.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Polyureas are generally formed by reacting amines and isocyanates. The use of amines such as polyamines as crosslinkers or &#x201c;curatives&#x201d; is well known. For example, amines are known to crosslink with isocyanates to form urea compounds. Similarly, sulfur-containing compounds are known to crosslink with isocyanates to form thiourea compounds. The use of sulfur-containing compounds in a polyurea coating, however, has been difficult due to the high viscosity and odor of the sulfur-containing compounds. Combinations, however, would be desirable to provide optimum properties.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention is directed to a coating composition comprising polyurea and polythiourea formed from a reaction mixture comprising a first component comprising isocyanate (&#x201c;isocyanate component&#x201d;), a second component comprising an amine (&#x201c;amine component&#x201d;), and a sulfur-containing compound in the first and/or second component. The first component further comprises an isocyanate functional polythioether-polyurethane and/or polythiourethane, and/or the second component further comprises an amine/hydroxy functional polythioether. The amine component may be referred to herein as a &#x201c;curative&#x201d; because it will react or cure with the isocyanate to form a polyurea and/or a polythiourea. In certain embodiments, the ratio of equivalents of isocyanate groups to equivalents of amine/mercaptan groups is greater than 1 and the isocyanate component and the amine component can be applied to a substrate at a volume mixing ratio of 1:1. The terms &#x201c;mercaptan&#x201d; and variants thereof and &#x201c;thiol&#x201d; and variants thereof are used interchangeably herein.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As used herein, the term &#x201c;isocyanate&#x201d; includes unblocked compounds capable of forming a covalent bond with a reactive group such as a hydroxyl, mercaptan or amine functional group. Thus, isocyanate can refer to &#x201c;free isocyanate&#x201d;, which will be understood to those skilled in the art. In alternate non-limiting embodiments, the isocyanate of the present invention can be monofunctional containing one isocyanate functional group (NCO) or the isocyanate used in the present invention can be polyfunctional containing two or more isocyanate functional groups (NCOs).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Suitable isocyanates for use in the present invention are numerous and can vary widely. Such isocyanates can include those that are known in the art. Non-limiting examples of suitable isocyanates can include monomeric and/or polymeric isocyanates. The polyisocyanates can be selected from monomers, prepolymers, oligomers, or blends thereof. In an embodiment, the polyisocyanate can be C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>20 </sub>linear, branched, cyclic, aromatic, or blends thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Suitable isocyanates for use in the present invention may include but are not limited to isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), which is 3,3,5-trimethyl-5-isocyanato-methyl-cyclohexyl isocyanate; hydrogenated materials such as cyclohexylene diisocyanate, 4,4&#x2032;-methylenedicyclohexyl diisocyanate (H<sub>12</sub>MDI); mixed aralkyl diisocyanates such as tetramethylxylyl diisocyanates, OCN&#x2014;C(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>C(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;NCO; polymethylene isocyanates such as 1,4-tetramethylene diisocyanate, 1,5-pentamethylene diisocyanate, 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDI), 1,7-heptamethylene diisocyanate, 2,2,4- and 2,4,4-trimethylhexamethylene diisocyanate, 1,10-decamethylene diisocyanate and 2-methyl-1,5-pentamethylene diisocyanate; and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Non-limiting examples of aromatic isocyanates for use in the present invention may include but are not limited to phenylene diisocyanate, toluene diisocyanate (TDI), xylene diisocyanate, 1,5-naphthalene diisocyanate, chlorophenylene 2,4-diisocyanate, bitoluene diisocyanate, dianisidine diisocyanate, tolidine diisocyanate, alkylated benzene diisocyanates, methylene-interrupted aromatic diisocyanates such as methylenediphenyl diisocyanate, 4,4&#x2032;-isomer (MDI) including alkylated analogs such as 3,3&#x2032;-dimethyl-4,4&#x2032;-diphenylmethane diisocyanate, polymeric methylenediphenyl diisocyanate and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a non-limiting embodiment, polyisocyanate monomer may be used. It is believed that the use of a polyisocyanate monomer (i.e., residual-free monomer from the preparation of prepolymer) may decrease the viscosity of the polyurea/polythiourea composition thereby improving its flowability, and may provide improved adhesion of the polyurea/polythiourea coating to a previously applied coating and/or to an uncoated substrate. For example, the coatings that have been previously applied to a substrate can comprise functional groups (e.g. hydroxy groups) that are reactive with isocyanates, thereby enhancing adhesion of this coating to the polyurea/polythiourea composition of the present invention applied over this coating. A lower viscosity polyurea/polythiourea composition may also remain in a &#x201c;flowable&#x201d; state for a longer period of time as compared to a comparable composition having a higher viscosity. In alternate embodiments of the present invention, at least 1 percent by weight, or at least 2 percent by weight, or at least 4 percent by weight of the isocyanate component comprises at least one polyisocyanate monomer.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a further embodiment of the invention, the isocyanate can include oligomeric polyisocyanates including but not limited to dimers, such as the uretdione of 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate, trimers, such as the biuret and isocyanurate of 1,6-hexanediisocyanate and the isocyanurate of isophorone diisocyanate, allophonates and polymeric oligomers. Modified polyisocyanates can also be used, including but not limited to carbodiimides and uretdiones, and mixtures thereof. Suitable materials include, without limitation, those available under the designation DESMODUR from Bayer Corporation of Pittsburgh, Pa. and include DESMODUR N 3200, DESMODUR N 3300, DESMODUR N 3400, DESMODUR XP 2410, and DESMODUR XP 2580.</p>

Suitable polyisocyanates include those previously disclosed herein. Suitable polyamines are numerous and may be selected from a wide variety known in the art. Examples of suitable polyamines include but are not limited to primary and secondary amines, and mixtures thereof, such as any of those listed herein. Amine terminated polyureas may also be used. Amines comprising tertiary amine functionality can be used provided that the amine further comprises at least two primary and/or secondary amino groups.

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In certain embodiments, the isocyanate includes an isocyanate prepolymer and in other embodiments the isocyanate includes an isocyanate prepolymer and one or more additional isocyanates, such as one or more of the polyisocyanates described above.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As noted above, the polyurea/polythiourea of the present compositions is formed from a reaction mixture comprising an isocyanate component and an amine component.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Suitable amines for use in the amine component of the present invention can be selected from a wide variety of known amines, such as primary and secondary amines, and mixtures thereof including polyamines having at least two functional groups, such as di-, tri-, or higher functional polyamines and mixtures thereof. The amine or amines used may be aromatic or aliphatic, such as cycloaliphatic, or mixtures thereof.

<p id="p-0157" num="0156">The sulfur-containing compound in the present invention can also comprise a polysulfide. A polysulfide is a polymer that contains multiple sulfur-sulfur linkages; that is, &#x2014;[S&#x2014;S]&#x2014;, in the polymer backbone and/or in terminal or pendant positions on the polymer chain. In certain embodiments, the polysulfide polymers used according to the present invention have two or more sulfur-sulfur linkages. Suitable polysulfides are commercially available from AKZO Nobel under the name THIOPLAST and from Toray Chemicals under the name THIOKEL. These products are available in a wide range of molecular weights ranging, for example, from less than 1100 to over 8000, with molecular weight being the average molecular weight in grams per mole. Particularly suitable is a number average molecular weight of 1000 to 4000. The crosslink density of these products also varies, depending on the amount of crosslinking agent used. The mercaptan content, that is the &#x201c;SH&#x201d; content, of these products can also vary. In some embodiments, it may be desired to use a combination of polysulfides to achieve the desired molecular weight and/or crosslink density in the present compositions. Different molecular weights and/or crosslink densities can contribute different characteristics to the composition. For example, compositions wherein the sulfur-containing compound comprises more than one polysulfide polymer, and one of the polysulfide polymers has a molecular weight of approximately 1000, may have desirable non-crystallization properties.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">In certain embodiments, the sulfur-containing compound is in the form of a prepolymer. Such prepolymers can be prepared, for example, by reacting a thiol with a compound comprising isocyanate functionality; the thiol can have one or more thiol groups and can further comprise one or more disulfide linkages.

<p id="p-0160" num="0159">In an embodiment, the coating compositions of the present invention may further include polyurethane and/or poly(thio)urethane. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that polyurethane and/or poly(thio)urethane can be formed as a by-product in the reactions of the present invention. In alternate embodiments, the polyurethane and/or poly(thio)urethane can be formed in-situ and/or it can be added to the reaction mixture; a non-limiting example is an NCO functional prepolymer formed by reaction of a polyol and a polyisocyanate as disclosed herein.

<p id="p-0161" num="0160">The polyurea/polythiourea coating composition of the present invention may be formulated and applied using various techniques known in the art. Accordingly, the present invention is further directed to methods for coating a substrate comprising applying to at least a portion of the substrate any of the coating compositions described herein. In an embodiment, conventional spraying techniques may be used. In this embodiment, the isocyanate component and amine component may be combined such that the ratio of equivalents of isocyanate groups to equivalents of amine/thiol groups is greater than 1 and the isocyanate component and the amine component can be applied to a substrate at a volume mixing ratio of 1:1; the reaction mixture may be applied to an uncoated or coated substrate to form a first coating on the uncoated substrate or a subsequent coating on the coated substrate. When determining the ratio of equivalents of isocyanate groups to equivalents of reactive amine/thiol groups, the total amine/thiol groups are taken into consideration; that is the amine groups from any amine or amines used in the coating, and the thiol groups from any sulfur-containing compound used in the coating.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">It will be appreciated that the present compositions are two component or &#x201c;2K&#x201d; compositions, wherein the isocyanate component and the amine component are kept separate until just prior to application. Such compositions will be understood as curing under ambient conditions, although a heated forced air or a heat cure can be applied to accelerate final cure or to enhance coating properties such as adhesion. In an embodiment, the sprayable coating composition may be prepared using a two-component mixing device. In this embodiment, isocyanate component and amine component are added to a high pressure impingement mixing device. The isocyanate component is added to the &#x201c;A-side&#x201d; and amine component is added to the &#x201c;B-side&#x201d;. The A- and B-side streams are impinged upon each other and immediately sprayed onto at least a portion of an uncoated or coated substrate. The isocyanate and the amine or the amine and sulfur-containing compound react to produce a coating composition that is cured upon application to the uncoated or coated substrate. The A- and/or B-side can also be heated prior to application, such as to a temperature of 140&#xb0; F. Heating may promote a better viscosity match between the two components and thus better mixing, but is not necessary for the curing reaction to occur.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">It is believed that the ratio of equivalents of isocyanate groups to amine/thiol groups may be selected to control the rate of cure of the coating composition of the present invention. It has been found that cure and adhesion advantages may result when applying the coating in a 1:1 volume ratio wherein the ratio of the equivalents of isocyanate groups to amine/thiol groups (also known as the reaction index) is greater than one, such as from 1.01 to 1.10:1, or from 1.03 to 1.10:1, or from 1.05 to 1.08:1 or from 1.01 to 1.4 to 1 or from 1.01 to 1.5, or greater than 1.3 to 1. For example, good adhesion can be obtained using these ratios over clearcoats that have low surface functionality after cure, such as carbamate melamine, hydroxyl melamine, 2K urethane, and silane-containing clearcoats. The term &#x201c;1:1 volume ratio&#x201d; means that the volume ratio varies by up to 20% for each component, or up to 10% or up to 5%.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">The rate of reaction of the thiol groups with the isocyanate can be altered depending on the type of amine or amines used. The amine co-reactant can function as a catalyst in the thiol/isocyanate reaction. While the inventors do not wish to be bound by any mechanism, it is believed that the greater the basicity of the amine, the faster the cure rate between the thiol and the isocyanate. Accordingly, the particular amine used and the amount of the amine used can be altered to adjust the cure rate of the overall composition. Alternatively, a catalyst can be used to increase the reaction rate. Suitable catalysts include, for example, DBU and other tertiary amines.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">In a non-limiting embodiment, a commercially available mixing device available commercially under the designation GUSMER VR-H-3000 proportioner fitted with a GUSMER Model GX-7 spray gun may be used. In this device, pressurized streams of the A- and B-side components are delivered from two separate chambers and are impacted or impinged upon each other at high velocity to mix the two components and form a coating composition, which may be applied to an uncoated or coated substrate using the spray gun. The mixing forces experienced by the component streams may depend upon the volume of each stream entering the mixing chamber per unit time and the pressure at which the component streams are delivered. A 1:1 volume ratio of the isocyanate and amine/thiol per unit time may equalize these forces.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">Another suitable application device known in the industry includes a &#x201c;static mix tube&#x201d; applicator. In this device, the isocyanate component and amine component are each stored in a separate chamber. As pressure is applied, each of the components is brought into a mixing tube in a 1:1 ratio by volume. Mixing of the components is effected by way of a torturous or cork screw pathway within the tube. The exit end of the tube may have atomization capability useful in spray application of the reaction mixture. Alternatively, the fluid reaction mixture may be applied to a substrate as a bead. A static mix tube applicator is commercially available from Cammda Corporation.</p>

<p id="p-0168" num="0167">In an embodiment, the polyurea/polythiourea coating composition of the present invention may be applied to a carrier film. The carrier film can be selected from a wide variety of such materials known in the art. Non-limiting examples of suitable carrier films may include, but are not limited to thermoplastic materials, thermosetting materials, metal foils, cellulosic paper, synthetic papers, and mixtures thereof. As used herein, the term &#x201c;thermoplastic material&#x201d; refers to any material that is capable of softening or fusing when heated and of solidifying (hardening) again when cooled. Non-limiting examples of suitable thermoplastic materials may include polyolefins, polyurethanes, polyesters, polyamides, polyureas, acrylics, and mixtures thereof.

Non-limiting examples may include polyurethane polymers, polyester polymers, polyamide polymers, polyurea polymers, polycarbonate polymers, acrylic polymers, aminoplasts, isocyanates, epoxies, copolymers thereof, and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">As noted above, in certain embodiments, the polyurea/polythiourea coating compositions of the present invention may be applied to a bare (e.g., untreated, uncoated) substrate, a pretreated substrate and/or coated substrate having at least one other coating. In a non-limiting embodiment, the coating compositions of the present invention may be applied as part of a multi-layer coating composite. The first coating applied to a substrate may be selected from a variety of coating compositions known in the art for surface coating substrates. Non-limiting examples may include but are not limited to electrodepositable film-forming compositions, primer compositions, pigmented or non-pigmented monocoat compositions, pigmented or non-pigmented base coat compositions, transparent topcoat compositions, industrial coating compositions, and the like. In another non-limiting embodiment, the coating compositions of the present invention may be applied as part of a multi-layer coating composite comprising a pretreated substrate and coating layers such as but not limited to electrocoat, primer, base coat, clear coat, and combinations thereof. In an embodiment, the clear coat comprises silane functional groups either before or after crosslinking and cure.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">In a further embodiment, the polyurea/polythiourea coating compositions of the present invention can be used in a two-coat application resulting in a textured surface. A first coat is applied to an uncoated or coated substrate to produce a smooth, substantially tack-free layer. The &#x201c;Tack-Free Method&#x201d; is used to determine if the layer is substantially tack-free. The Tack-Free Method includes spraying the coating composition in one coat onto a non-adhering plastic sheet to a thickness of from 10 to 15 mil (254-381 microns). When spraying is complete, an operator, using a loose fitting, disposable vinyl glove, such as one commercially available as AMBIDEX Disposable Vinyl Glove by Marigold Industrial, Norcross Ga., gently touches the surface of the coating. The coating may be touched more than one time by using a different fingertip. When the glove tip no longer sticks to, or must be pulled from, the surface of the layer, the layer is said to be substantially tack-free. The time beginning from the completion of spraying until when the coating is substantially tack-free is said to be the tack time or tack-free time. In a non-limiting embodiment, the tack-free time and the cure time may be controlled by balancing levels of various composition components such as the amount and/or type of amine.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">A second coat may then be applied to the first coating layer as a texturizing layer or &#x201c;dust coating&#x201d;. The second coating layer can be applied by increasing the distance between the application/mixing device and the coated substrate to form discrete droplets of the coating composition prior to contacting the coated substrate thereby forming controlled non-uniformity in the surface of the second layer. The substantially tack-free first layer of the coating is at least partially resistant to the second layer; i.e., at least partially resistant to coalescence of the droplets of coating composition sprayed thereon as the second layer or dust coating such that the droplets adhere to but do not coalesce with the previous layer(s) to create surface texture. The final coating layer typically exhibits more surface texture than the first or previous coating layers. Alternatively, a textured surface may be achieved by injection during in-mold coating, or by spray coating the present composition and then rolling a texture onto its surface. An overall thickness of the coating layers may range from 20 to 1000 mils, or from 40 to 150 mils, or from 60 to 100 mils (1524-2540 microns), or from 500 to 750 mils. Any of the endpoints within these ranges can also be combined. In a non-limiting embodiment, the first layer may be the majority of the total thickness and the dust coating may be from 15-50 mils (381-1270 microns).</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">In various embodiments of the present invention, the &#x201c;first&#x201d; coating layer may comprise one, two, three or more layers; and the &#x201c;second&#x201d; coating layer may be one or more subsequent layers applied thereover. For example, four polyurea (or polyurea/polythiourea) layers may be applied, with the fourth layer being the dust coating and each layer having a thickness of from 15 to 25 mil (381-635 microns). It will be appreciated that these coating layers are relatively &#x201c;thick&#x201d;. The coating compositions of the present invention can also be applied as much thinner layers as well, such as 0.1 to less the 15 mils, such as 0.1 to 10, 0.5 to 3 or 1 to 2 mils. Any of the endpoints within these ranges can also be combined. Such layers can be used alone or in conjunction with other coating layers, such as any of those known in the art or otherwise described herein. When applied at a sufficient thickness (e.g. 10 to 1000 mils, such as 100 to 200 mils, or 125 mils+/&#x2212;10 mils), the present polyurea/polythiourea layer(s) can provide blast and/or ballistic mitigation. &#x201c;Blast and/or ballistic mitigation&#x201d; means, for example, protection in the event of a close proximity blast, projectile, or explosion. This protection can include, for example, protection of a structure or portion of a structure, such as a building structure, vehicle, aircraft, ship/boat, shipping container and the like, from collapse and/or destruction, protection against flying debris and blast fragments, gunshots and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">In alternate embodiments, the coating layers may comprise the same or different polyurea/polythiourea coating compositions. For example, the first layer may be a composition comprising aliphatic and/or aromatic amine components and/or aliphatic and/or aromatic polyisocyanate and the second layer may comprise the same or different combination of aliphatic and/or aromatic amine components and/or aliphatic and/or aromatic polyisocyanate. Either or both layers may further comprise any of the sulfur-containing compounds described herein. &#x201c;Amine component&#x201d; in this context means any amine used in the present coatings. In a further embodiment, the outermost coating layer may comprise a coating composition that provides a desired durability. The desired durability may depend upon the use of the coating composition of the present invention and/or the substrate to which it may be applied. In an embodiment, a combination of aliphatic and/or aromatic amine and/or polyisocyanate may be selected such that the composition of the outermost layer has substantial durability. For example, the outermost coating layer may have a durability of 1000 kJ to 6000 kJ, or from 800 hours to 4000 hours, when tested using a Weatherometer (Atlas Material Testing Solutions) in accordance with method SAE J1960.

Additional color effect compositions can include transparent coated mica and/or synthetic mica, coated silica, coated alumina, a transparent liquid crystal pigment, a liquid crystal coating, and/or any composition wherein interference results from a refractive index differential within the material and not because of the refractive index differential between the surface of the material and the air.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">In certain non-limiting embodiments, a photosensitive composition and/or photochromic composition, which reversibly alters its color when exposed to one or more light sources, can be used in the coating of the present invention. Photochromic and/or photosensitive compositions can be activated by exposure to radiation of a specified wavelength. When the composition becomes excited, the molecular structure is changed and the altered structure exhibits a new color that is different from the original color of the composition. When the exposure to radiation is removed, the photochromic and/or photosensitive composition can return to a state of rest, in which the original color of the composition returns. In one non-limiting embodiment, the photochromic and/or photosensitive composition can be colorless in a non-excited state and exhibit a color in an excited state. Full color-change can appear within milliseconds to several minutes, such as from 20 seconds to 60 seconds. Example photochromic and/or photosensitive compositions include photochromic dyes.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">In a non-limiting embodiment, the photosensitive composition and/or photochromic composition can be associated with and/or at least partially bound to, such as by covalent bonding, a polymer and/or polymeric materials of a polymerizable component. In contrast to some coatings in which the photosensitive composition may migrate out of the coating and crystallize into the substrate, the photosensitive composition and/or photochromic composition associated with and/or at least partially bound to a polymer and/or polymerizable component in accordance with a non-limiting embodiment of the present invention, have minimal migration out of the coating. Example photosensitive compositions and/or photochromic compositions and methods for making them are identified in U.S. application Ser. No. 10/892,919 filed Jul. 16, 2004 and incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">In general, the colorant can be present in the coating composition in any amount sufficient to impart the desired property, visual and/or color effect. The colorant may comprise from 1 to 65 weight percent of the present compositions, such as from 3 to 40 weight percent or 5 to 35 weight percent, with weight percent based on the total weight of the compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">In another embodiment, the polyurea/polythiourea coating compositions of the present invention when applied to a substrate possesses color that matches the color of an associated substrate. As used herein, the term &#x201c;matches&#x201d; or like terms when referring to color matching means that the color of the coating composition of the present invention substantially corresponds to a desired color or the color of an associated substrate. For instance, when the substrate for the polyurea coating composition is a portion of a vehicle, such as a truck bed, the color of the coating substantially matches that of the associated vehicle body. This can be visually observed, or confirmed using spectroscopy equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">The coatings of the present invention may be part of a multi-layer coating composite comprising a substrate with various coating layers such as a pretreatment layer, electrocoat, primer, base coat and clear coat. At least one of the base coat and clear coat may contain pigment and/or the clear coat may contain an adhesion promoter and any of these coatings can be one or more of the coatings described herein. It is believed that the addition of adhesion promoter to the clear coat, or to its surface, may improve the adhesion between the clear coat and the coating composition applied thereover, although the inventors do not wish to be bound by any mechanism. In this embodiment, the coating composition of the present invention may be the reaction product of the isocyanate component and the amine component with a colorant additive. The coating composition of the present invention containing colorant may be applied to at least a portion of the article or structure. The color of the coated article or structure may match the color of an associated substrate. An &#x201c;associated substrate&#x201d; may refer to a substrate that comprises the article or structure but is not coated with the coating composition of the present invention or a substrate that is attached, connected or in close proximity to the article or structure, but is not coated with the coating composition of the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0193" num="0192">In a glass jar with magnetic stirrer were mixed DMDS from Nisso Maruzen, Japan, 154.0 g. (1.0 mol) and PA from Aldrich, 28.0 g. (0.5 mol) at room temperature. Then this mixture was heated up to 60&#xb0; C. using an oil bath. The mixture was kept at this temperature while stirring for 30 min. An exothermic reaction started to take place, leading to an increase in the temperature of the reaction mixture to 80&#xb0; C. for a short period of time. This exothermic reaction was over after 30 minutes and the reaction temperature went down to 60&#xb0; C., the temperature of the heating bath. Radical initiator VAZO<sup>1 </sup>64, 50 mg., 275 ppm was added three times at intervals of 5 hours while the mixture was stirred at 60&#xb0; C. The equivalent weight of the product was 181.5 g/equiv (theoretical 182 g/equiv), based on an Mn=363. VAZO 64, 50 mg., 275 ppm was added again and the mixture was heated at 60&#xb0; C. upon stirring for another 5 hours. The equivalent weight measurement showed no changes and the reaction was considered completed. The viscosity of the materials was 258 cPs (25&#xb0; C.), nD=1.627, Abbe 36, nE=1.631, Abbe 36.

<p id="p-0203" num="0202">An isocyanate-functional polyurethane for use as the A side in Examples 7-11, was prepared as described below:</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">A total of 1348.9 grams of isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) and 1901.5 grams of TERATHANE 650, were added to a suitable reaction vessel equipped with a stirrer, temperature probe, condenser and a nitrogen cap. The contents of the flask were mixed well. Then 0.2 grams of dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTDL) were added to the mixture. The contents were slowly heated to 80&#xb0; C. The contents underwent an exotherm to 112&#xb0; C. The reaction was held at 100&#xb0; C. for 2.5 hours. The isocyanate equivalent weight of the contents was then measured and found to be 531. The temperature of the reaction mixture was lowered to 80&#xb0; C. Finally, 2490.6 grams of DESMODUR XP2580 and 2490.6 grams of DESMODUR XP2410 were added to the reaction mixture. The contents of the reactor were cooled and poured out. The final material had a measured solids of 98%, a viscosity of Y, and an isocyanate equivalent weight of 255.8.</p>

<p id="p-0211" num="0210">The B side formulations of the table above were made by taking Grind 1 and then blending in the balance of the other materials until well mixed. The B side formulations were charged into separate canisters and to be paired up with the A side formulation (in separate canisters) and heated to 140&#xb0; F. in an oven for 2-6 hrs prior to spraying to ensure samples were equilibrated. Polyurea coating compositions were produced by mixing a 1:1 volume ratio of the A-side components to the B-side components in a static mix tube applicator device available from Cammda Corporation and sprayed onto panels.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">Hardness values were determined by charging the A and B side components into a double-barreled syringe equipped with a static mix tube and a &#x201c;Pneumatic applicator&#x201d; (PC Cox Limited) and injecting the components at a 1:1 ratio into a mold to form a round &#x201c;puck&#x201d; of approximately 6 cm in diameter and 0.2 cm in thickness. The hardness of the polyurea coating puck at ambient temperature was measured on the Shore D scale with a Model 212 Pencil Style Digital Durometer (Pacific Transducer Corp.) The pucks were then placed in a 140&#xb0; F. oven for 1 day and the Shore D hardness of the coating measured with the puck still inside the oven to prevent cooling. The pucks were removed from the oven and cooled to ambient temperature. The hardness was measured again on those pucks at ambient temperature after being out of the oven for 1 day.</p>
