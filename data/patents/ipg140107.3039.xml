<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a drum hitting assembly and particularly to a cajon hitting assembly.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A cajon looks like a stool which can be sat by people and hit at various positions to generate different sounds, thus is suitable for impromptu performance. The cajon is an empty wooden chest with a round hole formed on the back side as a sound outlet. At the front of the wooden chest, there is a snare installed therein to generate timbre like a snare drum.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in order to facilitate hitting convenience and enhance versatility, the cajon hitting assembly can serve as an ancillary hitting device. A conventional cajon hitting assembly comprises a foot pedal <b>1</b>, a first upright post <b>2</b>, a wire tube <b>3</b>, a second upright post <b>4</b>, a hitter <b>5</b> and a holding rack <b>6</b>. The holding rack <b>6</b> holds a cajon <b>7</b>. The second upright post <b>4</b> has a turnable axle <b>8</b> located thereon. The hitter <b>5</b> is fastened to the axle <b>8</b> to face the cajon <b>7</b>. The wire tube <b>3</b> is threaded by a drawing wire (not shown in the drawing) that has one end fastened to the hitter <b>5</b> and other end fastened to the foot pedal <b>1</b>. The foot pedal <b>1</b> is located on the first upright post <b>2</b>. By treading the foot pedal <b>1</b>, the drawing wire can be drawn to drive the axle <b>8</b> to turn, thereby the hitter <b>5</b> is driven to hit the cajon <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The cajon hitting assembly can enhance the versatility of hitting the cajon <b>7</b> to further enhance appeal of performances. With the drawing wire threading through the wire tube <b>3</b>, the position of the foot pedal <b>1</b> can be adjusted according to user's usual practices and use requirements. However, the displacement generated by the downward tread on the foot pedal <b>1</b> directly draws the drawing wire to move that in turn drives the hitter <b>5</b> to turn. Thus, the moving displacement of the drawing wire is not enough, and the torsional force being generated also is inadequate. Moreover, a static friction force generally takes place between the drawing wire and wire tube <b>3</b>. Hence when the torsional force is inadequate, jammed feeling is easily generated during tread on the foot pedal. Thus it cannot fully meet use requirements of the cajon <b>7</b> during performance.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The primary object of the present invention is to provide a cajon hitting assembly capable of treading smoothly to meet use requirements during performance.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To achieve the foregoing object, the cajon hitting assembly according to the invention comprises a first upright post, a first strut, a second upright post, a second strut, a foot pedal, a wire tube, a hitter and a holding rack. The first upright post has a turnable first axle located thereon. The first strut has one end fastened to the first axle. The second upright post has a turnable second axle located thereon. The second strut has one end fastened to the second axle. The foot pedal drives the first axle to turn.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The wire tube is threaded by a drawing wire which has a start end and a distal end. The wire tube has two ends respectively fastened to the first upright post and second upright post. The start end of the drawing wire is fastened to the first strut and spaced from the first axle at a first distance. The distal end of the drawing wire is fastened to the second strut and spaced from the second axle at a second distance. The hitter is fastened to the second axle. The holding rack securely clamps the cajon.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">By means of the structure set forth above, the first and second struts can provide a lever function to increase the moving displacement of the drawing wire and enhance the instantaneous torsional force, thus the static friction force between the drawing wire and wire tube can be eliminated. Hence when the foot pedal is treaded to drive the hitter to hit the cajon, a smoother movement can be accomplished to meet use requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The foregoing, as well as additional objects, features and advantages of the invention will be more readily apparent from the following detailed description, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B and <b>4</b>, the present invention aims to provide a cajon hitting assembly to hit a cajon <b>100</b>. It comprises a first upright post <b>10</b>, a first strut <b>20</b>, a second upright post <b>30</b>, a second strut <b>40</b>, a foot pedal <b>50</b>, a wire tube <b>60</b>, a hitter <b>70</b> and a holding rack <b>80</b>. The first upright post <b>10</b> has a turnable first axle <b>11</b> located thereon. The first strut <b>20</b> has one end fastened to the first axle <b>11</b> which has a first fastening bar <b>12</b> extended downwards. The first upright post <b>10</b> and first fastening bar <b>12</b> are bridged by a first elastic element <b>13</b> which provides an elastic force for the turning of the first axle <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The second upright post <b>30</b> has a turnable second axle <b>31</b> located thereon. The second strut <b>40</b> has one end fastened to the second axle <b>31</b> which has a second fastening bar <b>32</b> extended downwards. The second upright post <b>30</b> and second fastening bar <b>32</b> are bridged by a second elastic element <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The foot pedal <b>50</b> drives the first axle <b>11</b> to turn. The first axle <b>11</b> is coupled by a drive bar <b>14</b> transversely. The drive bar <b>14</b> is coupled with the foot pedal <b>50</b> via a belt <b>90</b> which can draw and is flexible to drive the first axle <b>11</b> to turn. The drive bar <b>14</b> has a groove <b>141</b> to hold the belt <b>90</b> from loosening.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The wire tube <b>60</b> is threaded by a drawing wire <b>61</b> which has a start end <b>611</b> and a distal end <b>612</b>. The wire tube <b>60</b> has two ends fastened respectively to the first upright post <b>10</b> and second upright post <b>30</b>. The first upright post <b>10</b> has a first support bar <b>15</b> to hold the wire tube <b>60</b>. The first support bar <b>15</b> is further fastened by a first holding member <b>16</b> via screwing. The wire tube <b>60</b> runs through the first holding member <b>16</b> and is fastened by two nuts <b>91</b>, thereby the direction of the wire tube <b>60</b> can be confined to reduce the static friction force between the drawing wire <b>61</b> and wire tube <b>60</b>. Similarly, the second upright post <b>30</b> has a second support bar <b>34</b> to hold the wire tube <b>60</b>, and also is fastened by a second holding member <b>35</b>. The wire tube <b>60</b> runs through the second holding member <b>35</b> and is fastened by another two nuts <b>91</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The start end <b>611</b> of the drawing wire <b>61</b> is fastened to the first strut <b>20</b> and spaced from the first axle <b>11</b> at a first distance D<b>1</b> (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>). The distal end <b>612</b> of the drawing wire <b>61</b> is fastened to the second strut <b>40</b> and spaced from the second axle <b>31</b> at a second distance D<b>2</b> (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>). Through the first and second distances D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> and a lever principle, the moving displacement of the drawing wire <b>61</b> increases and the instantaneous torsional force also enhances, thereby the static friction force between the drawing wire <b>61</b> and wire tube <b>60</b> can be eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The hitter <b>70</b> is fastened to the second axle <b>31</b>. The holding rack <b>80</b> securely clamps the cajon <b>100</b>. The holding rack <b>80</b> has an L-shaped plate <b>81</b> fastened by an adjustment press disc <b>82</b> via screwing. Hence the invention is adaptable to the cajon <b>100</b> at varying sizes by adjusting the adjustment press disc <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Also referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, when in use, a user treads on the foot pedal <b>50</b> to drive the first axle <b>11</b> to turn, and the first axle <b>11</b> then drives the drawing wire <b>61</b> to move and the second axle <b>31</b> to turn, thereby the hitter <b>70</b> is also driven to turn. Through the first and second distances D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b>, a lever action takes place on the first and second struts <b>20</b> and <b>40</b>, hence not only the moving displacement of the drawing wire <b>61</b> increases, but also the instantaneous torsional force enhances, thereby the static friction force between the drawing wire <b>61</b> and wire tube <b>60</b> can be eliminated. As a result, smoothness of treading on the foot pedal <b>50</b> to drive the hitter <b>70</b> to hit the cajon <b>100</b> can be improved to meet use requirements.</p>
