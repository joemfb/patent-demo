<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to synergistic combinations of polyene fungicides with antibiotic non-ribosomal peptides, such as amphiphilic cyclic lipopeptides, to improve the fungicidal activity of both components.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Fungicides have myriad uses, including for crop protection; as food, feed, and cosmetics preservatives; and as pharmaceuticals for both human and veterinary applications. Crop yield reduction, food-borne diseases and fungal infections of both humans and animals are a problem in both developed and developing countries. Therefore, improvements to the efficacy of existing fungicides, especially those that are environmentally friendly and are not susceptible to development of fungal resistance are highly desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Polyene fungicides are antifungal antibiotics that have been used in all of the aforementioned fields. They may be obtained through fermentation of <i>Streptomyces </i>species, such as <i>Streptomyces natalensis</i>, which is commonly found in soil. Activity of polyene fungicides derives, in part, from their ability to damage cell membranes by forming complexes with ergosterol. Numerous studies have confirmed that the potential for development of fungi resistant to natamycin is very low. Further, polyene fungicides have negligible toxicity, as they do not affect the cholesterol present in mammalian cells.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Non-ribosomal peptides, including cyclic amphiphilic lipopeptides such as surfactins, iturins and fengycins, are well-recognized for their antimicrobial properties and have been used in the field of crop protection. Because of their mode of action, they also have potential uses in biopharmaceutical and other biotechnology applications. Lipopeptides may be obtained through fermentation of various soil bacteria, including <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>and <i>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</i>. Lipopeptides, similarly to polyene fungicides, kill fungi by disrupting cell membranes. The potential for the development of fungal resistance to these compounds is expected to be very low since they act directly upon membrane lipids and not on a single site protein target. Further, lipopeptides are environmentally friendly and of low risk to workers and consumers; in fact, crops treated with lipopeptide-containing <i>Bacillus </i>strains may be harvested on the day of treatment. Applicants have discovered that combinations of polyene fungicides and lipopeptides cause a synergistic, rather than simply an additive, increase in efficacy against microorganisms such as fungi. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, Applicants hypothesize that the lipopeptides and polyene fungicides of the present invention act in a synergistic fungicidal manner because each type of compound disrupts fungal cell membranes via a distinct mode of action.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides a low-tox, low resistance-inducing, increased-efficacy fungicidal composition that comprises components that are less toxic than many traditional synthetic fungicides and that are applied at rates lower than either compound individually. This fungicidal composition is comprised of a synergistic fungicidal combination of one or more polyene fungicides and at least one lipopeptide. In one embodiment, the polyene fungicide is one or more of natamycin, nystatin, amphotericin B, aureofungin, filipin and lucenosomycin and/or derivatives of each of these polyene fungicides. In another embodiment, the composition includes more than one polyene fungicide.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The lipopeptide component of this synergistic fungicidal combination may be part of a fermentation product produced by a lipopeptide-producing microorganism, may be a crude extract of such fungicidal fermentation product, or may be purified or semi-purified from such fermentation product.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">All publications, patents and patent applications, including any drawings and appendices therein, are incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The following description includes information that may be useful in understanding the present invention. It is not an admission that any of the information provided herein is prior art or relevant to the presently claimed inventions, or that any publication specifically or implicitly referenced is prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The present invention encompasses synergistic combinations of polyene fungicides with antibiotic non-ribosomal peptides, other than enzymes, for control of microbial pathogens, such as fungi, oomycetes and/or bacteria.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Polyene fungicides of the present invention are antifungal antibiotics with a macrocyclic lactone ring having (i) a rigid lipophilic polyene portion and a flexible, hydrophilic hydroxylated portion and (ii) the ability to bind to a sterol in the cell membrane of most fungi, principally ergosterol. The macrocyclic lactone ring may have 12-40 carbons, 6-14 hydroxyl groups and may or may not be linked to a carbohydrate. The ring may be linked to one or more sugars such as a simple sugar with five or more carbon units, a deoxy sugar, amino sugars and the like, which contain substituent groups attached to the ring including oxygenated linkages. Polyene fungicides of the present invention may be obtained from a species of <i>Streptomyces </i>bacteria. Such fungicides include natamycin, nystatin, amphotericin B, aureofungin, filipin and lucensomycin as well as derivatives thereof. Examples of derivatives include the amphotericin B derivatives described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,606,038, for example, or the nystatin derivatives/analogues such as S44HP, NYST1068, and the octaene nystatin described in Bruheim et al., ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY, November 2004, pp. 4120-4129. Derivatives are naturally occurring analogs of a parent molecule or synthetic or semi-synthetic compounds derivatized from a parent molecule that retain at least some fungicidal activity compared to the parent molecule. In some embodiments, the derivatives have at least the same or greater fungicidal activity compared to the parent molecule. Derivatives include salts and solvates and other modified forms that have enhanced solubility compared to the parent molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Antibiotic non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs) of the present invention are cell membrane or cell wall disrupting non-ribosomal peptides, excluding enzymes. Such antibiotic NRPs are synthesized by large enzymatic complexes called nonribosomal peptide synthetases, rather than by ribosomes. The term &#x201c;antibiotic,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to the ability to kill or slow the growth of microbial pathogens, such as fungi, oomycetes and/or bacteria. A database of nonribosomal peptides called Norine is provided on the internet and described in Caboche, S., et al., &#x201c;NORINE: A Database of Nonribosomal Peptides,&#x201d; <i>Nucleic Acids Research, </i>36:D326-D331, (2008). Antibiotic NRPs of the present invention disrupt cell membranes, including organelle membranes, or cell walls. Membranes or walls may be disrupted through various means, including inhibition of synthesis of components of cell membranes or walls; physical disruption of the components of the cell membrane, such as through permeabilization of phospholipid membranes, either by membrane solubilization or osmotic perturbation; or binding to small molecules in the cell membrane.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Cell-wall disrupting antifungal NRPs of the present invention include echinocandins, which are semi-synthetic amphiphilic lipopeptides composed of a cyclic hexapeptide core linked to a variably configured lipid side chain. Echinocandins inhibit synthesis of 1,3-&#x3b2;-glucan, a predominant polysaccharide component of the ascomycete cell wall that maintains the osmotic integrity of the cell and is involved in cell division and growth. Echinocandins include caspofungin, micafungin and anidulafungin.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Cell-membrane disrupting antifungal NRPs of the present invention also include lipopeptides, such as amphiphilic cyclic peptides obtainable from various bacteria, including <i>Bacillus </i>sp., <i>Paenibacillus </i>sp., and <i>Streptomyces </i>sp. As used herein the term &#x201c;lipopeptides&#x201d; refers to amphiphilic cyclic peptides.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, these amphiphilic cyclic peptides are composed of six to ten &#x3b1;-amino acids linked to a &#x3b2;-amino or &#x3b2;-hydroxy fatty acid, such as the fengycin-type compounds, the iturin-type compounds, the surfactin-type compounds and the fusaricidins. The iturin-type compounds are composed of seven amino acids and are linked to a &#x3b2;-amino fatty acid. The length of the fatty acid chain may vary from C14 to C17. These compounds are obtainable from various species of <i>Bacillus</i>, including <i>subtilis </i>and <i>amyloliquefaciens</i>. The iturins and their variants are described in Ongena, M., et al., &#x201c;<i>Bacillus </i>Lipopeptides: Versatile Weapons for Plant Disease Biocontrol,&#x201d; <i>Trends in Microbiology, </i>16(3):115-125, (2007). Iturin-type compounds of the present invention include one or more of the following compounds: bacillomycin D, bacillyomycin F, bacillomycin L, bacillomycin LC (also known as bacillopeptin), mycosubtilin, iturin A, iturin A<sub>L</sub>, and iturin C (with the latter three compounds referred to herein, collectively, as iturins).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Fengycin-type compounds are composed often amino acids linked to a &#x3b2;-hydroxy fatty acid with a chain that varies in length from C14 to C18. These compounds are obtainable from various species of <i>Bacillus</i>, including <i>subtilis, amyloliquefaciens, cereus </i>and <i>thuringiensis </i>and from <i>Streptomyces </i>sp. The fengycin-type compounds are described in Ongena, supra. Fengycin-type compounds suitable for the compositions described herein include fengycin A, fengycin B, plipastatin A, plipastatin B, the plipastatins from a <i>Streptomyces </i>sp. described in Kimura, et al., &#x201c;SNA 60-367&#x2014;New Peptide Enzyme Inhibitors against Aromatase,&#x201d; <i>Journal of Antibiotics, </i>50(6): 529-531, (1997), and agrastatins, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,291,426 (with the latter four listings referred to herein, collectively, as plipastatins).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Surfactin-type compounds are composed of seven amino acids linked to a &#x3b2;-hydroxy fatty acid with a chain that varies in length from C13 to C16. These compounds are obtainable from various species of <i>Bacillus</i>, including <i>subtilis, amyloliquefaciens, coagulans, pumilus </i>and <i>licheniformis</i>. The surfactin family of compounds is described in Ongena, supra. Surfactin-type compounds of the present invention include one or more of the following compounds: esperin, lichenysin, pumilacidin and surfactin.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Fusaricidins are composed of six amino acids linked to a 15-guanidino-3-hydroxypentadecanoic acid. Fusaricidins are obtainable from <i>Paenibacillus </i>sp., including <i>polymyxa</i>. The fusaricidin family of compounds is described in Choi, S-K, et al., &#x201c;Identification and Functional Analysis of the Fusaricidin Biosynthetic Gene of <i>Paenibacillus polymyxa </i>E681<i>,&#x201d; Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, </i>365:89-95, (2008). Fusaricidins of the present invention include one or more of the following compounds: fusaricidins A-D and fusaricidins LI-F03, LI-F04, LI-F05, LI-F06, LI-F07 and LI-F08.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Certain bacteria produce one or more lipopeptides, and combinations of various lipopeptides are known to have synergistic fungicidal activity. In one embodiment, the lipopeptide component of the composition contains a combination of lipopeptides from at least two of the following lipopeptide classes: surfactin-type compounds, iturin-type compounds, and fengycin-type compounds. In another embodiment, the combination contains two or more of the following compounds: iturin As, plipastatins A and B, fengycins A and B and surfactin. In yet another embodiment, the combination contains one or more of the following compounds: iturin As, plipastatins A and B, fengycins A and B, surfactin and agrastatin.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Lipopeptides of the present invention are produced by one or more bacteria, such as those described above, or are chemically synthesized. The term &#x201c;fermentation broth,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to the culture medium resulting after fermentation of a microorganism and encompasses the microorganism and its component parts, unused raw substrates, and metabolites produced by the microorganism during fermentation, among other things. The term &#x201c;fermentation solid,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to concentrated and/or dried fermentation broth. The term &#x201c;fermentation product,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to fermentation broth and/or fermentation solids. The term &#x201c;lipopeptides,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to lipopeptides that are part of a fermentation product and to lipopeptides that are purified to at least some extent, whether chemically synthesized or biologically produced.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Methods of culturing bacteria are well known in the art. Conventional large-scale microbial culture processes include submerged fermentation, solid state fermentation, or liquid surface culture. For <i>Bacillus</i>, towards the end of fermentation, as nutrients are depleted, cells begin the transition from growth phase to sporulation phase, such that the final product of fermentation is largely spores, metabolites and residual fermentation medium. Sporulation is part of the natural life cycle of many <i>Bacilli </i>and is generally initiated by the cell in response to nutrient limitation. For this invention, fermentation is configured to obtain high levels of lipopeptides and to promote sporulation.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The bacterial cells, spores and metabolites in culture media resulting from fermentation (i.e., fermentation broth) may be used directly or concentrated (to make a fermentation solid) by conventional industrial methods, such as centrifugation, tangential-flow filtration, depth filtration, and evaporation. In some embodiments, the concentrated fermentation solid is washed, for example, via a diafiltration process, to remove residual fermentation broth and metabolites.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The fermentation broth or fermentation solids can be dried with or without the addition of carriers using conventional drying processes or methods such as spray drying, freeze drying, tray drying, fluidized-bed drying, drum drying, or evaporation. The resulting dry fermentation solids may be further processed, such as by milling or granulation, to achieve a specific particle size or physical format. Carriers, described below, may also be added post-drying, as appropriate for the desired method of use.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Bacterially produced lipopeptides may be separated from bacterial cells or further purified from other bacterial components and, in some embodiments, from each other. The term &#x201c;cell-free preparation&#x201d; refers to fermentation broth from which cells have been removed or substantially removed through means well known to those of skill in the art. Some methods of creating cell-free preparations are described below. Cell-free preparations of fermentation broth can be obtained by any means known in the art, such as extraction, centrifugation and/or filtration of fermentation broth. Those of skill in the art will appreciate that so-called cell-free preparations may not be devoid of cells but rather are largely cell-free or substantially cell-free, depending on the technique used (e.g., speed of centrifugation) to remove the cells. The resulting cell-free preparation may be dried and/or formulated with components that aid in its particular application. Concentration methods and drying techniques described above for fermentation broth are also applicable to cell-free preparations.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, after a cell-free preparation is made by centrifugation of fermentation broth, the metabolites may be purified by size exclusion filtration such as the Sephadex resins including LH-20, G10, and G15 and G25 that group metabolites into different fractions based on molecular weight cut-off, such as molecular weight of less than about 2000 daltons, less than about 1500 daltons, less than about 1000 daltons and so on, as the lipopeptides are between 800 daltons and 1600 daltons.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The term &#x201c;crude extract,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to organic extracts of fermentation broth, such as ethyl acetate extracts, in which the extract is enriched for lipopeptides. One method to obtain a crude extract of lipopeptides from a bacterial culture is described in Example 1.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The term &#x201c;semi-purified,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to lipopeptides isolated from fermentation broth that are about 50% to about 90% pure. The term &#x201c;purified,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to lipopeptides that are isolated from fermentation broth that are about 91% to about 100% pure. Lipopeptides of the present invention may be either purified or semi-purified.</p>

In one embodiment in which the synergistic composition of the present invention is applied to food or feed, the polyene fungicide component is natamycin or a derivative thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In another embodiment the locus is a human or animal. In human and veterinary applications, the compositions are applied topically to the skin and mucosal membranes to control <i>Candida albicans </i>and/or <i>Fusarium </i>sp. In one embodiment, the compositions are used to prevent or treat vaginal infections, especially those caused by <i>Candida albicans </i>but also those caused by <i>C. glabrata, C parapsilosis, C. guilliermondii</i>, and <i>C. tropicalis</i>. In one embodiment in which the synergistic composition is applied to treat <i>Candida </i>the polyene fungicide component is nystatin. In humans, the compositions of the present invention may also be applied to nails, scalp and skin to control dermatophytes, such as Trichophyton, Epidermophyton and Microsporum, which are responsible for a variety of disease manifestations that localize to keratinized structures of the body (skin, nail and hair). In humans, the compositions may be administered as lozenges, to treat oral candidiasis or orally to treat or prevent intestinal candidiasis. Compositions of the present invention may also be used to treat <i>Aspergillus </i>and <i>Fusarium </i>corneal infections. In one embodiment wherein the compositions are used to treat corneal infections, the polyene fungicide component of the composition is natamycin or a derivative thereof. Determining appropriate administration rates for the present compositions would be well within the knowledge of one of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments a locus in need of treatment is identified before the compositions are applied or administered.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In one embodiment, the compositions may include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers may vary depending on their suitability for various dosage forms. In one embodiment, the compositions may include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers as a topical composition. Topical composition can be in the form of a cream, gel, oil, spray, powder, paste, clay or any other form, way or method known in the art for administering the composition to the skin or a subject whether human or animal. The acceptable carrier contained in the topical composition may be varied depending on the type of the formulation. For example, the formulation of ointment, pastes, creams or gels may comprise animal and vegetable fats, waxes, paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentonites, silica, talc, zinc oxide or mixtures of these substances.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In one embodiment, the compositions may include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers as an oral composition. The oral dosage forms may be in the form of a solid powder, caplets, tablets, lozenges, pills, capsules, soft-gel or a liquid, and which may be administered alone or in suitable combination with other components. For example, the composition of the present invention may be administered in one or more caplets or lozenges as practical for ease of administration. In preparing the composition in oral dosage form, any of the usual media may be utilized. For liquid preparations (e.g., suspensions, elixirs, and solutions), media containing, for example water, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like may be used. Pharmaceutical acceptable carriers such as starches, sugars, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like may be used to prepare oral solids (e.g., powders, caplets, pills, tablets, capsules, and lozenges). Controlled release forms may also be used. Because of their ease in administration, caplets, tablets, pills, and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid carriers are employed. If desired, tablets may be sugar coated or enteric coated by standard techniques. All of these pharmaceutical carriers and formulations are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. See, e.g., WADE &#x26; WALLER, HANDBOOK OF PHARMACEUTICAL EXCIPIENTS (2nd ed. 1994).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In a specific embodiment of the present invention may comprise compositions in the dosage form of a soft-gel. A soft-gel is a one-piece, sealed, soft gelatin shell that contains a solution, a suspension, or a semi-solid paste. Soft-gels are predominantly used to contain liquids wherein the active ingredients are present in the dissolved or suspended state. Soft-gels have been widely known and used for many years and for a variety of purposes. Because soft-gels have properties that are quite different from two-piece, hard shell capsules, the soft-gels are capable of retaining a liquid fill material. Soft-gels are often used to encapsulate consumable materials, including vitamins, dietary supplements, pharmaceuticals, and the like, in a liquid vehicle or carrier. Soft-gels are a unique dosage form that can provide distinct advantages over more traditional dosage forms such as tablets, hard-shell capsules, and liquids. These advantages include patient compliance and consumer preference, improved bioavailability, speed of product development in many cases, shortened manufacturing time, enhanced drug stability due to less exposure of the active ingredient to oxygen, excellent dose uniformity, and product differentiation.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In one embodiment, the compositions and methods of the present invention may have a pleasant or palatable flavor. Palatable flavors may be achieved by including sweetening agents and/or flavorants.

Diluents can include, by way of example and without limitation, microcrystalline cellulose, sucrose, dicalcium phosphate, starches, lactose and polyols of less than 13 carbon atoms, such as mannitol, xylitol, sorbitol, maltitol and pharmaceutically acceptable amino acids, such as glycin, and their mixtures.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Lubricants are substances used in composition formulations that reduce friction during composition compression. Lubricants that may be used in the present invention include, by way of example and without limitation, stearic acid, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, zinc stearate, talc, mineral and vegetable oils, benzoic acid, poly(ethylene glycol), glyceryl behenate, stearyl fumarate, and others known to those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Glidants improve the flow of powder blends during manufacturing and minimize composition weight variation. Glidants that may be used in the present invention include, by way of example and without limitation, silicon dioxide, colloidal or fumed silica, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, stearic acid, cornstarch, talc and others known to those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Additionally, suspensions of the active compounds may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Non-lipid polycationic amino polymers may also be used for delivery.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The compositions can include a solubilizer to ensure good solubilization and/or dissolution of the active ingredients such as the fungicide and/or lipopeptide. A solubilizer can also be added to increase the solubility of the fungicide and/or lipopeptide and/or other components, such as surfactants, or to maintain the composition as a stable or homogeneous solution or dispersion.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Examples of suitable solubilizers include, but are not limited to, the following: alcohols and polyols, such as ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, benzyl alcohol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butanediols and isomers thereof, glycerol, pentaerythritol, sorbitol, mannitol, transcutol, dimethyl isosorbide, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polyvinylalcohol, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and other cellulose derivatives, cyclodextrins and cyclodextrin derivatives; ethers of polyethylene glycols having an average molecular weight of about 200 to about 6000, such as tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol PEG ether (glycofurol) or methoxy PEG; amides and other nitrogen-containing compounds such as 2-pyrrolidone, 2-piperidone, &#x3b5;-caprolactam, N-alkylpyrrolidone, N-hydroxyalkylpyrrolidone, N-alkylpiperidone, N-alkylcaprolactam, dimethylacetamide and polyvinylpyrrolidone; esters such as ethyl propionate, tributylcitrate, acetyl triethylcitrate, acetyl tributyl citrate, triethylcitrate, ethyl oleate, ethyl caprylate, ethyl butyrate, triacetin, propylene glycol monoacetate, propylene glycol diacetate, .epsilon.-caprolactone and isomers thereof, &#x3b4;-valerolactone and isomers thereof, &#x3b2;-butyrolactone and isomers thereof; and other solubilizers known in the art, such as dimethyl acetamide, dimethyl isosorbide, N-methylpyrrolidones, monooctanoin, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, and water.</p>

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The amount of solubilizer that can be included is not particularly limited. The amount of a given solubilizer can be limited to a bioacceptable amount, which can be readily determined by one of skill in the art. In some circumstances, it can be advantageous to include amounts of solubilizers far in excess of bioacceptable amounts, for example, to maximize the concentration of the drug, with excess solubilizer removed prior to providing the 1 composition to a subject using conventional techniques, such as distillation or evaporation. Thus, if present, the solubilizer can be in a weight ratio of about 10%, 25%, 50%, 100%, or up to about 200% by weight, based on the combined weight of the drug, and other excipients. If desired, very small amounts of solubilizer can also be used, such as about 5%, 2%, 1% or even less. Typically, the solubilizer can be present in an amount of about 1% to about 100%, more typically about 5% to about 25% by weight.</p>

<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The lipopeptides used were a complex mixture of iturin-type compounds, plipastatin-type compounds, and surfactins partially purified from the fermentation broth of <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>QST713. Seed flasks containing Luria Broth (LB) were inoculated with the QST713 strain, and these flasks were grown overnight at 30&#xb0; C. The next day, aliquots from the seed flask were inoculated into a soy-based medium and grown until sporulation. The <i>B. subtilis </i>QST713 fermentation broth was acidified to pH 2 and centrifuged to separate the solid material from the supernatant. The lipopeptides concentrated in the pellet. The supernatant was decanted and the pellet was extracted with an aqueous organic solvent mixture (preferably 80/20 acetonitrile/water). The lipopeptides concentrated in the aqueous organic fraction. The mixture was centrifuged and the supernatant removed. The cell pellet was re-extracted two additional times with an aqueous organic solvent mixture (preferably 80/20 acetonitrile/water).

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Synergistic Effect of Natamycin and Lipopeptides Against <i>S. cerevisiae </i>Using Lipopeptides Obtained from Commercially Available Product</heading>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">This study, which is similar to that described in Example 1, is conducted using a crude extract of lipopeptides obtained from SERENADE&#xae; MAX fungicide or SERENADE&#xae; ASO fungicide as a starting point (rather than from unformulated fermentation broth of <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>QST713). The SERENADE&#xae; products are commercially available, and their active ingredient is <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>QST713. A crude extract of lipopeptides is obtained by acidifying SERENADE&#xae;ASO (or SERENADE&#xae; MAX, dissolved in water) to pH 2, centrifuging and extracting the resulting pellet with an organic solvent mixture. The resulting lipopeptides are combined with natamycin as described above and this mixture tested for activity against <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. The same results as obtained above are expected.</p>

<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Synergistic Effect of Natamycin and a Crude Extract of Lipopeptides Against <i>Penicillium expansum </i></heading>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The effect of (i) natamycin (Haorui Pharma-Chem. Inc.), (ii) a crude extract of lipopeptides from <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>QST713 (prepared as described in Example 1), and (iii) a combination of natamycin and a crude extract of lipopeptides on <i>Penicillium expansum </i>was investigated. A liquid fungal growth assay was performed in 96-well plates to determine whether the combination of lipopeptides and natamycin is synergistic in inhibiting fungal growth. All procedures were conducted aseptically.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">For each 96 well plate, three separate additions were made to each well. First, 100 &#x3bc;l of potato dextrose broth w/100 ppm chloramphenicol was added. Then 25 &#x3bc;l of each sample (lipopeptides, natamycin, or combo from dilution plate) was supplemented. Finally, 50 &#x3bc;l of DI H<sub>2</sub>O was added to the blank plate (the plate intended to be left blank for an OD reference) OR 50 &#x3bc;l of 10<sup>5 </sup>fungal inoculum was added to each well in its respective plate(s). Thus, the final concentration of lipopeptide in each well was 1.1 ppm and the final concentration of natamycin in each well was 1.1 ppm. The plates were then covered with lids and placed at 20&#xb0; C. for 3 days of incubation.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Rating Plates and Interpreting Data</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">After the incubation period, the growth of each well in each plate was rated by optical density at 600 nm using a PerkinElmer Victor plate-reader using the setting &#x201c;MIC Settings @600 (0.1 s)&#x201d; that can be found in the Wallac&#xae; Victor&#xae; software. The results were also roughly assessed visually as cloudy wells (partial growth) appearing in the dilution series where the sample fell off in activity.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">After an OD was obtained for each well, the relative growth was determined by the following calculation: [(Treatment w/Bacteria)&#x2212;(Treatment w/o Bacteria)/(Diluent Control w/Bacteria)&#x2212;(Diluent Control w/o Bacteria)]&#xd7;100. The positive control wells for bacterial growth were considered acceptable if the average and standard deviation of the OD readings at 600 nm were well above the range of the non-inoculated OD reference wells. (There must be a large difference between the un-inoculated diluent control and the inoculated diluent control wells' readings to ensure that good growth was obtained).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">This percent growth was then graphed against the sample for the dilutions tested and the last dilution providing at least 80% of growth inhibition was taken as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Synergy was then determined by Gowing's Equation, set forth above.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In this example, the Percent Growth of 1.1 ppm Lipopeptides was 113%. The Percent Growth of 1.1 ppm Natamycin was 102%. The Percent Growth of 1.1 ppm Lipopeptide+1.1 ppm Natamycin was 20.4%.

These lipopeptides were further purified and separated through reversed-phase chromatography to obtain fengycin-type compounds that were about 83% pure and iturins that were about 88% pure. Surfactins were extracted using an organic solvent and then further purified using size exclusion column chromatography to 95% purity.

<heading id="h-0025" level="1">Synergistic Effect of Semi-Purified and Purified Iturins, Fengycins, and Surfactins and Natamycin Against <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i></heading>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Experiments similar to those described above, using <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>as the target pathogen, were conducted with (i) natamycin, (ii) crude extracts of lipopeptides from <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>QST713 (obtained as described above in Example 1), (iii) combinations of natamycin and the crude extracts, and (iv) combinations of natamycin and semi-purified and purified lipopeptides (i.e., iturin-type compounds, fengycin-type compounds, and surfactin-type compounds) from <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>QST713.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">As before, liquid fungal growth assays were performed in 96-well plates to determine whether the combination of lipopeptides and natamycin is synergistic in inhibiting fungal growth. Each well of the plate had three separate additions. First, yeast peptone dextrose media (YPD) was used. Then, 25 &#x3bc;L of each sample (whether lipopeptide, natamycin, or combination of the two from dilution plate) was added. Finally, 50 &#x3bc;L of yeast inoculum or 50 &#x3bc;L of DI H<sub>2</sub>O was added (the latter option is used when constructing the blank). Yeast inoculum was prepared by inoculating a single colony in 5 mL YPD and incubated at 30&#xb0; C. overnight with shaking. In the morning, 200 &#x3bc;L of the overnight inoculum was subcultured into 5 mL YPD and incubated at 30&#xb0; C. shaking for 4 to 5 hours. This was diluted to an optical density of 0.015. After all three additions, the plates were then covered with lids and incubated at 30&#xb0; C. overnight to be analyzed the next day.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Iturin-type compounds, surfactins, and fengycin-type compounds were extracted and purified from <i>B. subtilis </i>QST713 as explained above. Final concentration of natamycin in each test well was 1.12 ppm; final concentration of the crude lipopeptide extract in each well was 1.12 ppm; final concentration of each semi-purified or purified lipopeptide extract of iturin-type compounds, surfactin or fengycin-type compounds in each well was 1.12 ppm. Thus, the weight to weight ratio of each component in the wells containing combinations was 1:1.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Results showing synergy between various combinations are described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and Table 6. Applicants conducted additional experiments to investigate the lack of synergy between natamycin and surfactin against <i>S. cerevisiae </i>at final concentrations of 1.12 ppm each, expecting to find synergy at a higher concentration. Final concentration of surfactin was increased while final concentration of natamycin was held at 1.12 ppm. As expected, synergy was experienced with a higher concentration of surfactin; namely, 17.86 ppm.</p>

<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Studies were conducted to determine whether synergy was observed with various weight to weight ratios of natamycin to crude extract of lipopeptides. Lipopeptides were extracted from <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>QST713 as described in Example 1, above. Efficacy of various combinations were tested against <i>Penicillium expansum </i>using the multi-well plate assay described in Example 3. Weight to weight ratios of natamycin to the crude lipopeptide extract were varied from 1:500 to 500:1 and synergy observed in all cases, as summarized in Table 8. Concentrations in Table 8 represent final concentration of each component per well.</p>
