<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a printing apparatus capable of printing on copying paper.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">There is such conventional printing apparatus that accommodates roll paper into the inside, provides a cutter for cutting roll paper ejected after print, and prints by dividing print result into two of a submitting (issuing to a customer) use and preservation (shop safekeeping) use.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In such printing apparatuses, there is a printing apparatus that prints the same content respectively by using two rolls of 1P roll paper and that print and copies print content by using a roll of 2P roll paper as copying paper (for example, referring to patent document 1).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Patent document 1: Japan patent publication of No. 2001-205871 (paragraph [0013]-paragraph [0014], FIG. 1, FIG. 2)</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, in the conventional technology mentioned above, when one printing apparatus enables to print by using both of 1P roll paper and 2P roll paper, for conveying respective papers through the same paper route by inserting them between rollers, pressure between the rollers has to be set into the intermediate of necessary pressures so as to convey 1P roll paper or 2P roll paper. In such setting, in a printing apparatus without winding mechanism of paper, if print is continued by feeding 2P roll paper, only one side of pull-up rollers in the printing apparatus is driven, and then the slack of the paper occurs because one of the paper is pulled powerfully in comparison with the other of the paper. Thus, there is a problem that a running jam of paper occurs if the amount of the slack of the paper exceeds a certain amount.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is, therefore, an object of the invention to provide a printing apparatus that can solve the above problem. That is, it is possible to print without the occurrence of the slack of copying paper.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An aspect of the invention is to provide a printing apparatus that has a paper cut mechanism for cutting successive paper printed in a print mechanism, comprising: a first conveying section which holds and sends out successive paper to the print mechanism; a second conveying section which holds and sends out the successive paper that is printed out in the print mechanism and is sent out from the first conveying section to the paper cut mechanism; and a controlling section which returns a tip of the successive paper after being cut by the paper cut mechanism to between the print mechanism and the first conveying section.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">THE EFFECT OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to such printing apparatus of the present invention, an effect is obtained an effect that can print without the occurrence of the slack of copying paper.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The above and other objects and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description and the appended claims with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0133" num="0132">A fourth embodiment, even though the same print data is sent to two kinds of printing apparatuses <b>1</b> in which distances from the automatic cutter to the print head are different, enables to cut the roll papers on which the same contents are printed and give them to customers.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In the first embodiment to the third embodiment, there is a problem that a region of an necessary print result cannot be cut, in the case that the same print data are respectively sent from an upper apparatus in which the same application software is operated to two kinds of printing apparatuses <b>1</b> in which distances from the automatic cutter <b>10</b> to the printer head <b>7</b> are different, this is to solve the problem.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows an example that the same print data are sent to a printer A and a printer B those are two kinds of printing apparatuses <b>1</b> in which the distances from the automatic cutter <b>10</b> to the print head <b>7</b> are different, and automatic cutting are performed.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Data sent to the printer A and the printer B in a 1 job are shown in (a)&#x2dc;(e); (a)&#x2dc;(e) show print data and line feed data; and (e) shows an automatic cut command.</p>

<p id="p-0138" num="0137">The data is created by adjusting to the printer A, because the roll paper <b>2</b> is cut on the automatic cut position at that time through the automatic cut command of (e) after (d) is printed, it is possible to cut on the below of the print of (c), and it becomes possible to issue the receipt that cuts a region which prints from (d) of the last time job print to &#x201c;***THANK YOU***&#x201d; of (c) of this time job print.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">With respect to this, because the distance from the automatic cutter <b>10</b> to the print head <b>7</b> in the printer B is longer compared with that in the print A, the automatic cut position of the printer B is more close to a tip side of the roll paper <b>2</b> compared with the printer A, and there is a problem that the necessary print data (c) becomes outside of the customer giving region in the issued receipt.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Therefore, in the present embodiment, an automatic cut position adjustment is performed so as to absorb the difference &#x201c;fdC&#x201d; (fdC=fdB&#x2212;fdA) between the distances from the automatic cutter <b>10</b> to the print head <b>7</b> in the printer A and the printer B.
