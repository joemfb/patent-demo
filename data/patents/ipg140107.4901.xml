<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Consistent with the present disclosure, an optical receiver is paired with an optical transmitter in a transceiver card or module, for example. During normal operation, the optical transmitter supplies optical signals for downstream transmission on a first optical communication path, and the optical receiver receives additional optical signals from a second optical communication path. During a transmitter monitoring mode (or &#x201c;loopback&#x201d;), however, when monitoring of transmitter parameters is desired, an optical switch directs the output or portion thereof from the transmitter to the receiver. The receiver may then supply monitoring data or information to a control or processor circuit, which, in turn, may supply control signals to the transmitter. In response to such control signals, the performance of the transmitter may be optimized, for example, by reducing BER and/or OSNR to a desired level. The switch is then configured to block transmission of the transmitter output or portion and normal operation is commenced. Thus, consistent with the present disclosure, an optical receiver is provided to detect optical signals inbound on one optical communication path during normal operation is also used to receive optical signals directly from the transmitter during the monitoring mode. Accordingly, a dedicated monitoring receiver is not required and the system is rendered less expensive, power consumption may be minimized and space may be conserved.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Optical communication systems are known in which an optical transmitter transmits an optical signal on an optical communication path to a downstream optical receiver. The optical signal is often modulated to carry information to the receiver that is often spaced from the transmitter by tens or hundreds of kilometers. The optical communication path typically includes one or more segments of optical fiber and various nodes, such as optical amplifier nodes and reconfigurable optical add/drop (ROADM) nodes.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The performance of the optical transmitter may be monitored by detecting various parameters, such as the optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) and bit error rate (BER) of the optical signal. When these parameters, for example, are at desired levels, the performance of the optical transmitter may be considered optimized. If the optical transmitter does not transmit at an acceptable baseline performance level and the BER and OSNR are not at minimally acceptable levels, for example, during system start-up, tuning of the wavelength of light output from the optical transmitter, optimal performance may be difficult to adjust to the optimal level based on optical signals monitored at a distant receiver. In particular, when monitoring the optical signal at a remote receiver, impairments due to transmission through the optical communication path, e.g., through fiber, optical amplifiers and OADMs, may be difficult to distinguish from impairments due to faults associated with the optical transmitter itself. Distinguishing between the two classes of impairments is further made difficult in systems including photonic integrated circuits that supply optical signals having different wavelengths. Identifying the source of impairments is also difficult in systems in which the optical signals are modulated in accordance with advanced modulation formats, such as quadrature phase shift-keying (QPSK).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">So-called intradyne coherent optical systems are known that include receivers having known digital signal processing circuits that operate in accordance with known algorithms to demodulate a received signal, apply error correction, and determine various characteristics of the optical signal. In order to monitor to thereby adjust parameters of an optical transmitter in such systems for optimal performance, a dedicated receiver may be provided locally, near the transmitter, to thereby directly monitor the optical signals prior to transmission along the optical communication path. As a result, so-called back-to-back BER measurements, for example, can be obtained directly proximate to the output of the optical transmitter, and such measurements are free of distortions or impairments related to the optical communication path.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although accurate measurements indicative of the performance of the transmitter itself may be obtained with a dedicated receiver, the cost, power consumption and physical space required for the dedicated receiver are often prohibitive. Accordingly, there is a need for an efficient and inexpensive method and apparatus for locally monitoring the performance of an optical transmitter, such as an optical transmitter in a coherent optical communication system.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Consistent with the present disclosure, an optical receiver is paired with an optical transmitter in a transceiver card or module, for example. During normal operation, the optical transmitter supplies optical signals for downstream transmission on a first optical communication path, and the optical receiver receives additional optical signals from a second optical communication path. During a transmitter monitoring mode (or &#x201c;loopback&#x201d;), however, when monitoring of transmitter parameters is desired, an optical switch directs the output or portion thereof from the transmitter to the receiver. The receiver may then supply monitoring data or information to a control or processor circuit, which, in turn, may supply control signals to the transmitter. In response to such control signals, the performance of the transmitter may be optimized, for example, by reducing BER and/or increasing OSNR to a desired level. The switch is then configured to block transmission of the transmitter output or portion thereof to the local receiver, and normal operation is commenced. Thus, consistent with the present disclosure, an optical receiver is provided to detect optical signals inbound on one optical communication path during normal operation and is also used to receive optical signals directly from the local transmitter during the monitoring mode. Accordingly, a dedicated monitoring receiver is not required and the system is rendered less expensive, power consumption may be minimized and space may be conserved.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Reference will now be made in detail to the present exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an optical communication system <b>100</b> consistent with an aspect of the present disclosure. Communication system <b>100</b> includes a first rack, cabinet, chassis, or housing <b>11</b>, which has a card or blade <b>41</b>. Card <b>41</b> includes a plurality of transmitter blocks (Tx Block) <b>12</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>12</b>-<i>n</i>, each of which receives a corresponding one of a plurality of data or information streams Data-<b>1</b> to Data-n, and, in response to a respective one of these data streams, each of transmitter blocks <b>12</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>12</b>-<i>n </i>may output a group of optical signals or channels to a combiner or multiplexer <b>14</b>. Each optical signal carries an information stream or data corresponding to each of data streams Data-<b>1</b> to Data-n. In particular, each optical signal may carry a series of symbols constituting an information signal. Multiplexer <b>14</b>, which may include one or more optical filters, for example, combines each group of optical signals onto optical communication path <b>16</b> to provide a wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) optical signal. As used herein, an optical signal may refer to the WDM optical signal, as well as each optical signal included in the WDM optical signal.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Optical communication path <b>16</b> may include one or more segments of optical fiber and optical amplifiers <b>101</b>, <b>169</b>, and <b>103</b>, for example, to optically amplify or boost the power of the transmitted optical signals. In one example, optical signals output from transmitter block <b>12</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>12</b>-<i>n </i>may be polarization multiplexed optical signals that are modulated in accordance with a known modulation format, such as quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK), binary phase shift keying (BPSK) or combinations of such modulation formats, e.g., certain optical signals may have a first modulation format, while others have a second, different modulation format.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a receive node is provided that includes a second rack, cabinet, chassis, or housing <b>18</b>, which has a card or blade <b>38</b>. An optical combiner or demultiplexer <b>20</b> provided on card <b>38</b> may include one or more optical filters, for example, and supply each group of received optical signals to a corresponding one of receiver blocks (Rx Blocks) <b>22</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>22</b>-<i>n</i>. Each of receiver blocks <b>22</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>22</b>-<i>n</i>, in turn, supplies a corresponding copy of data or information streams Data-<b>1</b> to Data-n in response to the optical signals. It is understood that each of transmitter blocks <b>12</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>12</b>-<i>n </i>may have the same or similar structure and each of receiver blocks <b>22</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>22</b>-<i>n </i>may have the same or similar structure.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">One of transmitter blocks <b>12</b>-<b>1</b> is shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. It is understood that remaining receiver circuitry or blocks <b>12</b>-<b>2</b> to <b>12</b>-<i>n </i>have the same or similar structure as transmitter block <b>12</b>-<b>1</b>. Transmitter block <b>12</b>-<b>1</b> may include processor (such as a digital signal processor or DSP) and driver circuits <b>202</b>, that receives, for example, a corresponding portion of Data-<b>1</b>. Circuitry <b>202</b>, in turn, supplies corresponding outputs or electrical drive signal groupings <b>204</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>204</b>-<b>10</b> to optical sources or transmitter circuits OS-<b>1</b> to OS-<b>10</b> provided on transmit photonic integrated circuit (PIC) <b>205</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, each of optical sources OS-<b>1</b> to OS-<b>10</b> supplies a corresponding pair of modulated optical signals (for example, a respective one of pairs &#x3bb;<b>1</b>TE, &#x3bb;<b>1</b>TE&#x2032; . . . &#x3bb;<b>10</b>TE, &#x3bb;<b>10</b>TE&#x2032;) to wavelength multiplexing circuitry <b>208</b>. Typically, each optical signal within a given pair has the same or substantially the same wavelength, e.g., each of optical signals &#x3bb;<b>1</b>TE, &#x3bb;<b>1</b>TE&#x2032; have wavelength &#x3bb;<b>1</b>. In one example, each of optical signals &#x3bb;<b>1</b>TE to &#x3bb;<b>10</b>TE are multiplexed by wavelength multiplexing circuitry <b>208</b> into a first WDM output <b>290</b> and each of optical signals &#x3bb;<b>1</b>TE&#x2032; to &#x3bb;<b>10</b>TE&#x2032; are multiplexed into a second WDM output <b>291</b>. Wavelength multiplexing circuitry <b>208</b> may include one or more arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs) and/or one or more power combiners. Optical sources OS-<b>1</b> to OS-<b>10</b> and wavelength multiplexing circuitry <b>208</b> may be provided on substrate <b>205</b>, for example. Substrate <b>205</b> may include indium phosphide or other semiconductor materials.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the first (<b>290</b>) and second (<b>291</b>) WDM outputs may be provided to polarization multiplexing circuitry <b>295</b>, including for example a polarization beam combiner. In one example, first WDM output <b>290</b> may have a transverse electric (TE) polarization and is supplied to a polarization beam combiner by polarization maintaining optical fiber, such that the polarization of each optical signal in the first WDM output has the TE polarization upon input to polarization multiplexing circuitry <b>295</b>. The second WDM output <b>291</b> may also have a TE polarization when output from wavelength multiplexer <b>208</b>, but the second WDM output <b>291</b> may be provided to a second polarization maintaining fiber that is twisted in such a way that the polarization of each optical signal in the second WDM output <b>291</b> is rotated, for example, by 90 degrees. Accordingly, each such optical signal may have a transverse magnetic (TM) polarization when supplied to polarization multiplexing circuitry <b>295</b>. Polarization multiplexing circuitry <b>295</b>, in turn, combines the two WDM optical outputs to provide a polarization multiplexed WDM optical signal <b>296</b>. Each optical signal wavelength associated with the WDM optical signal output from housing <b>11</b> onto first optical communication path <b>16</b> may equal or substantially equal a corresponding optical signal wavelength associated with the WDM optical signal output from housing <b>18</b> onto second optical communication path <b>19</b>. Alternatively, each optical signal wavelength assocaited with the WDM optical signal output from housing <b>11</b> onto first optical communication path <b>16</b> may differ from each optical signal wavelength associated with the WDm optical signal output from housing <b>18</b> onto optical communication path <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates ten optical sources OS<b>1</b>-<b>1</b> to OS-<b>10</b>, it is understood that any appropriate number of such circuit blocks and optical sources may be provided. Moreover, it is understood, that optical sources OS-<b>1</b> to OS-<b>10</b>, as well as wavelength multiplexing circuitry, wavelength multiplexer or wavelength combiner <b>208</b>, may be provided as discrete components, as opposed to being integrated onto substrate <b>205</b>, such as PIC <b>206</b>. Alternatively, selected components may be provided on a first substrate while others may be provided on one or more additional substrates in a hybrid scheme in which the components are neither integrated onto one substrate nor provided as discrete devices.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a </i>illustrates transmitter or optical source OS-<b>1</b> in greater detail. It is understood that remaining optical sources OS-<b>1</b> to OS-<b>10</b> have the same or similar structure as optical source OS-<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Optical source OS-<b>1</b> may be provided on substrate <b>205</b> and may include a laser <b>308</b>, such as a distributed feedback laser (DFB), which supplies light to at least four (4) modulators <b>306</b>, <b>312</b>, <b>326</b> and <b>330</b>. DFB <b>308</b> may output continuous wave (CW) light at wavelength &#x3bb;<b>1</b> to a dual output splitter or coupler <b>310</b> (e.g. a 3 db coupler) having an input port and first and second output ports. Typically, the waveguides used to connect the various components of optical source OS-<b>1</b> may be polarization dependent. A first output <b>310</b><i>a </i>of coupler <b>310</b> supplies the CW light to first branching unit <b>311</b> and the second output <b>310</b><i>b </i>supplies the CW light to second branching unit <b>313</b>. A first output <b>311</b><i>a </i>of branching unit <b>311</b> is coupled to modulator <b>306</b> and a second output <b>311</b><i>b </i>is coupled to modulator <b>312</b>. Similarly, first output <b>313</b><i>a </i>is coupled to modulator <b>326</b> and second output <b>313</b><i>b </i>is coupled to modulator <b>330</b>. Modulators <b>306</b>, <b>312</b>, <b>326</b> and <b>330</b> may be, for example, Mach Zehnder (MZ) modulators. Each of the MZ modulators receives CW light from DFB <b>308</b> and splits the light between two (2) arms or paths. An applied electric field in one or both paths of a MZ modulator creates a change in the refractive index. In one example, if the relative phase between the signals traveling through each path is 180&#xb0; out of phase, destructive interference results and the signal is blocked. If the signals traveling through each path are in phase, the light may pass through the device and modulated with an associated data stream. The applied electric field may also cause changes in the refractive index such that a phase, as well as the amplitude, of light output from the MZ modulator is shifted or changed relative to light input to the MZ modulator. Thus, appropriate changes in the electric field can cause changes in phase of the light output from the MZ modulator, such that the light output from the modulator complies with phase modulation format, such as QPSK, BPSK or another phase modulation format.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Each of the MZ modulators <b>306</b>, <b>312</b>, <b>326</b> and <b>330</b> are driven with data signals or drive signals associated with drive signal grouping <b>204</b>-<b>1</b>, for example. The CW light supplied to MZ modulator <b>306</b> via DFB <b>308</b> and branching unit <b>311</b> is modulated in accordance with one such drive signal from grouping <b>204</b>-<b>1</b>. The modulated optical signal from MZ modulator <b>306</b> is supplied to first input <b>315</b><i>a </i>of branching unit <b>315</b>. Similarly, other drive signals of grouping <b>204</b>-<b>1</b> drive MZ modulator <b>312</b>. The CW light supplied to MZ modulator <b>312</b> via DFB <b>308</b> and branching unit <b>311</b> is modulated in accordance with the drive signal supplied by driver circuit <b>328</b>. The modulated optical signal from MZ modulator <b>312</b> is supplied to phase shifter <b>314</b> which shifts the phase of the signal 90&#xb0; (&#x3c0;/2) to generate one of an in-phase (I) or quadrature (Q) components, which is supplied to second input <b>315</b><i>b </i>of branching unit <b>315</b>. The modulated data signals from MZ modulator <b>306</b>, which includes the other of the I and Q components, and from MZ modulator <b>312</b> are supplied as &#x3bb;<b>1</b>TE to wavelength multiplexing circuitry <b>208</b> via branching unit <b>315</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Further drive signals of grouping <b>204</b>-<b>1</b> drive MZ modulator <b>326</b> to output modulated optical signals as one of the I and Q components. The CW light supplied from DFB <b>108</b> is supplied to MZ modulator <b>326</b> via first output <b>313</b><i>a </i>of branching unit <b>313</b>. MZ modulator <b>326</b> then modulates the polarization rotated CW light supplied by DFB <b>308</b>, in accordance with drive signals from driver circuit <b>330</b>. The modulated optical signal from MZ modulator <b>326</b> is supplied to first input <b>317</b><i>a </i>of branching unit <b>317</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">An additional drive signal of grouping <b>204</b>-<b>1</b> drives MZ modulator <b>330</b>. The CW light supplied from DFB <b>308</b> is also rotated by polarization rotator <b>324</b> and is supplied to MZ modulator <b>330</b> via second output <b>313</b><i>b </i>of branching unit <b>313</b>. MZ modulator <b>330</b> then modulates the received optical signal in accordance with the drive signal supplied by driver <b>332</b>. The modulated data signal from MZ modulator <b>330</b> is supplied to phase shifter <b>328</b> which shifts the phase the incoming signal 90&#xb0; (&#x3c0;/2) and supplies the other of the I and Q components to second input <b>317</b><i>b </i>of branching unit <b>317</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The modulated data signal from MZ modulator <b>330</b> is also supplied to branching unit <b>317</b>, and the combined outputs from MZ modulators <b>326</b> and <b>330</b> are also supplied to wavelength multiplexing circuitry <b>208</b> as optical signal &#x3bb;<b>1</b>TE&#x2032; Both &#x3bb;<b>1</b>TE and &#x3bb;<b>1</b>TE&#x2032; have a TE polarization, but &#x3bb;<b>1</b>TE&#x2032;, as well as &#x3bb;<b>2</b>TE&#x2032; to &#x3bb;<b>10</b>TE&#x2032; as part of the second WDM optical output <b>291</b> may be polarization rotated to have a TM polarization (to provide optical signals &#x3bb;<b>1</b>&#x2122; to &#x3bb;<b>10</b>&#x2122;) prior to be polarization multiplexed in circuitry <b>295</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As noted above, one DFB laser <b>108</b> may provide a CW signal to four separate MZ modulators <b>306</b>, <b>312</b>, <b>326</b> and <b>330</b> for modulating at least four separate optical channels by utilizing phase shifting and polarization rotation of the transmission signals. Alternatively, multiple CW light sources may be used for each channel which increased device complexity, chip real estate, power requirements and associated manufacturing costs.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Alternatively, splitter or coupler <b>310</b> may be omitted and DFB <b>308</b> may be configured as a dual output laser source to provide CW light to each of the MZ modulators <b>306</b>, <b>312</b>, <b>326</b> and <b>330</b> via branching units <b>311</b> and <b>313</b>. In particular, coupler <b>310</b> may be replaced by DFB <b>308</b> configured as a back facet output device. Both outputs of DFB laser <b>308</b>, from respective sides <b>308</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>308</b>-<b>2</b> of DFB <b>308</b>, are used, in this example, to realize a dual output signal source. A first output <b>308</b><i>a </i>of DFB <b>308</b> supplies CW light to branching unit <b>311</b> connected to MZ modulators <b>306</b> and <b>312</b>. The back facet or second output <b>308</b><i>b </i>of DFB <b>308</b> supplies CW light branching unit nit <b>313</b> connected to MZ modulators <b>326</b> and <b>330</b> via path or waveguide <b>343</b> (represented as a dashed line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The dual output configuration provides sufficient power to the respective MZ modulators at a power loss far less than that experienced through 3 dB coupler <b>310</b>. The CW light supplied from second output <b>308</b><i>b </i>is supplied to waveguide <b>343</b> which is either coupled directly to branching unit <b>313</b> or to polarization rotator <b>324</b> disposed between DFB <b>308</b> and branching unit <b>313</b>. Polarization rotator <b>324</b> rotates the polarization of CW light supplied from second output <b>308</b><i>b </i>of DFB <b>308</b> and supplies the rotated light to MZ modulator <b>326</b> via first output <b>313</b><i>a </i>of branching unit <b>313</b> and to MZ modulator <b>330</b> via second output <b>313</b><i>b </i>of branching unit <b>313</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, each optical receiver circuit OR-<b>1</b> to OR-<b>10</b> supplies a corresponding grouping of analog electrical signals (such as E<b>1</b> to E<b>4</b>) to analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) circuits <b>406</b>. Each analog electrical signal grouping is indicative of data carried by a respective wavelength component of the first WDM optical signal portion. Each ADC circuit may also include known transimpedance amplifier and automatic gain control circuitry to adjust the voltage and/or current of the analog electrical signals.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">ADC circuits <b>406</b> supply digital samples associated with each analog electrical signal grouping supplied by optical receiver circuits OR-<b>1</b> to OR-<b>10</b>. These digital samples are then processed by DSP <b>408</b>, which can determine various parameters associated with each spectral component of the first WDM optical signal portion, such as phase, amplitude, BER and OSNR, in a known manner. DSP <b>408</b> may, during the first or monitoring mode of operation, supply signals indicative of these parameters to a control or processor circuit <b>410</b>, which, in turn, may supply appropriate control signals to one or more parts of Tx blocks <b>12</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>12</b>-<i>n </i>to optimize the performance thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">For example, processor circuit <b>410</b> may supply control signals to processor and driver circuits or circuitry <b>202</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to adjust the amplitude, phase or other property of one or more of the drive signals included in drive signal groupings <b>204</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>204</b>-<b>10</b>. In addition, control signals output from processor circuit <b>410</b> may also be supplied to one or more optical sources OS-<b>1</b>. In one example, control signals may be applied to heater <b>391</b> (such as a thin film heater, including platinum, for example) to adjust the temperature and thus the wavelength of light output from DFB laser <b>508</b>. Alternatively, the control signals may be used to adjust the current through DFB <b>508</b>. In another example, control signals may be supplied to heaters <b>393</b>, <b>395</b>, <b>397</b>, and <b>399</b> to adjust the temperature and thus the refractive index of portions of MZ interferometers <b>306</b>, <b>312</b>, <b>326</b>, and <b>330</b>, respectively. As a result, the phase and or amplitude or other characteristic of light output from these MZ interferometers may be adjusted to achieve optimal performance. In a further example, such control signals may be used to &#x201c;balance&#x201d; the refractive index in each arm of one or more of MZ interferometers, such that the phase of light output from each is at a null in the absence of data and each MZ interferometer has a desired DC extinction ratio. Also, the refractive index in each arm may be &#x201c;balanced&#x201d; so that the relative phase between an upper path, including MZ interferometers <b>306</b> and <b>312</b>, and a lower path including MZ interferometers <b>326</b> and <b>330</b> is in quadrature, e.g., one lags the other by 90 degrees. Such a phase relationship may be required in order to modulate both in-phase and quadrature components of the optical signal to carry data.</p>

During the normal mode of operation, the second portion of the first optical signal output from tap <b>151</b> is blocked by optical component <b>153</b> and is not supplied to the optical receiver (e.g., receiver block <b>42</b>-<b>1</b>) during the normal mode of operation (the &#x201c;second time interval&#x201d;, step <b>1108</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">It is noted that the equipment and/or circuitry associated with or in housing <b>18</b> may be in a loopback mode during a time interval that does not coincide with a time interval during which the equipment or circuitry associated with or in housing <b>11</b> is in a loopback mode, so that such loopback modes occur during different time intervals. Similarly, the normal mode of operation of the circuitry in housing <b>11</b> may occur during a different time interval than that of the circuitry in housing <b>18</b>, so that that such normal modes of operation occur during different time intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As noted above, consistent with the present disclosure both sets of Tx blocks <b>12</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>12</b>-<i>n </i>as well as Tx blocks <b>32</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>32</b>-<i>n </i>may be optimized during a first mode of operation using corresponding co-located Rx blocks. The Rx blocks may then receive optical signal carrying data traffic during a normal mode of operation once such optimization is complete. No dedicated receiver is required.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Other embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification. It is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope and spirit of the invention being indicated by the following claims.</p>
