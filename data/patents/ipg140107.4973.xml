<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a) of a Korean patent application filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Mar. 12, 2010 and assigned Ser. No. 10-2010-0022186, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a multiple antenna (i.e., Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO)) system. More particularly, the present invention relates to an apparatus and method for mitigating inter-cell interference in the MIMO system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems divide a transmit beam pattern forming scheme into a closed loop scheme and an open loop scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The closed loop scheme is a scheme in which a Base Station (BS) transmits a signal in a transmission pattern determined considering downlink channel information provided from a Mobile Station (MS). The open loop scheme is a scheme in which a BS transmits a signal in a fixed beam pattern irrespective of a channel state with an MS. For example, the closed loop scheme includes a codebook based communication scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the case of the codebook based communication scheme, an MS selects a code vector or code matrix suitable to a channel with a serving BS, from a previously arranged and defined codebook, and transmits the selected code vector or code matrix to the serving BS. The serving BS transmits a signal using the code vector or code matrix provided from the MS. That is, the serving BS can transmit a signal using the code vector or code matrix suitable to the channel with the MS, thus maximizing a throughput.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the case of using the codebook based communication scheme, a BS determines a transmission pattern considering only a channel with an MS. That is, because the BS considers no inter-cell interference, performance may be deteriorated due to neighboring cell interference.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, a technology for controlling inter-cell interference in a wireless communication system has been proposed. For example, to control the inter-cell interference, the 3<sup>rd </sup>Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard proposes a Coordinated Multiple Point Transmission/Reception (CoMP) technology. For another example, to control the inter-cell interference, the Institute Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.16 standard proposes a Multi-BS MIMO technology.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The CoMP technology is divided into a Coordinated Beamforming (CB) scheme and a Joint Processing/transmission (JP) scheme. Here, the CB scheme represents a scheme in which one BS transmits traffic data for one MS, and control traffic is shared between neighboring cells. The JP scheme is a scheme in which at least two BSs transmit traffic data for one MS. For example, the CB scheme includes a Precoding Matrix Index (PMI) coordination scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the case of using the PMI coordination scheme, an MS feeds the worst PMI of great interference from a neighboring BS or the best PMI of less interference, back to a serving BS. Based on the feedback information of the MS, the serving BS makes PMI coordination requests to the neighboring BSs that exert interference on the MS. Based on information provided from the serving BS, the neighboring BS restricts the use of the worst PMI (i.e., performs PMI restriction) or recommends the use of the best PMI (i.e., performs PMI recommendation), thus being capable of mitigating inter-cell interference.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, the PMI coordination scheme has several inherent problems.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Firstly, in the case of MSs feeding information back to a serving BS or communicating between BSs, the PMI coordination scheme uses a restricted bandwidth. Accordingly, because the PMI coordination scheme cannot perfectly remove all PMIs on all subbands giving interference, it is difficult to achieve ideal throughput owing to residual interference.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Secondly, in a case where cell boundary MSs send too many PMI coordination requests to interfering BSs so as to increase their own throughputs, there is a problem that the interfering BSs making the PMI coordination requests from the MSs suffer a shortage of bands and PMIs to provide service to their own MSs.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Lastly, in a case where cell boundary MSs send too few PMI coordination requests, there is a problem of increasing a probability that an interfering cell uses a band and PMI exerting interference on the MS that has sent the PMI coordination request.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Accordingly, there is a need for a way to efficiently reduce inter-cell interference while reducing a collision between cells.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Below, exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide a technology for mitigating Inter-Cell Interference (ICI) in a Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) system.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the following description, it is assumed that a MIMO system uses an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)/Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) scheme. However, exemplary embodiments of the present invention are identically applicable to a MIMO system using other communication schemes as well.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The following description is made on the premise of a PMI restriction scheme of restricting the use of a Precoding Matrix Index (PMI) that results in a large amount of interference to a cell boundary Mobile Station (MS), among PMI coordination schemes. However, exemplary embodiments of the present invention are equally applicable to a PMI recommendation scheme of recommending the use of a PMI that results in a small amount of interference to a cell boundary MS.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a construction of a wireless communication system using a PMI coordination scheme according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a MIMO system is constructed of one cluster <b>100</b> including a plurality of cells. For example, the MIMO system is constructed of one cluster <b>100</b> including a cell of a BS<b>1</b> <b>110</b>, a cell of a BS<b>2</b> <b>120</b>, and a cell of a BS<b>3</b> <b>130</b>. At this time, the BS<b>1</b> <b>110</b>, the BS<b>2</b> <b>120</b>, and the BS<b>3</b> <b>130</b> communicate with each other through a backbone network.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The BS<b>1</b> <b>110</b> provides service to an MS<b>1</b> <b>112</b> located in the service area of BS<b>1</b> <b>110</b>, the BS<b>2</b> <b>120</b> provides service to an MS<b>2</b> <b>122</b> located in the service area of MS<b>2</b> <b>122</b>, and the BS<b>3</b> <b>130</b> provides service to an MS<b>3</b> <b>132</b> located in the service area of MS<b>3</b> <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Inter-Cell Interference (ICI) can be generated among the BS<b>1</b> <b>110</b>, the BS<b>2</b> <b>120</b>, and the BS<b>3</b> <b>130</b>. For example, in a case where the MS<b>1</b> <b>112</b>, the MS<b>2</b> <b>122</b>, and the MS<b>3</b> <b>132</b> have the same serving band, a transmit signal from the BS<b>2</b> <b>120</b> to the MS<b>2</b> <b>122</b> and a transmit signal from the BS<b>3</b> <b>130</b> to the MS<b>3</b> <b>132</b> act as interference in the MS<b>1</b> <b>112</b>. That is, the MS<b>1</b> <b>112</b> is interfered by PMIs used by the MS<b>2</b> <b>122</b> and the MS<b>3</b> <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Accordingly, in order to reduce the inter-cell interference, the MS<b>1</b> <b>112</b> and the BS<b>1</b> <b>110</b> determine a band and PMI to make a use restriction request to neighboring BSs, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> below.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a method for selecting a PMI in a MIMO system according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. In the following description, it is assumed that the worst PMI is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a BS <b>210</b> provides service to an MS<b>1</b> <b>212</b> and an MS<b>2</b> <b>214</b> located in the service area of BS <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In a case where the MS<b>1</b> <b>212</b> and MS<b>2</b> <b>214</b> are located at a cell boundary, the MS<b>1</b> <b>212</b> and MS<b>2</b> <b>214</b> determine interference from dominant interfering BSs. For example, the MS<b>1</b> <b>212</b> and MS<b>2</b> <b>214</b> determine an interference value by subband for each of PMIs available in neighboring BSs, using a channel midamble of a non-precoding form. For another example, the MS<b>1</b> <b>212</b> and MS<b>2</b> <b>214</b> can also determine one wideband interference value for each of PMIs available in neighboring BSs using a channel midamble of a non-precoding form.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The MS<b>1</b> <b>212</b> and the MS<b>2</b> <b>214</b> generate request sets (<b>200</b>-<b>1</b>_<b>1</b> to <b>200</b>-<b>1</b>_N_D<b>1</b>) and request sets (<b>200</b>-<b>2</b>_<b>1</b> to <b>200</b>-<b>2</b>_N_D<b>1</b>) using the determined interference information. And then, the MS<b>1</b> <b>212</b> and the MS<b>2</b> <b>214</b> transmit the generated request sets (<b>200</b>-<b>1</b>_<b>1</b> to <b>200</b>-<b>1</b>_N_D<b>1</b>) and the generated request sets (<b>200</b>-<b>2</b>_<b>1</b> to <b>200</b>-<b>2</b>_N_D<b>1</b>) to the BS <b>210</b>. At this time, the MS<b>1</b> <b>212</b> and the MS<b>2</b> <b>214</b> generate request sets (<b>200</b>-<b>1</b>_<b>1</b> to <b>200</b>-<b>1</b>_N_D<b>1</b>) and the generated request sets (<b>200</b>-<b>2</b>_<b>1</b> to <b>200</b>-<b>2</b>_N_D<b>1</b>) by interfering BS and transmit the request sets (<b>200</b>-<b>1</b>_<b>1</b> to <b>200</b>-<b>1</b>_N_D<b>1</b>) and the request sets (<b>200</b>-<b>2</b>_<b>1</b> to <b>200</b>-<b>2</b>_N_D<b>1</b>) to the BS <b>210</b>. Request set <b>200</b> is an example of one request set. Request set <b>200</b> includes at least one PMI index (i.e., index of restPMI) restricting use of at least one PMI included therein, at least one band index (i.e., index of restBand) restricting use of at least one band included therein, an interference cell index (i.e., cell index from which interference is originated), and additional information. The additional information includes interference information determined from the PMI index and band index.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The BS <b>210</b> updates the request set by interfering BS provided from the MS<b>1</b> <b>212</b> and the MS<b>2</b> <b>214</b>, using scheduling information of the MS<b>1</b> <b>212</b> and MS<b>2</b> <b>214</b>. For example, the BS <b>210</b> removes information on a band other than a serving band of the MS<b>1</b> <b>212</b>, from the request sets (<b>200</b>-<b>1</b>_<b>1</b> to <b>200</b>-<b>1</b>_N_D<b>1</b>) by interfering BS provided from the MS<b>1</b> <b>212</b>. Also, the BS <b>210</b> removes information on a band other than a serving band of the MS<b>2</b> <b>214</b>, from the request sets (<b>200</b>-<b>2</b>_<b>1</b> to <b>200</b>-<b>2</b>_N_D<b>1</b>) by interfering BS provided from the MS<b>2</b> <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">After that, the BS <b>210</b> selects at least one request set among the updated request sets and transmits the selected request set to a corresponding interfering BS. For instance, the BS <b>210</b> arbitrarily selects request sets of &#x2018;N<b>1</b>&#x2019; number from the updated request sets. Next, the BS <b>210</b> transmits the selected request sets to interfering BSs corresponding to the selected request sets of &#x2018;N<b>1</b>&#x2019; number. If the BS <b>210</b> selects all the updated request sets, the BS <b>210</b> transmits many request sets to the interfering BSs, and receives many request sets from other BSs. Accordingly, the BS <b>210</b> transmits only the selected request sets of &#x2018;N<b>1</b>&#x2019; number to the interfering BSs.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The above determining of the interference by subband includes wideband interference determination that is the most comprehensive interference determination. In the case of using the wideband interference determination scheme, instead of not being constructed with respective subbands, the request set <b>200</b> has wideband construction such as &#x2018;PMI<b>1</b>@wideband&#x2019;, &#x2018;PMI<b>2</b>@wideband&#x2019; and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The following description is made for a method for feeding interference information back to a serving BS in an MS located at a cell boundary.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a procedure for feeding back interference information in an MS of a MIMO system according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in step <b>301</b>, the MS determines the best band. Here, the best band refers to a band not included in a use restriction request from a neighboring BS, among at least one or more bands supported by a serving BS.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">After that, the MS proceeds to step <b>303</b> and determines interference for all PMIs included in the best band with respect to an interfering BS. For example, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in a case where a band <b>1</b>, a band <b>2</b>, and a band <b>3</b> are included in the best band, the MS determines interference of all PMIs of the band <b>1</b>, band <b>2</b>, and band <b>3</b> by interfering BS.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">After determining the interference, the MS proceeds to step <b>305</b> and generates a request set for each interfering BS. Here, the request set includes at least one PMI index (i.e., index of restPMl) restricting use of at least one PMI included therein, at least one band index (i.e., index of restBand) restricting use of at least one band included therein, an interference cell index (i.e., cell index from which interference is originated), and additional information. The additional information includes interference information determined in the PMI index and band index.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">After generating the request set by interfering BS, the MS proceeds to step <b>307</b> and transmits the generated request set by interfering BS to a serving BS.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">After that, the MS terminates the procedure according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the aforementioned exemplary embodiment, an MS determines interference of a PMI by subband.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In another exemplary embodiment, an MS can also determine wideband interference of a PMI. In this case, the MS finds one or more worst PMIs in the determined wideband interference and then, the MS can construct a request set, such as &#x2018;worst PMI @ best band&#x2019;, and feed the request set back to a serving BS. The serving BS makes a wideband restriction request for a PMI to an interfering BS. That is, in a case where the best band or a serving band of an MS quickly varies, the serving band of the MS can change in a process in which the serving BS of the MS makes a PMI restriction request to an interfering BS. In this case, no gain can be obtained from PMI restriction for a specific band. So, it is efficient that the serving BS makes a wideband restriction request to the interfering BS.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the aforementioned exemplary embodiment, an MS generates a request set to include interference information of all PMIs on the best band.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In another exemplary embodiment, an MS can also select the best PMI by best band, and generate a request set to include interference information of the best PMI by best band.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The following description is made for a method for transmitting a request set provided from an MS, to a neighboring BS in a BS.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a procedure for transmitting a request set to a neighboring BS in a BS of a MIMO system according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in step <b>401</b>, the BS determines at least one serving band of each of at least one or more MSs to be serviced, through scheduling.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">After that, the BS proceeds to step <b>403</b> and determines if a request set is received from at least one MS located at a cell boundary.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">If the BS does not receive a request set from at least one MS located at a cell boundary, the BS terminates the procedure according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">On the other hand, if the BS receives a request set from at least one MS located at a boundary cell, the BS proceeds to step <b>405</b> and updates the request set by interfering BS received from the MS, using the serving band of each MS. That is, the BS removes information on a band other than the serving band of each MS, from the request set of the MS. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in a case where a serving band of an MS<b>1</b> <b>212</b> is a band <b>2</b>, a BS <b>210</b> removes information on a band other than the band <b>2</b> from request sets (<b>200</b>-<b>1</b>_<b>1</b> to <b>200</b>-<b>1</b>_N_D<b>1</b>) by interfering BS provided from the MS<b>1</b> <b>212</b>. For another example, in a case where a serving band of the MS<b>2</b> <b>214</b> is a band <b>1</b>, the BS <b>210</b> removes information on a band other than the band <b>1</b> from request sets (<b>200</b>-<b>2</b>_<b>1</b> to <b>200</b>-<b>2</b>_N_D<b>1</b>) by interfering BS provided from the MS<b>2</b> <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">After updating request sets by interfering BS, the BS proceeds to step <b>407</b> and selects request sets for interfering BSs of any number (N<b>1</b>) originating a large amount of interference, from the updated request sets of the respective MSs by interfering BS.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Next, the BS proceeds to step <b>409</b> and transmits the selected request sets to the interfering BSs corresponding to the selected request sets, through a backhaul network. That is, the BS makes use restriction requests for bands and PMIs included in the selected request sets, to the interfering BSs corresponding to the selected request sets.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">After that, the BS terminates the procedure according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In the aforementioned exemplary embodiment, the BS selects only request sets of &#x2018;N<b>1</b>&#x2019; number among updated request sets and transmits the selected request sets to interfering BSs.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In another exemplary embodiment, the BS can also transmit updated request sets to interfering BSs. In this case, step <b>407</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the aforementioned exemplary embodiment, the BS makes a use restriction request for a band and PMI to an interfering BS, using a request set by subband provided from an MS.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In another exemplary embodiment, in a case where an MS feeds a request set determining and constructing wideband interference back to a serving BS, the serving BS can transmit a request set including wideband interference information, to an interfering BS. At this time, the serving BS transmits serving band information of each MS being serviced, to the interfering BS together with the request set.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">If a serving BS of an MS located at a cell boundary makes a use restriction request for specific band and PMI to an interfering BS as above, the interfering BS restricts the use of the band and PMI originating interference in a neighboring cell as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> below.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a procedure for accepting a PMI restriction request in a BS of a MIMO system according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a cell C <b>510</b> exerts interference on a cell A, a cell B, a cell D, and a cell E in a process in which the cell C <b>510</b> transmits a signal to an MS within the service area of cell C <b>510</b>. In this case, a BS <b>511</b> managing the cell C <b>510</b> can receive request sets <b>500</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>500</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>500</b>-<b>3</b>, and <b>500</b>-<b>4</b> from the cell A, the cell B, the cell D, and the cell E through a backbone network, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In this case, the BS <b>511</b> determines a band and PMI to restrict a use thereof as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> below, based on the request sets provided from the cell A, the cell B, the cell D, and the cell E.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a procedure for, after restricting a PMI, sharing the same information with intra cell MSs in a BS of a MIMO system according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in step <b>601</b>, the BS determines if a request set making a use restriction request for a band and PMI is received from at least one neighboring BS.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">If a request set is not received from at least one neighboring BS, the BS returns to step <b>601</b> to determine if a request set making a use restriction request for a band and PMI is received from at least one neighboring BS.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">On the other hand, if a request set is received from at least one neighboring BS, the BS proceeds to step <b>603</b> and selects a request set to apply to a resource allocation, from the received at least one request set. That is, the BS selects at least one request set to be used for resource matrix construction, from the received at least one request set. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the BS <b>511</b> arbitrarily selects request sets of &#x2018;N<b>2</b>&#x2019; number among request sets provided from a cell A, a cell B, a cell D, and a cell E.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">After that, the BS proceeds to step <b>605</b> and updates a band-PMI resource matrix using the selected request set. That is, the BS masks out, for non-use, an element corresponding to the request set selected in step <b>603</b>, in the band-PMI resource matrix. For example, the BS masks out, for non-use, an element corresponding to a request set in a band-PMI resource matrix constructed as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, which is described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">After updating a band-PMI resource matrix, the BS proceeds to step <b>607</b> and transmits information on the updated band-PMI resource matrix to at least one MS located within a cell. For example, the BS transmits a broadcasting message that includes the information on the updated band-PMI resource matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">After that, the BS terminates the procedure according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a resource matrix construction in a MIMO system according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in a case where an interfering BS receives a request set from at least one neighboring BS, the interfering BS updates a band-PMI resource matrix based on the request set so as to reduce interference exerted on the neighboring BS.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In other words, in order to restrict the use of an element corresponding to the request set received from the neighboring BS, the interfering BS masks out the element. At this time, the interfering BS provides service to at least one MS located in the service area of the interfering BS, using an element not masked out.</p>
