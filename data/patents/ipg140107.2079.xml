<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to a method and apparatus for making a preform for insertion in the cavity of a muffler.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The exhaust system of an automobile incorporates a muffler for reducing exhaust noise from the engine. Mufflers must provide appropriate silencing while not causing too high a pressure drop. Fiber inserts can be positioned within the muffler to assist in sound dampening and minimizing pressure drop.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to this invention there is provided a process for curing a porous muffler preform defined by a plurality of glass fibers and heat-curing thermoset or thermoplastic materials (i.e. binders) applied to the plurality of glass fibers. The function of the binder is to impart mechanical integrity to the preform so that it can be easily inserted into a muffler. The process includes the step of enclosing the muffler preform in a chamber. The process also includes the step of surrounding the muffler preform with steam. The process also includes the step of causing steam to enter the muffler preform from multiple directions.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A second process for curing a porous muffler preform defined by a plurality of glass fibers and a heat-curing thermoset or thermoplastic materials applied to the plurality of glass fibers is also provided. The second process includes the step of enclosing the muffler preform in a chamber at a first pressure. The second process also includes the step of injecting steam into the chamber through an inlet port after the enclosing step. The steam is directed by baffling surfaces inside the chamber so as to not directly impinge the steam on the muffler preform. The second process also includes the step of causing steam to enter the muffler preform from multiple directions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A third process for curing a porous muffler preform defined by a plurality of glass fibers and a heat-curing thermoset or thermoplastic materials applied to the plurality of glass fibers is also provided. The third process includes the step of enclosing the muffler preform at a first temperature in a chamber at first pressure. The third process also includes the step of surrounding the muffler preform after the enclosing step with steam at a second pressure greater than atmosphere and the first pressure and at second temperature substantially at the boiling point of water (i.e. saturated steam) based on the second pressure. The third process also includes the step of causing steam to enter the muffler preform wherein water is condensed on the muffler preform thereby imparting heat to the binder material. The third process also includes the step of venting the chamber to the atmosphere after the condensing step such that much of the condensate on the muffler preform evaporates.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Two different embodiments of the invention are shown in the Figures of the application. Similar features are shown in the two embodiments of the invention. Similar features have been numbered with a common reference numeral and have been differentiated by an alphabetic suffix. Similar features are structured similarly, operate similarly, and/or have the same function unless otherwise indicated by the drawings or this specification. Furthermore, particular features of one embodiment can replace corresponding features in the other embodiment or can supplement the other embodiment unless otherwise indicated by the drawings or this specification.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The embodiments of the invention disclosed below are applicable to the fabrication of an insert for a muffler. However, it is noted that the process steps set forth herein can be applied in other fields for porous preforms or other products used in other operating environments. A porous preform defined by a plurality of glass fibers and a heat-curing thermoset or thermoplastic materials applied to the plurality of glass fibers can be cured and used as a muffler insert. In the curing process, steam is caused to enter the preform from different directions and does not directly impinge on the preform. It is noted that the thickened arrows in the drawings schematically represent the flow of steam. Since the steam does not directly impinge on the preform, the preform is not deformed by the steam entering the chamber, but is quickly and uniformly cured without the excessive accumulation of condensation. The retained water is about 10% of the preform by weight.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The method disclosed herein is superior to previous methods. For example, it is faster, can provide for more uniform curing, and can be typically carried out at a lower temperature so there is no binder decomposition. The method also appears to be more energy efficient. Rapid curing cycle also allows the use of fewer molds.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">For example, the average cure time for a batch (e.g. 40 preforms) of phenolic based thermoset binders can be less than one second. This compares with 30 seconds to 2 minutes for a forced hot air system or a simple convective hot air system. Typically, in hot air curing systems, the temperatures utilized are high enough that the binder will start to decompose. The reason for these high temperatures is to reduce the average curing time. In contrast, the temperatures used in this process are just above the maximum curing rate of the binder and below the temperature at which binder decomposition could begin. This results in a higher quality preform with minimal binder content. The curing of the preform with the new process is also more consistent since the steam rapidly penetrates the preform and releases most of its energy as the steam condenses. This compares with hot air systems where the outer part of preform attains higher temperatures than the inner parts of the preform because the porous preform is a good thermal insulator in an air environment. Because of the very efficient transfer of energy from the steam to the preform and the very thermally efficient steam generators readily available, the overall energy consumption of this process is typically less than that of prior art hot air systems. Because of the very rapid curing cycle, one will typically need fewer molds for the same process throughput than will be required for hot air processes.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in a first exemplary embodiment, a muffler preform <b>10</b> is retained in a perforated mold <b>12</b>. The preform <b>10</b> is formed from a plurality of glass fibers and a heat-curing thermoset or thermoplastic materials applied to the plurality of glass fibers. At this point, a heat-curing thermoset material is uncured, and the glass fibers are moveable relative to one another prior to curing. The application of heat to the preform <b>10</b> causes the heat-curing thermoset material to cure and thereby tends to immobilize the glass fibers. Both the thermoset and thermoplastic materials can encase the fibers as well as bridge the fibers together. Since the binder materials tend to be less flexible than the glass fibers, simply encasing the fibers with the stiff binder materials will also tend to give structural integrity to the preform. The bridging mechanism will probably be dominant, at least in the case of thermoplastic materials. If a thermoplastic materials is used, the heat can allow the material to form bridges between fibers. When the binder material cools, the glass fibers will be bound together. The glass fibers can be injected into the mold <b>12</b> until the mold <b>12</b> is filled with the desired quantity of fibers. The fibers can be sprayed with the heat-curing thermoset or thermoplastic materials while being injected into the mold <b>12</b>. Other means and methods can be used to insert the fibers into the mold <b>12</b> and to apply the binder either before or after the fibers enter the mold.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the mold <b>12</b> can be perforated, including apertures <b>14</b> on at least two different sides. The exemplary mold <b>12</b> includes a pattern of apertures <b>14</b> arranged around an entire periphery of the mold <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, substantially 20% to substantially 50% of an outer surface of the mold <b>12</b> can be open to receive steam. It is possible to achieve acceptable curing with few holes in the mold. Generally, higher porosity of the mold tends to make the mold less mechanically durable in a manufacturing environment. However, a smaller porosity tends to increase the curing time. It is also noted that a preform without a central hole could be more in the shape of a rectangle than a cylinder, but could be cured by an embodiment of the process disclosed herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a second embodiment in which a mold <b>12</b><i>a </i>includes a first set of apertures <b>14</b><i>a </i>around an outer surface <b>16</b><i>a </i>and a second set of apertures <b>18</b><i>a </i>around an inner surface <b>20</b><i>a</i>. It is noted that the use of a mold for retaining the preform and the configurations of the molds <b>12</b>, <b>12</b><i>a </i>are relevant to the exemplary embodiments and not limitations for every embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is also noted that either mold <b>12</b> or <b>12</b><i>a </i>can be filled with a plurality of glass fibers and a heat-curing thermoset or thermoplastic materials assisted by a vacuum. For example, a vacuum can be applied in the interior cavity <b>22</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> as the preform materials are directed into the annular space between the surfaces <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>a</i>. Other applications of a vacuum can be applied in other mold configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the chamber <b>24</b> can be defined by a pressure vessel <b>26</b>. The mold <b>12</b> retaining the muffler preform <b>10</b> can be enclosed in a chamber <b>24</b> by placing the mold <b>12</b> in the chamber <b>24</b> and closing a door <b>40</b> of the pressure vessel <b>26</b>. After the mold <b>12</b> is enclosed in the chamber <b>24</b> the chamber <b>24</b> can be filled with steam. The muffler preform is thus surrounded with steam. When the chamber <b>24</b> is closed after the mold <b>12</b> is inserted, the pressure in the chamber <b>24</b> can be a first pressure, such as atmosphere or some other level of pressure. The steam injected into the chamber <b>24</b> is at a second pressure that is higher than the first pressure. Steam is caused to enter the muffler preform <b>10</b> because the muffler preform <b>10</b> is porous and because of the differential between the first and second pressures. The steam can thus penetrate the muffler preform <b>10</b> and contact the heat-curing thermoset or thermoplastic materials throughout the muffler preform <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The steam will rapidly enter the interstices of the preform. When the steam contacts the glass filaments in the preform, it will change state from the gaseous phase to the liquid phase, giving up its latent heat of condensation to the glass fibers. The rapid movement of the steam deep into the preform is driven by the pressure difference between the air already present in the preform, at atmospheric pressure, and the pressure of the steam. The steam will travel rapidly and deeply into the preform (based upon the steam pressure) and will condense to the liquid form upon contact with the relatively colder binder-coated glass filaments.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The steam can be injected into the chamber <b>24</b> through an inlet port <b>28</b> after the enclosing step. Optionally, the steam can be directed by baffling surfaces inside the chamber <b>24</b> so as to not directly impinge the steam on the muffler preform <b>10</b>. In other words, the inlet port <b>28</b> can direct the steam along an axis <b>30</b> but the steam contacts the preform <b>10</b> in a direction different from the axis <b>30</b>. Since the steam does not directly impinge the preform, the steam will be less likely to deform the preform. It will also tend to heat the preform in a more uniform manner than if the steam directly impinges the preform from one or a plurality of inlets. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows one example in which a baffle <b>32</b> is positioned along the axis <b>30</b> between the muffler preform <b>10</b> and the inlet port <b>28</b>. The baffle <b>32</b> divides or bifurcates the flow of steam to opposite sides of the muffler preform <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the baffle <b>32</b> is shown diffusing the flow 360 degrees about the axis <b>30</b>. By the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the baffle <b>32</b> diverts the flow to the radial periphery of the chamber <b>24</b>. In operation, the steam will penetrate the preform <b>10</b> from all sides of the preform <b>10</b> about the axis <b>30</b> for the full length of the preform along the axis <b>30</b>. The steam represented by arrows <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> can penetrate the preform <b>10</b> initially, followed by the steam represented by arrows <b>48</b> and <b>50</b>, followed by the steam represented by arrows <b>52</b> and <b>54</b>, followed by the steam represented by arrows <b>56</b> and <b>58</b>, followed by the steam represented by arrows <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>, and followed by the steam represented by arrows <b>64</b> and <b>66</b>. The arrows <b>44</b>-<b>66</b> are schematic and shown to illustrate the progression of steam from the inlet port <b>28</b>, around the baffle <b>32</b>, and along the axis <b>30</b>. The diffusion of steam from the inlet port <b>28</b> along the axis <b>30</b> will occur substantially instantaneously. Thus, the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> provides a process for causing steam to rapidly penetrate the preform <b>10</b> from all sides and pass from the outside of the preform <b>10</b> to the inside.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows several other examples by which steam can be introduced to a chamber <b>24</b><i>a </i>without directly impinging on the muffler preform <b>10</b><i>a</i>. Inlet ports <b>28</b><i>a</i>, <b>28</b><i>b </i>are directed at baffles <b>32</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>b</i>, respectively, having various cross-sections. The baffle <b>32</b><i>a </i>is shaped such that outer baffling surfaces <b>36</b><i>a </i>and <b>38</b><i>a </i>extend tangent to the mold <b>12</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the flow of steam directed by surfaces <b>36</b><i>a </i>and <b>38</b><i>a </i>would not impinge directly on the preform <b>10</b><i>a</i>. The radially inner edge <b>42</b><i>a </i>of the baffle <b>32</b><i>b </i>is similarly shaped to be tangent to the mold <b>12</b><i>a</i>. It is also noted that a flat plate could be utilized placed between the inlet and the preform to diffuse the steam.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Another inlet port <b>28</b><i>c </i>can be directed at an inner surface <b>34</b><i>a </i>of the pressure vessel <b>26</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the pressure vessel <b>26</b><i>a </i>itself can define a baffling surface. An inlet port <b>28</b><i>d </i>can direct steam along an axis <b>30</b><i>a </i>that does not intersect the mold <b>12</b><i>a </i>or the preform <b>10</b><i>a</i>. The steam emitted from the inlet port <b>28</b><i>d </i>can emanate from the inlet port <b>28</b><i>d </i>such that the steam would contact the mold <b>12</b><i>a </i>prior to contacting the surface <b>34</b><i>a</i>. However, the steam emitted from the inlet port <b>28</b><i>d </i>would not directly impinge on the preform <b>10</b><i>a </i>since the axis <b>30</b><i>a </i>does not intersect the preform <b>10</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The examples set forth in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> demonstrate that various embodiments can be practiced to cause steam to enter the muffler preforms <b>10</b>, <b>10</b><i>a </i>from multiple directions, including opposite directions. Inlet ports can be arranged around the periphery of the preform or a single inlet port can direct steam into the chamber. In an embodiment having multiple inlet ports, the inlet ports can be equally spaced about a periphery of the preform or can be grouped together.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the muffler preform <b>10</b> can be enclosed in the chamber <b>24</b> when the muffler preform <b>10</b> is at a first temperature. The first temperature can be selected as desired and may be ambient temperature. The first temperature will be lower than the temperature of the steam to ensure that heat from the steam can be transferred to the heat-curing thermoset or thermoplastic materials. The chamber <b>24</b> can be at a first pressure when the door <b>40</b> of the pressure vessel <b>26</b> is closed. The first pressure can be selected as desired and may be ambient pressure or atmospheric pressure. The first pressure will be lower than the pressure of the steam to ensure that the steam will fully penetrate the preform <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The temperature and pressure of the steam can be selected to ensure curing, while minimizing the likelihood that condensation will remain after the chamber <b>24</b> is vented after curing. The temperature of the steam is normally controlled by the steam pressure. One could attach a subsequent heater to increase the temperature of the steam. That solution may be more costly than simply increasing the operating pressure of the steam generator. It is desirable to minimize the amount of condensation that remains on the preform after the curing process. The pressure of the steam can be at least eight times the first pressure in the exemplary embodiments, but could be less than eight times in other embodiments. For example, the steam can be injected into the chamber <b>24</b> at a pressure in the range of about 150 p.s.i. (10.2 atmospheres) to about 190 p.s.i. (12.9 atmospheres).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Generally, higher steam pressure corresponds to higher cost, so the pressure of the steam can be selected as the minimum pressure at which the steam will fully and quickly penetrate the preform <b>10</b> and the temperature of the steam is high enough that it will still cure the thermoset or allow the thermoplastic material to form bridges between fibers. The amount of condensation remaining on the preform can be further reduced by reducing the pressure in the chamber below atmospheric pressure for a brief time before the door is opened and pressure in the chamber raises/returns to atmospheric pressure. This would also further decrease the temperature of the preforms making them easier to handle when they are removed from the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Also, the minimum pressure of the steam can be selected in view of the corresponding temperature at which water will vaporize. The boiling point of water is dependent on the extent of the surrounding pressure. The steam imparts almost all of its useable heat to the thermoset or thermoplastic materials by condensing, changing state from vapor to liquid. Thus, the pressure of the steam can be selected so that the steam condensation will occur at a temperature that the thermoset or thermoplastic materials will rapidly cure. In one example, the steam can be injected into the chamber <b>24</b> at a temperature in the range from about 350&#xb0; F. to about 380&#xb0; F. The steam may be injected into the chamber <b>34</b> as saturated steam, i.e. at the saturation temperature corresponding to the steam pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The temperature can also be selected in view of the pressure and temperature conditions after the chamber <b>24</b> is vented and the door <b>40</b> is open. Specifically, it can be desirable that all of the condensate vaporizes when the curing process is complete. Therefore, the temperature of the steam can be selected so that the temperature of the condensate resulting from curing will be at a temperature high enough to vaporize at the pressure in the chamber <b>24</b> after venting. It is noted that the temperature of the muffler preform <b>10</b> will be raised by the steam, increasing the likelihood of complete vaporization of the condensate generated by curing.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">An exemplary process according to an embodiment can proceed as follows. The mold <b>12</b> can be filled with a plurality of glass fibers and a heat-curing thermoset or thermoplastic materials applied to the plurality of glass fibers. The filled mold <b>12</b> can then be placed in the chamber <b>24</b> and the door <b>40</b> of the pressure vessel <b>26</b> can be closed to define the closed chamber <b>24</b>. The temperature of the mold <b>12</b>, preform <b>10</b>, and the interior of the chamber <b>24</b> can be ambient. The pressure in the chamber <b>24</b> can be ambient. After the pressure vessel <b>26</b> is closed, steam can be injected into the chamber <b>24</b> for a period of about 20 seconds to about 120 seconds. The steam can be at a temperature in the range from about 350&#xb0; F. to about 380&#xb0; F. After a time within the range of about 120 seconds to about 150 seconds, the pressure in the chamber <b>24</b> can be in the range of about 120 p.s.i. to about 190 p.s.i. The time required to reach the maximum pressure is mainly dependent upon the capacity of the steam generator. In one commercial operation, a pressure of 150 psi would be reached within 20 seconds of the start of pressurization. As the chamber is being pressurized, the interior of the preform lags the temperature of the steam by about 15 seconds and less than 15&#xb0; C. After reaching the maximum pressure, the time required to cure the binder or cause the binder to flow sufficiently that the preform will have mechanical integrity when cooled is in the range of about 30 seconds to about 150 seconds. Generally, the lower the steam temperature, the longer will be the time required for curing. Next, the chamber <b>24</b> can be vented and the door <b>40</b> to the pressure vessel <b>26</b> can be opened. It can be desirable to vent the chamber <b>24</b> and open the door <b>40</b> as quickly as possible so that the condensate does not experience a temperature drop, thus decreasing the likelihood of complete evaporation. In some embodiments, the chamber <b>24</b> can be vented and the door <b>40</b> opened in a time within the range of about 20 seconds to about 40 seconds. In another embodiment, the pressure in the chamber <b>24</b> can be reduced below atmospheric to decrease the amount of moisture remaining on the preform and further cool the preform. If there is condensate in the chamber, it can be removed before the door is opened.</p>
