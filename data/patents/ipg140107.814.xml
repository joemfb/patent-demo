<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to baling equipment safety devices or mechanisms and related methods which protect operators from potential injury incurred by movement of the equipment or components of the equipment during operation or positioning of the baling equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A baling machine is capable of compacting various types of material into a bale and requires the movement of various large components that pose a significant safety risk to the operators of the equipment. This safety risk is a concern to employers, employees and national safety institutions.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">While there are multiple manufacturers, types and designs of baling machines, many components are similar among them. One example of a common type of baling machine has two chambers attached to each other about an axis. This enables the machine to rotate between two positions. The first position is a loading position where textiles, waste, recyclable or other materials are loaded into one of the chambers. The first chamber is then rotated to a second position where the material is compacted and baled and the second chamber is simultaneously rotated into the first position. This allows for the compaction of the material in the first chamber, while the second chamber is simultaneously being loaded with material. The rotation of the two chambers about the axis continues between the two positions as the operation of loading, compacting and baling proceeds.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">So as to reduce the complexity and length of the Detailed Specification, and to fully establish the state of the art in certain areas of technology, Applicants herein expressly incorporate by reference all of the following materials identified in each numbered paragraph below.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 6,239,423 (Hama) discloses area sensors including a light emitter having a plurality of light emitting devices for placement around a pressing machine.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat. No. 5,819,645 (Sutton) discloses an electrical safety circuit which is incorporated into a standard vertical baler operational circuit of the type which actuates the ram cycle of a baler.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">U.S. Pat. No. 7,007,598 (Patras) discloses a trash compactor including a blocking mechanism to an access port during compaction using various sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">U.S. Pat. No. 6,742,448 (Davis) discloses a compaction apparatus with magnetic locks and position sensors which for locking, releasing, and sensing the position of a loading door and a bale chamber door.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">U.S. Pat. App. No. 20040200367 (Iacobucci) discloses a waste compactor with sensors to detect compaction material and that the compaction area doors are closed.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Applicants believe that the material incorporated above is &#x201c;non-essential&#x201d; in accordance with 37 CFR 1.57, because it is referred to for purposes of indicating the background of the inventions or illustrating the state of the art. However, if the Examiner believes that any of the above-incorporated material constitutes &#x201c;essential material&#x201d; within the meaning of 37 CFR 1.57(c)(1)-(3), Applicants will amend the specification to expressly recite the essential material that is incorporated by reference as allowed by the applicable rules.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The operation of a baling machine requires safety mechanisms to avoid injury to operators and also to avoid damage to objects or to the machine itself during operation. Safety mechanisms prevent the machine and components of the machine from moving when obstacles are in potential hazardous areas during processing. These mechanisms may be incorporated on as manufactured baling equipment or added to existing equipment to ensure equipment operation proceeds in a safe manner.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Implementations of a safety actuator apparatus for a baling machine with at least one baling chamber may comprise an extension member attached to the baling machine with one end of the extension member that protrudes or extends from the baling machine. A separate support member is part of frame work outside of the baling machine and includes a safety actuated retention component. This component aligns with the one end of the extension member and is capable of contacting and restraining the baling machine by restraining the attached extension member.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Particular implementations may comprise one or more of the following features. A detection device in the surrounding area of the baling equipment and capable of identifying the presence of an obstacle in a predetermined path or trajectory of movement of a component of the baling machine. Implementations may further comprise a communication device configured to send a signal from the detection device to the safety actuated retention component and engage the safety actuated retention component to restrain the movement of at least one component of the baling machine. This occurs when an obstacle, such as a human or an object, is within the predetermined path or trajectory of movement of the baling machine or component of the baling machine. This movement of the machine or a component of the machine includes rotation about a central axis.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Particular implementation of the safety actuated retention component of the safety actuator apparatus of the baling machine may have at least one retraction arm. This arm may be actuated by pneumatics and include a spring loaded mechanism. Implementations may further comprise the safety actuated retention component secured to the separate support member by a frame sleeve that allows the retention component to engage and disengage the one end of the extension member. The engagement or disengagement of the retention component restrains or allows movement of the baling machine. In other implementations the retention component may have two extension arms with a support connecting the two arms forming a U-shaped channel. These two extension arms are configured to extend around the at least one end of the extension member to restrain the movement of at least one component of the baling machine in at least two directions. Implementations may further comprise extension arms that include a sloped protrusion that contacts the end of the extension member and as the extension member moves along with the baling equipment, it causes the progressive retraction of the extension arm. The retraction of this arm is at least a distance in height equal to the slope of the sloped protrusion.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further implementations may comprise a detection device that is an opto-electric device such as a light curtain. It will detect obstacles in the predetermined path or trajectory of at least one component of the baling machine but may also detect obstacles between moving components or between moving and stationary components of the baling machine.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Particular implementations of a safety actuator apparatus are also for a baling machine with at least two baling chambers configured to alternate between at least two predetermined processing positions. An extension member is attached to the baling machine and one end extends outwardly from the baling machine and is configured to contact a safety actuated retention component when the baling chambers alternate between the at least two predetermined processing positions.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Other implementations comprise a detection device employed to recognize the presence of an obstacle in a predetermined path or trajectory of movement of at least one component of the two chambered baling machine. A communication device implemented to send a signal from the detection device to the safety actuated retention component. This signal will engage the safety retention component and restrain the movement of at least one component of the baling machine. Implementations may further comprise a detection device that is an opto-electric device and will detect an obstacle within a predetermined path of the movement of the baling machine, including rotation of the two baling chambers about a central axis.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Implementations may further comprise a safety actuated retention component that includes at least one retractable extension arm to engage and disengage the extension member. The engagement of the retractable extension arm may be actuated through pneumatics or spring loading or both. Other implementations may include two extension arms that form a U shaped channel to engage and disengage one end of the extension member. These arms restrain movement of the baling machine in at least two directions with the end of the extension arm restrained between the two extension arms.

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Safety mechanisms for baling equipment often function to protect an operator from the compacting and baling mechanisms of the baling equipment but there is also risk to operators during movement of the baling equipment itself. Referring to a dual chamber rotating baler design, operators that work in the path of chamber rotation to strap or unload bales require safety mechanisms to reduce the risk of injury during movement of the equipment. Baling equipment is often large in size and heavy and safety mechanisms must be able to restrain the equipment from movement once an obstacle, such as an operator, is within the predetermined path or trajectory of the machine. Although a dual chambered machine frequently used in the baling industry, all designs require moving components and therefore safety devices are imperative to the industry regardless of the baling machine design.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts an implementation of the present invention including a front view of a baling machine <b>1</b> and a safety actuator apparatus <b>2</b>. In this embodiment, the baling machine <b>1</b> depicted includes two baling chambers <b>10</b> but a baling machine <b>1</b> with one or with multiple chambers or other components not featured in this implementation is contemplated for the present invention. The fixed base <b>5</b> of the baling machine along with a central axle <b>7</b> allows the rotation of the chambers <b>10</b> into different positions about the central axle <b>7</b>. The rotation may or may not occur in only one direction about the axle <b>7</b> and may be of any degree between 0 and 360. In other embodiments, it is contemplated that the baling machine <b>1</b> may move positions by a sliding, lifting or any other mechanism and in any direction without deviating from the intent of the present invention. All details of all components of a baling machine are not necessarily relevant to the configuration of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The components of the safety actuator apparatus <b>2</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> include two extension members <b>20</b>, each with an end <b>25</b> extending outwardly from the baling machine <b>1</b> and two separate support members <b>30</b> with safety actuator retention components <b>40</b> secured to each separate support member <b>30</b>. Details of a safety actuator retention component <b>40</b> are provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also includes a representation of strapping channels <b>8</b> beneath baling chambers <b>10</b> of the baling machine <b>1</b>. Typically, areas near strapping channels <b>8</b> and the baling machine chambers <b>10</b> are the critical safety areas where operators process materials and are relevant to the need for a safety actuator apparatus <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a top view of an embodiment of the safety actuator apparatus <b>2</b>, the baling machine <b>1</b> and a detection device <b>50</b>. The detection device <b>50</b> in this embodiment covers a 360 degree target area about the center axle <b>7</b> and within the perimeter of the exterior of the baling machine dual chamber rotation <b>9</b>. The detection device <b>50</b> in this embodiment is an opto-electric device such as a light curtain but the present invention could employ a detection device <b>50</b> using any other method such as laser, magnetic or thermal technologies to detect an obstacle in a target area. Extension members <b>20</b> are attached to the sides and top of the baling chambers <b>10</b>. The extension members <b>20</b> may be fabricated from multiple materials and include various constructions and designs. Non limiting material examples of the extension members include wood, steel, iron or polymeric materials. Non limiting designs include hollow square iron, rod iron, solid shafts, or steel pipes.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The baling equipment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a dual chambered baler but single chambered, multi-chambered or any other baler configuration is an appropriate implementation for use with the present safety actuator apparatus. Additionally, although all components of the safety actuator apparatus are used for baling equipment, use of any or all components of the safety apparatus with equipment or machines other than baling machines does not depart from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also depicts two separate support members <b>30</b> positioned on the exterior of the perimeter of the baling machine <b>1</b> chamber rotation. The positioning of these posts may be at any distance around the perimeter of the rotation of the baling machine. In this embodiment, the two separate support members <b>30</b> are vertical posts secured to the floor; however, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that any other appropriate support member configuration may also be used. Each post includes an attached safety retention component <b>40</b>. The safety actuated retention components <b>40</b> are positioned on the support members <b>30</b> to align with the extension members <b>20</b> or the ends of the extension arms <b>25</b>. This alignment is such that the rotational horizontal movement of the extension members <b>20</b> about the central axle <b>7</b> will cause the extension members <b>20</b> or the ends of the extension members <b>25</b> to engage safety retention components <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The chambers <b>10</b> of baling machine <b>1</b> represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are positioned in one of two predetermined processing positions, where material is loaded in a chamber <b>10</b> while other material may be baled simultaneously in a second chamber <b>10</b>. A second predetermined processing position is 180 degrees opposite the first position where material is loaded a chamber <b>10</b> and while other material may be baled simultaneously in a second chamber <b>10</b>. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a placement of support members <b>30</b> in a position where extension arms <b>20</b> could engage safety actuated retention components <b>40</b> at a short distance after a predetermined position or its inverse. Engagement of the respective extension arms <b>20</b> with the respective retention component <b>40</b> depends on the rotation direction about the central axis <b>7</b>. The placement of the support members <b>30</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are not limiting and implementations of the present invention include any number of support members <b>30</b> and locations at which the support members could be placed around a baling machine <b>1</b>. Furthermore, various designs of support members and locations of those support members are contemplated based on the configuration of a baling machine that slides, lifts or moves in a path other than rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts an implementation of a safety actuated retention component <b>40</b> including an air cylinder <b>41</b>, a retention component frame <b>45</b>, and a retention component body <b>44</b>. The retention component body <b>44</b> includes two extension arms <b>46</b> and <b>47</b> where extension arm <b>46</b> includes an angled extension arm protrusion <b>48</b> and a spring loaded mechanism <b>43</b>. When the safety actuated retention component <b>40</b> extends the two extension arms <b>46</b> and <b>47</b> through piston <b>42</b> and pneumatics <b>85</b> of air cylinder <b>41</b>, a U-shaped channel <b>90</b> is formed to restrain the extension members <b>20</b> or the ends of the extension members <b>25</b> between the retention component body <b>44</b> and the two extension arms <b>46</b> and <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the angled protrusion <b>48</b> on extension arm <b>46</b> and the spring loaded mechanism <b>43</b> connects extension arm <b>46</b> with the retention component body <b>44</b> and facilitate engagement with the extension members <b>20</b>. These elements enable the end <b>25</b> of extension member <b>20</b>, to pass into the U-shaped channel <b>90</b> when the safety actuated retention component <b>40</b> is engaged. The end <b>25</b> of extension member <b>20</b> is engaged in the U-shaped channel <b>90</b> as the extension member travels horizontally along the perimeter of the chamber rotation in a clockwise direction (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). As rotation continues, the spring loaded mechanism <b>43</b> and the force of the contact of end <b>25</b> of the extension member <b>20</b> with the angled protrusion <b>48</b> on the bottom of the extension arm <b>46</b> allows extension arm <b>46</b> to retract into the retention component body <b>44</b>. Once the end <b>25</b> of extension member <b>20</b> has rotated past the bottom of extension arm <b>47</b>, the spring loaded mechanism <b>43</b> causes extension arm <b>46</b> to spring back out and retain end <b>25</b> of the extension member <b>20</b> within the U-shaped channel <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The embodiment of the safety actuated retention component <b>40</b> represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is not a limiting example as other implementations of a retention component are possible. The retention component may include, for example, a single extension arm with a latching mechanism, magnetic forces, ball and socket or other restraining mechanisms. Additionally, the safety retention component <b>40</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is not limited to use with only baling equipment. Numerous other types of equipment and machinery that require safety mechanisms to restrain physical movement of the equipment or machine could integrate this component and other various aspects of the present invention to improve the safe operation of the equipment or machine.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a block diagram for a method of engaging a safety actuator apparatus <b>2</b>. This method begins by installing a safety actuator apparatus <b>100</b> such as those described in embodiments above. Once the safety actuator apparatus has been installed, an obstacle that is within a predetermined path or trajectory of movement of at least one component of a baling machine is detected <b>110</b>. As implementations described previously, the detection may be made by opto-electric sensors such as by non-limiting example, a light curtain or other devices such as safety laser scanners. After an obstacle is detected, a communication device signals the safety actuated retention component of the safety actuator apparatus <b>120</b>. In the present embodiment, the communication device <b>60</b> converts the signals from opto-electric sensors to one or more pneumatic actuators, as is well known in the art of light curtains. In the present embodiment, the safety actuated retention component then engages a piston of the pneumatic actuator <b>130</b> to extend two extension arms that restrain the movement of at least one component of a baling machine <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The communication device <b>60</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is one of many communication devices known to a person having skill in the art of opto-switches that enable opto-electric signal conversion to pneumatics or other signals. Low voltage switches, fiber optic links or other signal conversion communication devices are contemplated in the present invention.</p>
