<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention mainly assembles the rod core and cover assembling structure produced by heterogeneous insulating magnetic powder, in order to meet the advantage characteristics, including easy coiling, assembling and heating dissipation.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The large current assembling magnetic component used in market condition is mainly separated into the following two types:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0005">Type 1: As for rod core and cover integral magnetic component, top and bottom covers of iron insulating magnetic powder are used to assemble the finished product. As demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the rod core is built in top and bottom covers, so there is no separated rod core.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0006">Type 2: Concerning the magnetic component of separated rod core and cover, cover of iron or Fe&#x2014;Si insulating magnetic powder is used to be assembled with rod core of iron or Fe&#x2014;Si insulating magnetic powder, which is demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0007">However, there are several obvious disadvantages in the above two traditional magnetic components, which is demonstrated in the comparative table in Brief summary of the invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0008">Before describing the technology content of this invention, please allow us to define or explain the material or technology applied in this invention as follow:
<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0009">Rod core: The magnetic inductive material surrounded by coil in general magnetic component, which can be single individual or with components according to requirements, and there are different shape variations, such as T type and rod type.</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0010">Magnetic powder: Iron powder or alloy powder with magnetic characteristic. Resin obtained from market condition is used to perform surface insulation coating, to form magnetic powder with insulation characteristic on the surface. After that, it will form through pressing by cold-forming technology.</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0011">Coil: Coil mentioned in this invention is copper wire with insulation surface which coils and becomes coils in single or multiple turns, in order to carry current and generate external magnetic field.</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0012">Assembly: Assembly mentioned in this invention is to reserve holes, tenon, and location design for assembly of each component previously, and combine by mechanical or manual means. Common glue sold in market condition can be used for adhesion between each component, such as epoxy resin, silica gel, and instant glue.</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0013">Cold forming technology: Press the powder to form. Mechanical pressure is mainly used to form, and then the product is completed by annealing and sintering.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0029">As demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> of this invention, assembling magnetic component in this invention is mainly composed of top cover (<b>1</b>), bottom cover (<b>2</b>), rod core (<b>3</b>), and coil (<b>4</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0030">The basic shape of above-mentioned top cover (<b>1</b>) and bottom cover (<b>2</b>) is cup-like body. There is one through hole in the center (<b>11</b>), (<b>21</b>) and one rectangle hole on the side (<b>12</b>), (<b>22</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0031">The material of top cover (<b>1</b>) and bottom cover (<b>2</b>) is iron or Fe&#x2014;Si insulating magnetic powder. It forms after cold-forming technology. The width range of rectangle hole (<b>12</b>), (<b>22</b>) is 0.5 mm&#x2dc;10 mm, and the diameter of top cover (<b>1</b>) and bottom cover (<b>2</b>) is recommended to be 20 mm&#x2dc;120 mm. The wall thickness of top cover (<b>1</b>) and bottom cover (<b>2</b>) is recommended to be more than 1 mm. As for the above-mentioned size, the actual size will be in accordance with customer's electric property requirement. The main function of top cover (<b>1</b>) and bottom cover (<b>2</b>) is to be the medium of magnetic field path and provide the whole component environment protection.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0032">The basic shape of above-mentioned rod core (<b>3</b>) is solid cylinder, and the material is the insulating iron powder made by Fe&#x2014;Al&#x2014;Si powder. It forms after cold-forming technology. In this invention, 0.1%&#x2dc;10% copper powder is added into insulating magnetic powder. Copper powder is softer, so it effectively reduces friction of green part release and strengthens green tape strength. The cylinder's outer diameter is less than the inner diameter of through hole (<b>11</b>), (<b>21</b>) in the top cover (<b>1</b>), and bottom cover (<b>2</b>). The main function of rod core (<b>3</b>) is to provide inductive magnetic field, and the height (length) of rod core (<b>3</b>) product could be more than 52 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0033">The above-mentioned coil (<b>4</b>) mainly coils on rod core (<b>3</b>). Electrical connectors (<b>41</b>), (<b>42</b>) extend at two ends. After the assembling of top cover (<b>1</b>) and bottom cover (<b>2</b>), electrical connectors (<b>41</b>), (<b>42</b>) extend outward through rectangle hole (<b>12</b>), (<b>22</b>) in the cover's wall. The main function of coil is for the current flow from one of the electrical connectors (<b>41</b>) or (<b>42</b>), which produces external magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0034">The assembling is to set rod core (<b>3</b>) into coil (<b>4</b>), and then put two ends into the through hole (<b>11</b>), (<b>21</b>) of top cover (<b>1</b>) and bottom cover (<b>2</b>) separately. After top cover (<b>1</b>) and bottom cover (<b>2</b>) combine and electrical connectors (<b>41</b>), (<b>42</b>) extending from two ends of the coil (<b>4</b>) extend outward through rectangle hole (<b>12</b>), (<b>22</b>), glue is used to bind to top cover (<b>1</b>) and bottom cover (<b>2</b>) and assemble the assembling magnetic component of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0035">When rod core (<b>3</b>) is too long or coiling winding is considered, method demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> can be used when putting into practice. Coil is winded at insulating bobbin (<b>5</b>), which is assembled with rod core (<b>3</b>), top cover (<b>1</b>) and bottom cover (<b>2</b>) afterward.</p>

    <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0043">As demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, top cover (<b>1</b>) is still cup-like body, but bottom cover (<b>2</b>) is trapezoidal body (<b>2</b>B) with thick middle and thin outer edge.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0044">Please see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 14</figref> as the reference. The following are the main variations of through hole (<b>11</b>), (<b>21</b>) and rectangle hole (<b>12</b>), (<b>22</b>) in top cover (<b>1</b>) and bottom cover (<b>2</b>) of this invention:
<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0045">As demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, there are two holes in the cover. One is in the center in the cup-like cover.

However, too many holes will cause the emission of magnetic line and the reduction of AL, inductance rating.</li>
    <li id="ul0005-0005" num="0049">As demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, in addition to the through hole (<b>11</b>), (<b>21</b>) of rod core (<b>3</b>) at top cover (<b>1</b>) and bottom cover (<b>2</b>), coil through hole (<b>15</b>) of electrical connector (<b>41</b>), (<b>42</b>) is set next to through hole (<b>11</b>), (<b>21</b>).</li>

<p id="p-0033" num="0050">As for the function hole (<b>13</b>) and L-shape opening (<b>14</b>) of top cover (<b>1</b>) and bottom cover (<b>2</b>), the total hole length is asked to be less than &#x2153; diameter of through hole (<b>11</b>), (<b>21</b>) by this patent design.
