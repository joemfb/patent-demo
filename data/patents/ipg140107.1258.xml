<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates in particular to an item of equipment chosen from a furnace, a boiler, a superheater, a steam generator, a chemical reactor and a heat exchanger, intended in particular for the production of ethylene. In particular, it relates to means for providing or improving an end-to-end connection between a tube made of ceramic (in particular of silicon carbide) and a metal tube, with or without direct contact between the two tubes.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">STATE OF THE ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The production of ethylene results conventionally from a steam cracking operation starting from ethane or naphtha. To this end, an ethylene production unit <b>5</b>, as represented diagrammatically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, conventionally comprises a furnace <b>10</b> comprising a chamber <b>11</b> through which passes a bundle of tubes <b>12</b> and which is heated by at least one burner <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The tubes <b>12</b>, of circular cross section, exhibit an external diameter of between 50 and 250 mm and a wall with a thickness of between 5 and 25 mm. These tubes, bent into a pin, exhibit a length inside the chamber of the furnace of several meters. They are made of an alloy of iron, nickel and chromium.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to produce ethylene, feed means <b>14</b> feed an upstream end of the tubes <b>12</b> with a reactive mixture M of hydrocarbons and of steam, a temperature of greater than 1000&#xb0; C. being maintained in the chamber <b>11</b>. The flow rate of this mixture is adjusted so that the reactive mixture M can reach a temperature of greater than 750&#xb0; C. and can react to result in the production of ethylene.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The production of ethylene results in a deposition of coke on the internal surfaces of the tubes <b>12</b>, bringing about a fall in productivity.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In particular, it has been discovered that the nickel of the alloy forming the tubes catalyzes the production of coke. Researchers have thus envisaged replacing the metal tubes by nickel-free tubes, in particular ceramic tubes. The ceramic tubes have to be able to be connected to the remainder of the plant and in particular to metal tubes used to introduce the reactive mixture or to discharge the reaction products. Research studies have thus been carried out in order to find suitable connecting devices, in particular devices capable of withstanding the thermal cycles, typically with an amplitude of more than 700&#xb0; C., which result from the shutdowns of the furnaces.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In particular, the ceramic tubes and the metal tubes exhibit very different thermal expansion coefficients, typically of approximately 4&#xb7;10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>K<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and of approximately 18&#xb7;10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>K<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>respectively. In the applications targeted, the connections tested result in losses in leaktightness, indeed even in separation of the tubes.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, FR 2 645 941 describes a connecting device between a metal support and a ceramic tubular element in which a collar is attached to the support and surrounds the ceramic tube with a functional clearance. The leaktightness is obtained by a coke seal resulting from the operation of the production unit. However, this functional clearance results, at the startup of the production unit, in escapes of hydrocarbons.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, the connection is not mechanically reliable, in particular at ambient temperature. It is thus not suitable for an environment such as that of an ethylene production furnace.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, decoking cannot be carried out with steam but necessarily has to result from mechanical abrasion.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Finally, the connecting device described in FR 2 645 941 can only be applied in plants which generate coke.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">There thus exists a need for a novel connecting device, suitable in particular for the connection of a ceramic tube with a metal tube in an environment such as that of an ethylene production furnace, but without being limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">An object of the invention is thus to respond, at least partially, to this need.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">FIRST ASPECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to a first aspect of the invention, this aim is achieved by means of a device comprising a first part shrink fitted by means of a first shrink ring, the first shrink ring being itself shrink fitted by means of a second shrink ring exhibiting a lower thermal expansion coefficient than the thermal expansion coefficient of the first shrink ring, at least between 20&#xb0; C. and 1000&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">At ambient temperature, the shrink rings provide a reliable mechanical connection and good leaktightness. During a rise in the temperature, the second shrink ring expands less than the first shrink ring. It thus exerts, on the latter, a compressive force which prevents it from becoming detached from the first part or a loss in leaktightness between the first part and the first shrink ring.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As will be seen in more detail in the continuation of the description, when the first part is a ceramic tube, it thus becomes possible, by attaching a metal tube to the first shrink ring, to obtain a connection between the ceramic tube and the metal tube which is particularly reliable mechanically. This connection can advantageously be sufficiently leaktight, in particular for the targeted applications, not only at ambient temperature but also over a temperature range of several hundred degrees, typically of more than 700&#xb0; C., of more than 800&#xb0; C., indeed even of more than 900&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A device according to the invention can also comprise one or more of the following optional characteristics:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0018">The first part is made of a material exhibiting a thermal expansion coefficient of less than 10&#xb7;10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>K<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, of less than 8&#xb7;10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>K<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, of less than 6&#xb7;10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>K<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>or indeed even of less than 5&#xb7;10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>K<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, between 20&#xb0; C. and 1000&#xb0; C.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0019">The first part is made of a material exhibiting a modulus of elasticity (MOE) of greater than 150 GPa.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0020">The first part is made of a ceramic, carbide, nitride or oxide material capable of withstanding temperatures reaching 1400&#xb0; C., indeed even 1500&#xb0; C.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0021">The first part comprises a ceramic or vitroceramic material. This material can in particular be chosen from silicon carbide, alumina, mullite, silicon nitride, zirconia, cordierite, aluminum titanate and their mixtures.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0022">The amount by weight of silicon carbide in the material of the first part is greater than 80%, preferably greater than 90%. Preferably, said material is composed of silicon carbide. Silicon carbide exhibits properties which are of particular use in the application targeted. In particular, it makes it possible to limit the formation of coke and exhibits a high thermal conductivity, allowing efficient transfer of the heat from the furnace to the reactive mixture moving through the tubes. The energy efficiency is thus better than that obtained with a corresponding metal tube. Finally, silicon carbide, the maximum operating temperature of which is greater than 2000&#xb0; C., retains its mechanical properties, even at very high temperature. Advantageously, it thus becomes possible to increase the temperature inside the furnace and, simultaneously, to increase the flow rate of the mixture of reactants moving through the tubes. The productivity of the furnace can thus be considerably increased.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0023">The material of the first part exhibits a total porosity of less than 5%, preferably of less than 2%, indeed even of less than 1%. Advantageously, the permeability of the first part is thereby reduced.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0024">The first shrink ring comprises a metal. Preferably, the first shrink ring is composed of one or more metals. In one embodiment, it comprises a ferrous metal.</li>

        <li id="ul0002-0046" num="0063">The first part is a ceramic tube, preferably extending along a substantially vertical axis, and the second part is a metal tube. The ceramic tube can in particular exhibit a length of greater than 1 meter, of greater than 5 meters, indeed even of greater than 8 meters. The metal tube can in particular exhibit a rectilinear axis and a position coaxially in the extension of the ceramic tube.

    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0064">The first and second parts can have any conformation. However, at the connecting device, the dimensions of the second part must allow it to be attached to the first shrink ring, itself attached externally to the first part.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0065">In one embodiment in which the first and second parts are tubes exhibiting, over their entire length, including at the connecting device, an external diameter and a wall thickness which are substantially constant, this requirement thus results in a reduction in the passage cross section at the transition between the second part and the first part.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0066">This is why, preferably, the first and second parts are tubes (or bars) exhibiting, over their entire length, a constant external diameter except, as regards the second part, at the connecting device. In this embodiment, such as that represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the second part is thus a tube exhibiting a broadened axial end, for example in the form of a cylindrical skirt, the dimensions of which are adjusted in order for it to be able to be used for the attaching to the first shrink ring.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0067">The broadened axial end can be integral with the remainder of the tube. The practical preparation of a second part exhibiting such a conformation may, however, be problematic. In one embodiment, said broadened axial end is thus attached to a conventional tube (with a constant diameter over its entire length) in the form of a junction part. For example, a skirt exhibiting an internal diameter greater than the internal diameter of such a tube can be welded to one end of said tube.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0068">Advantageously, the passage cross section can thus be kept constant, whatever the axial position under consideration (upstream, downstream or in the connecting device).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0069">The use of a junction part is particularly effective when the second part is a solid bar.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0070">The above characteristics and those of the other aspects of the invention which are described below are advantageously incorporated together in one and the same device in order to obtain an optimal connection, although, in some cases, the advantages which result from these characteristics may be taken advantage of separately from the others, in different devices.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0071">The invention also relates to a process for joining a first part made of a material exhibiting a first thermal expansion coefficient and a second part made of a material exhibiting a second thermal expansion coefficient greater than said first thermal expansion coefficient, said process comprising the following stages:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0072">1) shrink fitting a first shrink ring to the first part;</li>
    <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0073">2) shrink fitting a second shrink ring to the first shrink ring, said second shrink ring being made of a material exhibiting a thermal expansion coefficient which is lower than the thermal expansion coefficient of the first shrink ring;</li>
    <li id="ul0003-0003" num="0074">3) independently of stage 1) or stage 2), preferably after stage 2), attaching the second part to the first shrink ring.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0075">Preferably, the first part, the second part, the first shrink ring and the second shrink ring are chosen so as to obtain, on conclusion of stage 3), a device in accordance with the invention, according to any one of its aspects.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0076">The invention also further relates to a process for adapting a shrink ring to an environment exhibiting a specific variability in temperature, for example with an amplitude of greater than 200&#xb0; C., of greater than 400&#xb0; C., of greater than 700&#xb0; C., indeed even of greater than 900&#xb0; C., said process consisting in modifying the composition of said shrink ring, in particular in modifying the content of niobium and/or of Dilver P1.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0077">The shrink ring can in particular exhibit one or more characteristics, possibly optional, of a second shrink ring according to any one of the aspects of the invention. The material of the shrink ring can in particular exhibit a content by weight of niobium and/or of Dilver P1 of greater than 80%, preferably of greater than 85%, and/or of less than 95%, preferably of less than 93%.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SECOND ASPECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0078">The fitting of a first shrink ring to a first part consists conventionally in axially aligning the first shrink ring, heated to high temperature, and a corresponding cylindrical portion of the first part and in then axially displacing the first shrink ring with respect to the first part in order to shrink fit the first shrink ring to the first part.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0079">The axial alignment of the first part and of the first shrink ring has to be sufficiently precise and the first part and the first shrink ring have to be given dimensions with the smallest possible tolerance.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0080">The physical proximity of the first shrink ring and of the first part during the fitting can result in the appearance of thermal shocks. In particular, the low clearance can result in rapid heat transfers, in particular in the case of contact between the first shrink ring and the first part, and especially when the first part exhibits a high thermal conductivity, for example because it is made of silicon carbide.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0081">These heat transfers can damage the first part. Furthermore, they can result in an expansion of the first part and in a contraction of the first shrink ring resulting in the first shrink ring being locked in position before it has been able to reach the desired definitive position.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0082">There thus exists a need for a shrink fitting process which makes it possible to at least partially solve this problem.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0083">One aim of the invention is to meet, at least partially, this need.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0084">According to a second aspect of the invention, this aim is achieved by coating the first part and/or the first shrink ring with a coating made of a material exhibiting a lower thermal conductivity than that of the material of the first part.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0085">This coating thus limits the heat exchanges between the first part and the first shrink ring and thus reduces the risk of thermal shock and of locking in an intermediate position, in particular in the event of contact during the fitting.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0086">Preferably, the coating material exhibits a thermal conductivity of less than 10 W.m.&#xb0; C. and, preferably, the ratio of the thermal conductivity of the material of the first part to the thermal conductivity of the coating material is greater than 10.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0087">The coating material is preferably a refractory material. In particular, the coating material can be chosen from zirconia, doped zirconia, cordierite, alumina, mullite, aluminum titanate, yttrium oxide, magnesium oxide, hafnium oxide or a mixture of these materials. A coating comprising more than 80% by weight of zirconia has proved to be particularly effective.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0088">The coating material might also be made of metal.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0089">The first part and/or the first shrink ring may or may not be a first part and/or a first shrink ring of a device according to one or more other aspects of the invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">THIRD, FOURTH AND FIFTH ASPECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0090">The inventors have found that, when a first shrink ring is fitted to the first part, material can migrate from the first shrink ring toward the first part. In particular, they have found that nickel from the first shrink ring can migrate toward the silicon carbide of the first part, resulting in regions of stresses in the first part, which can result in breakages during temperature changes.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0091">There thus exists a need for a device comprising a first shrink ring fitted to a first part and exhibiting an improved mechanical strength.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0092">Furthermore, when the first part is made of a material based on a silicon compound (that is to say, comprises more than 50% by weight of said silicon compound), in particular when the first part is made of silicon carbide, it may be difficult to make a coating made of a ceramic oxide adhere to the surface of the first part.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0093">This adhesion is particularly problematic when the material of the first part exhibits a total porosity of less than 5%.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0094">There thus exists a need for a process for coating a substrate based on a silicon compound by means of a coating comprising at least one ceramic oxide, this process making it possible to attach said coating in a reliable and lasting fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0095">An objective of the invention is to provide a technical solution for solving, at least partially, the abovementioned problems.</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0107">Alternatively again, according to a fifth aspect of the invention, this aim is achieved by means of a process for coating a substrate, in particular based on a silicon compound, for example based on SiC, on silicon nitride Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>or on SiAlON, by means of a coating comprising at least one ceramic oxide, said process comprising the following successive stages:

<p id="p-0051" num="0113">Stage c3) can be carried out like stage b1). However, in this process, advantageously, no heat treatment is necessary if, in stage b3), the application of the particles is carried out by thermal spraying. The process is advantageously simplified thereby.</p>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">EIGHTH ASPECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0068" num="0161">During their tests, the inventors also found that the joining of a ceramic tube to a metal tube by means of one or more shrink rings, as described according to the first aspect of the invention, can result in breakages in the ceramic tube.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0162">There thus exists a need for a solution which makes it possible to limit damage to a part made of ceramic material when it is shrink fitted by means of a first shrink ring.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0163">An objective of the invention is to meet this need.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0164">According to an eighth aspect of the invention, this objective is achieved by means of a device comprising a first part made of ceramic material shrink fitted by means of a first shrink ring, in which device the edges of the axial ends of the cylindrical portion of said first part and of the first shrink ring by which the first shrink ring has been fitted to the first part belong to one and the same transverse plane.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0165">In other words, the first shrink ring extends up to the edge of the cylindrical portion of said first part to which it has been fitted but without projecting axially therefrom. For the sake of clarity, it is said that the first shrink ring is fitted &#x201c;flush&#x201d; to the first part.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0166">In the case of an end-to-end joining of two tubes or of two bars, this type of fitting is novel, the search to firmly attach the tubes or bars to one another naturally prompting at least the first shrink ring to be fitted in overlapping fashion to these two tubes or bars. However, the inventors have found that a &#x201c;flush&#x201d; fitting very significantly limits the damage to the first part during the fitting of the first shrink ring.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0167">It is said that two edges &#x201c;belong to one and the same transverse plane&#x201d; when their axial offsetting is less than 1 mm. Preferably, according to the invention, this offsetting is less than 0.8 mm, preferably less than 0.5 mm, more preferably less than 0.3 mm, still preferably less than 0.1 mm. In the case where one or both of said edges is/are not included in a transverse plane, it is considered that the two edges &#x201c;belong to one and the same transverse plane&#x201d; when, whatever the point of an edge under consideration, the distance from the other edge is less than 1 mm, preferably less than 0.8 mm, preferably less than 0.5 mm, more preferably less than 0.3 mm, still preferably less than 0.1 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0168">The term &#x201c;transverse plane&#x201d; describes a plane perpendicular to the axis of the first shrink ring.</p>

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">NINTH ASPECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0078" num="0175">In one embodiment of a device according to the first aspect of the invention, the second part is attached to the first shrink ring by welding or brazing. This is because this type of connection is advantageously mechanically resistant and lasting. However, the inventors have found that, when the first part is made of ceramic material, it may break during the attaching of the second part.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0176">There thus exists a need for a solution which makes it possible to limit this risk of breakage.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0177">An objective of the invention is to meet this need.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0178">According to a ninth aspect of the invention, this objective is achieved by means of a device comprising a first part made of ceramic material shrink fitted by means of a first shrink ring and a second part attached to said first shrink ring, for example by a heating process, the region of junction between the first shrink ring and the second part being at any point separated by at least 1 mm from said first part. For example, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, this separation of at least 0.8 mm, indeed even of at least 1 mm, corresponds to the radial separation &#x3b4; between the external surface of the ceramic tube and the weld bead which makes it possible to bond the metal tube to the first shrink ring.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0179">As will be seen in more detail in the continuation of the description, the separation of the region of junction limits the interactions with the first part during the attaching of the second part to the first shrink ring. In particular, when the second part is welded or brazed to the first shrink ring, this separation reduces the heat gradients within the first part.</p>

<p id="p-0084" num="0189">In a particularly advantageous embodiment, the first shrink ring is not fitted flush to the first part but projects axially therefrom and the second part is attached to the projecting portion of the first shrink ring, preferably at the end of the first shrink ring opposite the end by which it has been slipped onto the first part.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0190">Advantageously, this embodiment does not require the provision of a flange, which simplifies the manufacture of the first shrink ring. In addition, it allows a minimal space requirement.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0191">Preferably, the optional second shrink ring is, however, fitted flush to the first part, that is to say that it extends up to the edge of the cylindrical part of said first part to which it has been fitted.</p>

<heading id="h-0015" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0114" num="0264"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> was described in the preamble of the description.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0265">Shrink fitting is a technique for the axial fitting of an external part to an internal part which makes use of the difference in dilatometric behavior between these two parts. The external part is conventionally referred to as &#x201c;shrink ring&#x201d;. The internal part is referred to as &#x201c;shrink fitted&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0266">More specifically, the shrink ring is made of a material exhibiting a greater thermal expansion coefficient than that of the internal part. As represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the shrink ring F exhibits an orifice O, delimited by an internal surface, the dimensions of which make it difficult, indeed even impossible, to fit it to the internal part P by hand or even, conventionally, using a press. When the shrink ring F is cylindrical with a circular transverse cross section, its internal diameter ID is thus less than the external diameter OD of the internal part P in the range of temperatures anticipated for the use of the joined components. In this range, the fitting of the shrink ring is thus impossible. For this, the shrink ring F has to be brought to a temperature greater than that of the internal part P. This difference in temperatures can be obtained by heating the shrink ring F and/or by cooling the internal part P, for example with liquid nitrogen or with dry ice. The difference in temperatures has to be determined in order for the dimensions of the orifice O of the shrink ring F to then allow it to be introduced over the internal part.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0267">Once the shrink ring F has been introduced over the internal part P, the combination is brought to the same temperature, for example to the starting ambient temperature, which results in the shrink ring F compressing the internal part and provides the cohesion between the shrink ring F and the internal part P. However, this cohesion may be challenged if the temperature of the surroundings of the joined components increases. This is because the shrink ring will then expand more rapidly than the internal part. An increase in the temperature may thus result in a loss of leaktightness, indeed even in an unintentional separation of the parts.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0268">In particular, under the conditions of variation in temperature of a furnace of an ethylene production unit, the inventors have found that joining a metal tube by shrink fitting to a ceramic tube is unsatisfactory. This is because the thermal expansion coefficients of the materials of these tubes are too different for the shrink fitting to be able to provide a reliable connection over a range of temperatures with an amplitude of more than 1000&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0269">U.S. Pat. No. 4,624,484 describes a connecting device which makes it possible to join a ceramic part by means of a shrink ring. Before fitting the shrink ring, a layer made of a nonferrous metal is applied to the internal surface of the shrink ring intended to be brought into contact with the ceramic part. After fitting, this layer deforms so as to compensate for the differences in expansion between the ceramic tube and the shrink ring. Such a layer, or generally a coating, are not shrink rings.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0270">The inventors then imagined providing the connection between the ceramic tube and the metal tube by means of several intermediate shrink rings exhibiting gradually increasing thermal expansion coefficients: a first shrink ring exhibiting a slightly greater thermal expansion coefficient than that of the ceramic tube was fitted to this ceramic tube, a second shrink ring exhibiting a slightly greater thermal expansion coefficient than that of the first shrink ring was fitted to this first shrink ring, this type of fitting being reproduced until a shrink ring is obtained exhibiting a thermal expansion coefficient similar to that of the metal tube. The metal tube was subsequently attached to this final shrink ring. However, tests have shown that, under the conditions of variation in temperature of a furnace of an ethylene production unit, this technical solution results in the application of high stresses to the ceramic tube and can result in the breaking thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0271">The inventors then devised and produced a connecting device of an entirely different design.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0272">In one embodiment, this connecting device comprises a first shrink ring fitted to the ceramic tube and a second shrink ring fitted to the first shrink ring, the second shrink ring exhibiting a lower thermal expansion coefficient than that of the first shrink ring. In the event of an increase in the temperature, the second shrink ring thus opposes the expansion of the first shrink ring and thus prevents a loss in leaktightness or a separation from the first shrink ring. In addition, this type of joining has proved to be particularly reliable under the conditions of an ethylene production furnace.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0273"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> represents an example of joining by means of a connecting device according to a preferred nonlimiting embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0274">For the sake of clarity, the tubes represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are regarded as positioned along a vertical axis V. Without implied limitation, the words &#x201c;top&#x201d;, &#x201c;bottom&#x201d;, &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and &#x201c;lower&#x201d; are used to describe members or member portions as a function of their position with respect to this axis.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0275"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> represents the lower portion <b>20</b> of a ceramic tube <b>22</b> with an axis X connected coaxially to the upper portion <b>24</b> of a metal tube <b>26</b> by means of a connecting device <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0276">The ceramic tube <b>22</b> and the metal tube <b>26</b> exhibit, except at the connecting device, identical annular transverse cross sections. The external diameter of the tubes <b>22</b> and <b>26</b> is preferably greater than 50 mm and/or less than 100 mm. The internal diameter of the tubes <b>22</b> and <b>26</b> is preferably greater than 40 mm and/or less than 50 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0277">The ceramic tube <b>22</b> is made of a nonoxide material, preferably of silicon carbide, and preferably exhibits a porosity of less than 1%, this porosity being closed.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0278">The lower portion <b>20</b> of the ceramic tube <b>22</b> is coated with a thermally insulating coating <b>32</b>, for example made of zirconia. The coating <b>32</b> extends along an annular surface intended to act as support for a first shrink ring which will be described below. It exhibits a thickness of approximately 30 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0279">Photographs show, at the interface between the silicon carbide of the ceramic tube <b>22</b> and the zirconia of the coating <b>32</b>, the presence of a transition layer with a substantially constant thickness of approximately 5 &#x3bc;m. The transition layer is composed of a silica layer continuously adherent to the ceramic tube <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0280">Except in its upper portion <b>24</b>, the metal tube <b>26</b> is a tube similar to the tubes used in the prior art upstream or downstream of the furnaces used for the production of ethylene.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0281">The upper portion <b>24</b> of the metal tube <b>26</b> comprises a wall <b>34</b>, the thickness of which gradually broadens until a maximum is reached in a transverse plane P<sub>1</sub>. In this plane, the metal tube <b>26</b> exhibits a flat annular surface <b>36</b>, on which will rest a lower edge <b>38</b> of the ceramic tube <b>22</b> and/or the lower edge of the first shrink ring described above, in the nonlimiting embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. A cylindrical peripheral skirt <b>40</b> with a circular cross section with an axis X extends upward from the periphery of the annular surface <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0282">The connecting device <b>30</b> comprises a first shrink ring <b>42</b> and a second shrink ring <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0283">The first shrink ring <b>42</b> is composed of a material exhibiting a thermal expansion coefficient of less than 25&#xb7;10<sup>6 </sup>K<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and greater than 10&#xb7;10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>K<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>between 20 and 1000&#xb0; C. and is preferably composed of the same material as the metal tube <b>26</b>, for example of HP40 steel or of an FeNiCr alloy. The use of the same material to manufacture the metal tube <b>26</b> and the first shrink ring <b>42</b> advantageously facilitates the welding thereof to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0284">The first shrink ring <b>42</b> exhibits a total length L<sub>42 </sub>of approximately 60 mm and a substantially constant wall thickness e<sub>42 </sub>preferably between 1 and 5 mm, preferably of approximately 2 mm. The actions of the second shrink ring on the first shrink ring and of the first shrink ring on the ceramic tube <b>22</b> are then optimal in the event of an increase in the temperature from 20&#xb0; C. to 900&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0285">In one embodiment, the first shrink ring <b>42</b> exhibits a substantially constant wall thickness e<sub>42 </sub>of greater than 3 mm, indeed even greater than 3.5 mm, indeed even substantially equal to 4 mm. This is because the inventors have discovered that the thickness of the first shrink ring modifies the quality of the leaktightness of the connection at ambient temperature, the best results having been obtained with a thickness e<sub>42 </sub>of approximately 4 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0286">The first shrink ring <b>42</b> exhibits the shape of a cylindrical sleeve <b>46</b> of circular cross section and with a length L<sub>46 </sub>of approximately 50 mm, which is extended upward by a flange <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0287">Over its entire length, the cylindrical sleeve <b>46</b> is in contact with the coating <b>32</b> of the ceramic tube <b>22</b> via a layer <b>50</b> of a compliant material which improves the leaktightness between the ceramic tube and the first shrink ring. The layer <b>50</b> exhibits a substantially constant thickness of approximately 30 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0288">The compliant material comprises, on the one hand, silver and/or gold and, on the other hand, palladium. The inventors have discovered that such a material is particularly reliable. In particular, this material exhibits a very good refractoriness and a very high melting point which render it compatible with the stresses encountered in a furnace of an ethylene production unit.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0289">For example, the compliant material comprises approximately 30% of palladium, the remainder being silver.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0290">The cylindrical sleeve <b>46</b> defines a lower edge <b>52</b> of the first shrink ring <b>42</b>. The lower edge <b>52</b> of the cylindrical sleeve <b>46</b> is coplanar with the lower edge <b>38</b> of the ceramic tube <b>22</b> and may be in contact with the annular surface <b>36</b>. This is because the inventors have discovered that this configuration limits the risks of breakage of the ceramic tube <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0291">The flange <b>48</b> results from a gradual opening out until the wall of the first shrink ring extends substantially perpendicular to the axis X. This gradual opening out limits the risks of breakage of the ceramic tube during the fitting of the first shrink ring <b>42</b> and facilitates the introduction of the ceramic tube <b>22</b> into the first shrink ring <b>22</b>. The flange <b>48</b> defines a circular &#x201c;upper edge&#x201d; <b>56</b> of the first shrink ring <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0292">The upper edge <b>58</b> of the peripheral skirt <b>40</b> is attached to the upper edge <b>56</b> of the flange <b>48</b> by means of a weld bead <b>60</b>. The radial separation <b>5</b> between the external surface <b>61</b> of the ceramic tube <b>22</b> and the weld bead <b>60</b> is, for example, approximately 5 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0293">The annular surface <b>36</b>, the peripheral skirt <b>40</b> and the first shrink ring <b>42</b> thus define a chamber <b>62</b>. The weld bead <b>60</b> is preferably continuous, so that the chamber <b>62</b> is substantially leaktight. Optionally, the chamber <b>62</b> is also isolated from the internal volume of the ceramic tube <b>22</b> and the metal tube <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0294">The internal volume of the chamber <b>62</b> is a few tens of cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably of more than 20 cm<sup>3</sup>, of more than 50 cm<sup>3</sup>, and/or preferably of less than 100 cm<sup>3</sup>, of less than 80 cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably of approximately 70 cm<sup>3</sup>. Advantageously, the optional accumulation of coke is thus limited.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0295">The second shrink ring <b>44</b> is composed of a material exhibiting a lower thermal expansion coefficient than that of the first shrink ring. The difference in the thermal expansion coefficients between the first shrink ring and the second shrink ring is determined as a function of the application. When the connecting device is intended to be subjected to variations in the temperatures such as those encountered inside the chamber of an ethylene production unit furnace or immediately upstream or downstream of such a chamber, the second shrink ring can in particular be made of an alloy comprising more than 70% of niobium and/or of Dilver P1. Such a niobium and/or Dilver P1 alloy advantageously exhibits a low thermal expansion coefficient, a low Young's modulus (modulus of elasticity) and a good resistance to heat and to corrosion at high temperature, it being possible for the latter to be further improved by the presence of a coating. For example, the material of the second shrink ring comprises 89% of niobium, 10% of hafnium and 1% of titanium. The resistance to corrosion can be further improved by coating the second shrink ring with a protective coating, or &#x201c;coating&#x201d; of the &#x201c;coating <b>32</b>&#x201d; type. The second shrink ring <b>44</b> exhibits the shape of a cylindrical sleeve of circular cross section and is fitted to the first shrink ring by shrink fitting via a layer <b>63</b> of compliant material, for example identical to that extending between the ceramic tube and the first shrink ring.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0296">The length L<sub>44 </sub>of the second shrink ring <b>44</b> is substantially identical to that of the cylindrical sleeve <b>46</b> of the first shrink ring <b>42</b>. The thickness e<sub>44 </sub>is between 3 and 15 mm, preferably between 5 and 13 mm. The action of the second shrink ring on the first shrink ring is then optimal in the event of an increase in the temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0297">Furthermore, the second shrink ring <b>44</b> is housed inside the chamber <b>62</b>. Advantageously, the second shrink ring is thus protected from the outside world. The peripheral skirt <b>40</b> thus acts as protective shield for the second shrink ring <b>44</b> but also for the first shrink ring <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0298">The lower edge <b>64</b> of the second shrink ring <b>44</b> is substantially coplanar with the lower edge <b>38</b> of the ceramic tube <b>22</b> and the lower edge <b>52</b> of the first shrink ring <b>42</b>. This is because this configuration has proved to be optimal in limiting the risk of breakage of the ceramic tube during the fitting of the second shrink ring.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0299">The upper edge <b>65</b> of the second shrink ring <b>26</b> is beveled toward the inside and toward the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0300">A connecting device such as that represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> can be produced in the following way:</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0301">The lower portion of the ceramic tube <b>22</b> is first covered with the insulating coating <b>32</b>. However, the adhesion of a coating made of ceramic oxide to a tube made of a nonoxide material is difficult, in particular when the nonoxide material is not or only slightly porous.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0302">In particular, conventional techniques for the direct spraying of very fine particles of said ceramic oxide by means of a plasma torch have proved to be ineffective in the case of spraying onto a first part made of nonoxide ceramic.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0303">However, the inventors have discovered several novel processes for coating a substrate based on a silicon compound by means of a coating comprising at least one ceramic oxide. In particular, they have discovered a process for coating a substrate based on a silicon compound by means of a coating comprising at least one ceramic oxide, comprising the following successive stages:

    <li id="ul0030-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0031" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0031-0001" num="0304">a1) application to said substrate, preferably at ambient temperature, of particles comprising, preferably composed of, said at least one ceramic oxide;</li>
        <li id="ul0031-0002" num="0305">b1) heat treatment of said substrate under conditions suitable for causing said at least one ceramic oxide to react with silicon of the substrate, so as to form silica.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0306">Preferably, the particles of said at least one ceramic oxide are applied directly to the substrate, without an intermediate layer. In particular, no intermediate layer of silicon or of silica is positioned on the substrate before stage a1). The thickness of the transition layer formed during stage b1) is then advantageously very low, typically of less than 10 &#x3bc;m, indeed even less than 8 &#x3bc;m or even of less than 6 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0307">In a preferred embodiment, a process according to the invention does not comprise a stage which makes it possible to form silica before stage a1).</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0308">In stage a1), all conventional techniques can be used to apply the particles. In particular, the particles of said ceramic oxide can be applied by spraying, painting or dipping. To this end, a slip is prepared and is applied to the substrate. The slip conventionally comprises a solvent, preferably water, an organic dispersant and said particles.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0309">Preferably, the slip does not comprise silica and preferably does not comprise a silicon compound. After firing, the silica will thus be present only in the transition layer, a coating devoid of silica being exposed to the outside world. The absence of silica may modify the permeability of the coating but, in the embodiment represented, this modification has no practical effect, the coating being itself covered with a layer made of compliant material and/or with a first shrink ring. In addition, the manufacturing process is simplified thereby.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0310">Application can be carried out at ambient temperature, for example in the open air. The amount of particles is adjusted according to the coating thickness desired.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0311">Preferably again, the process does not comprise any stage between stages a1) and b1).</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0312">In stage b1), the substrate is preferably subjected to firing at a temperature of between 1000&#xb0; C. and 1400&#xb0; C., preferably for a time of greater than 1 hour, for example under air.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0313">Surprisingly, the heat treatment results in the formation, in the substrate, of a transition layer in which a portion of the silicon compound has reacted to form a silica layer within the material of the substrate. Without being able to explain it theoretically, the inventors have found that the silica layer considerably improves the quality of the adhesion of the ceramic oxide.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0314">In a preferred embodiment, a process according to the invention comprises only stages a1) and b1). The silica of the transition layer thus results exclusively from the implementation of stage b1). The process is then particularly easy to carry out.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0315">The inventors have also developed alternative forms of this process.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0316">In particular, they have discovered a process for coating a substrate based on a silicon compound by means of a coating comprising at least one ceramic oxide, this process comprising the following successive stages:
<ul id="ul0032" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0032-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0033" list-style="none">

        <li id="ul0033-0003" num="0319">c2) heat treatment of said substrate under conditions suitable for causing said at least one ceramic oxide to react with said silica.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0320">In stage a2), the oxidative heat treatment can, for example, be carried out by heating the surface of the substrate at a temperature of 1250&#xb0; C. for 3 hours, for example under air, for example at atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0321">In one embodiment, only a portion of the substrate, in particular only its surface or only the section of its surface intended to receive the coating, is heated. For example, in the case of a ceramic tube, it is not always necessary to introduce all the tube into the furnace.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0322">Preferably, only a surface layer of the substrate is oxidized. More preferably, the substrate is oxidized only over a depth of less than 20 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0323">In stage b2), the particles of said at least one ceramic oxide can be applied as in stage a1).</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0324">In stage c2), the substrate is preferably subjected to firing at a temperature of between 1000&#xb0; C. and 1400&#xb0; C., preferably for a time of greater than 1 hour, for example under air.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0325">The inventors have also invented a process for coating a substrate based on a silicon compound by means of a coating comprising at least one ceramic oxide, this process comprising the following successive stages:
<ul id="ul0034" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0034-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0035" list-style="none">

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0329">In stage a3), a conventional plasma torch can be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0330">In stage b3), the particles of said at least one ceramic oxide can be applied as in stage a1).</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0331">Stage c3) can be carried out as in stage b1). However, in this process, advantageously no heat treatment is necessary if, in stage b3), the application of the particles is carried out by thermal spraying. The process is advantageously simplified thereby.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0332">It is possible to cause the coating <b>32</b> of zirconia to adhere to the substrate formed by the lower portion of the ceramic tube <b>22</b> by following one of the three processes which have just been described.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0333">Before installing the first shrink ring <b>42</b> on the first part, a layer of compliant material precursor is applied to the external surface of the lower portion <b>20</b> of the ceramic tube <b>22</b> and/or to the internal surface (intended to come into contact with the lower portion <b>20</b> of the first shrink ring <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0334">The compliant material precursor can be prepared in the form of a suspension in an organic solvent. This suspension is then applied, for example by spraying, painting or dipping. The solvent is then removed, for example by drying.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0335">The particle size distribution of the powder of the suspension and the amount and the nature of the solvent are adjusted according to the nature of the surfaces and the thickness of compliant material which are desired.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0336">The fitting of the first shrink ring <b>42</b> to the lower portion <b>20</b> of the ceramic tube <b>22</b> is subsequently carried out, preferably by expanding the first shrink ring by heating and by then introducing it axially, by its axial end provided with the flange <b>48</b>, over the ceramic tube <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0337">Preferably, the first shrink ring is fitted &#x201c;flush&#x201d; to the lower portion <b>20</b> of the ceramic tube <b>22</b>. In other words, it is immobilized in a position in which its lower edge <b>52</b> is aligned, in one and the same transverse plane, with the lower edge <b>38</b> of the ceramic tube. The inventors have found that this arrangement advantageously limits the risk of breakage of the ceramic tube.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0338">As explained above, silicon carbide is highly conducting thermally and any contact between the first shrink ring <b>42</b> and the ceramic tube <b>22</b> would result, in the absence of the coating <b>32</b>, in the sudden contraction in the first shrink ring, resulting in it becoming locked axially before it could reach the definitive position desired.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0339">The presence of the coating <b>32</b> limits the heat exchanges between the first shrink ring <b>42</b> and the ceramic tube <b>22</b>, in particular in the event of contact. This is because, during the introduction of the first shrink ring <b>42</b> over the ceramic tube <b>22</b>, the insulating coating advantageously forms a thermal barrier which limits transfers of heat between the first shrink ring <b>42</b> at high temperature and the thermally conducting ceramic tube <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0340">The term &#x201c;clearance&#x201d; J refers to the difference between the internal diameter of the first shrink ring <b>42</b> and the external diameter of the ceramic tube <b>22</b>. At the time of the introduction of the first shrink ring <b>42</b> over the ceramic tube <b>22</b>, the clearance J is positive and allows the fitting by shrink fitting of the first shrink ring to the ceramic tube <b>22</b>. By virtue of the presence of the coating, the clearance J can advantageously be considerably reduced and/or the temperature of the first shrink ring decreased, without the risk of untimely axial locking.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0341">The return to ambient temperature results in a greater contraction of the first shrink ring than that of the ceramic tube, which leads to a cancellation of the clearance J and then to a pressure of the first shrink ring on the ceramic tube <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Advantageously, this compression also attributes to the effectiveness of the compliant material. Before installing the second shrink ring <b>44</b> on the first shrink ring <b>42</b>, a layer of compliant material precursor is also applied to the external surface of the first shrink ring <b>42</b> and/or to the internal surface of the second shrink ring <b>44</b>, at least over the areas of these surfaces intended to be in contact after shrink fitting.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0342">The second shrink ring <b>44</b> can then be fitted to the first shrink ring <b>42</b> by a conventional shrink fitting (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The shape beveled toward the inside of the upper edge <b>65</b> of the second shrink ring <b>44</b> facilitates the shrink fitting to the first shrink ring.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0343">As for the fitting of the first shrink ring to the ceramic tube <b>22</b>, a coating which forms a thermal barrier can also be applied to the external surface of the first shrink ring in order to limit the clearance necessary during the shrink fitting operation. Preferably, the second shrink ring is fitted &#x201c;flush&#x201d; to the first shrink ring. In other words, it is immobilized in a position in which its lower edge <b>64</b> is aligned, in one and the same transverse plane P<sub>1</sub>, with the lower edge <b>52</b> of the first shrink ring. The inventors have found that this position advantageously limits the risk of breakage of the ceramic tube.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0344">The shape beveled towards the outside of the upper edge <b>65</b> of the second shrink ring <b>44</b> also advantageously limits the stresses applied to the ceramic tube <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0345">The ceramic tube <b>22</b> is subsequently brought closer coaxially to the metal tube <b>26</b> until it abuts against the annular surface <b>36</b>. As the first shrink ring <b>42</b> and the second shrink ring <b>44</b> are fitted flush with the lower edge <b>38</b> of the ceramic tube <b>22</b>, it is also possible for the support on the annular surface <b>36</b> to be achieved via the lower edge <b>52</b> of the first shrink ring <b>42</b> and/or the lower edge <b>64</b> of the second shrink ring.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0346">In this abutment position, as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the upper edge <b>58</b> of the peripheral skirt <b>40</b> faces the upper edge <b>56</b> of the flange <b>48</b>. These edges are then united by welding or brazing.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0347">The production of the weld bead <b>60</b> conventionally involves temperatures of approximately 1500&#xb0; C. Advantageously, the region of junction (weld bead <b>60</b>) between the upper edge <b>56</b> of the flange <b>48</b> and the upper edge <b>58</b> of the peripheral skirt <b>40</b> is at a distance from the external surface <b>61</b> of the ceramic tube <b>22</b>. Advantageously, the risk of a thermal shock capable of breaking the ceramic tube is limited thereby.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0348">In this position, the first shrink ring <b>42</b> and the metal tube <b>26</b> delimit the chamber <b>62</b>. The second shrink ring is positioned in the chamber <b>62</b>. Advantageously, it is thus protected from attacks, in particular physical attacks.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0349">Preferably, the weld bead <b>60</b> is substantially continuous, so that the chamber <b>62</b> is leaktight, thus also protecting the second shrink ring from chemical attacks.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0350">The ceramic tube <b>22</b> is then reliably attached to the metal tube <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0351"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> represents a device according to the invention according to an alternative form in which the first shrink ring <b>42</b> has the form of a sleeve which projects beyond the axial end of the ceramic tube <b>22</b>. The metal tube is attached to the free end of the first shrink ring <b>42</b> by means of a weld bead <b>60</b>, at a distance from the ceramic tube. The second shrink ring <b>44</b> is fitted flush to the ceramic tube <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0352">Alternative forms of the embodiment represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> are possible. For example, the metal tube <b>26</b> can be welded end-to-end with the first shrink ring <b>42</b>, the first shrink ring and the metal tube being in contact edgewise. The internal diameter and/or the external diameter of the first shrink ring <b>42</b> may be constant or variable along the axis X. The metal tube <b>26</b> can also be attached to the external surface of the first shrink ring <b>42</b>.</p>
