<p id="p-0003" num="0001">The present invention relates to a laser processing method and laser processing apparatus for processing an object to be processed by irradiating the object with a laser beam.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">Known as a conventional laser processing technique is one in which measurement means (a contact-type displacement meter, an ultrasonic rangefinder, or the like) for measuring the main surface height of the object to be processed is arranged in parallel with a condenser lens for converging a laser beam with a predetermined gap therebetween (see, for example, FIGS. 6 to 10 of Patent Document 1). In such a laser processing technique, while scanning the object with the laser beam along its main surface, the main surface height of the object is measured by the measurement means, and the condenser lens is driven along its optical axis such that the distance between the condenser lens and the main surface of the object becomes constant according to thus measured main surface at the time when the measurement point is positioned directly under the condenser lens.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">Known as a technique for processing an object to be processed whose main surface has irregularities, on the other hand, is one in which the planarity in the whole part to be processed is measured by planarity measuring means (a planarity meter comprising a projector and a reflected light receiver) as a preparation for processing, and the object is processed according to thus measured planarity (see, for example, Patent Document 2).

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0006">However, the following problem to be overcome exists in the above-mentioned laser processing apparatus disclosed in Patent Document 1. When the laser beam irradiation is started from a position on the outside of the object to be processed, so as to perform processing while the laser beam and the object are moved along the main surface of the latter, the measurement means proceeds with measurement from the outside of the object to the inside thereof. When the condenser lens is driven according to the measured value of main surface height obtained by this measurement, the converging point of the laser beam may deviate from its predetermined position in end parts of the object to be processed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0007">Though the planarity of the main surface of the object to be processed can accurately be grasped when the technique disclosed in Patent Document 2 is used, the same part must be scanned twice, i.e., before and during the actual processing, which takes time and lowers the processing efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0008">Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a laser processing method and laser processing apparatus which can efficiently perform laser processing while minimizing the deviation of the laser beam converging point in the end parts of the object.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Means for Solving Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0009">The inventors conducted various studies in order to overcome the above-mentioned problem. First, a processing method in which a first laser beam for processing and a second laser beam for measuring the displacement of a main surface of an object to be processed are emitted to the object on the same axis was studied. Details of this study will now be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10(A) to 10(C)</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(A)</figref> shows a processing preparatory phase in the case where a silicon wafer <b>800</b> secured to a dicing film <b>802</b> is processed with a laser beam emitted from a laser unit <b>804</b>. The laser unit <b>804</b> includes a condenser lens <b>804</b><i>a </i>for converging the laser beam onto the silicon wafer <b>800</b>, a lens holder <b>804</b><i>b </i>for holding the condenser lens <b>804</b><i>a</i>, and a piezoelectric actuator <b>804</b><i>c </i>which holds the lens holder <b>804</b><i>b </i>such that the latter can freely advance and retract with respect to the silicon wafer <b>800</b>. The laser processing apparatus including the laser unit <b>804</b> further comprises a laser light source and the like which are not described. In the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(A)</figref>, irradiation with a first laser beam <b>806</b> for processing and a second laser beam <b>808</b> for measuring the displacement of a main surface <b>800</b><i>b </i>of the silicon wafer <b>800</b> is started, while a stage (not depicted) mounting the silicon wafer <b>800</b> is moved such that the silicon wafer <b>800</b> shifts in the direction of arrow A. The silicon wafer <b>800</b> is to be processed with the first laser beam <b>806</b> at a position corresponding to a line to cut <b>800</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0011">As the silicon wafer <b>800</b> shifts in the direction of arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(A)</figref>, the optical axis of the first laser beam <b>806</b> and second laser beam <b>808</b> reaches a position where it intersects the silicon wafer <b>800</b>. The piezoelectric actuator <b>804</b><i>c </i>causes the lens holder <b>804</b><i>b </i>to advance/retract with respect to the silicon wafer <b>800</b> such that an astigmatism signal detected from reflected light of the second laser beam <b>808</b> becomes a predetermined value. Therefore, the piezoelectric actuator <b>804</b><i>c </i>retracts from the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(B)</figref>, so as to raise the lens holder <b>804</b><i>b </i>and condenser lens <b>804</b><i>a</i>. However, since the silicon wafer <b>800</b> keeps shifting in the direction of arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(A)</figref>, a time lag occurs until the lens holder <b>804</b><i>b </i>and condenser lens <b>804</b><i>a </i>rise to a predetermined position so that the converging point of the first laser beam <b>806</b> is positioned at the line to cut <b>800</b><i>a</i>. Also, the astigmatism signal may vary so much that the converging point of the first laser beam <b>806</b> fluctuates.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0012">Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(C)</figref>, a part other than the line to cut <b>800</b><i>a </i>is processed with the laser in an area B until the first laser beam <b>806</b> is in focus with the line to cut <b>800</b><i>a </i>so as to attain a stable state. For example, assuming that the silicon wafer <b>800</b> has a thickness of 100 &#x3bc;m, and that a time delay of 15 mS occurs, the length of the area B is theoretically 1.5 mm when the processing speed is 100 mm/S.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0013">Though <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10(A) to 10(C)</figref> relate to the silicon wafer <b>800</b> having an ideally high planarity, there may be a case where end parts are warped upward. An example of a silicon wafer having an end part warped upward will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11(A) to 11(C)</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(A)</figref> shows a processing preparatory phase in the case where a silicon wafer <b>810</b> secured to a dicing film <b>802</b> is processed with a laser beam emitted from a laser unit <b>804</b>. This laser unit <b>804</b> is the same as that explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10(A) to 10(C)</figref>. The silicon wafer <b>810</b> has an end part warped upward. A line to cut <b>810</b><i>a </i>in the silicon wafer <b>810</b> is set so as to be positioned equidistantly from a main surface <b>810</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0015">As the silicon wafer <b>810</b> shifts in the direction of arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(A)</figref>, the optical axis of the first laser beam <b>806</b> and second laser beam <b>808</b> reaches a position where it intersects the silicon wafer <b>810</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(B)</figref>. The piezoelectric actuator <b>804</b><i>c </i>causes the lens holder <b>804</b><i>b </i>to advance/retract with respect to the silicon wafer <b>810</b> such that an astigmatism signal detected from reflected light of the second laser beam <b>808</b> becomes a predetermined value. Therefore, the piezoelectric actuator <b>804</b><i>c </i>retracts from the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(B)</figref>, so as to raise the lens holder <b>804</b><i>b </i>and condenser lens <b>804</b><i>a</i>. However, since the silicon wafer <b>810</b> keeps shifting in the direction of arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(A)</figref>, a time lag occurs until the lens holder <b>804</b><i>b </i>and condenser lens <b>804</b><i>a </i>rise to a predetermined position so that the converging point of the first laser beam <b>806</b> is positioned at the line to cut <b>810</b><i>a</i>. Also, since an end part of the silicon wafer <b>810</b> is warped upward, the gap from the position of the dotted line C to the actual position of the main surface <b>810</b><i>b </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(B)</figref> causes an overshoot when the lens holder <b>804</b><i>b </i>and condenser lens <b>804</b><i>a </i>rise to the predetermined position.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0016">Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(C)</figref>, a part other than the line to cut <b>810</b><i>a </i>is processed with the laser in an area D until the first laser beam <b>806</b> is in focus with the line to cut <b>810</b><i>a </i>so as to attain a stable state. The length of the area D tends to be longer by the overshoot than the length of the area B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(C)</figref>. Hence, the inventors take notice of the processing in end parts of the object to be processed. The present invention is achieved according to these findings.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0017">The present invention provides a laser processing method for irradiating an object to be processed with a first laser beam while converging the first laser beam with a lens such that a converging point is positioned within the object, and forming a modified region within the object along a line to cut in the object; the method comprising a preparatory step of holding the lens at an initial position with respect to a main surface of the object, the initial position being set so that the converging point is located at a predetermined position within the object; a first processing step of emitting the first laser beam while holding the lens at the initial position, and moving the lens and the object relative to each other along the main surface so as to form the modified region in one end part of the line to cut; and a second processing step of releasing the lens from being held at the initial position after forming the modified region in the one end part, and then moving the lens and the object relative to each other along the main surface while adjusting a gap between the lens and the main surface so as to form the modified region.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0018">Since the modified region is formed in one end part of the line to cut while the lens is held at the initial position, the modified region can be formed while excluding the influence of fluctuations in the shape of end parts in the object as much as possible in the laser processing method of the present invention. After the modified region is formed in one end part of the line to cut, the lens is released from being held, and the modified region is formed in the remaining part while adjusting the lens position, whereby the modified region can be formed at a predetermined position within the object.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0019">It will be preferred in the laser processing method of the present invention if, in the second processing step, the first laser beam and a second laser beam for measuring a displacement of the main surface are converged by the lens onto the object on the same axis, and the lens is released from being held after the quantity of reflected light of the second laser beam reflected by the main surface exceeds a predetermined threshold. Since the first and second laser beams are converged by the lens so as to be emitted on the same axis, the converging point of the first laser beam can be prevented from deviating from a predetermined position within the object because of a vibration of a stage mounting the object, for example. The quantity of reflected light varies depending on the distance from the reflecting surface. Therefore, when a predetermined threshold is set to a value corresponding to the height of the main surface, and a location where the quantity of reflected light becomes the predetermined threshold is assumed to correspond to an outer edge of the main surface of the object to be processed, the lens can be released from being held.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0020">It will also be preferred in the laser processing method of the present invention if, in the second processing step, the first laser beam and a second laser beam for measuring a displacement of the main surface are converged by the lens onto the object on the same axis, and the lens is released from being held after an amount of change in the quantity of reflected light of the second laser beam reflected by the main surface becomes a maximum value. Since the first and second laser beams are converged by the lens so as to be emitted on the same axis, the converging point of the first laser beam can be prevented from deviating from a predetermined position within the object because of a vibration of a stage mounting the object, for example. Since the quantity of reflected light varies depending on the distance from the reflecting surface, the displacement of the main surface seems to be acute in the vicinity of the location where the amount of change in the quantity of reflected light becomes an extreme value. Therefore, assuming that this location corresponds to an outer edge of the main surface of the object to be processed, the lens can be released from being held.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0021">It will also be preferred if the laser processing method of the present invention further comprises a transition step of holding the lens so as to keep the lens from being driven toward the main surface after the second processing step. Since the lens is held so as not to be driven toward the main surface after forming the modified region, a smooth transition is possible when shifting to the processing of the next line to cut, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0022">It will also be preferred in the laser processing method of the present invention if, in the transition step, the first laser beam and a second laser beam for measuring a displacement of the main surface are converged by the lens onto the object on the same axis, and the lens is held so as to be kept from being driven after the quantity of reflected light of the second laser beam reflected by the main surface becomes smaller than a predetermined threshold. The quantity of reflected light varies depending on the distance from the reflecting surface. Therefore, when a predetermined threshold is set to a value corresponding to the height of the main surface, and a location where the quantity of reflected light becomes the predetermined threshold is assumed to correspond to an outer edge of the main surface of the object to be processed, the lens can be held so as to be kept from being driven.</p>

Since the quantity of reflected light varies depending on the distance from the reflecting surface, the displacement of the main surface seems to be acute in the vicinity of the location where the amount of change in the quantity of reflected light becomes a minimum value. Therefore, assuming that this location corresponds to an outer edge of the main surface of the object to be processed, the lens can be held so as to be kept from being driven.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0024">It will also be preferred in the laser processing method of the present invention if the line to cut includes first and second lines to cut; respective displacements of the main surface in unit time zones are successively stored in the second processing step of the first line to cut; the lens is held in the transition step of the first line to cut such that, with respect to the main surface, the lens is placed at a position based on the displacement stored in the unit time zone earlier by a predetermined number than the unit time zone where the lens is held so as to be kept from being driven in the transition step of the first line to cut; and the position where the lens is held in the transition step of the first line to cut is employed as the initial position in the preparatory step of the second line to cut. Since the position of the lens with respect to the main surface in the preparatory step of the next line to cut is set to the position based on the displacement stored in the unit time zone earlier by a predetermined number than the unit time zone corresponding to the time when the lens is held so as to be kept from being driven, the influence of fluctuations in the shape of end parts can be excluded as much as possible.</p>

Since the quantity of reflected light varies depending on the distance from the reflecting surface, the displacement of the main surface seems to be acute in the vicinity of the location where the amount of change in the quantity of reflected light becomes a minimum value. Therefore, assuming that this location corresponds to an outer edge of the main surface of the object to be processed, the lens can be held so as to be kept from being driven.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0032">It will also be preferred in the laser processing apparatus of the present invention if the line to cut includes first and second lines to cut, the apparatus further comprises displacement storage means for successively storing respective displacements of the main surface in unit time zones, and the control means sets a position based on the displacement stored in the unit time zone earlier by a predetermined number than the unit time zone where the lens is held so as to be kept from being driven in the first line to cut as the initial position in the second line to cut. Since the position of the lens with respect to the main surface in the preparatory step of the next line to cut is set to the position based on the displacement stored in the unit time zone earlier by a predetermined number than the unit time zone corresponding to the time when the lens is held so as to be kept from being driven, the influence of fluctuations in the shape of end parts can be excluded as much as possible.</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0046">The findings of the present invention can easily be understood in view of the following detailed descriptions with reference to the accompanying drawings, which are represented for the purpose of illustration only. Embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. When possible, parts identical to each other will be referred to with numerals identical to each other without repeating their overlapping explanations.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0047">The laser processing apparatus in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, this laser processing apparatus <b>1</b> is one which irradiates a planar object to be processed S mounted on a stage <b>2</b> (moving means) with a processing laser beam L<b>1</b> (first laser beam) such that a converging point P is positioned within the object S, so as to form a modified region R caused by multiphoton absorption within the object S. The stage <b>2</b> is movable upward/downward and leftward/rightward and rotatable, whereas a laser emitting apparatus <b>6</b> mainly constituted by a laser head unit <b>3</b>, an optical system main part <b>4</b>, and an objective lens unit <b>5</b> is disposed above the stage <b>2</b>. The laser processing apparatus <b>1</b> also comprises a control unit <b>7</b> (control means), which outputs control signals for controlling behaviors of the stage <b>2</b> and laser emitting apparatus <b>6</b> (the movement of stage <b>2</b>, emission of laser beams from the laser emitting apparatus <b>6</b>, etc.) thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0048">The laser head unit <b>3</b> is detachably attached to an upper end part of the optical system main part <b>4</b>. The laser head unit <b>3</b> includes an L-shaped cooling jacket <b>11</b>. Embedded in a vertical wall <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the cooling jacket <b>11</b> is a cooling pipe <b>12</b> in a winding state, through which cooling water circulates. Attached to the front face of the vertical wall <b>11</b><i>a </i>are a laser head <b>13</b> which emits the processing laser beam L<b>1</b> downward, and a shutter unit <b>14</b> for selectively opening and closing an optical path of the processing laser beam L<b>1</b> emitted from the laser head <b>13</b>. This can prevent the laser head <b>13</b> and shutter unit <b>14</b> from overheating. For example, the laser head <b>13</b> uses an Nd:YAG laser and emits a pulsed laser beam having a pulse width of 1 &#x3bc;s or shorter as the processing laser beam L<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0049">In the laser head unit <b>3</b>, an adjuster <b>15</b> for adjusting the inclination of the cooling jacket <b>11</b> and the like is attached to the lower face of a bottom wall <b>11</b><i>b </i>of the cooling jacket <b>11</b>. The adjuster <b>15</b> is used for aligning an optical axis a of the processing laser beam L<b>1</b> emitted from the laser head <b>13</b> with an axis &#x3b2; which is set in the optical system main part <b>4</b> and objective lens unit <b>5</b> such as to extend vertically. Namely, the laser head unit <b>3</b> is attached to the optical system main part <b>4</b> by way of the adjuster <b>15</b>. When the inclination of the cooling jacket <b>11</b> or the like is adjusted by the adjuster <b>15</b> thereafter, the inclination of the laser head <b>13</b> or the like is adjusted in conformity to the movement of the cooling jacket <b>11</b>. As a consequence, the processing laser beam L<b>1</b> advances into the optical system main part <b>4</b> while in a state where its optical axis a coincides with the axis &#x3b2;. The bottom wall <b>11</b><i>b </i>of the cooling jacket <b>11</b>, the adjuster <b>15</b>, and a housing <b>21</b> of the optical system main part <b>4</b> are formed with through holes through which the processing laser beam L<b>1</b> passes.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0050">On the axis &#x3b2; within the housing <b>21</b> of the optical system main part <b>4</b>, a beam expander <b>22</b> for enlarging the beam size of the processing laser beam L<b>1</b> emitted from the laser head <b>13</b>, an optical attenuator <b>23</b> for adjusting the output of the processing laser beam L<b>1</b>, an output observation optical system <b>24</b> for observing the output of the processing laser beam L<b>1</b> adjusted by the optical attenuator <b>23</b>, and a polarization adjusting optical system <b>25</b> for adjusting the polarization of the processing laser beam L<b>1</b> are arranged in this order from the upper side to the lower side. A beam damper <b>26</b> for absorbing the eliminated laser beam is attached to the optical attenuator <b>23</b>, and is connected to the cooling jacket <b>11</b> by way of a heat pipe <b>27</b>. This can prevent the beam damper <b>26</b> having absorbed the laser beam from overheating.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0051">For observing the object S mounted on the stage <b>2</b>, a light guide <b>28</b> for guiding an observation visible ray is attached to the housing <b>21</b> of the optical system main part <b>4</b>, whereas a CCD camera <b>29</b> is disposed within the housing <b>21</b>. The observation visible ray is guided by the light guide <b>28</b> into the housing <b>21</b>, successively passes through a field stop <b>31</b>, a reticle <b>32</b>, a dichroic mirror <b>33</b>, and the like, and then is reflected by a dichroic mirror <b>34</b> disposed on the axis &#x3b2;. The reflected observation visible ray advances downward on the axis &#x3b2; and irradiates the object S. On the other hand, the processing laser beam L<b>1</b> is transmitted through the dichroic mirror <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0052">The reflected light beam of the observation visible ray reflected by a surface S<b>1</b> of the object S advances upward on the axis <b>1</b>, and is reflected by the dichroic mirror <b>34</b>. The light beam reflected by the dichroic mirror <b>34</b> is further reflected by the dichroic mirror <b>33</b>, so as to pass through an imaging lens <b>35</b>, etc., thereby entering the CCD camera <b>29</b>. An image of the object S captured by the CCD camera <b>29</b> is displayed on a monitor (not depicted).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0053">The objective lens unit <b>5</b> is detachably attached to the lower end part of the optical system main part <b>4</b>. Since the objective lens unit <b>5</b> is positioned by a plurality of positioning pins with respect to the lower end part of the optical system main part <b>4</b>, the axis &#x3b2; set in the optical system main part <b>4</b> and the axis &#x3b2; set in the objective lens unit <b>5</b> can easily be aligned with each other. By way of an actuator <b>43</b> (holding means) using a piezoelectric device, a processing objective lens <b>42</b> is mounted to the lower end of the housing <b>41</b> of the objective lens unit <b>5</b> while in a state where the optical axis coincides with the axis &#x3b2;. The housing <b>21</b> of the optical system main part <b>4</b> and the housing <b>41</b> of the objective lens unit <b>5</b> are formed with through holes through which the processing laser beam L<b>1</b> passes. The peak power density of the processing laser beam L<b>1</b> converged by the processing objective lens <b>42</b> is at least 1&#xd7;10<sup>8 </sup>(W/cm<sup>2</sup>) at the converging point P.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0054">In order to position the converging point P of the processing laser beam L<b>1</b> at a predetermined depth from the surface S<b>1</b> of the object S, a laser diode <b>44</b> for emitting a rangefinding laser beam L<b>2</b> (second laser beam) and a light-receiving part <b>45</b> (light-receiving means) are disposed within the housing <b>41</b> of the objective lens unit <b>5</b>. The rangefinding laser beam L<b>2</b> is emitted from the laser diode <b>44</b>, and is successively reflected by a mirror <b>46</b> and a half mirror <b>47</b>, and then by a dichroic mirror <b>48</b> disposed on the axis &#x3b2;. The reflected rangefinding laser beam L<b>2</b> advances downward on the axis &#x3b2;, and passes through the processing objective lens <b>42</b>, thereby irradiating the surface S<b>1</b> of the object S. On the other hand, the processing laser beam L<b>1</b> passes through the dichroic mirror <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0055">The reflected light beam of the rangefinding laser beam L<b>2</b> reflected by the surface S<b>1</b> of the object S reenters the processing objective lens <b>42</b>, and advances upward on the axis &#x3b2;, so as to be reflected by the dichroic mirror <b>48</b>. The reflected light beam of the rangefinding laser beam L<b>2</b> reflected by the dichroic mirror <b>48</b> passes through the half mirror <b>47</b>, so as to enter the light-receiving part <b>45</b>, and is converged on a four-divided position detecting device (displacement acquiring means) in which a photodiode is equally divided into four. According to the converged image pattern of the reflected light beam of the rangefinding laser beam L<b>2</b> converged onto the four-divided position detecting device, it can be detected where the converging point of the rangefinding laser beam L<b>2</b> due to the processing objective lens <b>42</b> is positioned with respect to the surface S<b>1</b> of the object S. Information about the converged image pattern of the reflected light beam of the rangefinding laser beam L<b>2</b> converged on the four-divided position detecting device is outputted to the control unit <b>7</b>. According to this information, the control unit <b>7</b> outputs a control signal for indicating to the actuator <b>43</b> a position for holding the processing objective lens <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0056">Physically, the control unit <b>7</b> comprises an interface for exchanging signals with the stage <b>2</b> and laser emitting apparatus <b>6</b>, a CPU (central processing unit), and a storage device such as memory or HDD. According to a program stored in the storage device, the CPU performs a predetermined information processing operation and outputs results of the information processing as control signals to the stage <b>2</b> and laser emitting apparatus <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a functional configuration of the control unit <b>7</b>. Functionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the control unit <b>7</b> comprises a laser emission controller <b>701</b>, a stage movement controller <b>702</b>, an actuator controller <b>703</b>, a converging point calculator <b>704</b>, an end part determiner <b>705</b>, and a circular memory <b>706</b> (displacement storage means). The laser emission controller <b>701</b> is a part which outputs signals for controlling emissions of the processing laser beam L<b>1</b> and rangefinding laser beam L<b>2</b> to the laser head <b>13</b> of the laser head unit <b>3</b> and the laser diode <b>44</b> of the objective lens unit <b>5</b>, respectively. The stage movement controller <b>702</b> is a part which outputs a control signal for controlling the movement of the stage <b>2</b> thereto. The actuator controller <b>703</b> is a part which outputs a control signal for controlling the driving of the actuator <b>43</b> of the objective lens unit <b>5</b> to the actuator <b>43</b>. The actuator controller <b>703</b> is also a part which causes the circular memory <b>706</b> to store the amount of movement of the actuator <b>43</b>. The amount of movement varies according to the displacement of the main surface S<b>1</b> of the object, and thus can be taken as an amount indicative of the displacement of the main surface S<b>1</b>. The converging point calculator <b>704</b> is a part which calculates the distance between the object S and the converging point of the rangefinding laser beam L<b>2</b> according to an astigmatism signal outputted from the light-receiving part <b>45</b> of the objective lens unit <b>5</b>. The end part determiner <b>705</b> is a part which determines whether the processing objective lens <b>42</b> is at a position corresponding to an end part of the object S or not according to the quantity of light received by the light-receiving part <b>45</b>. The circular memory <b>706</b> is one which stores the amount of movement of the actuator <b>43</b>. The circular memory <b>706</b> comprises 64 channels of storage areas, and successively stores respective amounts of movement into the storage areas. Operations of the individual functional constituents will be explained later.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0058">An outline of a laser processing method carried out by thus configured laser processing apparatus <b>1</b> will now be explained. First, the object S is mounted on the stage <b>2</b>, and the stage <b>2</b> is moved such that the converging point P of the processing laser beam L<b>1</b> is positioned within the object S. The initial position of the stage <b>2</b> is determined by the thickness and refractive index of the object S, the numerical aperture of the processing objective lens <b>42</b>, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0059">Subsequently, the processing laser beam L<b>1</b> is emitted from the laser head <b>13</b>, the rangefinding laser beam L<b>2</b> is emitted from the laser diode <b>44</b>, and the stage <b>2</b> is moved such that the processing laser beam L<b>1</b> and rangefinding laser beam L<b>2</b> converged by the processing objective lens <b>42</b> scan a desirable line (line to cut) of the object S. Here, the light-receiving part <b>45</b> detects the reflected light beam of the rangefinding laser beam L<b>2</b>, and the control unit <b>7</b> controls the actuator <b>43</b> in a feedback fashion such that the converging point P of the processing laser beam L<b>1</b> is always positioned at a predetermined depth from the surface S<b>1</b> of the object S, whereby the position of the processing objective lens <b>42</b> is minutely adjusted along the axis &#x3b2;.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0060">Therefore, even when the surface S<b>1</b> of the object S wobbles, for example, a modified region R caused by multiphoton absorption can be formed at a position located at a predetermined depth from the surface S<b>1</b>. Forming the linear modified region R within the planar object S as such can generate a cleavage from the linear modified region R acting as a start point, whereby the object S can be cut easily with a high precision along the linear modified region R.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0061">The laser processing method using the laser processing apparatus <b>1</b> of this embodiment will be explained more specifically. The explanation of the laser processing method will also illustrate the movement of the laser processing apparatus <b>1</b>. The laser processing method in accordance with this embodiment can be divided into a preparatory step of setting an initial position of the processing objective lens <b>42</b> with respect to the wafer-like object S, and a processing step of emitting the processing laser beam L<b>1</b> so as to form a modified region. Each of the preparatory step and processing step will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0062">(Preparatory Step) First, the preparatory step of setting the initial position of the processing objective lens <b>42</b> with respect to the wafer-like object S will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a plan view of the object S. In the object S, n lines to cut C<sub>1 </sub>to C<sub>n </sub>are set and are successively subjected to laser processing. First, the height of the stage <b>2</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is adjusted such that, at a point Q<sub>1 </sub>on the first line to cut C<sub>1</sub>, the converging point is located at a predetermined position within the object S. Using thus adjusted height as the initial position, the stage <b>2</b> is moved such that the processing objective lens <b>42</b> is positioned at a point X<sub>1 </sub>on an extension of the line to cut C<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0064">More detailed explanations will be set forth with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4(A) to 4(C)</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4(A) to 4(C)</figref> are views showing the cross section II-II of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. For easier understanding, the hatching indicating the cross section is omitted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4(A) to 4(C)</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(A)</figref>, the object S is attracted and secured to the stage <b>2</b> by way of a dicing film <b>2</b><i>a</i>. The dicing film <b>2</b><i>a </i>is secured with a dicing ring (not depicted).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(A)</figref>, the stage <b>2</b> moves such that the processing objective lens <b>42</b> is placed at a position corresponding to the point Q<sub>1 </sub>on the line to cut C<sub>1 </sub>in the object S. The actuator <b>43</b> holding the processing objective lens <b>42</b> is in a state expanded by 25 &#x3bc;m from the most contracted state. This amount of expansion, i.e., 25 &#x3bc;m, is set as one half of the maximum amount of expansion of the actuator <b>43</b>, i.e., 50 &#x3bc;m. In this state, the stage <b>2</b> is moved up/down so that a reflected light beam of the observation visible ray is in focus. When a large error occurs as the stage <b>2</b> moves up and down, it will be preferred if the actuator <b>43</b> is moved to a desirable position while storing the astigmatism signal at this time, the actuator <b>43</b> is returned to the original position, the stage <b>2</b> is moved (roughly), and then the actuator <b>43</b> is minutely adjusted to a position corresponding to the stored astigmatism signal.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0066">Subsequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(B)</figref>, the stage <b>2</b> is further raised by a predetermined distance (hereinafter referred to as processing height) from the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(A)</figref>, such that the distance between the surface S<b>1</b> of the object S and the processing objective lens <b>42</b> is set shorter by the processing height than the distance in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(A)</figref>. Here, assuming that the focal point of the visible range and the converging point of the laser beam coincide with each other, the processing laser beam L<b>1</b> is converged at a position corresponding to the value of product of the processing height from the surface S<b>1</b> and the refractive index of the object S at the laser wavelength within the object S. When the object S is a silicon wafer having a refractive index of 3.6 (at a wavelength of 1.06 &#x3bc;m) and a processing height of 10 &#x3bc;m, for example, the processing laser beam L<b>1</b> is converged at a position of 3.6&#xd7;10=36 &#x3bc;m. An astigmatism signal is obtained from the reflected light beam of the rangefinding laser beam L<b>2</b> in the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(B)</figref>, and the value of this astigmatism signal is employed as a reference value.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0067">The stage <b>2</b> is moved as it is from the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(B)</figref>, and attains a wait state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(C)</figref> when the processing objective lens <b>42</b> reaches a point X<sub>1 </sub>on the extension of the line to cut C<sub>1</sub>. The position of the processing objective lens <b>42</b> with respect to the object S in the vertical direction shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4(B) and 4(C)</figref> is the initial position.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0068">Operations of the laser processing apparatus <b>1</b> in this preparatory step will be explained with reference to the flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The stage controller <b>702</b> of the control unit <b>7</b> outputs a control signal to the stage <b>2</b> such that the processing objective lens <b>42</b> moves to the point Q<sub>1 </sub>on the C<sub>1 </sub>(step S<b>01</b>). In response to the output of this control signal, the stage <b>2</b> moves. Further, the actuator controller <b>703</b> of the control unit <b>7</b> outputs a control signal to the actuator <b>43</b> so as to make the latter expand by 25 &#x3bc;m (step S<b>02</b>). In response to the output of this control signal, the actuator <b>43</b> expands by 25 &#x3bc;m. In this state, the stage <b>2</b> is moved up/down so that the observation visible ray is in focus therewith, and a focal position of the observation visible ray is set, whereby the processing objective lens <b>42</b> and the object S attain the state explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(A)</figref> (step S<b>03</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0069">The stage movement controller <b>702</b> of the control unit <b>7</b> outputs a control signal to the stage <b>2</b> so as to make the latter rise by a predetermined processing height (e.g., 10 &#x3bc;m) (step S<b>04</b>). In response to the output of this control signal, the stage rises by 10 &#x3bc;m, whereby the processing objective lens <b>42</b> and the object S attain the state explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(B)</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0070">The laser emission controller <b>701</b> of the control unit <b>7</b> outputs a control signal to the laser diode <b>44</b> so as to make the latter emit the rangefinding laser beam L<b>2</b> (step S<b>05</b>). In response to the output of this control signal, the laser diode <b>44</b> emits the rangefinding laser beam L<b>2</b>, whereas its reflected light beam reflected by the surface S<b>1</b> of the object S is received by the four-divided position detecting device in the light-receiving part <b>45</b>. In response to the light received, signals are outputted to the converging point calculator <b>704</b> and the end part determiner <b>705</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0071">The converging point calculator <b>704</b> holds the value of astigmatism signal in this state as a reference value (step S<b>06</b>). Subsequently, the stage movement controller <b>702</b> outputs a control signal to the stage <b>2</b> such that the processing objective lens <b>42</b> moves to a position corresponding to X<sub>1 </sub>on an extension of the line to cut C<sub>1 </sub>in the object S (step S<b>07</b>). The stage <b>2</b> moves in response to the output of this control signal. When the processing objective lens <b>42</b> reaches the position corresponding to X<sub>1 </sub>on the extension of the line to cut C<sub>1 </sub>in the object S, the stage movement controller <b>702</b> outputs a control signal to the stage <b>2</b> so as to make the latter stop moving (step S<b>08</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0072">(Processing Step) The processing step of emitting the processing laser beam L<b>1</b> and rangefinding laser beam L<b>2</b> will now be explained.</p>

For easier understanding, the hatching indicating the cross section is omitted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(A) to 6(C)</figref>. Subsequent to the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(C)</figref>, FIG. <b>6</b>(A) shows a state where the processing objective lens <b>42</b> has started forming a modified region on the line to cut C<sub>1</sub>. The actuator <b>43</b> is fixed at the amount of expansion set in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(C)</figref>. The processing laser beam L<b>1</b> and rangefinding laser beam L<b>2</b> are emitted before the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(A)</figref> after the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(C)</figref>. The stage <b>2</b> moves such that the processing objective lens <b>42</b> shifts in the direction of arrow E in the drawing.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0074">The rangefinding laser beam L<b>2</b> is reflected less by the dicing film <b>2</b><i>a </i>so that the total quantity of light reflected thereby is smaller, whereas the total quantity of reflected light increases in the object S. Namely, the total quantity of reflected light beam of the rangefinding laser beam L<b>2</b> detected by the four-divided position detecting device in the light-receiving part <b>45</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) increases, whereby it can be determined that the processing objective lens <b>42</b> is located at the position intersecting the line to cut C<sub>1 </sub>in the object S when the total quantity of reflected light beam exceeds a predetermined threshold. Therefore, when the total light quantity detected by the four-divided position detecting device in the light-receiving part <b>45</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is greater than the predetermined threshold, the processing objective lens <b>42</b> is assumed to be located at one end of the line to cut C<sub>1 </sub>(in the state corresponding to FIG. <b>6</b>(A)), the expansion amount of the actuator <b>43</b> at this time is released from being held, and the expansion amount control of the actuator <b>43</b> is started such that the astigmatism signal becomes the reference value held at step S<b>06</b> at predetermined intervals (e.g., at individual sampling points). Hence, when the processing objective lens moves in the direction of arrow E in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(A)</figref>, the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(B)</figref> is attained. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(B)</figref>, a modified region R is formed by a predetermined processing height in area F (one end part). After the modified region R is formed by a predetermined processing height in this area F, the processing objective lens <b>42</b> moves along the line to cut C<sub>1</sub>, and forms the modified region R with the processing laser beam L<b>1</b>. During this period, the actuator <b>43</b> is adjusted such that the astigmatism signal obtained from the reflected light beam of the rangefinding laser beam L<b>2</b> becomes the above-mentioned reference value.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0075">When the processing objective lens <b>42</b> further moves in the direction of arrow E in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(A)</figref> from the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(B)</figref>, the processing objective lens <b>42</b> is located at the other end of the line to cut C<sub>1 </sub>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(C)</figref>. When the processing objective lens <b>42</b> reaches a position outside of the object S, a state opposite to that explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(A)</figref> is attained, whereby the total quantity of the reflected light beam of the rangefinding laser beam L<b>2</b> detected by the four-divided position detecting device in the light-receiving part <b>45</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) decreases. Therefore, when the total quantity of light detected by the four-divided position detecting device in the light-receiving part <b>45</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) becomes smaller than a predetermined threshold, the processing objective lens <b>42</b> is assumed to be located at a position corresponding to one end of the line to cut C<sub>1 </sub>(in the state corresponding to FIG. <b>6</b>(C)), and the amount of expansion of the actuator at this time is held. While keeping the amount of expansion of the actuator <b>43</b>, the stage <b>2</b> is moved such that the processing objective lens <b>42</b> reaches the position of X<sub>2 </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(C)</figref>, so as to be ready for the processing of the next line to cut C<sub>2 </sub>(transition step).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0076">Though the processing objective lens <b>42</b> having reached a position corresponding to one end of the line to cut C<sub>1 </sub>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(A)</figref>) is detected according to the fact that the total light quantity detected by the four-divided position detecting device in the light-receiving part <b>45</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) exceeds a predetermined threshold in the foregoing explanation, this is not restrictive, whereby other criteria may also be employed. An example of such criteria will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7(A) and 7(B)</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(A)</figref>, whose ordinate and abscissa indicate the total light quantity detected by the four-divided position detecting device of the light-receiving part <b>45</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and time, respectively, is a chart recording the change in the total light quantity detected by the four-divided position detecting device of the light-receiving part <b>45</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in the states of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(A) and 6(B)</figref>. In this case, as mentioned above, it is determined that the processing objective lens <b>42</b> is located at a position corresponding to one end of the line to cut C<sub>1 </sub>at the time when the light quantity exceeds a predetermined threshold T<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0077">From the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(A)</figref>, at predetermined intervals (e.g., at individual sampling points), the amount of change in difference obtained by subtracting the previous total light quantity value from the current total light quantity value is calculated. Thus obtained values are plotted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(B)</figref> whose ordinate and abscissa indicate the amount of change and time, respectively. In this case, a part exhibiting a positive peak seems to be a point where the change in the total light quantity is the largest, i.e., a part corresponding to the vicinity of the center of an edge (outer edge) of the object S. Therefore, the tracking of the actuator <b>43</b> can be started after the differential peak shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(B)</figref> stops changing after the total light quantity shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(A)</figref> becomes the threshold T<sub>1</sub>.</p>

An example of such criteria will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8(A) and 8(B)</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(A)</figref>, whose ordinate and abscissa indicate the total light quantity detected by the four-divided position detecting device of the light-receiving part <b>45</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and time, respectively, is a chart recording the change in the total light quantity detected by the four-divided position detecting device of the light-receiving part <b>45</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in the states of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(B) and 6(C)</figref>.

In this case, a part exhibiting a negative peak seems to be a point where the change in the total light quantity is the largest, i.e., a part corresponding to the vicinity of the center of an edge (outer edge) of the object S. Therefore, the amount of expansion/contraction of the actuator <b>43</b> can be fixed at that corresponding to this part.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0080">The amount of expansion/contraction of the actuator <b>43</b> is stored in the circular memory <b>706</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) during period G (in the case where the amount of expansion/contraction of the actuator <b>43</b> is fixed at the time when the total light quantity becomes smaller than the threshold T<sub>2</sub>) or period H (in the case where the amount of expansion/contraction of the actuator <b>43</b> is fixed at the time when the amount of change in the total light quantity attains a negative peak) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(A)</figref>. Since the circular memory comprises 64 channels, an average value of the amounts of expansion/contraction of the actuator <b>43</b> stored in the first 5 channels of the memory may be determined, for example, and the amount of expansion/contraction of the actuator <b>43</b> may be fixed so as to become thus determined average value. In this case, the actuator <b>43</b> is fixed at a position corresponding to the main surface height of the object corresponding to the initial quarter of the period G or H in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(A)</figref>, which is more suitably set as the initial position for the next line to cut C<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0081">Operations of the laser processing apparatus <b>1</b> in this processing step will be explained with reference to the flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.

<p id="p-0082" num="0082">The laser emission controller <b>701</b> of the control unit <b>7</b> outputs control signals to the laser head <b>13</b> and laser diode <b>44</b> so as to make them emit the processing laser beam L<b>1</b> and the rangefinding laser beam L<b>2</b>, respectively (step S<b>11</b>). In response to the output of the control signals, the processing laser beam L<b>1</b> and the rangefinding laser beam L<b>2</b> are emitted.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0083">The stage controller <b>702</b> of the control unit <b>7</b> outputs a control signal to the stage <b>2</b> so as to move the processing objective lens <b>42</b> in the direction of arrow E in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(A)</figref> (step S<b>12</b>). In response to the output of this control signal, the stage <b>2</b> starts moving.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0084">According to the signal outputted from the light-receiving part <b>45</b>, the end part determiner <b>705</b> of the control unit <b>7</b> determines whether the processing objective lens <b>42</b> is located at an end part of the object S or not (step S<b>13</b>). When it is determined that the processing objective lens <b>42</b> is located at an end part of the object S, the end part determiner <b>705</b> outputs an instruction signal to the actuator controller <b>703</b> so as to make the latter start the expansion/contraction of the actuator <b>43</b> such that the astigmatism signal equals the held reference value. The actuator controller <b>703</b> outputs the control signal to the actuator <b>43</b> so as to make the latter start expanding/contracting in order for the astigmatism signal to equal the held reference value (step S<b>14</b>). In response to the output of this control signal, the actuator <b>43</b> expands/contracts according to the displacement of the surface S<b>1</b> of the object S, and holds the processing objective lens <b>42</b> such that the converging point of the rangefinding laser beam L<b>2</b> is located at the reference position. Therefore, the modified region R is formed at a position corresponding to the displacement of the surface S<b>1</b> of the object S (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(B)</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0085">According to the signal outputted from the light-receiving part <b>45</b>, the end part determiner <b>705</b> determines whether the processing objective lens <b>42</b> is located at the other end part of the object S or not (step S<b>15</b>).

In response to the output of this instruction signal, the actuator controller <b>703</b> outputs a control signal to the actuator <b>43</b> so as to make the latter stop expanding/contracting and attain a held state (step S<b>16</b>). In response to the output of this control signal, the actuator <b>43</b> stops expanding/contracting. When the processing objective lens <b>42</b> is located at the point X<sub>2 </sub>on an extension of the line to cut C<sub>1</sub>, the stage movement controller <b>702</b> outputs a control signal to the stage <b>2</b> so as to make the latter stop moving (step S<b>17</b>).

<p id="p-0086" num="0086">The above-mentioned preparatory step and processing step are performed for all the lines to cut C<sub>1 </sub>to C<sub>n </sub>in the object S, whereby respective modified regions R are formed along the lines to cut C<sub>1 </sub>to C<sub>n</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0087">Since this embodiment starts laser processing by emitting the processing laser beam L<b>1</b> while holding the processing objective lens <b>42</b> at the initial position, the influence of fluctuations in the shape of end parts in the object S can be excluded as much as possible.</p>

<p id="p-0089" num="0089">After forming the modified region, the processing objective lens <b>42</b> is held so as to be kept from being driven toward the main surface S<b>1</b> of the object S, whereby a smooth transition is possible when shifting to the processing of the next line to cut.</p>
