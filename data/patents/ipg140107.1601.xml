<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method of turning the surface of a die, which is used to make a part to put into the lens barrel of a camera, for example, into an antireflective roughened one.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A camera such as a still camera or a camcorder receives external light, produces a subject image using an optical system inside its lens barrel, and then projects the subject image onto an image capturing member such as a photosensitive film or an image capture device. In this case, only the subject image that has been produced by the optical system is preferably incident on the image capturing member. Actually, however, there is also other light that has been reflected from inside the lens barrel before impinging on the image capturing member. Such unnecessary reflected light will be superposed as &#x201c;flare&#x201d; on the subject image. It is preferred that no flare be produced unless it is used as a sort of special video effect.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To eliminate such flare as much as possible, a part with an antireflective roughened surface is usually arranged inside the lens barrel. As used herein, the &#x201c;roughened surface&#x201d; refers to an object surface with a leather pattern, a sand pattern, a sprinkled lacquer pattern, a geometric pattern or any other form of regular or irregular roughness.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Inside the lens barrel, there may be a resin molded part, which often has such a roughened surface. And the surface of a die to make such a part is roughened in advance. Hereinafter, a conventional method for roughening the surface of a die will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 through 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates the shape of an abrasive grain <b>5</b> for use in the conventional surface roughening method. The abrasive grain <b>5</b> is used in sandblasting and has a size d, which may be approximately 0.01 mm to 2 mm. The abrasive grain <b>5</b> is made of aluminum oxide, for example.</p>

<p id="p-0010" num="0009">When abrasive grains <b>5</b> are repelled by compressed air, for example, to collide against the surface of the die <b>6</b>, mountains <b>6</b><i>a </i>and valleys <b>6</b><i>b </i>are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional view illustrating the surface of a resin molded product <b>7</b> that has been molded using the die <b>6</b> and its surrounding portions. The valleys <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the molded product <b>7</b> have been formed by transferring the mountains <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the die <b>6</b>, while the mountains <b>7</b><i>b </i>of the molded product <b>7</b> have been formed by transferring the valleys <b>6</b><i>b </i>of the die <b>6</b>. And these valleys <b>7</b><i>a </i>and mountains <b>7</b><i>b </i>form the roughened surface of the molded product <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-Open Publication No. 2-60045 discloses a technique for forming a finely roughened surface around the periphery of a rearview mirror for cars by making superfine particles collide against the periphery by known blasting process. As a result, it says, in a rearview mirror for cars, unwanted reflection of the light that has come from the periphery and impinged on the mirror surface will be minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to the conventional method of roughing the surface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 9</figref>, the abrasive grains <b>5</b> easily collide against the mountains <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the die <b>6</b>, thus forming a complex shape on the surface as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. On the other hand, the abrasive grains <b>5</b> do not collide against the valleys <b>6</b><i>b </i>easily and will rarely form a complex shape there. If a resin molding process is carried out using such a die, the mountains <b>7</b><i>b </i>of the molded product <b>7</b> will reflect the relatively smooth shape of the valleys <b>6</b><i>b </i>of the die <b>6</b>, and therefore, will have a relatively smooth surface, too. In that case, the mountains <b>7</b><i>b </i>of the molded product that are located at the uppermost surface thereof will reflect the incoming light easily.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">That is why even if the resin molded part inside the barrel is shaped by such a conventional surface roughening method, the incoming light will still be reflected significantly. Thus, when such a resin molded product is used as a part inside the lens barrel, flare will be produced. Also, if a non-reflective surface is required from optical design considerations, the surface of a molded product is sprayed with a special antireflective paint. However, it is expensive and interferes with realizing an inexpensive product to spray the surface with such a special paint.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method of making an antireflective roughened surface, which will hardly reflect incoming light at any of various angles of incidence and which will rarely produce flare or any other optical problem.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A method according to the present invention is a method of turning the surface of a die, which is used to make a product, into an antireflective roughened one. The method includes the steps of: a) producing a first roughness on the surface of the die; and b) producing a second roughness which is smaller than the first roughness, on the surface of the die on which the first roughness has already been produced.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one preferred embodiment, the step a) may include producing the first roughness by performing a first blasting process using abrasive grains of a first size, and the step b) may include producing the second roughness by performing a second blasting process using abrasive grains of a second size that is smaller than the first size.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In another preferred embodiment, the step a) may include producing the first roughness on the surface of the die by performing a first blasting process that roughens an unused smooth die surface to a 10-point average roughness of A &#x3bc;m, and the step b) may include producing the second roughness on the surface of the die, on which the first roughness has already been produced, by performing a second blasting process that roughens an unused smooth die surface to a 10-point average roughness of B &#x3bc;m, where B&#x2266;A/2 is satisfied.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In this particular preferred embodiment, A may be in the range of 8 &#x3bc;m to 30 &#x3bc;m and B may be in the range of 2 &#x3bc;m to 6 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an alternative preferred embodiment, the method may further include the step of producing a third roughness on the surface of the die, on which the second roughness has already been produced, by performing a third blasting process that roughens an unused smooth die surface to a 10-point average roughness of C &#x3bc;m, where C&#x2266;B/2 is satisfied.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a specific preferred embodiment, A&#x2267;8 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In still another preferred embodiment, the first size of the abrasive grains may be in the range of 0.4 mm to 1.6 mm, and the second size of the abrasive grains may be equal to or smaller than 0.3 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In yet another preferred embodiment, the abrasive grains of the first and second sizes may have a rugged surface shape.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In yet another preferred embodiment, the abrasive grains of the first and second sizes may include alumina grains.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In yet another preferred embodiment, the step a) may include producing the first roughness by such a process that roughens an unused smooth die surface to a 10-point average roughness of A &#x3bc;m, and the step b) may include producing the second roughness on the surface of the die, on which the first roughness has already been produced, by such a process that roughens an unused smooth die surface to a 10-point average roughness of B &#x3bc;m, where B&#x2266;A/2 is satisfied.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In yet another preferred embodiment, the method may further include the step of producing a third roughness on the surface of the die, on which the second roughness has already been produced, by such a process that roughens an unused smooth die surface to a 10-point average roughness of C &#x3bc;m, where C&#x2266;B/2 is satisfied.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">An antireflective part according to the present invention has been obtained as a resin molded product using the die, the surface of the die having been roughened by a method according to any of the preferred embodiments of the present invention described above.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one preferred embodiment, the surface of the antireflective part may have both a first roughness and a second roughness, the second roughness being smaller than the first roughness.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A lens barrel according to the present invention includes the antireflective part of the present invention inside.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">An image capture device according to the present invention includes the lens barrel of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to the surface roughening method of the present invention, after a first roughness has been produced on the surface of a die, a second roughness, which is smaller than the first roughness, is further produced on the surface of the die on which the first roughness has already been produced. On the surface of the die thus obtained, the second roughness is distributed uniformly inside the first roughness. As a result, the surface of a product to be obtained by transferring such a surface of the die can be an antireflective, uniformly roughened one.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">And by arranging such a product inside a lens barrel, for example, the reflection of incoming light can be minimized, and flare or any other optical problem will rarely occur, no matter at what angle the light has been incident. That is why there is no need to spay an expensive antireflective paint anymore.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Hereinafter, a preferred embodiment of a method of making an antireflective roughened surface (which will be simply referred to herein as a &#x201c;roughened surface&#x201d;) according to the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. A preferred embodiment of a lens barrel including a resin molded part that has been made with a die obtained by such a method and a preferred embodiment of an image capture device with such a lens barrel will also be described.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">(Embodiment 1)</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A First Specific Preferred Embodiment of the present invention to be described below is a method of making a roughened surface by performing different modes of blasting on the same die a number of times compliant with a predetermined standard. As used herein, the &#x201c;different modes of blasting&#x201d; means that the blasting is carried out in multiple steps using abrasive grains of different sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">For example, when the blasting is carried out for the first time, a first roughness may be produced using abrasive grains of the biggest size. Next, when the blasting is carried out for the second time, a second roughness may be produced on the first roughness using abrasive grains that are smaller in size than the ones used for the first time around. And if the blasting is further carried out for the third time and on, a third roughness will be produced thereon using even smaller abrasive grains than the ones used last time.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">On the surface of the die thus obtained, the second roughness is distributed uniformly inside the first roughness. Specifically, the second roughness is also produced on the valleys of the die surface with the first roughness. As a result, on the mountains of the surface of a product to be obtained by using such a die, the second roughness will be distributed uniformly.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Optionally, multiple different degrees of roughness may be produced on the same surface one after another by non-blasting process so that the first roughness that has been produced earlier than any other one is the roughest and the degree of roughness will decrease sequentially after that as will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The blasting process may be carried out with a known system, and the description thereof will be omitted herein.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates abrasive grains <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> for use to make a roughened surface according to this preferred embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The abrasive grain <b>1</b> is used to perform the blasting process for the first time (which will be referred to herein as the &#x201c;first blasting process&#x201d;) and has a size d<b>1</b> of 0.4 mm to 1.6 mm. Alternatively, the size d<b>1</b> of the abrasive grain <b>1</b> may be an abrasive grain size F<b>22</b> to F<b>40</b> according to the JIS (Japanese Industrial Standards) R6001.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">On the other hand, the abrasive grain <b>2</b> is used to perform the blasting process for the second time (which will be referred to herein as the &#x201c;second blasting process&#x201d;) and has a size d<b>2</b> of 0.3 mm or less. Alternatively, the size d<b>2</b> of the abrasive grain <b>2</b> may be an abrasive grain size F<b>100</b> to F<b>220</b> according to the JIS R6001 standard.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Both of these abrasive grains <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> have a rugged surface as can be seen easily from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and may be made of a material including alumina, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional view of a die on which the first blasting process is being performed according to this preferred embodiment. The die <b>3</b> may be used to make a resin molded product, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The abrasive grains <b>1</b> are used to perform the first blasting process. In this process, the abrasive grains <b>1</b> that have been blasted off collide against the surface of the die <b>1</b> that was initially smooth. As a result, mountains <b>3</b><i>a </i>and valleys <b>3</b><i>b </i>are formed on the surface of the die <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">If the blasting is performed continuously, more abrasive grains <b>1</b> will collide against the mountains <b>3</b><i>a </i>one after another, thus producing a fine roughness <b>3</b><i>c </i>there. On the other hand, the abrasive grains <b>1</b> will not collide against the valleys <b>3</b><i>b </i>easily as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and therefore, such fine roughness will not be produced easily on the surface of the valleys <b>3</b><i>b</i>. The surface of the die <b>3</b> that has been subjected to the first blasting process may have a surface roughness A of 8 &#x3bc;m to 30 &#x3bc;m, which is represented as a 10-point average roughness. Such ruggedness produced by the first blasting process will be referred to herein as a &#x201c;first roughness&#x201d; for convenience sake.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional view of a die on which the second blasting process is being performed according to this preferred embodiment. The die <b>3</b> on which the first roughness has been produced through the first blasting process is subjected to the second blasting process using abrasive grains <b>2</b>. If an unused smooth die surface were subjected to the second blasting process, then the surface roughness B would be 2 &#x3bc;m to 6 &#x3bc;m when represented as a 10-point average roughness. The roughness produced by the second blasting process will be referred to herein as a &#x201c;second roughness&#x201d; for convenience sake.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to this preferred embodiment, the respective sizes d<b>1</b> and d<b>2</b> of the abrasive grains <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, the injection pressures of the abrasive grains <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, the blasting process time, and other blasting process conditions are set so that the 10-point average roughnesses A and B satisfy the inequality A&#x2267;2&#xd7;B (or B&#x2266;A/2). By setting the blasting process conditions as described above for the first and second blasting processes and by performing such blasting in at least two stages, conditions that will not flatten the dents created previously can be obtained. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the abrasive grains <b>2</b> for use to perform the second blasting process can also collide against the valleys <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the die <b>3</b>. As a result, fine roughness <b>3</b><i>d </i>is also produced even on the surface of the valleys <b>3</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a resin molded product that has been obtained using the die <b>3</b> on which the second blasting process has been performed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, fine roughness has been produced in not only the valleys <b>4</b><i>a </i>but also the mountains <b>4</b><i>b </i>of the molded product <b>4</b>. Due to the presence of such roughness, reflection of incoming light from the surface of the molded product <b>4</b> can be reduced significantly. And if such a molded product <b>4</b> is used as a resin molded part in a lens barrel, for example, the incoming light will be hardly reflected at any of various angles of incidence and flare or any other optical problem can be minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The present inventors discovered, as a result of experiments carried out on various combinations of 10-point average roughnesses, that the condition A&#x2267;2&#xd7;B is most preferably satisfied. We also discovered that A preferably falls within the range of 8 &#x3bc;m to 30 &#x3bc;m, more preferably within the range of 20 &#x3bc;m to 30 &#x3bc;m, in particular, and also discovered that B preferably falls within the range of 2 &#x3bc;m to 6 &#x3bc;m, more preferably within the range of 3 &#x3bc;m to 6 &#x3bc;m, among other things. These preferred values were also obtained as a result of experiments that were carried out on various combinations of 10-point average roughnesses.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The blasting process does not have to be carried out in two stages but may also be performed in three stages. In the latter case, the blasting process is preferably carried out under the following conditions. Specifically, suppose the surface will have a 10-point average roughness of A &#x3bc;m if an unused smooth die surface is subjected to the first blasting process, will have a 10-point average roughness of B &#x3bc;m if an unused smooth die surface is subjected to the second blasting process, and will have a 10-point average roughness of C &#x3bc;m if an unused smooth die surface is subjected to the third blasting process. In that case, the blasting process conditions are preferably set so that B&#x2266;A/2 and C&#x2266;B/2 are satisfied. More preferably, A&#x2267;8 &#x3bc;m is satisfied.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">It should be noted that the present invention could be carried out not just by blasting but also by cutting or etching as well. In any case, two, three or more degrees of roughness represented by mutually different 10-point average roughnesses are preferably sequentially produced so that the highest degree of roughness is produced earlier than anything else. For example, if three degrees of roughness need to be produced, the three degrees of roughness are preferably produced sequentially so that their 10-point average roughnesses are A &#x3bc;m, B &#x3bc;m and C &#x3bc;m, respectively, and that B&#x2266;A/2 and C&#x2266;B/2 are satisfied.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">No matter what technique is adopted, according to the surface roughening method of the present invention, a die can be processed using an existent system such as a blasting system with abrasive grains, a cutting machine or an etching system.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">(Embodiment 2)</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The molded product <b>4</b> obtained in the first preferred embodiment (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) may be used as a part to be put into the lens barrel of an image capture device.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating a retractable lens barrel <b>50</b> as a second specific preferred embodiment of the present invention. The lens barrel <b>50</b> includes multiple lenses L<b>1</b> to L<b>7</b>, multiple lens holders <b>51</b> to <b>53</b>, an imager <b>54</b> and a shielding member <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Inside those lens holders <b>51</b> to <b>53</b>, arranged are resin molded parts <b>60</b> to <b>62</b> corresponding to the molded product <b>4</b> obtained by the method of the first preferred embodiment. On the inner surface of these resin molded parts <b>60</b> to <b>62</b>, there are valleys <b>4</b><i>a </i>and mountains <b>4</b><i>b </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Thus, it is possible to prevent unnecessary portions of the externally incoming light that have also entered this lens barrel <b>50</b> through the lenses L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> but will not be guided to the imager <b>54</b> from being reflected internally by the lens barrel <b>50</b>. It should be noted that the lens barrel <b>50</b> does not have to have such a retractable structure and could have its length fixed in the optical axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The shielding member <b>55</b> is also provided to shut out unnecessary light. That is why just like the resin molded parts <b>60</b> to <b>62</b>, the die to make this shielding member <b>55</b> may also be processed by the method of the first preferred embodiment described above. Then, it is possible to prevent unnecessary light from being reflected from the surface of the shielding member <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates the appearance of a digital camera <b>100</b> with the lens barrel <b>50</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. When this camera <b>100</b> is turned ON with a power switch <b>101</b>, the lens barrel <b>50</b> protrudes from the digital camera <b>100</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, thus making this camera <b>100</b> ready to shoot.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">It should be noted that the digital camera <b>100</b> with the lens barrel <b>50</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is just an example of the present invention. Rather the present invention is applicable to not only digital cameras but also analog film cameras and cameras, of which the lens barrel <b>50</b> is removable and replaceable. Furthermore, the present invention is applicable to even camcorders that can shoot a moving picture, not just still cameras.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described but the present invention is in no way limited to those illustrative preferred embodiments but could be modified in numerous ways.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">For example, although a method of preparing a die for a resin molding process has been described as a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the present invention is also applicable to preparing a die for use to form a metallic material, not just a resin, into a desired shape.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">According to the surface roughening method of the present invention, by subjecting a die to make a molded product to a surface roughening process, a roughened surface, which will hardly reflect any incoming light, no matter at what angle the light has been incident, and which will rarely produce flare or any other optical problem even when applied to a resin molded part to put into a lens barrel, is realized without using any expensive antireflective paint.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">According to the surface roughening method of the present invention, a die to make a resin molded part or a shielding member to be used inside a lens barrel can be prepared. And an antireflective resin molded product and other products can be obtained by using such a die. A molded product thus obtained is used inside a lens barrel. And an image capture device can also be fabricated using such a lens barrel.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">While the present invention has been described with respect to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the disclosed invention may be modified in numerous ways and may assume many embodiments other than those specifically described above. Accordingly, it is intended by the appended claims to cover all modifications of the invention that fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">This application is based on Japanese Patent Applications No. 2009-144895 filed on Jun. 18, 2009 and No. 2010-135843 filed on Jun. 15, 2010, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
