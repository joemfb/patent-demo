<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates anther example of a pixel circuit having the drive circuit <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The pixel circuit <b>130</b> is similar to the pixel circuit <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The pixel circuit <b>130</b> includes an OLED <b>132</b>.

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The pixel circuit <b>130</b> provides constant averaged current over the frame time, in a mariner similar to that of the pixel circuit <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an example of method of driving a pixel circuit in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The waveforms of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are applied to a pixel circuit (e.g., <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <b>130</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) having the drive circuit <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The operation cycle of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes a programming cycle <b>140</b> and a driving cycle <b>142</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, during the programming cycle <b>140</b>, node A<b>1</b> is charged to a programming voltage through the switch transistor <b>110</b> while the select line SEL is high. During the driving cycle <b>142</b>, node Al is discharged through the discharging transistor <b>108</b>. Since the drive transistor <b>106</b> and the discharging transistor <b>108</b> have the same bias condition, they experience the same threshold voltage shift. Considering that the discharge time is a function of transconductance of the discharging transistor <b>108</b>, the discharge time increases as the threshold voltage of the drive transistor <b>106</b>/the discharging transistor <b>108</b> increases. Therefore, the average current of the pixel (<b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <b>130</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) over the frame time remains constant. In an example, the discharging transistor is a very weak transistor with short width (W) and long channel length (L). The ratio of the width (W) to the length (L) may change based on different situations.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In addition, in the pixel circuit <b>130</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an increase in the OLED voltage for the OLED <b>132</b> results in longer discharge time. Thus, the averaged pixel current will remain constant even after the OLE)) degradation.</p>
