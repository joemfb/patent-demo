<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Reference will now be made to the drawings to describe preferred and exemplary embodiments of the present invention in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the present invention provides a backlight module <b>10</b>, which comprises a first optical film <b>100</b>, a second optical film <b>200</b>, a backplate frame <b>300</b> and an optical film supporting device <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The optical film supporting device <b>400</b> is adapted to splice and support the first optical film <b>100</b> and the second optical film <b>200</b>. The optical film supporting device <b>400</b> is integrally formed of a transparent material through injection molding to ensure uniform light output at the interface between the first optical film <b>100</b> and the second optical film <b>200</b>. For example, the optical film supporting device <b>400</b> may be made of a transparent material such as polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) or polycarbonate (PC).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Specifically, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref> together, the optical film supporting device <b>400</b> primarily comprises a body <b>410</b>, a splicing portion <b>420</b> and a fixing portion <b>430</b>. Hereinafter, three embodiments of the optical film supporting device <b>400</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in a first embodiment of the optical film supporting device <b>400</b>, the body <b>410</b> has a certain height, and is adapted to support the first optical film <b>100</b> and the second optical film <b>200</b>. In order to save the material cost, the body <b>410</b> is formed with a plurality of through-holes <b>412</b> to reduce the amount of material used in the injection molding process. However, the shape of the body <b>410</b> is not merely limited to what shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The splicing portion <b>420</b>, which is located at the top of the body <b>410</b>, is adapted to splice the first optical film <b>100</b> and the second optical film <b>200</b>. Specifically, the splice portion <b>420</b> comprises first receiving recesses <b>422</b> and second receiving recesses <b>424</b> arranged alternately. The first optical film <b>100</b> comprises first edge tabs <b>102</b>, and the second optical film <b>200</b> comprises second edge tabs <b>202</b>. The first edge tabs <b>102</b> are received in the first receiving recesses <b>422</b> respectively, and the second edge tabs <b>202</b> are received in the second receiving recesses <b>424</b> respectively. In this embodiment, the first receiving recesses <b>422</b> and the second receiving recesses <b>424</b> are in the form of rectangular recesses and alternately arranged on a top surface of the splicing portion <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The fixing portion <b>430</b> is located at the bottom of the body <b>410</b>, and can be fixed to the backplate frame <b>300</b> by means of a screw, an adhesive or a snap-fitting structure.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a second embodiment of the optical film supporting device <b>400</b> is shown therein. The structure of the second embodiment is substantially the same as that of the first embodiment described above, and thus, will not be further described herein. However, the second embodiment of the optical film supporting device <b>400</b> differs from the second embodiment mainly in that, a plurality of thinned regions <b>414</b> are formed at both sides of the body <b>410</b> in order to save the material cost. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the body <b>410</b> is formed with two transverse thinned regions <b>414</b> on each side. Of course, the shapes and amount of the thinned regions <b>414</b> are not merely limited to what shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a third embodiment of the optical film supporting device <b>400</b> is shown therein. The structure of the third embodiment is substantially the same as that of the second embodiment described above, and thus, will not be further described herein. However, the third embodiment of the optical film supporting device <b>400</b> differs from the second embodiment mainly in that, the first receiving recesses <b>422</b> and the second receiving recesses <b>424</b> are disposed within the splicing portion <b>420</b>, so splice of the first optical film <b>100</b> and the second optical film <b>200</b> with the optical film supporting device <b>400</b> is made more compact.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the embodiments of the present invention, the first optical film <b>100</b> and the second optical film <b>200</b> may be diffusers, brightness enhancement films (BEF) or other appropriate optical components.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Accordingly, as will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art, the present invention has the following benefits: by providing an optical film supporting device <b>400</b> in the backlight module <b>10</b> of the present invention, two or more optical films can be spliced by the optical film supporting device <b>400</b> to satisfy the demands for a large-sized optical film. This solution is practical, reliable and low in the cost.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the present invention further provides an LCD device <b>1</b>, which comprises a liquid crystal panel <b>20</b> and the backlight module <b>10</b> described above.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the structure of the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. In view of the foregoing, it is intended that the present invention cover modifications and variations of this invention provided they fall within the scope of the following claims and their equivalents.</p>
