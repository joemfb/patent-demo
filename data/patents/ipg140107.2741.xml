<heading id="h-0002" level="1">1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This application relates to combination therapies including triciribine compounds and a molecule that modulates the HER2/neu (erbB2) receptor, for example, trastuzumab or a salt thereof, and compositions with reduced toxicity for the treatment and prevention of tumors, cancer, and other disorders associated with abnormal cell proliferation.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Cancer is an abnormal growth of cells. Cancer cells rapidly reproduce despite restriction of space, nutrients shared by other cells, or signals sent from the body to stop reproduction. Cancer cells are often shaped differently from healthy cells, do not function properly, and can spread into many areas of the body. Abnormal growths of tissue, called tumors, are clusters of cells that are capable of growing and dividing uncontrollably. Tumors can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Benign tumors tend to grow slowly and do not spread. Malignant tumors can grow rapidly, invade and destroy nearby normal tissues, and spread throughout the body.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Cancers are classified according to the kind of fluid or tissue from which they originate, or according to the location in the body where they first developed. In addition, some cancers are of mixed types. Cancers can be grouped into five broad categories, carcinomas, sarcomas, lymphomas, leukemias, and myelomas, which indicate the tissue and blood classifications of the cancer. Carcinomas are cancers found in body tissue known as epithelial tissue that covers or lines surfaces of organs, glands, or body structures. For example, a cancer of the lining of the stomach is called a carcinoma. Many carcinomas affect organs or glands that are involved with secretion, such as breasts that produce milk. Carcinomas account for approximately eighty to ninety percent of all cancer cases. Sarcomas are malignant tumors growing from connective tissues, such as cartilage, fat, muscle, tendons, and bones. The most common sarcoma, a tumor on the bone, usually occurs in young adults. Examples of sarcoma include osteosarcoma (bone) and chondrosarcoma (cartilage). Lymphoma refers to a cancer that originates in the nodes or glands of the lymphatic system, whose job it is to produce white blood cells and clean body fluids, or in organs such as the brain and breast. Lymphomas are classified into two categories: Hodgkin's lymphoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Leukemia, also known as blood cancer, is a cancer of the bone marrow that keeps the marrow from producing normal red and white blood cells and platelets. White blood cells are needed to resist infection. Red blood cells are needed to prevent anemia. Platelets keep the body from easily bruising and bleeding. Examples of leukemia include acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The terms myelogenous and lymphocytic indicate the type of cells that are involved. Finally, myelomas grow in the plasma cells of bone marrow. In some cases, the myeloma cells collect in one bone and form a single tumor, called a plasmacytoma. However, in other cases, the myeloma cells collect in many bones, forming many bone tumors. This is called multiple myeloma.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Tumor induction and progression are often the result of accumulated changes in the tumor-cell genome. Such changes can include inactivation of cell growth inhibiting genes, or tumor suppressor genes, as well as activation of cell growth promoting genes, or oncogenes. Hundreds of activated cellular oncogenes have been identified to date in animal models, however, only a small minority of these genes have proven to be relevant to human cancers (Weinberg et al., <i>Oncogenes and the Molecular Origins of Cancer, </i>1989. Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.; Stanbridge J. et al., Cell, 1990. 63: p 867-874; Godwin et al., in <i>Gynecological oncology: principles and practice</i>, Hoskins W. J., Perez C. A. and Young R. C. (eds.), 1992. pp 87-116. Lippincott, Philadelphia). The activation of oncogenes in human cancers can result from factors such as increased gene copy number or structural changes. These factors can cause numerous cellular effects, for example, they can result in overexpression of a gene product. Several oncogenes involved in human cancer can be activated through gene overexpression.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It has become apparent that the successive genetic aberrations acquired by cancer cells result in detects in regulatory signal transduction circuits that govern normal cell proliferation, differentiation and programmed cell death (Hanahan, D. and Weinberg R. A., Cell, 2000. 100(1); p. 57-700). This in turn results in fundamental defects in cell physiology which dictate malignancy. These defects include: a) self sufficiency in growth signals (i.e. overexpression of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR and aberrant activation of downstream signal transduction pathways such as Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk &#xbd; and Ras/PI3K/Akt), b) resistance to anti-growth signals (i.e. lower expression of TGF&#x3b2; and its receptor), c) evading apoptosis (i.e. loss of proapoptotic p53; overexpression of pro-survival Bcl-2; hyperactivation of survival pathways such as those mediated by PI3K/Akt), d) sustained angiogenesis (i.e. high levels of secretion of VEGF) and f) tissue invasion and metastasis (i.e. extracellular proteases and prometastatic integrins) (Hanahan, D. and Weinberg R. A., Cell, 2000. 100(1): p. 57-700).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR, ErbB2, VEGFR and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) are intimately involved in the development of many human cancers including colorectal pancreatic, breast and ovarian cancers (Khaleghpour K. et al., Carcinogenesis, 2004. 25(2): p. 241-8.; Sekharam M. et al., Cancer Res, 2003. 63(22): p. 7708-16). Binding of ligands such as EGF, VEGF and IGF-1 to their receptors promotes stimulation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, autophosphorylation of specific tyrosines in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptors and recruitment of signaling proteins that trigger a variety of complex signal transduction pathways (Olayioye M. A. et al., Embo J, 2000. 19(13): p. 3159-67: Porter A. C. and Vaillancourt R. R., Oncogene, 1998. 17(11 Reviews): p. 1343-52). This in turn leads to the activation of many tumor survival and oncogenic pathways such as the Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk &#xbd;, JAK/STAT3 and PI3K/Akt pathways. Although all three pathways have been implicated in colon, pancreatic, breast and ovarian oncogenesis, those that are mediated by Akt have been shown to be critical in many steps of malignant transformation including cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis/survival, invasion and metastasis and angiogenesis (Datta S. R. et al., Genes Dev, 1999. 13(22): p. 2905-27).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Akt is a serine/threonine protein kinase (also known as PKB), which has 3 family members Akt1, Akt2 and Akt3. Stimulation of cells with growth or survival factors results in recruitment to the receptors of the lipid kinase phosphoinositide-3-OH-kinase (PI3K) which phosphorylates phosphoinsoitol-4,5-biphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) to PIP<sub>3 </sub>which recruits Akt to the plasma membrane where it can be activated by phosphorylation on Thr308 and Ser473 (Akt1), Thr308 and Ser474 (Akt2) and Thr308 and Ser472 (Akt3) (Datta S. R. et al., Genes Dev, 1999. 13(22): p. 2905-27). Thus, PI3K activates Akt by phosphorylating PIP2 and converting to PIP3. The phosphatase PTEN dephophorylates PIP3 to PIP2 and hence prevents the activation of Akt.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The majority of human cancers contain hyperactivated Akt (Datta S. R. et al., Genes Dev, 1999, 13(22): p. 2905-27; Bellacosa A, et al., Int J Cancer, 1995. 64(4): p. 280-5; Sun M. et al., Am J Pathol, 2001. 159(2): p. 431-7). In particular, Akt is overexpressed and/or hyperactivated in 57%, 32%, 27% and 36% of human colorectal, pancreatic, breast and ovarian cancers, respectively (Roy H. K. et al., Carcinogenesis, 2002. 23(1): p. 201-5; Altomare D. A. et al., J Cell Biochem, 2003. 88(1): p. 470-6; Sun M. et al., Cancer Res, 2001. 61(16): p. 5985-91: Stal O. et al., Breast Cancer Res, 2003. 5(2): p. R37-44; Cheng J. Q. et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 1992. 89(19): p. 9267-71; Yuan Z. Q. et al., Oncogene, 2000. 19(19): p. 2324-30). Hyperactivation of Akt is due to amplification and/or overexpression of Akt itself as well as genetic alterations upstream of Akt including overexpression of receptor tyrosine kinases and/or their ligands and deletion of the phosphatase PTEN (Khaleghpour K. et al., Carcinogenesis, 2004. 25(2): p. 241-8; Sekharam M. et al., Cancer Res, 2003. 63(22): p. 7708-16; Cohen B. D. et al., Biochem Soc Symp, 1998. 63: p. 199-210; Muller W. J. et al., Biochem Soc Symp, 1998, 63: p. 149-57; Miller W. E. et al., J Virol, 1995. 69(7): p. 4390-8; Slamon D. J. et al., Science, 1987. 235(4785): p. 177-82; Andrulis I. L. et al., J Clin Oncol, 1998. 16(4): p. 1340-9). Proof-of-concept of the involvement of Akt in oncogenesis has been demonstrated preclinically by showing that ectopic expression of Akt induces malignant transformation and promotes cell survival (Sun M. et al., Am J Pathol, 2001. 159(2); p. 431-7; Cheng J. Q. et al., Oncogene, 1997. 14(23): p. 2793-801) and that disruption of Akt pathways inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis (Jetzt A. et al. Cancer Res, 2003. 63(20): p. 6697-706).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Current treatments of cancer and related diseases have limited effectiveness and numerous serious unintended side effects. Despite demonstrated clinical efficacy of many anti-cancer drugs, severe systemic toxicity often halts the clinical development of promising chemotherapeutic agents. Further, overexpression of receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR and their ligands such as IGF-1, Akt overexpression and/or loss of PTEN (all of which result in hyperactivation of Akt) are associated with poor prognosis, resistance to chemotherapy and shortened survival time of cancer patients. Current research strategics emphasize the search for effective therapeutic modes with less risk.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thus, a combination of a triciribine compound and a molecule that modulates the HER2.neu (erbB2) receptor, for example, trastuzumab, holds promise as a potential combination therapy for treating tumors, cancer, and abnormal cell proliferation while synergistically reducing toxicity or adverse side effects caused by currently administered cancer compounds.</p>

<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention provides novel therapeutic regimens of triciribine, triciribine phosphate and related compounds in combination with a molecule that modulates the HER2/neu (erbB2) receptor, for example, trastuzumab or a salt thereof, to treat tumors or cancer in a subject while limiting systemic toxicity.

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">5.1. Definitions</heading>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As used herein, the term &#x201c;compounds of the invention&#x201d; refers to compounds of formula I, compounds of formula II, and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;cancer&#x201d; and &#x201c;cancerous&#x201d; refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth, i.e., proliferative disorders. Examples of such proliferative disorders include cancers such as carcinoma, lymphoma, blastoma, sarcoma, and leukemia, as well as other cancers disclosed herein. More particular examples of such cancers include breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, squamous cell cancer, small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, pancreatic cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, e.g., hepatic carcinoma, bladder cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial carcinoma, kidney cancer, and thyroid cancer.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Other non-limiting examples of cancers are basal cell carcinoma, biliary tract cancer; bone cancer; brain and CNS cancer; choriocarcinoma; connective tissue cancer; esophageal cancer; eye cancer; cancer of the head and neck; gastric cancer; intra-epithelial neoplasm; larynx cancer; lymphoma including Hodgkin's and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; melanoma; myeloma; neuroblastoma; oral cavity cancer (e.g., lip, tongue, mouth, and pharynx); pancreatic cancer; retinoblastoma; rhabdomyosarcoma; rectal cancer; cancer of the respiratory system; sarcoma; skin cancer; stomach cancer; testicular cancer; uterine cancer; cancer of the urinary system, as well as other carcinomas and sarcomas.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As used herein, the term &#x201c;tumor&#x201d; refers to all neoplastic cell growth and proliferation, whether malignant or benign, and all pre-cancerous and cancerous cells and tissues. For example, a particular cancer may be characterized by a solid mass tumor. The solid tumor mass, if present, may be a primary tumor mass. A primary tumor mass refers to a growth of cancer cells in a tissue resulting from the transformation of a normal cell of that tissue. In most cases, the primary tumor mass is identified by the presence of a cyst, which can be found through visual or palpation methods, or by irregularity in shape, texture or weight of the tissue. However, some primary tumors are not palpable and can be detected only through medical imaging techniques such as X-rays (e.g., mammography), or by needle aspirations. The use of these latter techniques is more common is early detection. Molecular and phenotypic analysis of cancer cells within a tissue will usually confirm if the cancer is endogenous to the tissue or if the lesion is due to metastasis from another site.</p>

In certain embodiments, the antibody is an IgG<sub>1 </sub>kappa that contains human framework regions with the complementary-determining regions of a murine antibody (4DS) that binds to HER2.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">As used herein and unless otherwise indicated, the term &#x201c;trastuzumab&#x201d; refers to trastuzumab or a salt thereof. In certain embodiment, the term trastuzumab refers to the compound with the DrugBank accession number BTD00098 and the trade name Herceptin, which is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). HER2 is overexpressed by many adenocarcinomas, particularly breast adenocarcinomas. Trastuzumab binds to HER2 on the cell surface of a tumor cell, thereby inducing an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity against tumor cells that overexpress HER2.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">It is to be understood that the compounds disclosed herein may contain chiral centers. Such chiral centers may be of either the (R) or (S) configuration, or may be a mixture thereof. Thus, the compounds provided herein may be enantiomerically pure, or be stereoisomeric or diastereomeric mixtures. It is understood that the disclosure of a compound herein encompasses any racemic, optically active, polymorphic, or steroisomeric form, or mixtures thereof, which preferably possesses the useful properties described herein, it being well known in the art how to prepare optically active forms and how to determine activity using the standard tests described herein, or using other similar tests which are will known in the art. Examples of methods that can be used to obtain optical isomers of the compounds include the following:</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">(i) physical separation of crystals&#x2014;a technique whereby macroscopic crystals of the individual enantiomers are manually separated. This technique can be used if crystals of the separate enantiomers exist, i.e., the material is a conglomerate, and the crystals are visually distinct;</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">(ii) simultaneous crystallization&#x2014;a technique whereby the individual enantiomers are separately crystallized from a solution of the racemate, possible only if the latter is a conglomerate in the solid state;</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">(iii) enzymatic resolutions&#x2014;a technique whereby partial or complete separation of a racemate by virtue of differing rates of reaction for the enantiomers with an enzyme</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">(iv) enzymatic asymmetric synthesis&#x2014;a synthetic technique whereby at least one step of the synthesis uses an enzymatic reaction to obtain an enantiomerically pure or enriched synthetic precursor of the desired enantiomer;</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">(v) chemical asymmetric synthesis&#x2014;a synthetic technique whereby the desired enantiomer is synthesized from an achiral precursor under conditions that produce asymmetry (i.e., chirality) in the product, which may be achieved using chiral catalysts or chiral auxiliaries;</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">(vi) diastereomer separations&#x2014;a technique whereby a racemic compound is reacted with an enantiomerically pure reagent (the chiral auxiliary) that converts the individual enantiomers to diastereomers. The resulting diastereomers are then separated by chromatography or crystallization by virtue of their now more distinct structural differences and the chiral auxiliary later removed to obtain the desired enantiomer;</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">(vii) first- and second-order asymmetric transformations&#x2014;a technique whereby diastereomers from the racemate equilibrate to yield a preponderance in solution of the diastereomer from the desired enantiomer or where preferential crystallization of the diastereomer from the desired enantiomer perturbs the equilibrium such that eventually in principle all the material is converted to the crystalline diastereomer from the desired enantiomer. The desired enantiomer is then released from the diastereomer;</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">(viii) kinetic resolutions&#x2014;this technique refers to the achievement of partial or complete resolution of a racemate (or of a further resolution of a partially resolved compound) by virtue of unequal reaction rates of the enantiomers with a chiral, non-racemic reagent or catalyst under kinetic conditions;</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">(ix) enantiospecific synthesis from non-racemic precursors&#x2014;a synthetic technique whereby the desired enantiomer is obtained from non-chiral starting materials and where the stereochemical integrity is not or is only minimally compromised over the course of the synthesis;</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">(x) chiral liquid chromatography&#x2014;a technique whereby the enantiomers of a racemate are separated in a liquid mobile phase by virtue of their differing interactions with a stationary phase. The stationary phase can be made of chiral material or the mobile phase can contain an additional chiral material to provoke the differing interactions;</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">(xi) chiral gas chromatography&#x2014;a technique whereby the racemate is volatilized and enantiomers are separated by virtue of their differing interactions in the gaseous mobile phase with a column containing a fixed non-racemic chiral adsorbent phase;</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">(xii) extraction with chiral solvents&#x2014;a technique whereby the enantiomers are separated by virtue of preferential dissolution of one enantiomer into a particular chiral solvent;</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">(xiii) transport across chiral membranes&#x2014;a technique whereby a racemate is placed in contact with a thin membrane barrier. The barrier typically separates two miscible fluids, one containing the racemate, and a driving force such as concentration or pressure differential causes preferential transport across the membrane barrier. Separation occurs as a result of the non-racemic chiral nature of the membrane which allows only one enantiomer of the racemate to pass through.</p>

<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In cases where compounds are sufficiently basic or acidic to form stable nontoxic acid or base salts, administration of the compound as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be appropriate. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic bases and acids. Suitable salts include those derived from alkali metals such as potassium and sodium, alkaline earth metals such as calcium and magnesium, among numerous other acids well known in the pharmaceutical art. In particular, examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are organic acid addition salts formed with acids, which form a physiological, acceptable anion, for example, tosylate, methanesulfonate, acetate, citrate, malonate, tartarate, succinate, benzoate, ascorbate, &#x3b1;-ketoglutarate, and &#x3b1;-glycerophosphate. Suitable inorganic salts may also be formed, including, sulfate, nitrate, bicarbonate, and carbonate salts.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be obtained using standard procedures well known in the art, for example reacting a sufficiently basic compound such as an amine with a suitable acid affording a physiologically acceptable anion. Alkali metal (for example, sodium, potassium or lithium) or alkaline earth metal (for example calcium) salts of carboxylic acids can also be made.</p>

<heading id="h-0011" level="1">5.5. Screening of Patient Populations</heading>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">In another aspect of the present invention, methods are provided to identify cancers or tumors that are susceptible to the toxic effects of triciribine (TCN) and related compounds. In one embodiment, methods are provided to treat a cancer or tumor in a mammal by (i) obtaining a biological sample from the tumor; (ii) determining whether the cancer or tumor overexpresses Akt kinase or hyperactivated and phosphorylated Akt kinase, and (iii) treating the cancer or tumor with triciribine or a related compound as described herein. In one embodiment, the biological sample can be a biopsy. In other embodiments, the biological sample can be fluid, cells and/or aspirates obtained from the tumor or cancer.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">The biological sample can be obtained according to any technique known to one skilled in the art. In one embodiment a biopsy can be conducted to obtain the biological sample. A biopsy is a procedure performed to remove tissue or cells from the body for examination. Some biopsies can be performed in a physician's office, while others need to be done in a hospital setting. In addition, some biopsies require use of an anesthetic to numb the area, while others do not require any sedation. In certain embodiments, an endoscopic biopsy can be performed. This type of biopsy is performed through a fiberoptic endoscope (a long, thin tube that has a close-focusing telescope on the end for viewing) through a natural body orifice (i.e., rectum) or a small incision (i.e., arthroscopy). The endoscope is used to view the organ in question for abnormal or suspicious areas, in order to obtain a small amount of tissue for study. Endoscopic procedures are named for the organ or body area to be visualized and/or treated. The physician can insert the endoscope into the gastrointestinal tract (alimentary tract endoscopy), bladder (cystoscopy), abdominal cavity (laparoscopy), joint cavity (arthroscopy), mid-portion of the chest (mediastinoscopy), or trachea and bronchial system (laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy).</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">In another embodiment, a bone marrow biopsy can be performed. This type of biopsy can be performed either from the sternum (breastbone) or the iliac crest hipbone (the bone area on either side of the pelvis on the lower back area). The skin is cleansed and a local anesthetic is given to numb the area. A long, rigid needle is inserted into the marrow, and cells are aspirated for study; this step is occasionally uncomfortable. A core biopsy (removing a small bone &#x2018;chip&#x2019; from the marrow) may follow the aspiration.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">In a further embodiment, an excisional or incisional biopsy can be performed on the mammal. This type of biopsy is often used when a wider or deeper portion of the skin is needed. Using a scalpel (surgical knife), a full thickness of skin is removed for further examination, and the wound is sutured (sewed shut with surgical thread). When the entire tumor is removed, it is referred to as an excisional biopsy technique. If only a portion of the tumor is removed, it is referred to as an incisional biopsy technique. Excisional biopsy is often the method usually preferred, for example, when melanoma (a type of skin cancer) is suspected.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In still further embodiments, a fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy can be used. This type of biopsy involves using a thin needle to remove very small pieces from a tumor. Local anesthetic is sometimes used to numb the area, but the test rarely causes much discomfort and leaves no scar. FNA is not, for example, used for diagnosis of a suspicious mole, but may be used, for example, to biopsy large lymph nodes near a melanoma to see if the melanoma has metastasized (spread). A computed tomography scan (CT or CAT scan) can be used to guide a needle into a tumor in an internal organ such as the lung or liver.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In other embodiments, punch shave and/or skin biopsies can be conducted. Punch biopsies involve taking a deeper sample of skin with a biopsy instrument that removes a short cylinder, or &#x201c;apple core,&#x201d; of tissue. After a local anesthetic is administered, the instrument is rotated on the surface of the skin until it cuts through all the layers, including the dermis, epidermis, and the most superficial parts of the subcutis (fat). A shave biopsy involves removing the top layers of skin by shaving it off. Shave biopsies are also performed with a local anesthetic. Skin biopsies involve removing a sample of skin for examination under the microscope to determine if, for example, melanoma is present. The biopsy is performed under local anesthesia.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In particular embodiment, methods are provided to determine whether the tumor overexpresses an Akt kinase. Akt kinase overexpression can refer to the phosphorylation state of the kinase. Hyperphosphorylation of Akt can be detected according to the methods described herein. In one embodiment, a tumor biopsy can be compared to a control tissue. The control tissue can be a normal tissue from the mammal in which the biopsy was obtained or a normal tissue from a healthy mammal. Akt kinase overexpression or hyperphosphorylation can be determined if the tumor biopsy contains greater amounts of Akt kinase and/or Akt kinase phosphorylation than the control tissue, such as, for example, at least approximately 1.5, 2, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3, 3.25, 3.5, 3.75, 4, 4.25, 4.5, 4.75, 5, 5.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10-fold greater amounts of Akt kinase than contained in the control tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method to detect aberrant Akt kinase expression in a subject or in a biological sample from the subject by contacting cells, cell extracts, serum or other sample from the subjects or said biological sample with an immunointeractive molecule specific for an Akt kinase or antigenic portion thereof and screening for the level of immunointeractive molecule-Akt kinase complex formation, wherein an elevated presence of the complex relative to a normal cell is indicative of an aberrant cell that expresses or overexpresses Akt. In one example, cells or cell extracts can be screened immunologically for the presence of elevated levels of Akt kinase.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In an alternative embodiment, the aberrant expression of Akt in a cell is detected at the genetic level by screening for the level of expression of a gene encoding an Akt kinase wherein an elevated level of a transcriptional expression product (i.e., mRNA) compared to a normal cell is indicative of an aberrant cell. In certain embodiments, real-time PCR as well as other PCR procedures can be used to determine transcriptional activity. In one embodiment, mRNA can be obtained from cells of a subject or from a biological sample from a subject and cDNA optionally generated. The mRNA or cDNA can then be contacted with a genetic probe capable of hybridizing to and/or amplifying all or part of a nucleotide sequence encoding Akt kinase or its complementary nucleotide sequence and then the level of the mRNA or cDNA can be detected wherein the presence of elevated levels of the mRNA or cDNA compared to normal controls can be assessed.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Yet another embodiment of the present invention contemplates the use of an antibody, monoclonal or polyclonal, to Akt kinase in a quantitative or semi-quantitative diagnostic kit to determine relative levels of Akt kinase in suspected cancer cells from a patient, which can include all the reagents necessary to perform the assay. In one embodiment, a kit utilizing reagents and materials necessary to perform an ELISA assay is provided. Reagents can include, for example, washing buffer, antibody dilution buffer, blocking buffer, cell staining solution, developing solution, stop solution, anti-phospho-protein specific antibodies, anti-Pan protein specific antibodies, secondary antibodies, and distilled water. The kit can also include instructions for use and can optionally be automated or semi-automated or in a form which is compatible with automated machine or software. In one embodiment, a phosphor-ser-473 Akt antibody that detects the activated form of AKT (Akt phosphorylated at serine 474) can be utilized as the antibody in a diagnostic kit. See, for example, Yuan et al., Oncogene, 2000. 19: p. 2324-2330.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">5.6. Akt Kinases</heading>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Akt, also named PKB<sup>3</sup>, represents a subfamily of the serine/threonine kinase. Three members, AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3, have been identified in this subfamily. Akt is activated by extracellular stimuli in a PI3K-dependent manner (Datta S. R. et al., Genes Dev, 1999. 13: p. 2905-2927). Full activation of Akt requires phosphorylation of Thr<sup>308 </sup>in the activation loop and Ser<sup>473 </sup>in the C-terminal activation domain. Akt is negatively regulated by PTEN tumor suppressor. Mutations in PTEN have been identified in various tumors, which lead to activation of Akt pathway (Datta S. R. et al., Genes Dev, 1999. 13: p. 2905-2927). In addition, amplification, overexpression and/or activation of Akt have been detected in a number of human malignancies (Datta S. R. et al., Genes Dev, 1999, 13: p. 2905-2927); Cheng J. Q. and Nicosia S. V., in <i>Encyclopedic Reference of Cancer, </i>2001, Schwab D. (ed.) Springer, Berlin Heidelberg and New York: pp 35-7). Ectopic expression of Akt, especially constitutively active Akt, induces cell survival and malignant transformation whereas inhibition of Akt activity stimulates apoptosis in a range of mammalian cells (Datta S. R. et al., Genes Dev, 1999. 13: p, 2905-2927); Cheng J. Q. and Nicosia S. V., in <i>Encyclopedic Reference of Cancer, </i>2001, Schwab D, (ed.) Springer, Berlin Heidelberg and New York: pp 35-7; Sun M. et al., Am J Path, 2001, 159: p. 431-437; Cheng J. Q. et al., Oncogene, 1997. 14; p. 2793-2801). Further, activation of Akt has been shown to associate with tumor invasiveness and chemoresistance (West K. A. et al., Drug Resist Updat, 2002. 5: p. 234-248).</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Activation of the Akt pathway plays a pivotal role in malignant transformation and chemoresistance by inducing cell survival, growth, migration, and angiogenesis. The present invention provides methods to determine levels of Akt kinase overexpression and/or hyperactivated and phosphorylated Akt kinase.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">The Akt kinase can be any known Akt family kinase, or kinase related thereto, including, but not limited to Akt 1, Akt 2, Akt 3.

<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Immunological Assays</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">In one embodiment, a method is provided for detecting the aberrant expression of an Akt kinase in a cell in a mammal or in a biological sample from the mammal, by contacting cells, cell extracts or serum or other sample from the mammal or biological sample with an immunointeractive molecule specific for an Akt kinase or antigenic portion thereof and screening for the level of immunointeractive molecule-Akt kinase complex formations and determining whether an elevated presence of the complex relative to a normal cell is present.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">The immunointeractive molecule can be a molecule having specificity and binding affinity for an Akt kinase or its antigenic parts or its homologs or derivatives thereof. In one embodiment, the immunointeractive molecule can be an immunoglobulin molecule. In other embodiments, the immunointeractive molecules can be an antibody fragments, single chain antibodies, and/or deimmunized molecules including humanized antibodies and T-cell associated antigen-binding molecules (TABMs). In one particular embodiment, the antibody can be a monoclonal antibody. In another particular embodiment, the antibody can be a polyclonal antibody. The immunointeractive molecule can exhibit specificity for an Akt kinase or more particularly an antigenic determinant or epitope on an Akt kinase. An antigenic determinant or epitope on an Akt kinase includes that part of the molecule to which an immune response is directed. The antigenic determinant or epitope can be a B-cell epitope or where appropriate a T-cell epitope. In one embodiment, the antibody is a phosphor-ser 473 Akt antibody.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">One embodiment of the present invention provides a method for diagnosing the presence of cancer or cancer-like growth in a mammal in which aberrant Akt activity is present, by contacting cells or cell extracts from the mammal or a biological sample from the subject with an Akt kinase-binding effective amount of an antibody having specificity for the Akt kinase or an antigenic determinant or epitope thereon and then quantitatively or qualitatively determining the level of an Akt kinase-antibody complex wherein the presence of elevated levels of said complex compared to a normal cell is determined.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Antibodies can be prepared by any of a number of means known to one skilled in the art. For example, for the detection of human Akt kinase, antibodies can be generally but not necessarily derived from non-human animals such as primates, livestock animals (e.g. sheep, cows, pigs, goats, horses), laboratory test animals (e.g. mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits) and/or companion animals (e.g. dogs, cats). Antibodies may also be recombinantly produced in prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cells. Generally, antibody based assays can be conducted in vitro on cell or tissue biopsies. However, if an antibody is suitably deimmunized or, in the case of human use, humanized, then the antibody can be labeled with, for example, a nuclear tag, administered to a patient and the site of nuclear label accumulation determined by radiological techniques. The Akt kinase antibody can be a cancer targeting agent. Accordingly, another embodiment of the present invention provides deimmunized forms of the antibodies for use in cancer imaging in human and non-human patients.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">In general, for the generation of antibodies to an Akt kinase, the enzyme is required to be extracted from a biological sample whether this be from animal including human tissue or from cell culture if produced by recombinant means. The Akt kinase can be separated from the biological sample by any suitable means. For example, the separation may take advantage of any one or more of the Akt kinase's surface charge properties, size, density, biological activity and its affinity for another entity (e.g. another protein or chemical compound to which it binds or otherwise associates). Thus, for example, separation of the Akt kinase from the biological fluid can be achieved by any one or more of ultra-centrifugation, ion-exchange chromatography (e.g. anion exchange chromatography, cation exchange chromatography), electrophoresis (e.g. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focussing), size separation (e.g., gel filtration, ultra-filtration) and affinity-mediated separation (e.g. immunoaffinity separation including, but not limited to, magnetic bead separation such as Dynabead (trademark) separation, immunochromatography, immuno-precipitation). The separation of Akt kinase from the biological fluid can preserve conformational epitopes present on the kinase and, thus, suitably avoids techniques that cause denaturation of the enzyme. In a further embodiment, the kinase can be separated from the biological fluid using any one or more of affinity separation, gel filtration and/or ultra-filtration.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Immunization and subsequent production of monoclonal antibodies can be carried out using standard protocols known in the art, such as, for example, described by Kohler and Milstein (Kohler and Milstein, Nature, 1975, 256: p. 495-499; Kohler and Milstein, Eur J Immunol, 1976, 6(7); p. 511-519; Coligan et al., (Current Protocols in Immunology, 1991-1997, John Wiley &#x26; Sons, Inc.) or Toyama et al. (Monoclonal Antibody, Experiment Manual, 1987, Kodansha Scientific). Essentially, an animal is immunized with an Akt kinase-containing biological fluid or fraction thereof or a recombinant form of Akt kinase by standard methods to produce antibody-producing cells, particularly antibody-producing somatic cells (e.g. B lymphocytes). These cells can then be removed from the immunized animal for immortalization. In certain embodiment, a fragment of an Akt kinase can be used to the generate antibodies. The fragment can be associated with a carrier. The carrier can be any substance of typically high molecular weight to which a non- or poorly immunogenic substance (e.g. a hapten) is naturally or artificially linked to enhance its immunogenicity.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Immortalization of antibody-producing cells can be carried out using methods which are well-known in the art. For example, the immortalization may be achieved by the transformation method using Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (Kozbor et al., Methods in Enzymology, 1986. 121: p. 140). In another embodiment, antibody-producing cells are immortalized using the cell fusion method (described in Coligan et al., 1991-3997, supra), which is widely employed for the production of monoclonal antibodies. In this method, somatic antibody-producing cells with the potential to produce antibodies, particularly B cells, are fused with a myeloma cell line. These somatic cells may be derived from the lymph nodes, spleens and peripheral blood of primed animals, preferably rodent animals such as mice and rats. In a particular embodiment, mice spleen cells can be used. In other embodiments, rat, rabbit, sheep or goat cells can also be used. Specialized myeloma cell lines have been developed from lymphocytic tumours for use in hybridoma-producing fusion procedures (Kohler and Milstein, 1976, supra; Shulman et al., Nature, 1978. 276: p. 269-270; Volk et al., J Virol, 1982. 42(1): p. 220-227). Many myeloma cell lines can also be used for the production of fused cell hybrids, including, e.g. P3.times.63-Ag8, P3.times.63-AG8.653, P3/NSI-Ag4-1 (NS-1), Sp2/0-Ag14 and S194/5.XXO.Bu.1. The P3.times.63-Ag8 and NS-1 cell lines have been described by Kohler and Milstein (1976, supra). Shulman et al. (1978, supra) developed the Sp2/0-Ag14 myeloma line. The S194/5.XXO.Bu.1 line was reported by Trowbridge (J Exp Med, 1978. 148(1): p. 313-323). Methods for generating hybrids of antibody-producing spleen or lymph node cells and myeloma cells usually involve mixing somatic cells with myeloma cells in a 10:1 proportion (although the proportion may vary from about 20:1 to about 1:1), respectively, in the presence of an agent or agents (chemical, viral or electrical) that promotes the fusion of cell membranes. Fusion methods have been described (Kohler and Milstein, 1975, supra; Kohler and Milstein, 1976, supra; Gefter et al., Somatic Cell Genet, 1977. 3: p. 231-236; Volk et al., 1982, supra). The fusion-promoting agents used by those investigators were Sendai virus and polyethylene glycol (PEG). In certain embodiments, means to select the fused cell hybrids from the remaining unfused cells, particularly the unfused myeloma cells, are provided. Generally, the selection of fused cell hybrids can be accomplished by culturing the cells in media that support the growth of hybridomas but prevent the growth of the unfused myeloma cells, which normally would go on dividing indefinitely. The somatic cells used in the fusion do not maintain long-term viability in in vitro culture and hence do not pose a problem. Several weeks are required to selectively culture the fused cell hybrids. Early in this time period, it is necessary to identify those hybrids which produce the desired antibody, so that they may subsequently be cloned and propagated. Generally, around 10% of the hybrids obtained produce the desired antibody, although a range of from about 1 to about 30% is not uncommon. The detection of antibody-producing hybrids can be achieved by any one of several standard assay methods, including enzyme-linked immunoassay and radioimmunoassay techniques as, for example, described in Kennet et al. (Monoclonal Antibodies and Hybridomas: A New Dimension in Biological Analyses, 1980, Plenum Press, New York, p. 376-384) and by FACS analysis (O'Reilly et al., Biotechniques, 1998 25: p. 824-830).</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Once the desired fused cell hybrids have been selected and cloned into individual antibody-producing cell lines, each cell line may be propagated in either of two standard ways. A suspension of the hybridoma cells can be injected into a histocompatible animal. The injected animal will then develop tumours that secrete the specific monoclonal antibody produced by the fused cell hybrid. The body fluids of the animal, such as serum or ascites fluid, can be tapped to provide monoclonal antibodies in high concentration. Alternatively, the individual cell lines may be propagated in vitro in laboratory culture vessels. The culture medium containing high concentrations of a single specific monoclonal antibody can be harvested by decantation, filtration or centrifugation, and subsequently purified.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">The cell lines can then be tested for their specificity to detect the Akt kinase of interest by any suitable immunodetection means. For example, cell lines can be aliquoted into a number of wells and incubated and the supernatant from each well is analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect fluorescent antibody technique, or the like. The cell line(s) producing a monoclonal antibody capable of recognizing the target LIM kinase but which does not recognize non-target epitopes are identified and then directly cultured in vitro or injected into a histocompatible animal to form tumours and to produce, collect and purify the required antibodies.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">The present invention provides, therefore, a method of detecting in a sample an Akt kinase or fragment, variant or derivative thereof comprising contacting the sample with an antibody or fragment or derivative thereof and detecting the level of a complex containing the antibody and Akt kinase or fragment, variant or derivative thereof compared to normal controls wherein elevated levels of Akt kinase is determined. Any suitable technique for determining formation of the complex may be used. For example, an antibody according to the invention, having a reporter molecule associated therewith, may be utilised in immunoassays. Such immunoassays include but are not limited to radioimmunoassays (RIAs), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) immunochromatographic techniques (ICTs), and Western blotting which are well known to those of skill in the art. Immunoassays can also include competitive assays. The present invention encompasses qualitative and quantitative immunoassays.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Suitable immunoassay techniques are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,016,043; 4,424,279; and 4,018,653. These include both single-site and two-site assays of the non-competitive types, as well as the traditional competitive binding assays. These assays also include direct binding of a labeled antigen-binding molecule to a target antigen.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">The invention further provides methods for quantifying Akt protein expression and activation levels in cells or tissue samples obtained from an animal, such as a human cancer patient or an individual suspected of having cancer. In one embodiment, the invention provides methods for quantifying Akt protein expression or activation levels using an imaging system quantitatively. The imaging system can be used to receive, enhance, and process images of cells or tissue samples, that have been stained with AKT protein-specific stains, in order to determine the amount or activation level of AKT protein expressed in the cells or tissue samples from such an animal. In embodiments of the methods of the invention, a calibration curve of AKT1 and AKT2 protein expression can be generated for at least two cell lines expressing differing amounts of AKT protein. The calibration curve can then used to quantitatively determine the amount of AKT protein that is expressed in a cell or tissue sample. Analogous calibration curves can be made for activated AKT proteins using reagents specific for the activation features. It can also be used to determine changes in amounts and activation state of AKT before and after clinical cancer treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">In one particular embodiment of the methods of the invention, AKT protein expression in a cell or tissue sample can be quantified using an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) to determine the amount of AKT protein in a sample. Such methods are described, for example, in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2002/0015974.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">In other embodiments enzyme immunoassays can be used to detect the Akt kinase. In such assays, an enzyme is conjugated to the second antibody, generally by means of gluteraldehyde or periodate. The substrates to be used with the specific enzymes are generally chosen for the production of, upon hydrolysis by the corresponding enzyme, a detectable colour change. It is also possible to employ fluorogenic substrates, which yield a fluorescent product rather than the chromogenic substrates. The enzyme-labeled antibody can be added to the first antibody-antigen complex, allowed to bind, and then the excess reagent washed away. A solution containing the appropriate substrate can then be added to the complex of antibody-antigen-antibody. The substrate can react with the enzyme linked to the second antibody, giving a qualitative visual signal, which may be further quantitated, usually spectrophotometrically, to give an indication of the amount of antigen which was present in the sample. Alternately, fluorescent compounds, such as fluorescein, rhodamine and the lanthanide, europium (EU), can be chemically coupled to antibodies without altering their binding capacity. When activated by illumination with light of a particular wavelength, the fluorochrome-labeled antibody adsorbs the light energy, inducing a state to excitability in the molecule, followed by emission of the light at a characteristic colour visually detectable with a light microscope. The fluorescent-labeled antibody is allowed to bind to the first antibody-antigen complex. After washing off the unbound reagent, the remaining tertiary complex is then exposed to light of an appropriate wavelength. The fluorescence observed indicates the presence of the antigen of interest. Immunofluorometric assays (IFMA) are well established in the art and are particularly useful for the present method. However, other reporter molecules, such as radioisotope, chemiluminescent or bioluminescent molecules can also be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">In a particular embodiment, antibodies to Akt kinase can also be used in ELISA-mediated detection of Akt kinase especially in serum or other circulatory fluid. This can be accomplished by immobilizing anti-Akt kinase antibodies to a solid support and contacting these with a biological extract such as serum, blood, lymph or other bodily fluid, cell extract or cell biopsy. Labeled anti-Akt kinase antibodies can then be used to detect immobilized Akt kinase. This assay can be varied in any number of ways and all variations are encompassed by the present invention and known to one skilled in the art. This approach can enable rapid detection and quantitation of Akt kinase levels using, for example, a serum-based assay.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">In one embodiment, an Akt ELISA assay kit may be used in the present invention. For example, a Cellular Activation of Signaling ELISA kit for Akt S473 from Super Array Bioscience can be utilized in the present invention. In one embodiment, the antibody can be an anti-part antibody that recognizes Akt S473. ELISA assay kit containing an anti-Akt antibody and additional reagents, including, but not limited to, washing buffer, antibody dilution buffer, blocking buffer, cell staining solution, developing solution, stop solution, secondary antibodies, and distilled water.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Nucleotide Detection</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">In another embodiment, a method to detect Akt kinases is provided by detecting the level of expression in a cell of a polynucleotide encoding an Akt kinase. Expression of the polynucleotide can be determined using any suitable technique known to one skilled in the art. In one embodiment, a labeled polynucleotide encoding an Akt kinase can be utilized as a probe in a Northern blot of an RNA extract obtained from the cell. In other embodiments, a nucleic acid extract from an animal can be utilized in concert with oligonucleotide primers corresponding to sense and antisense sequences of a polynucleotide encoding the kinase, or flanking sequences thereof, in a nucleic acid amplification reaction such as RT PCR. A variety of automated solid-phase detection techniques are also available to one skilled in the art, for example, as described by Fodor et al. (Science, 1991. 251: p. 767-777) and Kazal et al. (Nature Medicine, 1996. 2: p. 753-759).</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">In other embodiments, methods are provided to detect Akt kinase encoding RNA transcripts. The RNA can be isolated from a cellular sample suspected of containing Akt kinase RNA, e.g. total RNA isolated from human cancer tissue. RNA can be isolated by methods known in the art, e.g. using TRIZOL reagent (GIBCO-BRL/Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, Md.). Oligo-dT, or random-sequence oligonucleotides, as well as sequence-specific oligonucleotides can be employed as a primer in a reverse transcriptase reaction to prepare first-strand cDNAs from the isolated RNA. Resultant first-strand cDNAs can then amplified with sequence-specific oligonucleotides in PCR reactions to yield an amplified product.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Polymerase chain reaction or &#x201c;PCR&#x201d; refers to a procedure or technique in which amounts of a preselected fragment of nucleic acid, RNA and/or DNA, are amplified as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,195. Generally, sequence information from the ends of the region of interest or beyond is employed to design oligonucleotide primers. These primers will be identical or similar in sequence to opposite strands of the template to be amplified. PCR can be used to amplify specific RNA sequences and cDNA transcribed from total cellular RNA. See generally Mullis et al. (Quant Biol, 1987. 51: p. 263; Erlich, eds., PCR Technology, 1989, Stockton Press, NY). Thus, amplification of specific nucleic acid sequences by PCR relies upon oligonucleotides or &#x201c;primers&#x201d; having conserved nucleotide sequences wherein the conserved sequences are deduced from alignments of related gene or protein sequences, e.g. a sequence comparison of mammalian Akt kinase genes. For example, one primer is prepared which is predicted to anneal to the antisense strand and another primer prepared which is predicted to anneal to the sense strand of a cDNA molecule which encodes a Akt kinase. To detect the amplified product, the reaction mixture is typically subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis or other convenient separation technique and the relative presence of the Akt kinase specific amplified DNA detected. For example, Akt kinase amplified DNA may be detected using Southern hybridization with a specific oligonucleotide probe or comparing its electrophoretic mobility with DNA standards of known molecular weight. Isolation, purification and characterization of the amplified Akt kinase DNA can be accomplished by excising or eluting the fragment from the gel (for example, see references Lawn et al., Nucleic Acids Res, 1981. 2: p. 6103; Goeddel et al., Nucleic Acids Res, 1980. 8: p. 4057), cloning the amplified product into a cloning site of a suitable vector, such as the pCRII vector (Invitrogen), sequencing the cloned insert and comparing the DNA sequence to the known sequence of LIM kinase. The relative amounts of LIM kinase mRNA and cDNA can then be determined.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">In one embodiment, real-time PCR can be used to determine transcriptional levels of Akt nucleotides. Determination of transcriptional activity also includes a measure of potential translational activity based on available mRNA transcripts. Real-time PCR as well as other PCR procedures use a number of chemistries for detection of PCR product including the binding of DNA binding fluorophores, the 5&#x2032; endonuclease, adjacent liner and hairpin oligoprobes and the self-fluorescing amplicons. These chemistries and real-time PCR in general are discussed, for example, in Mackay et al., Nucleic Acids Res, 2002. 30(6): p. 1292-1305; Walker, J Biochem Mol Toxicology, 2001, 15(3): p. 121-127; Lewis et al., J Pathol. 2001. 195: p. 66-71.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">In an alternate embodiment, the aberrant expression of Akt can be identified by contacting a nucleotide sequences isolated from a biological sample with an oligonucleotide probe having a sequence complementary to an Akt sequences selected from the nucleotide sequences of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, <b>7</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, or <b>8</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, or fragment thereof, and then detecting the sequence by hybridizing the probe to the sequence, and comparing the results to a normal sample. The hybridization of the probe to the biological sample can be detected by labeling the probe using any detectable agent. The probe can be labeled for example, with a radioisotope, or with biotin, fluorescent dye, electron-dense reagent, enzyme, hapten or protein for which antibodies are available. The detectable label can be assayed by any desired means, including spectroscopic, photochemical, biochemical, immunochemical, radioisotopic, or chemical means. The probe can also be detected using techniques such as an oligomer restriction technique, a dot blot assay, a reverse dot blot assay, a line probe assay, and a 5&#x2032; nuclease assay. Alternatively, the probe can be detected using any of the generally applicable DNA array technologies, including macroarray, microarray and DNA microchip technologies. The oligonucleotide probe typically includes approximately at least 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 25 or 28 nucleotides that hybridise to the nucleotides selected from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a</i>-<i>e</i>, <b>7</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, and <b>8</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, or a fragment thereof. It is generally not preferred to use a probe that is greater than approximately 25 or 28 nucleotides in length. The oligonucleotide probe is designed to identify an Akt nucleotide sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Kinase Assays</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">The activity of the Akt kinases can be measured using any suitable kinase assay known in the art. For example, and not by way of limitation, the methods described in Hogg et al (Oncogene, 1994. 9; p. 98-96), Mills et al (J Biol Chem, 1992. 267: p. 16000-006) and Tomizawa et al. (FEBS Lett, 2001. 492: p. 221-7), Schmandt et al. (J Immunol, 1994. 152: p. 96-105) can be used. Further serine, threonine and tyrosine kinase assays are described in Ausubel et al. (Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, 1999, unit 17.6).</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Akt kinase assays can generally use an Akt polypeptide, a labeled donor substrate, and a receptor substrate that is either specific or non-specific for Akt. In such assays Akt transfers a labeled moiety from the donor substrate to the receptor substrate, and kinase activity is measured by the amount of labeled moiety transferred from the donor substrate to the receptor substrate. Akt polypeptide can be produced using various expression systems, can be purified from cells, can be in the form of a cleaved or uncleaved recombinant fusion protein and/or can have non-Akt polypeptide sequences, for example a His tag or .beta.-galactosidase at its N- or C-terminus, Akt activity can be assayed in cancerous cells lines if the cancerous cell lines are used as a source of the Akt to be assayed. Suitable donor substrates for Akt assays include any molecule that is susceptible to dephosphorylation by Akt, such as, for example include .gamma.-labeled ATP and ATP analogs, wherein the label is <sup>33</sup>P, <sup>32</sup>P, <sup>35</sup>S or any other radioactive isotope or a suitable fluorescent marker. Suitable recipient substrates for Akt assays include any polypeptide or other molecule that is susceptible to phosphorylation by Akt. Recipient substrates can be derived from fragments of in vivo targets of Akt. Recipient substrates fragments can be 8 to 50 amino acids in length, usually 10 to 30 amino acids and particularly of about 10, 12, 15, 18, 20 and 25 amino acids in length. Further recipient substrates can be determined empirically using a set of different polypeptides or other molecules. Targets of Recipient substrates for TTK can be capable of being purified from other components of the reaction once the reaction has been performed. This purification is usually done through a molecular interaction, where the recipient substrates is biotinylated and purified through its interaction with streptavidin, or a specific antibody is available that can specifically recognize the recipient substrates. The reaction can be performed in a variety of conditions, such as on a solid support, in a gel, in solution or in living cells. The choice of detection methods depends on type of label used for the donor molecule and may include, for example, measurement of incorporated radiation or fluorescence by autoradiography, scintillation, scanning or fluorography.</p>

<p id="p-0182" num="0181">In further embodiments of the present invention, the compounds disclosed herein can be used in the treatment of angiogenesis-related diseases.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">Antiangiogenic small molecules include thalidomide, which acts in part by inhibiting NFkB, 2-methoxyestradiol, which influences microtubule activation and hypoxia inducing factor (HTF1a) activation, cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX2) inhibitors, and low doses of conventional chemotherapeutic agents, including cyclophosphamide, taxanes, and vinca alkaloids (vincristine, vinblastine) (D'Amato R. J. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 1994. 91: p. 3964-3968; D'Amato R. J. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 1994. 91: p. 4082-4085). In addition, certain tyrosine kinase inhibitors indirectly decrease angiogenesis by decreasing production of VEGF and other proangiogenic factors by tumor and stromal cells. These drugs include Herceptin, imatinib (Glivec), and Iressa (Bergers G et al., J Clin Invest, 2003. 111: p. 1287-1295; Ciardiello F. et al., Clin Cancer Res, 2001. 7: p. 1459-1465; Plum S. M. et al., Clin Cancer Res, 2003. 9: p. 4619-4626).</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Recently, angiogenesis inhibitors have moved from animal models to human patients. Angiogenesis inhibitors represent a promising treatment for a variety of cancers. Recently, Avastin a high affinity antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has been shown to prolong life as a single agent in advanced renal cell carcinoma and prolong life in combination with chemotherapy in advanced colon cancer (Yang J. C. et al., New Eng J Med, 2003. 349: p. 427-434; Kabbinavar F. et al., J Clin Onc, 2003. 21: p. 60-65).</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">Angiogenesis-related diseases include, but are not limited to, inflammatory, autoimmune, and infectious diseases; angiogenesis-dependent cancer, including, for example, solid tumors, blood born tumors such as leukemias, and tumor metastases; benign tumors, for example hemangiomas, acoustic neuromas, neurofibromas, trachomas, and pyogenic granulomas; rheumatoid arthritis; psoriasis; eczema; ocular angiogenic diseases, for example, diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, macular degeneration, corneal graft rejection, neovascular glaucoma, retrolental fibroplasia, rubeosis; Osler-Webber Syndrome; myocardial angiogenesis; plaque neovascularization; telangiectasia; hemophiliac joints; angiofibroma; and wound granulation. In addition, compositions of this invention can be used to treat diseases such as, but not limited to, intestinal adhesions, atherosclerosis, scleroderma, warts, and hypertrophic scars (i.e., keloids). Compositions of this invention can also be used in the treatment of diseases that have angiogenesis as a pathologic consequence such as cat scratch disease (<i>Rochele minalia quintosa</i>), ulcers (<i>Helobacter pylori</i>), tuberculosis, and leprosy.</p>
<heading id="h-0015" level="1">6.1. Treatment of Drug Resistant Tumors or Cancers</heading>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">The invention provides compounds that can be used to treat drug resistant cancer, including the embodiments of cancers and the triciribine compound and/or the a molecule that modulates the HER2/neu (erbB2) receptor, for example, trastuzumab or a salt thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">Multidrug resistance (MDR) occurs in human cancers and can be a significant obstacle to the success of chemotherapy. Multidrug resistance is a phenomenon whereby tumor cells in vitro that have been exposed to one cytotoxic agent develop cross-resistance to a range of structurally and functionally unrelated compounds. In addition, MDR can occur intrinsically in some cancers without previous exposure to chemotherapy agents. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides methods for the treatment of a patient with a drug resistant cancer, for example, multidrug resistant cancer, by administration of TCN, TCN-P or a related compound and a molecule that modulates the HER2/neu (erbB2) receptor, for example, trastuzumab or a salt thereof. In certain embodiments, TCN, TCN-P and related compounds and a molecule that modulates the HER2/neu (erbB2) receptor, for example, trastuzumab or a salt thereof, can be used to treat cancers that are resistant to taxol alone, rapamycin, tamoxifen, cisplatin, and/or gefitinib (iressa).</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">In one embodiment, TCN, TCN-P or a related compound and a molecule that modulates the HER2/neu (erbB2) receptor, for example, trastuzumab or a salt thereof, can be used for the treatment of drug resistant cancers of the colon, bone, kidney, adrenal, pancreas, liver and/or any other cancer known in the art or described herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0016" level="1">6.2. Combination Therapy</heading>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">In one embodiment, the triciribine compounds and a molecule that modulates the HER2/neu (erbB2) receptor, for example, trastuzumab or a salt thereof, can be administered together with other cytotoxic agents. In another embodiment, the triciribine compounds and a molecule that modulates the HER2/neu (erbB2) receptor, for example, trastuzumab or a salt thereof, and compositions thereof, when used in the treatment of solid tumors, can be administered the use of radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">In another embodiment of the present invention, the triciribine compounds and a molecule that modulates the HER2/neu (erbB2) receptor, for example, trastuzumab or a salt thereof, and compositions disclosed herein can be combined with at least one additional chemotherapeutic agent. The additional agents can be administered in combination or alternation with the compounds disclosed herein. The drugs can form part of the same composition, or be provided as a separate composition for administration at the same time or a different time.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">In one embodiment, the triciribine compounds and a molecule that modulates the HER2/neu (erbB2) receptor, for example, trastuzumab or a salt thereof, disclosed herein can be combined with antiangiogenic agents to enhance their effectiveness, or combined with other antiangiogenic agents and administered together with other cytotoxic agents. In another embodiment, the triciribine compounds and a molecule that modulates the HER2/neu (erbB2) receptor, for example, trastuzumab or a salt thereof, and compositions, when used in the treatment of solid tumors, can be administered with the agents selected from, but not limited to IL-12, retinoids, interferons, angiostatin, endostatin, thalidomide, thrombospondin-1, thrombospondin-2, captopryl, anti-neoplastic agents such as alpha interferon, COMP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, methotrexate and prednisone), etoposide, mBACOD (methortrexate, bleomycin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and dexamethasone), PRO-MACE/MOPP (prednisone, methotrexate (w/leucovin rescue), doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide/mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine), vincristine, vinblastine, angioinhibins, TNP-470, pentosan polysulfate, platelet factor 4, angiostatin LM-609, SU-101, CM-101, Techgalan, thalidomide, SP-PG and radiation. In further embodiments, the compounds and compositions disclosed herein can be administered in combination or alternation with, for example, drugs with antimitotic effects, such as those which target cytoskeletal elements, including podophylotoxins or vinca alkaloids (vincristine, vinblastine); antimetabolite drugs (such as 5-fluorouracil, cytarabinc, gemcitabine, purine analogues such as pentostatin, methotrexate); alkylating agents or nitrogen mustards (such as nitrosoureas, cyclophosphamide or ifosphamide); drugs which target DNA such as the antracycline drugs adriamycin, doxorubicin, pharmorubicin or epirubicin; drags which target topoisomerases such as etoposide; hormones and hormone agonists or antagonists such as estrogens, antiestrogens (tamoxifen and related compounds) and androgens, flutamide, leuprorelin, goserelin, cyprotrone or octreotide; drugs which target signal transduction in tumour cells including antibody derivatives such as herceptin; alkylating drugs such as platinum drugs (cis-platin, carbonplatin, oxaliplatin, paraplatin) or nitrosoureas; drugs potentially affecting metastasis of tumours such as matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors; gene therapy and antisense agents; antibody therapeutics; other bioactive compounds of marine origin, notably the didemnins such as aplidine; steroid analogues, in particular dexamethasone, anti-inflammatory drugs, including nonsteroidal agents (such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen) or steroids and their derivatives in particular dexamethasone; anti-emetic drugs, including 5HT-3 inhibitors (such as gramisetron or ondasetron), and steroids and their derivatives in particular dexamethasone. In still further embodiments, the compounds and compositions can be used in combination or alternation with the chemotherapeutic agents disclosed below in Table 3.</p>

The compounds of the invention may be derivatized as the corresponding salts, esters, enol ethers or esters, acetals, ketals, orthoesters, hemiacetals, hemiketals, acids, bases, solvates, hydrates or prodrugs prior to formulation. The concentrations of the compounds in the compositions are effective for delivery of an amount, upon administration, that treats, prevents, or ameliorates one or more of the symptoms of the target disease or disorder. In one embodiment, the compositions are formulated for single dosage administration. To formulate a composition, the weight fraction of compound is dissolved, suspended, dispersed or otherwise mixed in a selected carrier at an effective concentration such that the treated condition is relieved, prevented, or one or more symptoms are ameliorated.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">Compositions suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as, but not limited to, tablets, caplets, pills or dragees capsules, or cachets, each containing a predetermined amount of one or more of the compositions; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension is an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil emulsion or as a bolus, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">Liquid pharmaceutically administrable compositions can, for example, be prepared by dissolving, dispersing, or otherwise mixing a triciribine compound and optional pharmaceutical adjuvants in a carrier, such as, for example, water, saline, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, glycols, ethanol, and the like, to thereby form a solution or suspension. If desired, the pharmaceutical composition to be administered may also contain minor amounts of nontoxic auxiliary substances such as wetting agents, emulsifying agents, solubilizing agents, pH buffering agents, preservatives, flavoring agents, and the like, for example, acetate, sodium citrate, cyclodextrine derivatives, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine sodium acetate, triethanolamine oleate, and other such agents.

When the carrier is a liquid (for example, a nasal spray or as nasal drops), one or more of the compositions can be admixed in an aqueous or oily solution, and inhaled or sprayed into the nasal passage.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">Compositions suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing one or more of the compositions and appropriate carriers.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">Compositions suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The compositions may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example, sealed ampules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets of the kind previously described above.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">Pharmaceutical organic or inorganic solid or liquid carrier media suitable for enteral or parenteral administration can be used to fabricate the compositions. Gelatin, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, talc, vegetable and animal fats and oils, gum, polyalkylene glycol, water, or other known carriers may all be suitable as carrier media.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">Compositions including triciribine compounds and a molecule that modulates the HER2/neu (erbB2) receptor, for example, trastuzumab or a salt thereof, may be used in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carrier mediums and/or excipients. As used herein, &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable carrier medium&#x201d; includes any and all carriers, solvents, diluents, or other liquid vehicles, dispersion or suspension aids, surface active agents, isotonic agents, thickening or emulsifying agents, preservatives, solid binders, lubricants, adjuvants, vehicles, delivery systems, disintegrants, absorbents, preservatives, surfactants, colorants, flavorants, or sweeteners and the like, as suited to the particular dosage form desired.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">Additionally, the compositions including triciribine compounds and a molecule that modulates the HER2/neu (erbB2) receptor, for example, trastuzumab or a salt thereof, may be combined with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, and, optionally, sustained-release matrices, such as biodegradable polymers, to form therapeutic compositions. A &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable excipient&#x201d; includes a non-toxic solid, semi-solid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compositions will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular host will depend upon a variety of factors, including for example, the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder, activity of the specific composition employed; the specific composition employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration; route of administration; rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; the triciribine compound and/or the a molecule that modulates the HER2/neu (erbB2) receptor, for example, trastuzumab or a salt thereof, used in combination or coincidental with the specific composition employed; and like factors well known in the medical arts. For example, it is well within the skill of the art to start doses of the composition at levels lower than those required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">Compositions including triciribine compounds and a molecule that modulates the HER2/neu (erbB2) receptor, for example, trastuzumab or a salt thereof, are preferably formulated in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. &#x201c;Dosage unit form&#x201d; as used herein refers to a physically discrete unit of the composition appropriate for the host to be treated. Each dosage should contain the quantity of composition calculated to produce the desired therapeutic affect either as such, or in association with the selected pharmaceutical carrier medium.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit, daily sub-dose, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the administered ingredient. For example, approximately 1-5 mg per day of a compound disclosed herein can reduce the volume of a solid tumor in mice.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">The dosage will depend on host factors such as weight, age, surface area, metabolism, tissue distribution, absorption rate and excretion rate. In one embodiment, approximately 0.5 to 7 grams per day of a triciribine compound disclosed herein may be administered to humans. Optionally, approximately 1 to 4 grams per day of the compound can be administered to humans. In certain embodiments 0.001-5 mg/day is administered to a human. The therapeutically effective dose level will depend on many factors as noted above. In addition, it is well within the skill of the art to start doses of the composition at relatively low levels, and increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">Compositions including triciribine compounds and a molecule that modulates the HER2/neu (erbB2) receptor, for example, trastuzumab or a salt thereof, may be used with a sustained-release matrix, which can be made of materials, usually polymers, which are degradable by enzymatic or acid-based hydrolysis or by dissolution. Once inserted into the body, the matrix is acted upon by enzymes and body fluids. A sustained-release matrix for example is chosen from biocompatible materials such as liposomes, polylactides (polylactic acid), polyglycolide (polymer of glycolic acid), polylactide co-glycolide (copolymers of lactic acid and glycolic acid), polyanhydrides, poly(ortho)esters, polypeptides, hyaluronic acid, collagen, chondroitin sulfate, carboxcylic acids, fatty acids, phospholipids, polysaccharides, nucleic acids, polyamino acids, amino acids such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, isoleucine, polynucleotides, polyvinyl propylene, polyvinylpyrrolidone and silicone. A preferred biodegradable matrix is a matrix of one of either polylactide, polyglycolide, or polylactide co-glycolide (co-polymers of lactic acid and glycolic acid).</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">The triciribine compounds and a molecule that modulates the HER2/neu (erbB2) receptor, for example, trastuzumab or a salt thereof, may also be administered in the form of liposomes. As is known in the art, liposomes are generally derived from phospholipids or other lipid substances. Liposomes are formed by mono- or multi-lamellar hydrated liquid crystals that are dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any non-toxic, physiologically-acceptable and metabolizable lipid capable of forming liposomes can be used. The liposome can contain, in addition to one or more compositions of the present invention, stabilizers, preservatives, excipients, and the like. Examples of lipids are the phospholipids and the phosphatidyl cholines (lecithins), both natural and synthetic. Methods to form liposomes are known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">The triciribine compounds and a molecule that modulates the HER2/neu (erbB2) receptor, for example, trastuzumab or a salt thereof, may be formulated as aerosols for application, such as by inhalation. These formulations for administration to the respiratory tract can be in the form of an aerosol or solution for a nebulizer, or as a microfine powder for insufflation, alone or in combination with an inert carrier such as lactose. In such a case, the particles of the formulation will, in one embodiment, have diameters of less than 50 microns, in one embodiment less than 10 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">Compositions including the triciribine compounds and a molecule that modulates the HER2/neu (erbB2) receptor, for example, trastuzumab or a salt thereof, may be used in combination with other compositions and/or procedures for the treatment of the conditions described above. For example, a tumor may be treated conventionally with surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy combined with one or more compositions of the present invention and then one or more compositions of the present invention may be subsequently administered to the patient to extend the dormancy of micrometastases and to stabilize, inhibit, or reduce the growth of any residual primary tumor.</p>
<heading id="h-0018" level="1">7.1. Additional Embodiments</heading>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">The pharmaceutical compositions including triciribine compounds and a molecule that modulates the HER2/neu (erbB2) receptor, for example, trastuzumab or a salt thereof, can be formulated according to known methods for preparing pharmaceutically useful compositions. Formulations are described in a number of sources which are well known and readily available to those skilled in the art. For example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa. describes formulations which can be used in connection with the subject invention. Formulations suitable for administration include, for example, aqueous sterile injection solutions, which may contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and nonaqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the condition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, water for injections, prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powder, granules, tablets, etc. It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the formulations of the subject invention can include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">The methods of the present invention, for example, for inhibiting the growth of a cancerous cell, can be advantageously combined with at least one additional therapeutic method, including but not limited to chemotherapy, radiation therapy, therapy that selectively inhibits Ras oncogenic signaling, or any other therapy known to those of skill in the art of the treatment and management of cancer, such as administration of an anti-cancer agent.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">Administration of API-2 (triciribine) as a salt may be carried out. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are organic acid addition salts formed with acids which form a physiological acceptable anion, for example, tosylate, methanesulfonate, acetate, citrate, malonate, tartarate, succinate, benzoate, ascorbate, alpha-ketoglutarate, and alpha-glycerophosphate. Suitable inorganic salts may also be formed, including hydrochloride, sulfate, nitrate, bicarbonate, and carbonate salts.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be obtained using standard procedures well known in the art, for example by reacting a sufficiently basic compound such as an amine with a suitable acid affording a physiologically acceptable anion. Alkali metal (for example, sodium, potassium or lithium) or alkaline earth metal (for example calcium) salts of carboxylic acids can also be made.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">The triciribine compounds and a molecule that modulates the HER2/neu (erbB2) receptor, for example, trastuzumab or a salt thereof, can be formulated as pharmaceutical compositions and administered to a subject, such as a human or veterinary patient, in a variety of forms adapted to the chosen route of administration, i.e., orally or parenterally, by intravenous, intramuscular, topical or subcutaneous routes.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">Thus, the triciribine compounds and a molecule that modulates the HER2/neu (erbB2) receptor, for example, trastuzumab or a salt thereof, of the present invention may be systemically administered, e.g., orally, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle (i.e., carrier) such as an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier. They may be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsules, may be compressed into tablets, or may be incorporated directly with the food of the patient's diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the compounds may be combined with one or more excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1% of active agent. The percentage of the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 to about 60% of the weight of a given unit dosage form. The amount of the active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage level will be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">The tablets, troches, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain the following: binders such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, fructose, lactose or aspartame or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring may be added. When the unit dosage form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier, such as a vegetable oil or a polyethylene glycol. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the solid unit dosage form. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with gelatin, wax, shellac or sugar and the like. A syrup or elixir may contain the compounds of the invention, sucrose or fructose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Of course, any material used in preparing any unit dosage form should be pharmaceutically acceptable and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the compounds of the invention may be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and devices.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">The triciribine compounds and a molecule that modulates the HER2/neu (erbB2) receptor, for example, trastuzumab or a salt thereof, may also be administered intravenously or intraperitoneally by infusion or injection. Solutions of the active agents or their salts can be prepared in water, optionally mixed with a nontoxic surfactant. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, triacetin, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">The pharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for injection or infusion can include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions or sterile powders including the active ingredient which are adapted for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable or infusible solutions or dispersions, optionally encapsulated in liposomes. In all cases, the ultimate dosage form must be sterile, fluid and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The liquid carrier or vehicle can be a solvent or liquid dispersion medium including, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol (for example, glycerol propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and the like), vegetable oils, nontoxic glyceryl esters, and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the formation of liposomes, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions or by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, buffers or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating compounds of the invention in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filter sterilization. In the case of sterile powders for she preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and the freeze drying techniques, which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient present in the previously sterile-filtered solutions.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">For topical administration, the triciribine compounds and a molecule that modulates the HER2/neu (erbB2) receptor, for example, trastuzumab or a salt thereof, may be applied in pure-form, i.e., when they are liquids. However, it will generally be desirable to administer them to the skin as compositions or formulations, in combination with a dermatologically acceptable carrier, which may be a solid or a liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">Useful solid carriers include finely divided solids such as talc, clay, microcrystalline cellulose, silica, alumina and the like. Useful liquid carriers include water, alcohols or glycols or water-alcohol/glycol blends, in which the compounds of the invention can be dissolved or dispersed at effective levels, optionally with the aid of non-toxic surfactants. Adjuvants such as fragrances and additional antimicrobial agents can be added to optimize the properties for a given use. The resultant liquid compositions can be applied from absorbent pads, used to impregnate bandages and other dressings, or sprayed onto the affected area using pump-type or aerosol sprayers.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">Thickeners such as synthetic polymers, fatty acids, fatty acid salts and esters, fatty alcohols, modified celluloses or modified mineral materials can also be employed with liquid carriers to form spreadable pastes, gels, ointments, soaps, and the like, for application directly to the skin of the user. Examples of useful dermatological compositions which can be used to deliver the compounds of the invention to the skin are disclosed in Jacquet et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,392), Geria (U.S. Pat. No. 4,992,478), Smith et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,559,157) and Woltzman (U.S. Pat. No. 4,320,508).</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">Useful dosages of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be determined by comparing their in vitro activity, and in vivo activity in animal models. Methods for the extrapolation of effective dosages in mice, and other animals, to humans are known to the art; for example, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,938,949.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">In one non-limiting embodiment, the concentration of the active agent in a liquid composition, such as a lotion, can be from about 0.1-25 wt-%, or from about 0.5-10 wt.-%. In one embodiment, the concentration in a semi-solid or solid composition such as a gel or a powder can be about 0.1-5 wt.-%, preferably about 0.5-2.5 wt.-%. In one embodiment, single dosages for injection, infusion or ingestion will generally vary between 5-1500 mg, and may be administered, i.e., 1-3 times daily, to yield levels of about 0.1-50 mg/kg, for adults. A non-limiting dosage of the present invention can be between 7.5 to 45 mg per clay, administered orally, with appropriate adjustment for the body weight of an individual.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">Accordingly, the present invention includes a pharmaceutical composition including triciribine compounds and a molecule that modulates the HER2/neu (erbB2) receptor, for example, trastuzumab or a salt thereof, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Pharmaceutical compositions adapted for oral, topical or parenteral administration, including an amount of triciribine compounds and a molecule that modulates the HER2/neu (erbB2) receptor, for example, trastuzumab or a salt thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, constitute a preferred embodiment of the invention. The dose administered to a subject, particularly a human, in the context of the present invention should be sufficient to affect a therapeutic response in the patient over a reasonable time frame. One skilled in the art will recognize that dosage will depend upon a variety of factors including the condition of the animal the body weight of the animal, as well as the severity and stage of the cancer.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">A suitable dose is that which will result in a concentration of the triciribine compounds and a molecule that modulates the HER2/neu (erbB2) receptor, for example, trastuzumab, in tumor tissue which is known to affect the desired response. The preferred dosage is the amount which results in maximum inhibition of cancer cell growth, without unmanageable side effects. Administration of API-2 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) can be continuous or at distinct intervals, as can be determined by a person of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">Mammalian species which benefit from the disclosed methods for the inhibition of cancer cell growth, include, but are not limited to, primates, such as apes, chimpanzees, orangutans, humans, monkeys; domesticated animals (e.g., pets) such as dogs, cats, guinea pigs, hamsters, Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs, rabbits, and ferrets; domesticated farm animals such as cows, buffalo, bison, horses, donkey, swine, sheep, and goats; exotic animals typically found in zoos, such as bear, lions, tigers, panthers, elephants, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, giraffes, antelopes, sloth, gazelles, zebras, wildebeests, prairie dogs, koala bears, kangaroo, opossums, raccoons, pandas, hyena, seals, sea lions, elephant seals, otters, porpoises, dolphins, and whales.

<p id="p-0247" num="0246">Identification of Small Molecule Inhibitor of Akt Signaling Pathway, API-2.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">Frequent alterations of Akt has been detected in human cancer and disruption of Akt pathway induces apoptosis and inhibits tumor growth (Jetzt A, et al., Cancer Res, 2003. 63: p. 697-706, 2003). Thus, Akt is considered as an attractive molecular target for development of novel cancer therapeutics. To identify small molecule inhibitor(s) of Akt, a chemical library of 1,992-compounds from the NCI (the NCI Diversity Set) is evaluated for agents capable of inhibition of growth in AKT2-transformed but not empty vector LXSN-transfected NIH3T3 cells. Repeated experiments showed that 32 compounds inhibited growth only in AKT2-transformed cells. The most potent of these compounds. API-2 (NCI identifier: NSC 154020), can suppress cell growth at a concentration of 50 nM. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows the chemical structure of API-2, which is also known as triciribine (Schweinsberg P. D. et al., Biochem Pharmacol, 1981. 30: p. 2521-2526). The fact that API-2 inhibits selectively AKT-2 transformed cells over untransformed parental cells prompted as to determine whether API-2 is an inhibitor of AKT2 kinase. To this end, AKT2 is immunoprecipitated with anti-AKT2 antibody from AKT-2 transformed NIH3T3 cells following treatment with API-2. AKT2 immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-phospho-Akt antibodies. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, API-2 significantly inhibited AKT2 phosphorylation at both threonine-309 and serine-474, which are required for full activation of AKT2 (Datta S. R. et al., Genes Dev, 1999. 13: p. 2905-2927). As three isoforms of Akt share high homology and similar structure, the effect of API-2 on their kinase activities is evaluated. HEK293 cells are transfected with HA-Akt1, -AKT2 and -AKT3, serum-starved overnight and treated with API-2 for 60 min prior to EGF (50 ng/ml) stimulation. Triple experiments showed that API-2 suppressed EGF-induced kinase activity and phosphorylation of Akt1, AKT2 and AKT3 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>). However, kinase activity of recombinant constitutively active AKT2 (Myr-AKT2) is not inhibited by API-2 in an in vitro kinase reaction (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>), suggesting that API-2 does not directly inhibit Akt in vitro and that API-2 neither functions as ATP competitor nor as the substrate competitor that binds to active site of Akt.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">API-2 does not Inhibit Known Upstream Activators of Akt.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">It has been well documented that Akt is activated by extracellular stimuli and intracellular signal molecules, such as active Ras and Src, through a PI3K-dependent manner. Therefore, API-2 inhibition of Akt could result from targeting upstream molecule(s) of Akt. As PI3K and PDK1 are direct upstream regulators of Akt (Datta S. R. et al., Genes Dev, 1999. 13: p. 2905-2927), whether API-2 inhibits PI3K and/or PDK1 is examined. HEK293 cells are serum-starved and then can be treated with API-2 or PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, for 30 min prior to EGF stimulation. PI3K is immunoprecipitated with anti-p110 antibody. The immunoprecipitates are subjected to in vitro PI3K kinase assay using PI-4-P as a substrate. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the EGF-induced PI3K activity is inhibited by wortmannin but not by API-2. To evaluate the effect of API-2 on PDK1, an assay in which recombinant PDK1 promotes the threonine-309 phosphorylation of AKT2 peptides is used in the presence of lipid vesicles containing phosphotidylinositol. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the assay is potently inhibited by the control PDK1 inhibitor staurosporine (IC50=5 nM). In contrast, API-2 displayed only 21% inhibition of the assay at the highest concentration tested (5.1 &#x3bc;M). To further evaluate the effect of API-2 on PDK1 activation, the autophosphorylation level of PDK1 at serine-241, a residue that is phosphorylated by itself and is critical for its activity is examined (Datta S. R. et al., Genes Dev, 1999. 13: p. 2905-2927), following API-2 treatment of HEK293 cells. Triplicate experiments show that phosphorylation levels of PDK1 are not inhibited by API-2 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>). However, PI3K inhibitor wortmannin can inhibit EGF-stimulated PDK1 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">API-2 is Highly Selective for the Akt Over PKC, PKA, SGK, STAT, JNK, p38, and ERK Signaling Pathways.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">Akt belongs to AGC (PKA/PKG/PKC) kinase family, which also include PKA, PKC, serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase, p70<sup>S6K</sup>, mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase and PKC-related kinase. Among AGC kinase family, protein structures of PKA, PKC and SGK are more close to Akt kinase than other members. Therefore, next examined are the effects of API-2 on the enzymatic activities of these 3 kinases. HEK293 cells are transfected with HA-tagged PKA, PKC&#x3b1;, or SGK. In vitro kinase assay and immunoblotting analysis show that the kinase activities of PKA and PKC are inhibited by PKA1 and Ro 33-8220, a PKC inhibitor, respectively, whereas API-2 exhibits no effect on their activities (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2C and 2E</figref>). Further, serum-induced SGK kinase activity is attenuated by wortmannin but not by API-2 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>). In addition, it is determined whether API-2 has effect on other oncogenic survival pathways. Western blotting analyses with commercially available anti-phospho-antibodies reveals that phosphorylation levels of Stat3, JNK, p38 and Erk1/2 were not affected by API-2 treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>). These data indicate that API-2 specifically inhibits Akt signaling pathway.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">API-2 Suppresses Cell Growth and Induces Apoptosis in Akt-Overexpressing/Activating Human Cancer Cell Lines.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">The ability of API-2 to selectively inhibit the Akt pathway suggests that it should inhibit proliferation and/or induces apoptosis preferentially in those tumor cells with aberrant expression/activation of Akt. As activation of Akt in human malignancies commonly results from overexpression of Akt or PTEN mutations, API-2 is used to treat the cells that express constitutively active Akt, caused by overexpression of AKT2 (OVCAR3, OVCAR8, PANC1 and AKT2-transformed NIH3T3) or mutations of the PTEN gene (PC-3, LNCaP, MDA-MB-468), and cells that do not (OVCAR5, DU-45, T47D, COLO357 and LXSN-NIH3T3) as well as melanoma cells that are activated by IGF-1 to activate Akt or do not respond to growth stimulation by IGF-1 (Satyamoorthy K. et al., Cancer Res, 2001. 61: p. 7318-7324). Immunoblotting analysis showed that phosphorylation levels of Akt are inhibited by API-2 only in the cells expressing elevated Akt or responding to IGF-1 simulation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) Accordingly, API-2 inhibited cell growth to a much higher degree in Akt-overexpressing/activating cells as compared to those with low levels of Akt. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, API-2 treatment inhibited cell proliferation by approximately 50-60% in Akt-overexpressing/activating cell lines, LNCaP, PC-3, OVCAR3, OVCA8, PANC1, MDA-MB-468, and WM35, whereas only by about 10-20% in DU145, OVCAR5, COLO357, T47D and WM852 cells, which exhibit low-levels of Akt or do not respond to growth stimulation by IGF-1. Moreover, API-2 induces apoptosis by 8-fold (OVCAR3), 6-fold (OVCAR8), 6-fold (PANC1), and 3-fold (AKT2-NIH3T3). No significant difference of apoptosis is observed between API-2 and vehicle (DMSO) treatment in OVCAR5, COLO357 and LXSN-NIH3T3 cells. Thus, API-2 inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis preferentially in cells that express aberrant Akt.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">API-2 Inhibits Downstream Targets of Akt.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">It has been shown that Akt exerts its cellular effects through phosphorylation of a number of proteins (Datta S. R. et al., Genes Dev, 1999. 13: p. 2905-2927), More than 20 proteins have been identified as Akt substrates, including the members of Forkhead protein family (FKHR, AFX and FKHRL1), tuberlin/TSC2, p70<sup>S6K</sup>, GSK-3 &#x25a1;, p21<sup>WAFl/Cipl</sup>, p27<sup>kipl</sup>, MDM2, Bad, ASK1 and IKK&#x25a1; etc. It is next examined whether API-2 inhibits downstream targets of Akt. As anti-phospho-tuberlin, -Bad, -AFX, and -GSK-3&#x3b2; antibodies are commercially available, therefore, the effect of API-2 on their phosphorylation induced by Akt was determined. Following API-2 (1 &#x3bc;M) treatment, OVCAR3 cells was lysed and immunoblotted with the individual anti-phospho-antibody. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> shows that API-2 considerably inhibited the phosphorylation levels of tuberlin leading to stabilization and upregulation of tuberin (Dan, H. C., et al., J Biol Chem, 2002. 277: p. 35364-35370). The phosphorylation levels of Bad, GSK-3&#x3b2;, and AFX are partially attenuated by API-2. These data suggest that API-2 induces cell death and cell growth arrest by inhibiting phosphorylation of its downstream targets. API-2 inhibition of Akt downstream targets at different degrees could be due to the fact that phosphorylation sites of these targets are also regulated by other kinase(s), for instance, Bad serine-136 is phosphorylated by PAK1 in addition to Akt (Schurmann, A., et al. Mol Cell Biol, 2000. 20; p. 453-461).</p>

When tumors reach about 100-150 mm<sup>3</sup>, animals are randomized and dosed i.p. with 0.2 ml vehicle of the triciribine compound and/or a molecule that modulates the HER2/neu (erbB2) receptor, for example, trastuzumab, daily.

<p id="p-0258" num="0257">API-2 Inhibits the Growth of Tumors in Nude Mice that Overexpress Akt.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">Frequent overexpression/activation and/or amplification of AKT1 and AKT2 in human ovarian and pancreatic cancer was shown (Cheng J. Q. and Nicosia S. V., in <i>Encyclopedic Reference of Cancer, </i>2001, Schwab D, Ed. Springer, Berlin Heidelberg and New York, p. 35-7). Inhibition of Akt pathway by inhibitors of PI3K, HSP70, Src and farnesyltransferase resulted in cell growth arrest and induction of apoptosis (Solit D. B. et al., Cancer Res, 2003. 63: p. 2139-2144; Xu, W., et al. Cancer Res, 2003. 63: p. 7777-7784). A recent study showed that the tumor growth of xenografts with elevated Akt was also significantly inhibited by intratumoral injection of adenovirus of dominant negative Akt (Jetzt A. et al., Cancer Res, 2003. 63: p. 697-706, 2003). Because API-2 inhibits Akt signaling and induces apoptosis and cell growth arrest only in cancer cells with elevated levels of Akt (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), the growth of tumors with elevated levels of Akt should be more sensitive to API-2 than that of tumors with low levels of Akt in nude mice. To this end, s.c. Akt-overexpressing cells (OVCAR3, OVCAR8 and PANC-1) are s.c. implanted into the right flank, and those cell lines that express low levels of Akt (OVCAR5 and COLO357) into the left flank of mice. When the tumors reach an average size of about 100-150 mm<sup>3</sup>, the animals are randomized and treated i.p. with either vehicle or API-2 (1 mg/kg/day). As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, OVCAR-5 and COLO357 tumors treated with vehicle grew to about 800-1,000 mm<sup>3 </sup>49 days after tumor implantation, OVCAR3, OVCAR8 and PANC1 tumors treated with vehicle control grew to about 700-900 mm<sup>3 </sup>49 days after tumor implantation. API-2 inhibited OVCAR3, OVCAR8 and PANC1 tumor growth by 90%, 88% and 80%, respectively. In contrast, API-2 has little effect on the growth of OVCAR5 and COLO357 cells in nude mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B-4D</figref> and data not shown). At dose 1 mg/kg/day, API-2 had no effects on blood glucose level, body weight, activity and food intake of mice. In treated tumor samples, Akt activity was inhibited by API-2 without change of total Akt content (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>). Taken together, these results indicate that API-2 selectively inhibits the growth of tumors with elevated levels of Akt.</p>

<p id="p-0277" num="0276">To find a strategy to overcome trastuzumab resistance, particularly resistance caused by PTEN loss, 6 different small molecule inhibitors were tested, which directly or indirectly targeted the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal transduction pathway, a major pathway activated by overexpression of ErbB2 and the loss of PTEN. The goal was to identify compounds that would exhibit synergistic effects with trastuzumab, preferably at a low dose of the compound in order to minimize toxicity. The drugs chosen targeted Akt, mTOR and integrin-linked kinase (ILK) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>). BT474.m1 cells are a tumorigenic subline of the BT474 breast cancer cell line and express high levels of ErbB2. When PTEN levels are decreased by transfection with PTEN antisense oligonucleotides (PTEN AS), BT474.m1 breast cancer cells become more resistant to the anti-proliferative effects of trastuzumab than cells with normal levels of PTEN and provide a good experimental model for breast cancers in which trastuzumab resistance is caused by PTEN loss (Nagata Y, et al., Cancer Cell, 2004. 6(2); p. 117-27 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9B and 9C</figref>). Nonspecific oligonucleotides (NS) were transfected as controls. Treatment with PTEN AS oligonucleotides effectively lowered PTEN levels (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>). Neither PTEN AS nor NS control oligonucleotides altered ErbB2 levels in the cells.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">PTEN AS and NS-transfected BT474.m1 cells were treated with each of the 6 compounds or trastuzumab alone and in combination for 5 days and evaluated cell proliferation as compared to DMSO-treated control. Using growth inhibition as a biological endpoint, we compared the ability of each drug to exhibit cooperative effects with trastuzumab using doses of drug that resulted in &#x2212;20-40% growth inhibition when administered alone (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">Almost all of the compounds displayed growth inhibitory effects, particularly at high concentrations and in cells with intact PTEN (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>). However, two of the compounds, triciribine and RAD001, markedly enhanced growth inhibition in the PTEN AS cells when combined with trastuzumab as compared to trastuzumab or either compound alone (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>). Triciribine (also called API-2), a compound that inhibits Akt activation, potentiated growth inhibition by trastuzumab over a 20-fold concentration range (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>). The mTOR inhibitor RAD001 (everolimus) increased growth inhibition by trastuzumab when RAD001 was administered at low doses (&#x3c;1 nM) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>). Strikingly, triciribine and RAD001 were able to cooperate with trastuzumab to inhibit cell growth at similar levels in the PTEN AS and NS cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9B and 9C</figref>). In essence, triciribine and RAD001 were able to restore trastuzumab sensitivity to PTEN-deficient cells. Triciribine and RADOO1 were also effective as single agents, both in PTEN AS and NS cells, at doses greater than 5 mM and 1.5 nM for triciribine and RAD001, respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 98 and 9C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">A third compound, the ILK inhibitor QLT0267, potentiated growth inhibition by trastuzumab within a narrow dose range (&#x2212;5-15 pM) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>). Because the dose range in which QLT0267 exhibited cooperative effects with trastuzumab was narrow, this compound further was not investigated further. At concentrations greater than 20 pM, QLT0267 had no cooperative effect with trastuzumab but significantly inhibited cell growth as a single agent.</p>

RAD001 did not significantly induce apoptosis alone or in combination with trastuzumab. Although the number of TUNEL-positive, apoptotic cells increased slightly following treatment with trastuzumab or triciribine alone, this increase was not statistically significant.

<heading id="h-0031" level="1">TCN Inhibits Activation of Akt and mTOR Inhibition of Downstream Signaling Molecules</heading>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">Immunoblot analysis verified that triciribine and RAD001 blocked activation of Akt and mTOR, important signaling molecules activated by ErbB2 and the targets of triciribine and RAD001 respectively. Phosphorylation of Akt on Thr308 and Ser473 was analyzed as an indicator of Akt activity and mTOR activity was assessed by the phosphorylation of p70S6K (70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase), an mTOR target. After triciribine treatment, phosphorylation of Akt on both sites was substantially decreased (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>). In PTEN-deficient cells, the levels of Akt phosphorylation following triciribine and trastuzumab combination treatment were similar to those seen in cells with intact PTEN (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, lanes 4&#x26;8). Thus, triciribine overcame the adverse effects of PTEN loss by effectively blocking Akt activation, RAD001 dramatically blocked phosphorylation of p70S6K (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>). However, RAD001 combined with trastuzumab did not lower p70S6K phosphorylation beyond that seen with RAD001 alone (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>). A feedback loop has been recently identified which results in Akt phosphorylation and activation following treatment with mTOR inhibitors, such as RAD001 (O'Reilly K. E. et al., Cancer Res, 2006. 66(3); p. 1500-8). It was also observed that feedback activation of Akt by RAD001 and combination therapy with trastuzumab and RAD001 eliminated Akt phosphorylation by this feedback loop (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, lanes 3 vs. 4), consistent with the notion that Akt activation following mTOR inhibition is dependent on upstream receptor tyrosine kinases (O'Reilly K. E. et al., Cancer Res, 2006. 66(3): p. 1500-8). In summary, both drugs inhibited their predicted target kinases and combination treatment had a larger inhibitory effect on the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway than any single agent, even in PTEN-deficient cells.</p>

<p id="p-0286" num="0285">Female, 6-week-old, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice were from Taconic Farms (Hudson, N.Y.). Tumor xenografts were performed as described in Nagata Y. et al., Cancer Cell, 2004. 6(2): p. 117-27. When the xenograft tumors reached the average size of 100-150 mm<sup>3</sup>, the mice were divided into 6 groups, each with 7 mice and an even distribution of tumor sizes, and treated as follows. PTEN antisense (30 pg) oligonucleotides were administered to each mouse weekly via intratumor injection. One week after PTEN AS oligonucleotide administration was initiated, drug treatment began. Trastuzumab was given at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg twice a week in 200 pL saline through intratumor injection at multiple sites. Triciribine was given at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day in 200 pL 20% DMSO saline solution through intraperitoneal (I.P.) injection. RAD001 was given via gavage at a dose of 1 pg/kg in 500 pL 5% glucose water twice a week. 20% DMSO saline solution (200 pL/day) was given through I.P. injection. The tumors were measured twice weekly with calipers and the volume of the tumors was calculated as: volume=length&#xd7;width<sup>2</sup>/2.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">Statistical Analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287">One-way ANOVA was performed using GraphPad Prism 3.0 for Windows (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, Calif.).</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">Results</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">The earlier biological and molecular data were very promising, however, in vivo studies provide the most stringent test for therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, triciribine and RAD001 were tested in vivo. BT474.m1 cell xenografts were injected into the mammary fat pad of 6-week-old SCID mice. After tumors formed, the mice received PTEN AS weekly via intratumor injection. This protocol effectively models PTEN-deficient tumors in vivo (Nagata Y. et al., Cancer Cell, 2004. 6(2): p. 117-27). The mice were randomized into treatment groups receiving triciribine, RAD001, trastuzumab or DMSO alone or in combination. After treatment, the growth patterns of the tumors treated with DMSO, trastuzumab, RAD001, or triciribine alone were similar (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref>). Growth of the tumors was not inhibited and the mice were euthanized after 3 weeks due to large tumor burdens. In contrast, combination treatment with triciribine and trastuzumab dramatically and significantly inhibited tumor growth (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>). Many of the tumors actually decreased in size and four of 7 mice had no palpable tumors after 5 weeks of treatment. Following treatment with RAD001 and trastuzumab, tumor growth was relatively slower compared to RAD001 or trastuzumab alone (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>). Thus combining trastuzumab with triciribine or RAD001 effectively inhibited ErbB2-overexpressing, PTEN-deficient human breast cancer xenografts in vivo.</p>
