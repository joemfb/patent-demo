<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a gelatin capsule manufacturing and drying process.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The gelatin capsule or softgel is a one-piece, hermetically sealed soft gelatin shell containing a liquid, a suspension, or a semi-solid. One challenge for softgel manufacturers is the length of time it takes to dry the shell to a hardness where the softgel can be packaged. Many softgel manufacturers utilize pre-drying units, then spread the capsules onto trays and place the frays into drying tunnels. Once the product is put into the drying tunnels, it can take up to seven days to complete drying of the shell. Shorter drying times are desirable.</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It will be appreciated that terms such as &#x201c;front,&#x201d; &#x201c;back,&#x201d; &#x201c;top,&#x201d; &#x201c;bottom,&#x201d; &#x201c;side,&#x201d; &#x201c;short,&#x201d; &#x201c;long,&#x201d; &#x201c;up,&#x201d; &#x201c;down,&#x201d; and &#x201c;below&#x201d; used herein are merely for ease of description and refer to the orientation of the components as shown in the figures. It should be understood that any orientation of the components described herein is within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for purposes of illustrating the present invention and not for purposes of limiting the same, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref> show in block diagram form a softgel drying system in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. It should be understood that the process described and shown herein is described as performed within a manufacturing warehouse/building. This is done for illustrative purposes only and for ease of understanding and is not considered limiting in any way.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As can be seen from the block layout in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the building includes an area for fill tanks <b>10</b>, a gel prep area <b>12</b> and a gel receiver area <b>14</b>. These areas can be within the same room or in separate rooms. The building also includes three separate zones/rooms in which the drying process occurs (described below). Each zone is also supplied with sensors for monitoring temperature and humidity, among other conditions. The system includes a dehumidifier/HVAC unit <b>20</b>, chiller <b>24</b>, control panels for controlling the conditions of each of the zones, ducting, water lines, electrical schematics, and three air handler units <b>22</b>. Each air handler unit <b>22</b> is capable of cooling and heating within each zone.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Generally, the softgels are manufactured according to the following process: 1. The product is transferred from bulk storage to the fill tanks <b>10</b> where the product is agitated continuously. 2. In the gel prep area <b>12</b>, raw gelatin is placed in a gel prep tank/reactor and is liquefied. 3. The gelatin is aged in the gel receiver area <b>14</b>. 4. The fill product is encapsulated in a capsule injector <b>16</b>, thereby forming a softgel. 5. The softgels are cured as they are processed through a series of tumble dryers <b>18</b>. 6. A sorter <b>19</b> sorts and removes defective softgels. In an exemplary embodiment, the inventor has found that softgels can be dried to a hardness of eight newtons in about thirteen hours. A 1000 mg capsule can be dried to a desired level in under 12 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The softgels are generally prepared by encapsulating a medicated fill in a gelatin shell. The shells and fills are prepared according to formulations well known to those of skill in the art. Accordingly, the system and process set forth above can be used for drying any softgel. However, in a preferred embodiment, the system is used to dry softgels having a desired formula and steps for preparation. An exemplary batch for the preferred gelatin formulation is 219.0 kg of gelatin 150 bloom, 110.0 kg of glycerin 99.5%, and 172.5 kg of purified water and 6.5 kg of caramel color. In a preferred embodiment, the softgels include between about 37% and about 41% 150 bloom bovine gelatin, between about 17% and about 21% glycerine and between about 25% and about 29% water.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In a preferred embodiment, the process for making the softgel shell (step 2 above) includes the following steps: Pre-weigh all raw materials into clean containers. Add glycerin and purified water to the gelatin melter (which is set in an exemplary embodiment to 176&#xb0; F.). Turn on the mixer and leave mixing. Once the mixer reaches about 176&#xb0; F. add the pre-weighed raw gelatin. Apply vacuum to allow the liquids to rise and saturate the gelatin. Turn off the vacuum, but leave the tank sealed with the vacuum. Leave on the mixer/agitator and allow the gelatin to mix for 30 minutes. Deaerate the gelatin. Leave the vacuum valve on the gelatin melter closed to seal the vacuum and turn off the vacuum pump. Allow the gelatin to mix under sealed vacuum for 10 minutes at slow mixing speed, or until the temperature is between about 149&#xb0; F. to about 158&#xb0; F.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Step 5 above (the softgels are cured as they are processed through a series of tumble dryers <b>18</b>) will now be described in more detail. During the process, the softgels pass through the series of tumble dryers <b>18</b> (also referred to herein as a tumble drying line <b>18</b>) that reside in and span three separate air conditioning zones or rooms (labeled zone <b>1</b>, zone <b>2</b> and zone <b>3</b> in the figures). It will be appreciated that there could be as few as three tumble dryers; one in each zone. In a preferred embodiment, the zones are separate rooms that are separated by walls or other partitions. However, in another embodiment, the zones can be all located within the same room or space.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Preferably, each zone is maintained at a predetermined temperature and relative humidity condition. The preferred equipment for maintaining the zones at the desired temperature and humidity and providing the desired air flow within each zone is described below. Generally, in zone <b>1</b>, the ambient temperature is kept cool to allow the softgel to set immediately after conception. In zone <b>2</b>, the temperature is set higher than zone <b>1</b> so that it drives out the moisture in the softgel shell and the humidity is lower than zone <b>1</b> to help the moisture evaporate from the softgel in a timely manner. In zone <b>3</b>, the conditions again change to allow the softgel a slower drying process for the remaining moisture to evaporate from the shell.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In a preferred embodiment, the temperature in zone <b>1</b> is between about 50&#xb0; F. and about 68&#xb0; F. In a more preferred embodiment, the temperature in zone <b>1</b> is between about 59&#xb0; F. and about 61&#xb0; F. In the most preferred embodiment, the temperature in zone <b>1</b> is about 60&#xb0; F. In a preferred embodiment, the relative humidity in zone <b>1</b> is between about 19% and about 23%. In a more preferred embodiment, the relative humidity in zone <b>1</b> is between about 20.5% and about 21.5%. In the most preferred embodiment, the relative humidity in zone <b>1</b> is about 21%. In a preferred embodiment, the dew point in zone <b>1</b> is between about 15&#xb0; F. and about 30&#xb0; F. In a more preferred embodiment, the dew point in zone <b>1</b> is between about 24&#xb0; F. and about 26&#xb0; F. In the most preferred embodiment, the dew point in zone <b>1</b> is about 25&#xb0; F.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a preferred embodiment, the temperature in zone <b>2</b> is between about 72&#xb0; F. and about 87&#xb0; F. In a more preferred embodiment, the temperature in zone <b>2</b> is between about 81&#xb0; F. and about 83&#xb0; F. In the most preferred embodiment, the temperature in zone <b>2</b> is about 82&#xb0; F. In a preferred embodiment, the relative humidity in zone <b>2</b> is between about 9% and about 14%. In a more preferred embodiment, the relative humidity in zone <b>2</b> is between about 10.5% and about 11.5%. In the most preferred embodiment, the relative humidity in zone <b>2</b> is about 11%. In a preferred embodiment, the dew point in zone <b>2</b> is between about 15&#xb0; F. and about 23&#xb0; F. In a more preferred embodiment, the dew point in zone <b>2</b> is between about 19&#xb0; F. and about 21&#xb0; F. In the most preferred embodiment, the dew point in zone <b>2</b> is about 20&#xb0; F.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In a preferred embodiment, the temperature in zone <b>3</b> is between about 68&#xb0; F. and about 74&#xb0; F. In a more preferred embodiment, the temperature in zone <b>3</b> is between about 71&#xb0; F. and about 73&#xb0; F. In the most preferred embodiment, the temperature in zone <b>3</b> is about 72&#xb0; F. In a preferred embodiment, the relative humidity in zone <b>3</b> is between about 10% and about 15%. In a more preferred embodiment, the relative humidity in zone <b>3</b> is between about 12.5% and about 13.5%. In the most preferred embodiment, the relative humidity in zone <b>3</b> is about 13%. In a preferred embodiment, the dew point in zone <b>3</b> is between about 15&#xb0; F. and about 23&#xb0; F. In a more preferred embodiment, the dew point in zone <b>3</b> is between about 19&#xb0; F. and about 21&#xb0; F. In the most preferred embodiment, the dew point in zone <b>3</b> is about 20&#xb0; F.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">It should be understood that the temperatures and humidities set forth above are preferred for the particular gelatin capsule formulation set forth above and can vary for other formulations based on a variety of factors, such as the gelatin formulation and/or the fill formulation.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The temperature, humidity and dew point conditions set forth above are provided by an HVAC unit <b>20</b> together with an air handler unit <b>22</b> within each zone. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in a preferred embodiment, the HVAC unit <b>20</b>, provides conditioned air to the air handler unit <b>22</b> within each zone. The air is conditioned by the air handler unit <b>22</b> after it leaves the HVAC unit <b>20</b> and prior to entering each zone/room atmosphere. Within each zone, the resident air handler unit <b>22</b> is capable of adjusting the temperature, dew point and humidity of the air prior to its release into the air/room atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the air handler units <b>22</b> blow the conditioned air over the softgels as they move through the tumbler drying line <b>18</b>. Cubic feet per minute (CFM) is a standard measurement of airflow indicating how many cubic feet of air pass a point in one minute. In a preferred embodiment, the zone <b>1</b> air handler unit <b>22</b> outputs air at between about 3000 CFM and about 6000 CFM. In a more preferred embodiment, the zone <b>1</b> air handler unit <b>22</b> outputs air at about 4000 CFM and about 5000 CFM.
