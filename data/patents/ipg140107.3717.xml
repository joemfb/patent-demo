<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of the earlier filing date, pursuant to 35 USC 119, to that patent application entitled &#x201c;INTERNAL ANTENNA MODULE AND WIRELESS COMMUNICATION APPARATUS HAVING THE SAME&#x201d; filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Dec. 8, 2008 and assigned Serial No. 10-2008-0123750, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to an internal antenna module and a wireless communication apparatus having the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With the rapid advances in information-communication technology, wireless communication apparatuses providing various services to users through wireless data communication have been widely deployed. Examples of such devices are a PCS (Personal Communication Service), a DCS (Digital Cellular System), GPS (Global Positioning System), a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant), a cellular phone, a Smart Phone, a laptop computer, and a palmtop computer. The wireless communication apparatus is gradually miniaturized, lightweight, and thin, and the variety of functions thereof must meet the needs of customers.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Generally two types of antennas may be used as an element of a wireless communication apparatus to improve transceiver sensitivity. A road or whip external antenna, which protrudes from the wireless communication apparatus by a preset length, is one type of antenna that is used. However, such external antennas are very fragile, have a poor design and inferior portability. Therefore, built-in antennas, so-called internal antennas, which are mounted in the wireless communication apparatus, are also used.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (represented as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>b</i>)) illustrates a general internal antenna module, wherein <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) illustrates a carrier <b>10</b> mounted on a main board (not shown) of a wireless communication apparatus and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>b</i>) illustrates an antenna module including a plate-shaped radiator <b>20</b> installed on a surface of the carrier <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A carrier <b>10</b> provides a preset gap between a main board, that is, a Radio Frequency (RF) board, and the radiator <b>20</b> to achieve a desired radiation performance and serves as a supporting member protecting the radiator <b>20</b> from an external impact and mitigating the effect of such an impact. The radiator <b>20</b> is made of a metal plate and is attached to a surface of the carrier <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The carrier <b>10</b> is coupled with the radiator <b>20</b> in such a way that a plurality of protrusions <b>11</b> of the carrier <b>10</b> is inserted into a plurality of holes <b>21</b> of the radiator <b>20</b> and is thermally welded.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">When a surface of the carrier <b>10</b> is closely attached to the radiator <b>20</b>, since the carrier <b>10</b> has a permittivity of 2.8 to 3, three times that of air, an efficiency of the radiator <b>20</b> is deteriorated and, thus, it is difficult to guarantee a desired radiation performance of an antenna module.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention provides an internal antenna module and a wireless communication apparatus having the same, in which a space is formed in a region excluding a region required to support a radiator in a carrier while keeping the antenna module thin so that radiation performance of the antenna module may be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention provides an internal antenna module comprising: a carrier including a partition formed on a surface thereof and a space defined by the partition; and a radiator disposed on the partition of the carrier. The space has sides surrounded by the partition and an opening facing the radiator.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The space is formed in a region of the surface of the carrier excluding a region to support the radiator, or at a position corresponding to a signal input portion and a signal output portion of the radiator. This is because influence of the dielectric carrier is strongest at a signal input portion and a signal output portion of the radiator.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">For the coupling and fitting of the radiator and the carrier, the internal antenna module further includes a plurality of protrusions formed on the top of the partition and a plurality of holes formed in the radiator to accommodate the plurality of protrusions.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In accordance with another aspect, the present invention also provides a wireless communication apparatus including the above-mentioned internal antenna module.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to the present invention, a space is defined in a region of the carrier excluding a region required to support the radiator on the surface on which the radiator is mounted, while maintaining an existing thickness of the carrier. Therefore, influence of the carrier on the radiator is minimized so that radiation performance of the internal antenna module may be improved.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. The same reference symbols are used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts. Detailed descriptions of well-known functions and structures incorporated herein may be omitted to avoid obscuring the subject matter of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an exploded perspective view of an internal antenna module according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>) is a plan view of a carrier of the internal antenna module according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>b</i>) is a plan view of the internal antenna module according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3(</figref><i>a</i>)/<b>3</b>(<i>b</i>), an internal antenna module according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes a carrier <b>100</b> mounted on a main board of a wireless communication apparatus (not shown) and a radiator <b>200</b> mounted on a surface of the carrier <b>100</b>. The carrier <b>100</b> is made of non-conductive synthetic resin, particularly, polycarbonate. Polycarbonate possesses excellent weatherability, impact resistance, and mechanical strength. However, it would be understood that other types of materials may be used without altering the scope of the invention claimed. The radiator <b>200</b> represents a Planar Inverted F Antenna (PIFA) having a power feed point and a ground point provided in a single plate radiator, and may be applied to a variety of dipole antennas having a ground point.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The carrier <b>100</b> includes a partition <b>110</b> provided on a surface on which the radiator <b>200</b> is mounted and a space <b>120</b> defined by the partition <b>110</b>. The carrier <b>100</b> has the same thickness as that of the previously described existing carrier <b>10</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>)). Therefore, the space <b>120</b> of carrier <b>100</b> on which the radiator <b>200</b> of the carrier <b>100</b> is mounted is obtained by partially protruding or removing the resin that forms the existing carrier <b>10</b> by a preset height or depth from a surface of the existing carrier <b>10</b>. That is, the space part <b>120</b> has sides surrounded by the partition <b>110</b> and an opening facing the radiator <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Since the space <b>120</b> is formed to employ air as a dielectric, the space <b>120</b> may be formed in every remaining region excluding a minimal region of the carrier <b>100</b> required to support the radiator <b>200</b>. The region supporting the radiator <b>200</b> becomes the partition <b>110</b>. Meanwhile, since a signal input portion and a signal output portion have the greatest influence on the radiation efficiency of the radiator <b>200</b>, the carrier <b>100</b> may have spaces <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> formed at positions corresponding to the signal input portion <b>221</b> and the signal output portion <b>222</b> of the radiator <b>200</b>. A plurality of protrusions <b>111</b> is formed on the top of the partition <b>110</b> to couple and fix the radiator <b>200</b> to the carrier <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The radiator <b>200</b> is electrically connected to the main board and includes a plurality of holes <b>211</b> accommodating the protrusions <b>111</b> for the coupling and fixation with the carrier <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The internal antenna module according to the present invention is manufactured by the following method. The carrier <b>100</b> including the partition <b>110</b>, the space <b>120</b>, and the protrusions <b>111</b> on a surface thereof is made by injection molding of non-conductive synthetic resin. In this case, the carrier <b>100</b> has the same overall thickness as that of the existing carrier. That is, the carrier <b>100</b> is made by removing material from the existing carrier to form space part <b>120</b>. Also, the radiator <b>200</b> having the holes <b>211</b> is obtained by pressing sheet metal.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Then, the radiator <b>200</b> is put on the partition <b>110</b> of the carrier <b>100</b>. A side of the radiator <b>200</b> faces the opening of the space <b>120</b>. The coupling and fixation between the carrier <b>100</b> and radiator <b>200</b> may be achieved by fitting the protrusions <b>111</b> on top of the partition <b>110</b> into the holes <b>211</b> of the radiator <b>200</b>. Not all of the plurality of protrusions <b>111</b> is accommodated in the holes <b>211</b> and other protrusions, excluding the protrusions inserted into the holes <b>211</b>, may be arranged at the installation positions of the radiator to support the radiator <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Thermal welding, performed by heating and pressing the carrier <b>100</b> and the radiator <b>200</b> together and coupled with each other as described above, is performed such that the protrusions <b>111</b> inserted into the holes <b>211</b> may be melted and the radiator <b>200</b> may be fixed to the carrier <b>100</b>. As such, the protrusions <b>111</b> are accommodated in the holes <b>211</b> to couple and fix the radiator <b>200</b> to the carrier <b>100</b> by the thermal welding process.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the comparison of simulated data of the internal antenna module according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention with those of an existing internal antenna module. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a graph illustrating simulation results of the internal antenna module using an existing carrier (comparative example) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a graph illustrating simulation results of the internal antenna module according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention (present invention). The simulations were carried out using MicroWave Studio (MWS&#xae;) by Computer Simulation Technology AG (CST AG).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, S-parameter (S<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>) at resonant frequency (800 MHz) is &#x2212;6.99 dB in the comparative example and &#x2212;11.63 dB in the present invention. In general, since an antenna only has an input port except for a multi-port, only the S-parameter (S<b>1</b>,<b>1</b>) is output. The S-parameter (S<b>1</b>,<b>1</b>) indicates the reflection loss expressed by a ratio of reflection over input and shows a behavior such as a sharp drop at the resonant frequency. The sharp drop of the S-parameter (S<b>1</b>,<b>1</b>) at the resonant frequency means that an input voltage is not reflected at the resonant frequency but is discharged as much as possible. Therefore, the sharper the drop in the S-parameter (S<b>1</b>,<b>1</b>), the better is the radiation performance. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, since the S-parameter (S<b>1</b>,<b>1</b>) drops more sharply in the present invention than in the comparative example, it can be understood that the present invention has improved radiation performance.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The comparison results of radiation efficiency and gain in the present invention with the comparative example are listed in the following table.</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As described above, in the internal antenna module according to the present invention, the radiation efficiency is improved in comparison to that of the existing internal antenna module. This improvement is the result of the reduction of the influence of the radiator <b>200</b> on the permittivity of the carrier <b>100</b> due to the space <b>120</b> formed in the carrier <b>100</b>. When the influence on the permittivity of the carrier <b>100</b> is reduced, it is necessary to tune the length of the radiator <b>200</b> during design of the internal antenna module.</p>
