<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an inkjet printer and inkjet printing method that, while scanning a printing head, ejects printing liquid such as ink on a printing medium to print an image. More particularly, the present invention relates to an inkjet printer and inkjet printing method that enables, in both forward and backward scans of a printing head, the image to be printed.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently, a serial type inkjet printer is widely used, that is provided with: a carriage mounted with a printing head including a plurality of nozzles that eject ink and an ink tank; a conveyance unit that conveys a printing medium; and a control unit that controls them. The inkjet printer repeatedly performs: a main scan in which, while moving the carriage in a direction (main scanning direction) orthogonal to a conveyance direction of the printing medium, the ink is ejected from the printing head to perform printing; and a sub scan in which, at the time of printing, the printing medium is conveyed by a distance corresponding to the printing width of the printing head. Also, many of the currently used inkjet printers are ones that can use a plurality of color inks to print full color images. For example, printing heads that can eject inks such as yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (c), and black (b) inks are mounted on a carriage, and these inks are used to print full color images. In many cases, in the carriage, a plurality of printing heads corresponding to the respective inks are sequentially arranged along the main scanning direction.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the case where along a forward direction in the main scan, the printing heads are arrayed in the order of Bk, C, M, and Y, a printing order at the time of printing on a printing medium by a forward scan is the order of Bk, C, M, and Y, whereas a printing order at the time of printing by a backward scan is the order of Y, M, C, and Bk. As described, the printing order is different between the forward and backward scans and, therefore, the order to overlap the inks on the printing medium is different between the forward printing and the backward printing. For this reason, the hue is different depending on the conveyance distance of the printing medium, which may cause color unevenness to result in a reduction in image quality.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A document that discloses the technique for preventing color unevenness in so-called bidirectional printing in which the forward printing and backward printing are performed is Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2001-180017. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2001-180017 discloses a printing method that counts the number of dots for each ink color on the basis of printing data, and if an ink driving threshold where color unevenness occurs is exceeded, it fixes the printing direction to a forward or backward direction. If the printing direction is fixed to perform printing as described, the printing order of respective inks becomes constant and, therefore, color unevenness can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, in the technique disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2001-180017, if the ink driving threshold where color unevenness occurs is exceeded, the printing direction is fixed to the forward or backward direction and, therefore, there arises a problem in that the printing time is increased.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is intended to provide an inkjet printer and inkjet printing method that can reduce the occurrence of color unevenness in bidirectional printing and also suppress an increase in printing time.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to accomplish the above objective, the present invention has the following configuration. That is, a first aspect of the present invention is an inkjet printer that moves a plurality of printing heads capable of ejecting different inks along a predetermined main backward and forward scanning direction, and on a basis of printing data specifying ejection or non-ejection of the inks, controls ejection of the inks from the respective printing heads to print an image on a printing medium, the inkjet printer comprising: a printing data generation unit that generates the printing data on a basis of image data; and a determination unit that determines whether or not a color unevenness occurrence value set on the basis of values of unit image data constituting the image data is more than a predetermined threshold value, the color unevenness occurrence value relating to a degree of occurrence of color unevenness, wherein if the color unevenness occurrence value is less than the threshold values, the printing data generation unit enables a dot to be formed in a unit area corresponding to the unit image data by a forward scan and a backward scan by the printing heads, whereas if the color unevenness occurrence value is more than the threshold value, the printing data generation unit enables a dot to be formed in the unit area only by any one of the forward scan and the backward scan by the printing heads.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A second aspect of the present invention is an inkjet printing method that moves a plurality of printing heads capable of ejecting different inks along a predetermined main backward and forward scanning direction and on the basis of printing data specifying ejection or non-ejection of the inks, controls ejection of the inks from the respective printing heads to print an image on a printing medium, the inkjet printing method comprising: a printing data generation step of generating the printing data on the basis of image data; and a determination step of determining whether or not a color unevenness occurrence value set on the basis of values of unit image data constituting the image data is equal to or more than a predetermined threshold value, wherein if the color unevenness occurrence value is less than the threshold values, the printing data generation step enables a dot to be formed in a unit area corresponding to the unit image data by a forward scan and a backward scan by the printing heads, whereas if the color unevenness occurrence value is more than the threshold value, the printing data generation step enables a dot to be formed in the unit area only by any one of the forward scan and the backward scan by the printing heads.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the present invention, while performing printing operation based on the forward and backward scans of the printing heads, the occurrence of color unevenness can be reduced and the increase in printing time can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further features of the present invention will become apparent form the following description of exemplary embodiments (with reference to the attached drawings).</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">One embodiment of the present invention is described below in detail with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a plan view of an inkjet printer (hereinafter also simply referred to as a printer) in the present embodiment. The inkjet printer illustrated here is one that performs printing on a relatively large-sized printing medium and is provided with a printer main body <b>2</b> including a conveyance unit that is not illustrated that conveys the printing medium in a Y direction (conveyance direction). The main body <b>2</b> is provided with a moveable carriage <b>1</b> that is attached in the main scanning direction along a guide shaft <b>33</b>. The carriage <b>1</b> is configured to be movable forward and backward along the main scanning direction (X direction) by a driving force that is transmitted from a carriage motor (not illustrated) through a belt <b>34</b>. The carriage <b>1</b> is mounted with a plurality of printing heads <b>5</b> each having a plurality of nozzles that eject ink droplets, and the printing heads <b>5</b> move in the main scanning direction together with the carriage <b>1</b>. Also, the carriage <b>1</b> is provided with an optical sensor <b>32</b>. The optical sensor <b>32</b> detects the presence or absence of the printing medium on a platen while moving in the main scanning direction together with the carriage <b>1</b>. Also, the inkjet printer of the present embodiment is provided with an ejection failure nozzle sensing unit <b>36</b> that can sense ejection failure of each of the nozzles of the printing heads and has a floodlight part and a light-receiving part. Specifically, by sensing the presence or absence of an ink droplet that blocks the light path from the floodlight part to the light-receiving part, the ejection failure of each of the nozzles is detected.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Also, in order to keep ejection performance of each of the nozzles of the printing heads <b>5</b> in a proper state, the inkjet printer is provided with a printing head recovery unit. The recovery unit is configured to have a suction recovery mechanism <b>30</b> that covers an ejection port formed at the tip of each of the nozzles of the printing heads <b>5</b> with a cap connected to a pump, and on the basis of negative pressure generated inside the cap by the pump, sucks and discharges viscous ink or the like inside the nozzle.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a plan view schematically illustrating an array of ejection ports of the printing heads used in the embodiment of the present invention. Each of the printing heads <b>5</b> illustrated here is provided with a plurality of nozzles that eject ink. Each of the nozzles includes the ejection port n that ejects ink, and an ink flow path (not illustrated) communicatively connected to the ejection port n, and inside the ink flow path of each of the nozzles, there is provided an electrothermal transducer that locally heats ink to give rise to film boiling, and on the basis of corresponding foaming energy, ejects the ink. In each of the printing heads, an ejection port array corresponding to each of the plurality of color inks to be used is arranged. In each of the ejection port array of the present embodiment, there are 1280 ejection ports that are arrayed at a density of 1200 dpi along a sub scanning direction corresponding to the conveyance direction of the printing medium.</p>

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the present embodiment, after-mentioned dot arrangement pattern data (also referred to as index pattern data) are used to convert multi-value input image data to binary data (printing data) representing whether or not a dot is formed, i.e., ejection or non-ejection of an ink droplet in each of the printing heads. In this binarization processing, for example, in the host device, the image data are quantized to have a relatively low resolution, and the quantized multi-value image data are transferred to the printer main body. In the printer main body, the received image data are converted to the binary data (printing data) with the use of the index pattern data, and the binary data are expanded in the buffer.</p>

Note that the term &#x201c;pixel data&#x201d; here means multi-value image data (unit image data) for giving the inks to a pixel that is a minimum unit area for an image to be printed, and the pixel data at this step have a level from 0 to 256 steps. Then, the quantization processing is performed to convert the pixel data <b>401</b> to pixel data <b>402</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>) having a 9-step level from 0 to 8. Subsequently, on the basis of predetermined index pattern data, to a matrix M (unit area) having vertically 2 areas&#xd7;horizontally 4 areas illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, the binary data (printing data) <b>403</b> representing whether or not a dot is formed are allocated.

By performing the processing based on the index pattern data (hereinafter referred to as index processing), binarized data having resolutions of horizontally 2400 dpi and vertically 1200 dpi can be generated as the printing data.

That is, in the case of printing dots in both forward and backward directions, i.e., performing so-called bidirectional printing scans on the basis of the two-column thinning method, the odd-numbered column data (<b>501</b> and <b>503</b>) are used in a printing scan in the forward direction (hereinafter referred to as a forward scan).

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A pattern data group having the above-described two types of pattern data, i.e., the index pattern data A and the index pattern data B, is referred to as an index pattern data set (dot arrangement pattern data set). Which index pattern data in the index pattern data set should be selected is determined by after-mentioned processing, and on the basis of the result of the determination, the index pattern data A or B are selected. Then, from the selected index pattern data A or B, a matrix corresponding to the pixel data is selected, in which the pixel data are expanded as printing data.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Next, data processing using the above-described index pattern data A or B is described along the data processing flow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 6E</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As described above, the 8-bit RGB input image data <b>601</b> having been processed to have a resolution of 600 dpi are converted to the C, M, Y, Bk pixel data <b>602</b>. Then, the multi-value (0 to 255) pixel data are converted to the 5-level (<b>0</b> to <b>4</b>) C, M, Y, Bk pixel data <b>603</b> by the quantization processing. Also, on the basis of multi-value pixel input values (0 to 255) of C, M, Y, Bk, it is determined whether the bidirectional printing or unidirectional printing should be performed as an image printing method. A method for the determination will be described later. If it is determined here that the bidirectional printing should be performed, the index pattern data A are selected, and from the index pattern data A, pattern data corresponding to the level of the pixel data are selected. For example, if the quantized pixel data level is 3, on the basis of the pattern data <b>703</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the pixel data are expanded. In the index pattern data A, the dot data are allocated to the areas <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b> described in the matrix M of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref> and, therefore, the printing is performed by the forward and backward scans. On the other hand, as a result of the determination in the step <b>603</b>, if it is determined that the unidirectional printing should be performed, the index pattern data B are selected, and from the index pattern data B, pattern data corresponding to the level of the pixel data are selected. For example, if the processing result in <b>603</b> corresponds to the level <b>3</b>, on the basis of the pattern data <b>707</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the pixel pattern data are expanded.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As described, by employing the printing method that combines the printing data generating method and the printing method that performs printing on the basis of the division into multiple printing scans, a print scanning direction can be selected for each matrix (in this case, horizontally 4 areas&#xd7;vertically 2 areas) formed by predetermined pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Next, the method for determining which of the above-described bidirectional and unidirectional printing methods should be selected is described.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">It is assumed that, in the multi-value (0 to 255) pixel data corresponding to the respective ink colors, a cyan pixel input value is denoted by Vc, magenta pixel input value by Vm, yellow pixel input value by Vy, and black pixel input value by Vk. Also, regarding weightings N of the respective inks, it is assumed that a cyan weighting is denoted by Nc, magenta weighting by Nm, yellow weighting by Ny, and black weighting by Nk. These weightings are set in consideration of the degrees contributed by the respective inks to color unevenness. Also, it is assumed that a threshold value serving as a criterion for determining which of the bidirectional and unidirectional printing methods should be employed is denoted by S.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">On the other hand, given that the value (color unevenness occurrence value) calculated from the respective color pixel input values inputted in a predetermined area and the corresponding weighting coefficients is denoted by K, K is obtained by the following expression:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>K=Nc&#xd7;Vc+Nm&#xd7;Vm+Ny&#xd7;Vy+Nk&#xd7;Vk</i>&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
In the present embodiment, in consideration of contribution ratios of the respective inks to the occurrence of color unevenness on the basis of the experimental result, the weighting coefficients are set as Nc=1.3, Nm=1.0, Ny=1.5, and Nk=0.7. For example, in the case where Vc is 210, Vm is 128, Vy is 32, and Vk is 16, K calculated from the respective ink color input values and corresponding weightings is 460. If the K value obtained according to the weightings is 400 or more, it is determined that color unevenness is likely to occur and, therefore, the threshold value S is set as S=400. The value K calculated from the respective ink color pixel input values and corresponding weightings is compared with the threshold value S to determine whether the bidirectional or unidirectional printing is performed.
</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Among the above weighting coefficients, yellow weighting coefficient and cyan weighting coefficient are larger than the weighting coefficients of the other inks. Weighting coefficient values of yellow and cyan inks are set to be larger because yellow ink and cyan ink more affect a hue compared to the other inks (for example black ink), and more affect a change of hue due to the printing order of ink.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As described above, in the case where the value K calculated with use of the respective ink color pixel input values is smaller than the threshold value S, even if the bidirectional printing is performed, the color unevenness does not occur between the forward and backward scans. For this reason, the index pattern data A where dots are printed by the forward and backward scans are selected. On the other hand, in the case where the value K calculated with use of the respective ink color pixel input values is equal to or more than the threshold value S, if the bidirectional printing is performed, the color unevenness occurs between the forward and backward scans and, therefore, the index pattern data B where dots are printed only by the forward scan are selected. On the basis of the above procedure, index pattern data are selected to determine for each inputted pixel unit (600 dpi) whether the optimum printing method is bidirectional or unidirectional printing method, and according to a result of the determination, dots are printed.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flowchart of the above printing data generation processing.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In S<b>801</b>, the respective ink color pixel input values Vc, Vm, Vy, and Vk are obtained. In S<b>802</b>, from the respective ink color pixel input values inputted in S<b>801</b> and corresponding weighting coefficients, the K value is calculated. In S<b>803</b>, it is determined whether or not the K value calculated in S<b>802</b> is equal to or more than the preset threshold values S. Here, for a pixel of which the K value is determined to be less than the threshold value (less than S), the index pattern data A for which printing is performed by the forward and backward scans are selected (S<b>804</b>). On the other hand, for a pixel of which the K value is determined in S<b>803</b> to exceed the threshold value S, the index pattern data B for which printing is performed only by the forward scan are selected in S<b>805</b>. In S<b>806</b>, it is determined whether or not the processing to select index pattern data is completed for all of input pixels. If not, the flow returns to S<b>801</b> and the processing continues until it is determined that the processing for all of the input pixels is completed. If it is determined that the processing for all of the input pixels is completed, printing data are generated to start printing (S<b>807</b>).</p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating the operation of so-called two-pass divided printing that performs two scans to complete an image to be printed.

As described, in the present embodiment, by keeping the two-pass divided recording scan, for a pixel in which color unevenness occurs, performing printing by one forward scan, the printing time and the color unevenness can be suppressed from being increased and from occurring, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As described above, in the first embodiment, on the inputted pixel data basis, it is determined whether or not color unevenness occurs between the forward printing and the backward printing, and in the area where the color unevenness occurs, the index pattern data for which the number of printing scans is halved and printing is performed only by the forward scan are selected. Based on this, the print scanning direction at the time of printing for each pixel can be controlled, so that the color unevenness between the forward scan printing and the backward scan printing can be suppressed, and printing that prevents printing time from being increased can be performed.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Next, the second embodiment of the present invention is described. In addition, it is assumed that the second embodiment is also provided with the configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the second embodiment, a plurality of index pattern data sets are used to select a printing direction for each unit area and suppress color unevenness from occurring. That is, in the above first embodiment, one type of index pattern data set including the index pattern data A and the index pattern data B is used to select index pattern data for every individual pixel. On the other hand, in the second embodiment, by using the plurality of index pattern data sets, dispersibility of printing data is improved to suppress a texture from occurring.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The procedure for data processing on the basis of the pixel data is the same as that in the above-described first embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A to 10E</figref> are diagrams schematically illustrating a plurality of index pattern data sets in the second embodiment, and an example of an index allocation pattern that defines allocations of index pattern data to respective printing pixels. In the above first embodiment, the index pattern data A for which printing is performed by the forward and backward scans, or the index pattern data B for which printing is performed only in one direction are selectively used for the printing pixel. On the other hand, in the second embodiment, from the plurality of index pattern data sets as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A to 10D</figref>, an index pattern data set corresponding to the position of the printing pixel is selected. In the present embodiment, the four types of index pattern data sets illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A to 10D</figref> are used to provide the description.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> illustrates an index pattern data set <b>1</b>. The index pattern data set <b>1</b> is configured to have index pattern data <b>1</b>A for which printing is performed by the forward and backward scans and index pattern data <b>1</b>B for which printing is performed only in one direction. Also, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10B</figref>, <b>10</b>C, and <b>10</b>D illustrate index pattern data set <b>2</b>, index pattern data set <b>3</b>, and index pattern data set <b>4</b>, respectively. These index pattern data sets also have index pattern data <b>2</b>A, <b>3</b>A, and <b>4</b>A for which printing is performed by the forward and backward scans and index pattern data <b>2</b>B, <b>3</b>B, and <b>4</b>B for which printing is performed only in one direction.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10E</figref> illustrates index allocation pattern data that are used to select (first selection step) an index pattern data set. In the second embodiment, the index allocation pattern data having a size of horizontally 256 pixels and vertically 256 pixels are repeatedly used. Depending on the inputted pixel position, from the index allocation pattern data, any of the above-described four types of index pattern data sets is selected. If within <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10E</figref>, in the pixel position denoted by <b>1</b>, printing data are present, the index pattern data set <b>1</b> is selected. Similarly, if in the pixel position denoted by <b>2</b>, printing data are present, the index pattern data set <b>2</b> is selected, and if in the pixel position denoted by <b>3</b>, printing data are present, the index pattern data set <b>3</b> is selected. Further, if in the pixel position denoted by <b>4</b>, printing data are present, the index pattern data set <b>4</b> is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Also, it is determined which of the index pattern data for performing bidirectional printing and index pattern data for performing unidirectional printing is selected from a pair of index pattern data in each of the index pattern data sets. This determination is made with use of, as in the above first embodiment, pixel input values, corresponding weighting coefficients, and the above expression 1.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The printing data generation processing using the above index pattern data selection method is described by, as an example, citing a pixel position where the index pattern data set <b>1</b> is selected. First, depending on the inputted pixel position in the above-described index allocation pattern data, from the above-described four types of index pattern data sets, the index pattern data set <b>1</b> is selected. Then, on the basis of the result of the above-described determination whether the bidirectional or unidirectional printing is performed, the index pattern data <b>1</b>A or index pattern data <b>1</b>B are selected (second selection step), and on the basis of the selected index pattern data, pixel data are expanded.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a flowchart of the printing data generation processing in the second embodiment. In S<b>1101</b>, Vc, Vm, Vy, and Vk that are respective ink color pixel input values are obtained. In S<b>1102</b>, on the basis of the respective ink color pixel input values inputted in S<b>1101</b>, a K value is calculated from ink amounts and corresponding weighting coefficients. In S<b>1103</b>, it is determined whether or not the K value calculated in S<b>1102</b> is equal to or more than a preset threshold value S. Then, in S<b>1103</b>, the index allocation pattern data illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10E</figref> are referenced to select an index pattern data set corresponding to a pixel position in the printing data.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Here, a pixel for which the index pattern data set <b>1</b> is selected in S<b>1103</b> is cited as an example of the description. For a pixel of which the K value is determined in S<b>1104</b> to be less than the threshold S, because the index pattern data set <b>1</b> is selected in S<b>1103</b>, the index pattern data <b>1</b>A for which printing is performed by the forward and backward scans are selected in S<b>1105</b>. On the other hand, for a pixel of which the K value is determined in S<b>1104</b> to be equal to or more than the threshold value S, because the index pattern data set <b>1</b> is selected in S<b>1103</b>, the index pattern data <b>1</b>B for which printing is performed only by the forward scan are selected in S<b>1106</b>. In S<b>1107</b>, it is determined whether or not for all of the input pixels, the index pattern data selection processing is completed. If not, the flow returns to S<b>1101</b>, and the processing is repeated until it is determined that the processing for all of the input pixels is completed. Then, if it is determined that for all of the input pixels, the index pattern data selection processing is completed, printing data are generated to start printing.</p>

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Also, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> is a schematic diagram of the index allocation pattern data for selecting an index pattern data set corresponding to each pixel position of an image having a size of vertically 12 pixels and horizontally 12 pixels. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref> illustrates index pattern data that are finally allocated to each pixel on the basis of the result of the determination in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, and an index pattern data set selected from the index allocation pattern data illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>. For pixels denoted by <b>1</b>A, <b>2</b>A, <b>3</b>A, and <b>4</b>A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref>, the index pattern data <b>1</b>A, index pattern data <b>2</b>A, index pattern data <b>3</b>A, and index pattern data <b>4</b>A are respectively selected.

<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</figref> illustrates the scanning direction at the time of performing printing in each pixel, and as is clear from the diagram, for the pixels for which <b>1</b>A, <b>2</b>A, <b>3</b>A, or <b>4</b>A is selected in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref>, printing is performed by the forward and backward scans. Also, for the pixels for which <b>1</b>B, <b>2</b>B, <b>3</b>B, or <b>4</b>B is selected in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref>, printing is performed only by the forward scan. Accordingly, for the pixels where a &#x2218; mark is described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</figref>, printing is performed in the forward and backward directions. Also, for the pixels where a X mark is described, printing is performed only in the forward direction.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12E</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating operation of so-called two-pass divided printing that performs two scans to complete an image to be printed, and the basic operation of the two-pass divided printing is the same as that in the above first embodiment. Also, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12F</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating what number of the scan in the printing operation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12E</figref> performs printing for a pixel within an area illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12E</figref>. A numeral <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, or <b>3</b> described in each of the illustrated pixels refers to the first, second, or third printing scan. That is, pixels in which the numerals <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> are described are pixels for which printing is performed by the first and second printing scans, and for these pixels, printing is performed by the forward and backward scans. Also, pixels in which the numerals <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> are described are pixels for which printing is performed by the second and third printing scans, and for these pixels, printing is performed also by the forward and backward scans.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">On the other hand, pixels in which the numeral <b>1</b> is described are pixels for which printing is performed only by the first printing scan and, therefore, printing is performed only by the forward scan. Also, pixels in which the numeral <b>3</b> is described are pixels for which printing is performed only by the third printing scan, and printing is performed only by the forward scan. As described, for a pixel where it is determined that color unevenness does not occur, printing is performed by both of the forward and backward scans on the basis of the two-pass divided printing. On the other hand, for a pixel where it is determined that color unevenness occurs, printing is performed only by one printing scan (one-pass printing scan) in the forward direction. In this case, at the time of printing in the backward direction, an idle scan is performed, resulting in no printing. As described, even in the second embodiment, by keeping the two-pass divided printing scan and performing printing by one forward scan, the printing time and color unevenness can be suppressed from being increased and from occurring, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As described above, even in the second embodiment, on the basis of the inputted pixel data, it is determined whether or not color unevenness is likely to occur between the forward printing time and the backward printing time, and in an area where the color unevenness is likely to occur, the number of printing scans is halved and printing is performed only by the forward scan. Accordingly, even in the second embodiment, the print scanning direction at the time of printing for each pixel can be controlled, so that the color unevenness at the time of printing caused by performing the forward and backward scans and an increase in printing time can be suppressed. Further, according to the second embodiment, dispersibility of printing data can be increased to more dispersion of the print scanning direction, so that a texture can be suppressed from occurring to thereby form higher quality images.</p>

<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In each of the above embodiments, the inkjet printer has the function of a data processor of the present invention, and performs the processing that combines the binarization processing using the dot arrangement pattern data (index pattern data) and the printing method using the column thinning method.

However, the unit area serving as a unit based on which the color unevenness occurrence value is calculated is not set as one pixel, but may be set as an area including a plurality of pixels, and the color unevenness occurrence value may be calculated for each unit area including the plurality of pixels. In this case, index pattern data used for the plurality of pixels within the unit area are selected on the basis of a sum of multiplication values obtained by multiplying pixel data for the respective ink colors corresponding to the unit area by weighting coefficients determined for the respective ink colors. That is, printing data for each of the pixels located in the unit area are determined by using the same index pattern data.</p>
