<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to methods, systems, and devices for managing player data. More specifically, some embodiments of the present invention relate to methods, systems, and devices for a personal device used to allocate, and authenticate the allocation of, personal resources to a feature by a device separate from the personal device.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Casino gaming, also referred to as wagering games, gambling, gaming, or the like, may occur in a physical, brick-and-mortar casino or a virtual, online casino. These types of casino or wagering games usually include three components: a wager, chance, and a reward. That is, casino or wagering games are usually games in which the outcome of a wager, that is, the reward, is determined by chance, which predominates over every other factor, including skill. For example, chance predominates in card games such as poker, blackjack, or the like, even though some skill is involved. Specifically, chance, rather than the player's skill, determines which cards are dealt to the players, which cards are dealt to a dealer, if any, which cards are cut from the deck or shoe of cards, and so forth. In other wagering games, such as reel slot games, numbers games (such as keno, lotto, pull tabs, or the like), dice games, wheel games (such as roulette), or the like, chance is practically the only factor to determine the outcome of the wagering game, with skill having no influence on the symbols or numbers drawn, rolled, or spun.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As may be appreciated, the outcomes of wagering games can usually be determined by the strict probabilities that govern the games and, therefore, the hold for the game operator over the long term can be predicted. As may further be appreciated, this may not be true for skill games, in which the outcomes would vary from player to player based on the player's skill. As may be appreciated, wagering games must be operated for a profit over the long term and would generally not operate games that allow certain players to improve their performance through practice. Consequently, casinos will not, and in some jurisdictions cannot, offer games in which skill predominates.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A well-known consequence of how probability can affect online casinos is that online casinos require massive volumes of players to maintain liquidity. That is, house-banked games, i.e., those games in which the online casino operator banks wagers by collecting losing wagers and paying winning wagers, are particularly profitable for casinos because the games include a built-in house edge that guarantees the game will be profitable in the long term. However, the win or loss from these games can fluctuate wildly in the short term, such as when a player has a winning streak, and the casino operator must maintain a reserve of cash to pay off all winning bets. Conversely, player-banked and parimutuel games are more predictable in the short term because the casino operator does not collect losing wagers and pay winning wagers. Rather, in a player-banked game a player-banker banks the other players' wagers and in a parimutuel game, the players contribute to a pot that is awarded to the winning player(s). In either case, the casino operator collects a fee for administering and operating the game. This fee is levied regardless of the outcome of the game, so the casino operator makes money on every game. However, because the fee is generally low, the casino operator must generally have a high volume of play to be profitable.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of the present invention include a method, system, and device for managing player data. By &#x201c;player data,&#x201d; it is contemplated that the present invention could be applied to casino player data, arcade player data, home game player data, mobile game player data, entertainment and retail player data, any combination of the above, or any other type of player data. Therefore, the examples and discussion given below which use the context of a casino game should be viewed as illustrative and not limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A personal device, optionally a mobile device, according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a data processor and a player interface, a communication device, a display, and a data storage device in communication with the data processor. In an optional embodiment of a system (described in greater detail below) the communication device may communicate with a game device used, at least in part, to conduct a game and generate game data from the game conducted. The communication device may additionally or alternatively communicate with a server that stores an account balance of game resources allocatable to a game. The game resources may take any form and may be consumable or non-consumable. For example, at least a portion of the game resources are selected from the group consisting of currency, gaming chips, and game credits.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A data storage device also includes program instructions executable by the data processor to conduct a method. In an optional embodiment, the method includes displaying at the display at least one game feature for a game conducted without using the data processor of the personal device. For example, the display at the personal device may show a game feature for a game conducted using a separate and independent game device. The game feature could take many forms including an optional feature which alters the game, an event generated by the game, such as a wagerable proposition, a side game, bonus game, or side action, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An allocation of game resources to at least one selected game feature is received through the player interface. For example, in one such optional embodiment, a game includes one or more events (described above) and the allocation of game resources to the game feature comprises a wager on the event. As noted above, game resources may be consumable or non-consumable. Where the game resources are consumable, game resources may be debited after being allocated. Where the game resources are non-consumable, the balance of game resources may be maintained after allocation of game resources. The personal device communicates through the communication device with the server to authenticate the allocation of game resources received through the player interface.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Game data are received through the communication device. As noted above, game data are generated by the game conducted without using the data processor of the personal device. For example, in one optional embodiment, the game data are generated by a game device in communication with the personal device.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one optional embodiment, the data processor resolves the game feature(s) using the game data. In another optional embodiment, the personal device receives a resolution of the game feature(s) from the server, i.e., resolution of the game feature(s) occurs at the server and is communicated to the personal device. In either optional embodiment, resolution of the game feature may include awarding game resources, if any, earned through the game feature. For example, in an optional embodiment in which the game feature is an event that may occur in the game, the step of resolving the game feature may include the data processor determining whether the event occurred and issuing an award, if any, of game resources associated with the occurrence or non-occurrence of the event.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an optional embodiment, the personal device may be a mobile device that operates in a system including a game device. Optionally, the system may include multiple game devices and multiple personal devices.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">One optional embodiment of a system may include a server in communication with the personal device and the game device. In one such optional embodiment, the server stores an account balance of game resources separate from the game resources stored at the personal device. In one such example, at least a portion of the game resources stored at the server include at least one achievement outcome earned through an achievement game. The display at the personal device displays game resources stored at the server and an allocation of game resources stored at the server is received through the player interface of the personal device. In response, game resources are allocated to at least one selected game feature. Game data are received at the server from the game device and the server resolves the game feature using the game data.</p>

A communication device <b>108</b> may take any form, including a modem, wired or wireless network interface card (&#x201c;NIC&#x201d;), or the like. Likewise, a communication device may use any communication method including wired or wireless signals, radio waves, light, laser, sound, image, or the like, and may communicate using any protocol, including encrypted or unencrypted TCP/IP, serial communication, cellular, Bluetooth&#x2122;, or the like. It is contemplated that the communication device <b>108</b> may communicate with a game device <b>120</b> directly or via a server <b>200</b>. The server <b>200</b> may serve solely as a communication channel between the game device <b>120</b> and the personal device <b>100</b> or may perform additional functions (described in greater detail below).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an optional embodiment, a method according to the present invention may be conducted on a personal device <b>100</b> according to program instructions stored in a data storage device <b>106</b> and executable by a data processor <b>102</b>. For example, in an optional embodiment, one or more functions of the present invention may be embodied in a software application or &#x201c;app&#x201d; that is stored on, and executed by, the data processor <b>102</b> of the personal device <b>100</b>. Alternatively, the functions of the present invention may be embodied in firmware, cloudware, or other executable program instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The functions performed according to various embodiments of the present invention generally relate to managing data of a player. Thus, in one example embodiment, the personal device <b>100</b> may store data and enable the player to manipulate, search, sort, use, allocate, share, or otherwise utilize the data stored on the personal device <b>100</b> or stored remotely from the device. While the personal device <b>100</b> may exchange game data with a game device <b>120</b> and/or server <b>200</b>, the game itself may, in an optional embodiment, be conducted without using the data processor <b>102</b> of the personal device <b>100</b>. That is, in an optional embodiment, the personal device <b>100</b> does not conduct any games, but rather facilitates participation in a game by managing data, accessing game data, and providing game features separate from, although possibly related to, a game.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one such optional embodiment, game device(s) <b>120</b> communicate with a server <b>200</b>. For example, in an optional embodiment in which the game device(s) <b>120</b> include electronic gaming machines, electronic gaming tables, electronic card readers, electronic ball generators or ball readers, and other random number generators, each game device <b>120</b> may communicate with a server <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The data shared with the server <b>200</b> from the game device(s) <b>120</b> may include game data. In one such optional embodiment, the game device <b>120</b> may transmit a stream of game data from the game conducted, at least in part, using the game device <b>120</b>. For example, in an optional embodiment in which the game device <b>120</b> is an electronic gaming table and/or electronic card reader, game data may include at least a portion of the game pieces, e.g. playing cards, dealt in the game. Thus, in one such example, game device(s) <b>120</b> may generate a stream of game data including one or more of the dealt game pieces, e.g., playing cards. The game data could be used for security purposes to provide a record of the game pieces, e.g., playing cards, dealt. Additionally, the game data may be used for wagerable game events as described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In communicating with the server <b>200</b>, a personal device <b>100</b> may be authenticated. For example, in an optional embodiment, a personal device <b>100</b>, such as a mobile device, may communicate with a server <b>200</b> through a communication device <b>108</b>, such as a wireless network interface card or cell modem. The personal device <b>100</b> may be authenticated based on a serial number, IP address, network address, internet mobile equipment identity (&#x201c;IMEI&#x201d;) number, media access control (&#x201c;MAC&#x201d;) address, telephone number, account number, subscriber identity module (&#x201c;SIM&#x201d;) code, or the like. Authentication may additionally or alternatively include a username and password, personal identification number (&#x201c;PIN&#x201d;), code, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an optional embodiment, the location of the personal device <b>100</b> may also be discernible. For example, in an optional embodiment, the location of the personal device <b>100</b> may be determined from data from the personal device <b>100</b> (such as a global positioning system signal) or by locating the personal device <b>100</b> (such as by detecting signals from the device to a network including a server <b>200</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an optional embodiment, one or more functions may be provided in a method, system, and device according to the present invention. Functions could include, for example: managing game resources of a player; using game resources to participate in game features of a game; tracking play; searching and/or sorting game data; and displaying available game features in live or electronic games. Each of these functions is discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In an optional embodiment, a personal device <b>100</b> may store game resources of a player at a data storage device <b>106</b>. Additionally or alternatively, a personal device <b>100</b> may provide access to, and management by a player of, the player's game resources that are stored remotely, such as at a server <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Game resources may take any form. As but a few examples, game resources could take the form of game credits, gaming chips, or currency (or electronic representations thereof), casino credit markers, rewards points, experience levels, achievement outcomes, or any other resources that may be earned from, or allocated to, a game. Moreover, it is contemplated that game resources may be non-transferable, i.e., may only be possessed and/or used by a single player, or may be transferable, exchangeable, shareable, or otherwise transferable between or among players.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In an optional embodiment, game resources may be consumable or non-consumable. Specifically, any game resource that is depleted or debited from a balance as the result of use may be a &#x201c;consumable&#x201d; game resource. Conversely, any game resource that is maintained as the result of use or allocation may be a &#x201c;non-consumable&#x201d; game resource.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">For example, in an optional embodiment, the personal device <b>100</b> may serve as a &#x201c;virtual chip tray&#x201d; that manages and tracks game resources, such as currency, game credits, gaming chips, or the like, that may be used to purchase, enable, wager on, or otherwise activate game features of a game. In this regard, the personal device <b>100</b> may optionally serve as an electronic ticket or voucher representing and storing the actual value associated with the balance of game resources, e.g., currency, game credits, gaming chips, or the like. Alternatively, the personal device <b>100</b> may not actually store the value held by the player but rather may merely providing access to an account stored at a server <b>200</b>, or the like, at maintains a balance of game resources, e.g., currency, game credits, gaming chips, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an optional embodiment, game resources may be added to a balance through purchase from a casino operator, transfer from a casino operator or another player, purchase from another player, or the like. For example, a player who wishes to obtain five-hundred dollars worth of game resources, e.g., gaming chips or game credits, may purchase the game resources in a live or electronic transaction with a casino operator, electronic gaming machine, kiosk, casino operator's financial institution, or the like. In an additional or alternative optional embodiment, the game resources may be acquired on an exchange for game resources from another person or entity, e.g., another player, a casino operator, a purchaser, a trader, a seller, a buyer, or the like. In any event, the game resources may be transferred to the personal device <b>100</b> and/or a server <b>200</b> for storage thereat. In an optional embodiment, the transfer may occur through any wired or wireless communication, such as an internet transfer, short message service (&#x201c;SMS&#x201d;), Bluetooth&#x2122;, WiFi&#x2122;, infrared (&#x201c;IR&#x201d;), radio frequency identification (&#x201c;RFID&#x201d;), or other mode of communication. In an optional embodiment, currency, game credits, gaming chips, casino credit markers, or the like may be consumable game resources in that they may be debited from the balance until the balance is exhausted.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Broadly speaking, a personal device <b>100</b> may also be used to direct game resources to be used in a game conducted, at least in part, using a game device <b>120</b> separate from the personal device <b>100</b>. In general terms, a personal device <b>100</b> is authenticated, optionally by a server <b>200</b>, and the authenticated personal device <b>100</b> may then be permitted to use, allocate, direct the use and/or allocation, or otherwise transact game resources for use in a game conducted, at least in part, using a game device <b>120</b> as described in greater detail below. As previously noted, game resources may be consumable or non-consumable such that game resources may be debited from the account of game resources after use or may remain in the account after use, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Additionally, in an optional embodiment, a personal device <b>100</b> and/or server <b>200</b> may store other game values which are not necessarily currency or its equivalent and may, or may not, be treated as game resources. For example, the personal device <b>100</b> and/or server <b>200</b> may store and track reward points in a player loyalty and/or reward program, which are typically exchangeable or redeemable for goods or services. In an optional embodiment, reward points, experience levels, or the like may be earned through activity, acquired through gifting, sharing, or exchanging with another player, given or purchased from a source (such as a casino operator), or acquired in any other fashion. In an optional embodiment, a balance of reward points or experience level may be shared among a group or team of players, with the account for each member of the group or team being associated with a shared experience level or shared balance.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In an optional example, the personal device <b>100</b> may communicate with a server <b>200</b> to identify and authenticate the player account associated with the personal device <b>100</b> and, after authentication, permit the player to manage the account. As described above, the personal device <b>100</b> may be authenticated and/or identified using one or more of a device serial number, IP address, network address, IMEI number, MAC address, telephone number, account number, SIM code, username and password, PIN, code, or the like. In an optional embodiment, the personal device <b>100</b> may enable a player to manage and access reward points and/or experience levels reached by virtue of the account's reward points without regard to the casino operator awarding the reward points and/or experience levels. For example, the personal device <b>100</b> may function as an aggregator that allows the player to manage, share, exchange, and access reward points from any casino operator, even if the reward points are otherwise incompatible/non-fungible. In a further optional embodiment, the personal device <b>100</b> may function as an aggregator that allows a player to manage, share, exchange, and access rewards points within one or more networks of exchanges in which reward points are, at least partially, fungible/exchangeable.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Additionally or alternatively, according to an optional embodiment of the present invention, reward points, or experience levels reached as a result of earning reward points, may comprise game resources as that term is used herein. In an optional embodiment, reward points, experience levels, or the like may be consumable or non-consumable. Thus, in one optional embodiment, reward points and/or experience levels may decrease (be depleted from a balance) as they are used or allocated in a manner described below. Regardless of whether the reward points and/or experience levels are consumable or non-consumable, a personal device <b>100</b> may be used to direct the use of reward points and/or experience levels in a game. More specifically, in an optional embodiment, a personal device <b>100</b> may be identified and authenticated by a server <b>200</b>. Once authenticated, the personal device <b>100</b> may be used to manage and direct the use of game resources, including reward points and/or experience levels in this example, for games conducted, at least in part, using a game device <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In relation to reward points and/or experience levels, a personal device <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention may enable accurate player tracking insofar as the game resources are used for wagering on game features. That is, in an optional embodiment in which game resources are allocated to game features to wager on an event in a game, the personal device <b>100</b> and/or server <b>200</b> would have an exact record of the amount of the wager and the event wagered upon. In like fashion, in an optional embodiment, the personal device <b>100</b> and/or server <b>200</b> would have a complete record of the balance of game resources, when, where, and how game resources are acquired and used, and the like. In this manner, player tracking, i.e., gathering information on player behavior and activity, may provide broader and more accurate information than merely the information used to reward a player's loyalty. For example, in one such optional embodiment, the personal device <b>100</b>, through its interaction with the game device <b>120</b> and/or server <b>200</b>, may enable personalized earning rates of reward points and/or experience levels and management of those earning rates. In one such example, different earning rates could be used to provide an incentive to a player to play or continue play, change the rate of play, continue a behavior encouraged by the operator, discontinue a behavior discouraged by the operator, or the like by increasing or decreasing the earning rates. The player may be explicitly made aware of these incentives such as through the display <b>110</b> at the player device <b>100</b>. For example, a player may be encouraged to play faster, e.g, more hands or games per unit time, by providing an higher earning rate for higher rates of play.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In yet a further or alternate optional embodiment, a server <b>200</b> and/or personal device <b>100</b> may manage achievement outcomes which are earned in an achievement game. For example, in one optional embodiment, the achievement game may be a non-wagering, e.g., entertainment, game. The achievement game may be installed and played on a personal device <b>100</b> or may be stored remotely, such as on a cloud storage device, and accessed and played remotely. The achievement game may be free-to-download, free-to-play, fee-to-download, fee-to-play, or any combination thereof. In an optional embodiment, the achievement game is a non-wagering game in which no wager is staked although, as previously noted, it is contemplated that the non-wagering game may be free, require a subscription or fee, or require other consideration for play (e.g., joining a loyalty program, submitting data used for marketing, making a purchase, or the like). It is also noted that although no wager is staked in the non-wagering game, it is contemplated that prizes, whether tangible (such as a good, service, currency, or the like) or promotional (discounts, play currency, or the like) in nature may be offered as awards in the non-wagering game. Additionally, the non-wagering game may include a virtual economy in which real or virtual money can be used or exchanged for in-game thematic or game play elements.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The achievement game may take the form of a game, puzzle, quiz, or other activity. For example, the achievement game may be a puzzle (such as a jigsaw puzzle, crossword puzzle, chess puzzle, or the like), magic number square (such as Sudoku), arcade or video game (such as Angry Birds&#x2122;), social game (such as Farmville&#x2122;), role playing game (such as World of Warcraft&#x2122;), trivia game, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The achievement game includes one or more achievement outcomes. It is noted that, as used herein, an achievement outcome is not necessarily tied to the end of the achievement game. Rather, it is contemplated that an achievement outcome may occur at any time during the achievement game, including at any point at the beginning, middle, or end of the achievement game. It is also contemplated that an achievement outcome may be obtained over multiple achievement games, or may require multiple achievement games to obtain. For example, an achievement outcome may be earned by a player obtaining a specified score in three or more consecutive achievement games, successfully completing five achievement games in two minutes, finding a specified number of items regardless of the number of achievement games needed to find the items, or the like. As may be appreciated, an achievement game may have multiple achievement outcomes. In one such optional embodiment, the achievement game may take the form of an application (or &#x201c;app&#x201d;) that is downloaded and installed on personal device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Achievement outcomes obtained, earned, or otherwise acquired through achievement games, regardless of where the achievement game is conducted, may be stored on a server <b>200</b>. The achievement outcomes stored on the server <b>200</b> may be managed through the personal device <b>100</b> in a manner described above. For example, in an optional embodiment, the personal device <b>100</b> may be identified and authenticated and thereby be permitted access to an account storing achievement outcomes. The personal device <b>100</b> may be used to manage achievement outcomes in the player's account and, in various optional embodiments, use, share, exchange, buy, sell, acquire, or otherwise transact achievement outcomes through the personal device.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Additionally, achievement outcomes may also serve as game resources. Achievement outcomes that serve as game resources may be used in a manner similar to that described above for game resources generally. For example, after identification and authentication, a player may use a personal device <b>100</b> to allocate, or direct the allocation, of game resources (whether consumable or non-consumable) to a game conducted, at least in part, using a game device <b>120</b> separate from the personal device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A server <b>200</b> may take any form. That is, a server <b>200</b> may be a conventional network server that communicates with one or more personal devices <b>100</b> and one or more game devices <b>120</b>. The server <b>200</b> to communicate with personal devices <b>100</b> and game devices <b>120</b> in any manner, including via the world wide web, virtual private network (&#x201c;VPN&#x201d;), local area network (&#x201c;LAN&#x201d;), wide area network (&#x201c;WAN&#x201d;), mobile broadband, WiFi&#x2122;, cellular transmission, or the like. In an optional embodiment, the server <b>200</b> may store one or more accounts. In one such optional embodiment, the accounts may be tied to specific players and/or personal devices <b>100</b>. That is, in one such optional embodiment, the server <b>200</b> may determine the account available for management using a personal device <b>100</b> based on the authentication of the personal device <b>100</b>. For example, authentication may occur based on a unique characteristic of the personal device <b>100</b>. In such an optional embodiment, the authentication of the personal device <b>100</b> would serve to both ensure the account is accessed only by the correct personal device <b>100</b> but also identify the account to which access is granted. As one example, a unique number, such as a MAC address or IMEI number may be transmitted from a personal device <b>100</b> to a server <b>200</b>. Upon authenticating the personal device <b>100</b> by determining that the unique number is, in fact, associated with a valid account maintained by the server <b>200</b>, the server also determines the account to which the personal device <b>100</b> should be granted access, since it would be an account associated with the unique number. It is contemplated that, in an alternate optional embodiment, the player or player input (such as a username, password, PIN, biometric data, or the like) may be used as an additional or alternate means of authentication.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A game device <b>120</b> may take many forms including any form of mechanical or electronic random number generator, electronic gaming machine, mechanical slot machine, electronic table, roulette or other type of wheel, dice or dice reader, balls or ball reader, tiles or tile reader, cards or card reader, or the like. A game device <b>120</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention is intended to conduct, or aid in the conducting, of a game and generate a stream of game data from the game. For example, in an optional embodiment, the personal device <b>100</b> may be a mobile device and the game device <b>120</b> may be an electronic table or a card reader incorporated into a card shoe. As cards are dealt by the electronic table or card shoe, a stream of game data is generated that may include individual cards, sets or hands of cards, card combinations, or the like. It is contemplated that streams of game data may be generated by multiple different games and/or locations and that the game data may be kept separate for certain purposes, such as player tracking and game security, and integrated together for other purposes, such as creating new betting opportunities.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">With the general structure of a system described, some examples of uses of such a system are now described. Certain functions may provide access by personal devices <b>100</b> to game data. For example, in one optional embodiment, a personal device <b>100</b>, after authentication, may access, search, and sort game data which, as described above, may be obtained directly from game devices <b>120</b>. Thus, for example, a personal device <b>100</b> could include program instructions for accessing the game data communicated from the game devices <b>120</b> to a server <b>200</b> and/or personal device <b>100</b>. The program instructions may further permit the personal device <b>100</b> to search the game data to determine the game devices <b>120</b>, if any, that meet the search criterion or search criteria. For example, a personal device <b>100</b> could be used to search for game devices <b>120</b> associated with games that have progressive awards exceeding a certain amount, game devices <b>120</b> associated with games that have, or have not, produced certain winning or losing outcomes, game devices <b>120</b> associated with games that have produced certain patterns of game outcomes, game devices <b>120</b> associated with games that have certain payback rates, or the like. The game data may also be sorted for certain characteristics, such as payback, hold, game outcomes, hands per hour, or any other metric within, or stemming from, game data.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As another feature, personal devices <b>100</b> may be used to allocate game resources to, e.g., wager on, games associated with game devices <b>120</b>. For example, in one optional embodiment, the game device <b>120</b> may comprise an electronic gaming machine and a personal device <b>100</b> may comprise a mobile device such as a tablet device, smart phone, or the like. The personal device <b>100</b> may receive input directing the allocation of game resources, e.g., gaming chips, game credits, currency, or the like, to be wagered in a game conducted on the game device, i.e., an electronic gaming machine, in this example. The personal device <b>100</b> may communicate via a communication device <b>108</b> with a server <b>200</b> storing an account of the game resources. The server <b>200</b> authenticates <b>402</b> the personal device <b>100</b> and allocates <b>404</b> the game resources. This allocation may occur on the server <b>200</b> and/or it may be transmitted to the game device <b>120</b>. The game device <b>120</b> conducts <b>406</b> a game and generates a stream of game data from the game which can be used to determine whether the allocation of game resources results in an award. In this manner, a personal device <b>100</b> could be used to wager on a game device <b>120</b> remote from the personal device <b>100</b>. Thus, a personal device <b>100</b> could place a wager on a set of ten games from an electronic slot machine (i.e., the game device <b>120</b>), without actually sitting at, and playing, the slot machine or a wager on &#x201c;23&#x201d; to occur on any of the roulette wheels (i.e., the game device <b>120</b>) on the casino floor in the next spin without actually sitting at the multiple roulette tables.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In a further optional embodiment, the personal device <b>100</b> may be used to enable and/or wager on events within a game that may or may not normally be wagerable events. For example, in an optional embodiment, wagering opportunities may be presented to a player that are &#x201c;off-table&#x201d; or &#x201c;off-machine&#x201d; while still being decided by events within the game or games. In one such optional embodiment, a personal device <b>100</b> may display the game features that are activated or activatable through the personal device <b>100</b>. The player may allocate game resources to the game feature. A stream of game data may be transmitted <b>408</b> to the personal device <b>100</b> and/or server <b>200</b> for resolution <b>410</b> of the game feature and the game feature may be resolved by the personal device <b>100</b> and/or the server, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In an optional embodiment, the game feature may include a reward based on the allocation of game resources. For example, the game feature could be a side bet, jackpot bet, secondary game, proposition wager, or the like. Allocating game resources to the game feature may constitute a wager of those game resources on the game feature. Depending on the game data, the game feature either results in a winning or losing outcome and a loss or a reward based on the allocation of game resources.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">For example, if the game is a live game conducted using electronic playing cards dealt by an electronic table (e.g., the game device <b>120</b>) or physical playing cards dealt from a card-reading shoe (e.g., the game device <b>120</b>), the game data may include the dealt playing cards, selected playing cards, hands of playing cards, a stream of all playing cards over one or more games at one or more tables, an overall final outcome of one or more games at one or more tables, whether the outcomes were winning or losing outcomes, comparisons of outcomes between or among players (regardless of location), players and the house, house hands, or the like. In such an optional embodiment, a personal device <b>100</b> could place an &#x201c;off table&#x201d; wager on a straight flush occurring in a poker room within a certain time frame or certain number of hands, regardless of whether the player is participating in a poker game in the poker room. Similarly, a personal device <b>100</b> could place an &#x201c;off table&#x201d; wager on a proposition that may be fulfilled by the dealer hand in Blackjack, e.g., the dealer hand will include cards of a matching suit. As may be appreciated, the types of game features that may be wagerable would be infinite.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In yet another optional embodiment, game features may be activated by allocating game resources, but the game resources are not staked or wagered on the game feature. The game features may take any form, including by changing or enhancing the game, changing the wagering conditions, adding to the game, or the like. For example, game features may include varying paytables; second chances; additional paylines, hands, cards, reels, symbols, or the like; changes in wager limits, wager denominations, or wager amounts; varying probabilities of winning or losing outcomes; additional or different bonus opportunities; or other enhancements, changes, or alterations to a game.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Game features may be randomly selected or may be selected by the player. For example, a menu of optional features may be presented to a player and the player may allocate game resources to &#x201c;buy&#x201d; or activate a selected game feature. In one such optional embodiment, game features may vary in &#x201c;price&#x201d; and different quantities of game resources may be required to buy or activate game features, i.e., a player may only be permitted to &#x201c;buy&#x201d; or activate game features by allocating a sufficient quantity of game resources to cover the &#x201c;price&#x201d; of the game feature. It is noted that even where the game resources are non-consumable, such a variance in &#x201c;price&#x201d; may be used. For example, a player may have a balance of 10,000 points (or an experience level of &#x201c;5&#x201d;) which enables the player to activate certain game features associated with those balances or experience levels, but would not enable the player to activate certain game features associated with higher balances or higher experience levels. The player's balance or experience level may not be debited as game features are activated, but the player may still need to accumulate higher balances or experience levels to activate certain game features associated with higher balances or higher experience levels.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The nature of the game features may vary depending on the optional embodiment. For example, in one optional embodiment, the game features may be reserved exclusively for activation, purchase, or wagering using the personal device <b>100</b> to allocate game resources. That is, in one optional embodiment, exclusive game features may only be available when an wagered, purchased, or activated through the personal device <b>100</b> to allocate game resources. In another optional embodiment, a game may include exclusive game features and non-exclusive game features. In such an optional embodiment, exclusive game features may be available only when wagered, purchased, or activated through the personal device <b>100</b> to allocate game resources. When no game features are activated through a personal device <b>100</b>, the game is conducted only with non-exclusive game features. Depending on the optional embodiment, exclusive game features may replace or supplement non-exclusive game features when they have been activated through the personal device <b>100</b> by allocating game resources.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">It is contemplated that a game feature may alter the game conducted using the game device <b>120</b> in certain aspects, but maintain the overall expected value of the game. For example, a game feature may include a pay table that has higher payouts than would exist without the game feature, i.e., the game feature is an enhanced pay table. To maintain the overall expected value of the game, however, the distribution of the outcomes associated with the game feature, e.g., the enhanced pay table, may be altered so that the frequency of outcomes with the higher payouts is, for example, reduced, while the frequency of other outcomes with no or lower payouts is, for example, increased. In another example, the game feature is a progressive or jackpot payout which does not alter any of the other payouts in the pay table, but may result in a re-allocation of the outcomes so that the overall expected value of the game remains constant. In these cases, a player may have a different game experience when game features are activated, purchased, or wagered using the personal device <b>100</b>, even though the player did not obtain an advantage in the game compared to other players who do not have access to the game feature.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Conversely, in another optional embodiment, a game in which game feature(s) have been activated through a personal device <b>100</b> may have greater odds of producing a winning outcome, a higher expected value, a higher payback percentage, a lower hold, or the like, than the game as conducted without the game feature(s). In other words, in an optional embodiment, a player with access to game features may have an advantage in a game compared to players without access to game features in the game by, for example, having access to higher payouts, more frequent payouts, more frequent bonus features and/or bonus payouts, higher paying bonus features, higher bonus payouts, more frequent winning outcomes (or less frequent losing outcomes), or the like. It is contemplated that the difference in game experience could be accompanied by presenting and/or conducting the game differently when the game feature is included or, in an alternate optional embodiment, the game may be presented and/or conducted the same whether or not the game feature is included, such that the outward appearance is of the same game even though the game itself is different.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In yet another optional embodiment, game features may only affect the display or appearance of the game, without affecting the structure of the underlying game. For example, in an optional embodiment applied to a wagering game, the game features may, or may not, affect the odds of winning the game, the payback percentage, hold, expected value or return, or other metric by which the game is measured. Thus, in one such example, the game features may include an exclusive bonus game that is displayed and/or conducted differently from a non-exclusive bonus game. However, the odds of winning the exclusive bonus game and the expected value of the exclusive bonus game may be identical to the odds of winning and expected value of the non-exclusive bonus game even though the game is displayed and/or conducted differently. For example, in one such optional embodiment, a non-exclusive optional feature for a reel slot game may be a &#x201c;free spin&#x201d; bonus game in which the existing reels spin freely and any awards associated with the free spins are awarded as a bonus prize. An exclusive optional feature may be an interactive bonus game in which the game device <b>120</b> receives input from a user to, for example, select objects, control objects, initiate actions, or the like, to complete a bonus game and earn a bonus prize. In one optional embodiment, the expected value of the bonus game is the same in the free spin game and the interactive game.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">It is also contemplated that the player may, or may not, be informed of the game feature purchased, wagered, or activated through the personal device <b>100</b>. As noted above, in one optional embodiment, the player may participate in the selection of the game feature to be utilized in a game. In alternate optional embodiments, the game feature may be concealed from the player and the &#x201c;mystery&#x201d; game feature may only become apparent during the game. The selection of the &#x201c;mystery&#x201d; game feature in such an optional embodiment may be done randomly, quasi-randomly (e.g., in a weighted random fashion), or based on a predetermined selection, such as through a database that correlates achievement outcomes with specific, albeit concealed, game features or a rotating selection which is non-random, but also not displayed to the player.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">It is noted that a game feature may persist over a span of one or more games. That is, a game feature could continue to be applied to games for a defined or indefinite period of time. For example, a game feature may be applied for a specific number of games, a random number of games, until exhausted (such as free play, optional second chances, or the like), or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In an optional embodiment, the game feature is resolved by the game device <b>120</b> and a signal is transmitted to the server <b>200</b> and/or the personal device <b>100</b> indicating the outcome of the game feature. In another optional embodiment, a stream of game data is transmitted to a server <b>200</b> and/or a personal device <b>100</b> such that the game feature may be resolved by the server <b>200</b> and/or personal device <b>100</b>, respectively. More specifically, where game resources are staked on the outcome of a game feature, a game device <b>120</b>, a server <b>200</b>, and/or a personal device <b>100</b> may determine whether the outcome of the game feature (which is based on the game conducted with the game device <b>120</b>) was a winning outcome or a losing outcome and the result of that outcome, e.g., paying an award, if any.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In an optional embodiment, a personal device <b>100</b> and a game device <b>120</b> may interact. This may include the exchange of data, such as display data, account data, personal data, game data, or the like, so that the game device <b>120</b> may display information, data, graphics, or the like from the personal device <b>100</b>. Additionally or alternatively, this may include the exchange of data, such as display data, account data, personal data, game data, or the like, so that the personal device <b>100</b> may display information, data, graphics, or the like from the game device <b>120</b>. For example, in an optional embodiment, a secondary display at, or in communication with, a game device <b>120</b> may replicate or otherwise display information from, a display on the personal device <b>100</b>. In this manner, the personal device <b>100</b> may, for example, remain in the player's possession but the player may still be enabled to use the player data management functions, including the allocation of game resources, through a secondary display and/or input device on the game device <b>120</b> without the need to directly interact with the personal device <b>100</b>. Similarly, the player may be enabled to use a personal device <b>100</b> to view features, games, information, displays, data, or the like displayed on a game device. For example, in an optional embodiment described above, a player may be enabled to allocate game resources to a game that the player is not physically present at. One such example would be an electronic slot machine that the player wishes to play via the personal device <b>100</b> without physically playing the electronic slot machine and, in fact, while another player may be playing the electronic slot machine. In one such optional embodiment, the display <b>110</b> of the personal device <b>100</b> may replicate or otherwise display information from the display of the electronic slot machine.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Another feature that may be available using a personal device <b>100</b> is the display of selected bonuses available in games conducted using game devices <b>120</b>. In one such optional embodiment, a selected bonus amount may become available in one or more games, with the bonus amount selected during, or at the commencement, of the game. Put another way, the bonus may be determined at the time of the game, as distinguished from a bonus displayed prior to the game. As one example, a bonus amount may be selected randomly, quasi-randomly, weighted randomly, or the like, after a game has already commenced. In one such optional embodiment, a bonus amount may be displayed on a personal device <b>100</b>. As may be appreciated, the bonus amount may be displayed, as well as searchable and sortable, from any game, without regard to whether the player is physically present at the game.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In an optional embodiment, the player device <b>100</b> and the data associated therewith stored on the player device <b>100</b> and/or the server <b>200</b> may enable the personalization of awards, games, promotions, or the like. For example, player data may be used to create personalized awards for play of a game using a game device <b>120</b>. In an optional embodiment, the personalized awards may be searched and sorted like other game data. In additional or alternate examples, games, promotions, reward points, reward point earning rates, or the like may be personalized based on the player data.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In yet another optional application of an embodiment of the present invention, the player device <b>100</b> may be track play at a gaming device <b>120</b> for tournaments, contests, events, or the like. For example, in conventional slot tournaments, slot machines must be configured in tournament mode to conduct a tournament and, as a consequence, tournament entrants must play simultaneously on specially configured gaming devices <b>120</b>. In one optional embodiment, a player device <b>100</b> could, during normal play of a gaming device <b>120</b>, track the player's play so that the player's normal play of the gaming device <b>120</b> can be used to rank the player for purposes of a tournament, contest, event, or the like. That is, such a tournament could be &#x201c;layered&#x201d; on top of normal play of a gaming device <b>120</b> rather than requiring defined tournament play of a specially configured tournament gaming device. In another optional embodiment, a player device <b>100</b> could configure a gaming device <b>120</b> for tournament play. That is, the gaming device <b>120</b> and player device <b>100</b> could communicate (either directly or via a server <b>200</b>) so that the play at the gaming device <b>120</b> is conducted in &#x201c;tournament mode&#x201d; in place of, or in addition to, normal play. As may be appreciated, in either of these examples, it is noted that the tournament performance of the player may be tied to the game outcomes, e.g., the wins, losses, amounts won, amounts lost, or the like, or may be independent of aggregate and/or individual game outcomes.</p>
