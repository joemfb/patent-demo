<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Interactive TV networks provide a multitude of services including broadcast programming and video-on-demand. These networks reach out to users in various environments including single family residences, multi-dwelling apartments and commercial facilities. The types of service and the ability to provide those services are often dependent on the particular environment of the potential users. Quite often, the subscribers to these networks have limited choices in selecting the individual ads they can receive. Instead, ads are delivered without any targeting and end up being of little interest to viewers.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">One embodiment of the present disclosure can entail a non-transitory computer readable storage medium comprising computer instructions to present a graphical user interface (GUI) enabling subscriber selectable advertisements for delivery of the subscriber selectable advertisements to a set top box (STB), initiate storage of the subscriber selectable advertisements at a remote ad delivery server, and present the subscriber selectable advertisement Another embodiment of the present disclosure can entail a set top box (STB) comprising a controller programmed to receive subscriber selectable preferences for advertisements for delivery of the advertisements to the set top box (STB), initiate storage of the advertisements based on the subscriber selectable preferences at a remote ad delivery server, and receive advertisements based on the subscriber selectable preferences</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Yet another embodiment of the present disclosure can entail a network device comprising a controller programmed to store a subscriber selectable preference for advertisements used for selecting advertisements to send to a set top box (STB) and receive a signal from a broadcast stream indicating the location for insertion of an advertisement based on the subscriber selectable preference.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts an illustrative embodiment of a first communication system <b>100</b> for delivering media content. The communication system <b>100</b> can represent an Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) broadcast media system. The IPTV media system can include a super head-end office (SHO) <b>110</b> with at least one super headend office server (SHS) <b>111</b> which receives media content from satellite and/or terrestrial communication systems. In the present context, media content can represent audio content, moving image content such as videos, still image content, or combinations thereof. The SHS server <b>111</b> can forward packets associated with the media content to video head-end servers (VHS) <b>114</b> via a network of video head-end offices (VHO) <b>112</b> according to a common multicast communication protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The VHS <b>114</b> can distribute multimedia broadcast programs via an access network <b>118</b> to commercial and/or residential buildings <b>102</b> housing a gateway <b>104</b> (such as a common residential or commercial gateway). The building <b>102</b> can be various types including multi-dwelling units which house a plurality of different subscribers. The access network <b>118</b> can represent a group of digital subscriber line access multiplexers (DSLAMs) located in a central office or a service area interface that provide broadband services over optical links or copper twisted pairs <b>119</b> to buildings <b>102</b>. The gateway <b>104</b> can use common communication technology to distribute broadcast signals to media processors <b>106</b> such as Set-Top Boxes (STBs) which in turn present broadcast channels to media devices <b>108</b> such as computers or television sets managed in some instances by a media controller <b>107</b> (such as an infrared or RF remote control).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The gateway <b>104</b>, the media processors <b>106</b>, and media devices <b>108</b> can utilize tethered interface technologies (such as coaxial or phone line wiring) or can operate over a common wireless access protocol. With these interfaces, unicast communications can be invoked between the media processors <b>106</b> and subsystems of the IPTV media system for services such as video-on-demand (VoD), browsing an electronic programming guide (EPG), or other infrastructure services.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Some of the network elements of the IPTV media system can be coupled to one or more computing devices <b>130</b> a portion of which can operate as a web server for providing portal services over an Internet Service Provider (ISP) network <b>132</b> to wireline media devices <b>108</b> or wireless communication devices <b>116</b> by way of a wireless access base station <b>117</b> operating according to common wireless access protocols such as Wireless Fidelity (WiFi), or cellular communication technologies (such as GSM, CDMA, UMTS, WiMAX, Software Defined Radio or SDR, and so on).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Another distinct portion of the computing devices <b>130</b> can function as a server (herein referred to as server <b>130</b>). The server <b>130</b> can use common computing and communication technology to perform the function of relaying and/or receiving media content to ISP network <b>132</b> or to other networks.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> depict illustrative embodiments of a system or flow <b>400</b> and another system or flow <b>500</b> for enabling a subscriber to select and receive subscriber selectable advertising. In this regard, a subscriber can select preferences or even actual individual ad content that can be streamed to the user in a targeted fashion in a digital television system such as an IPTV system. The systems <b>400</b> or <b>500</b> can provide la carte IPTV Advertising that enable system subscribers to choose advertisements that fit their interests from a Set top Box (STB). The viewer or subscriber can select specific advertising content via GUI (Graphical User Interface) which will in turn store their choices on an Ad Delivery Server. The Ad Delivery Server can then present the subscriber's preferred advertising content during a next available ad break as further detailed below.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the system or flow <b>400</b> in one embodiment can enable a subscriber to select ad content from a catalog server using a STB at <b>402</b>. A billing server can optionally log the subscriber ad content selection at <b>404</b>. The system can use broadcaster que tone information to determine a location or time (or time slot) for delivery of the ad to a particular subscriber or STB at <b>406</b>. In one particular embodiment, an Ad Campaign Manager can deliver the subscriber selected ad content (or content in accordance with a selected subscriber preference) to the STB via a unicast transmission at <b>408</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Such a system can resolve several issues that allegedly disturb advertisers and subscribers. Advertisers would obviously want to discourage channel flipping away from the specific broadcasted content and subscribers are more likely to stay on a particular channel if they had the ability to insert advertisement into the Setup Top Box that pique the specific subscriber's interests. For example as a 40 year old male consumer would not necessarily want to receive product information or services that are only designed for females or receive product information for specific age groups when it is not applicable to them. In this regard, advertising that is not related to the viewer or subscriber's interest may not be as effective as subscriber selected advertising. The consumer will be able to select content from a GUI that is specific to content that personally interests them. For example, sports, sporting events, local events, medical, personal care, environment, travel, automobiles, racing, gaming, fashion or any other particular interest. Other techniques or inputs can be used in addition to the subscriber selectable preference to further refine the particular ads that can be delivered to the subscriber. Other inputs can include, but are not limited to demographics, geographic location, purchase histories and the like. These techniques bring e-commerce to a next level by allowing consumers to be more interactive when purchasing products and services through such a system.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In yet another embodiment, a system or flow <b>500</b> can enable a subscriber to request ad content (or ad preferences) via an STB at <b>502</b> from an ad server catalog <b>506</b> via an application server <b>504</b>. As discussed in the example above a billing server at <b>508</b> can optionally log the subscriber ad content selection and an Ad Campaign Manager at <b>510</b> can be used to deliver the subscriber selected ad content (or content in accordance with a selected subscriber preference) to the STB via an ad delivery system <b>512</b>. The ad delivery system can include a unicast transmission system, but can utilize other transmission system where specific ad content can be inserted or splice into a video stream for delivery to the STB at <b>514</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">From an STB, a subscriber can be presented with a screen or GUI that allows them to choose specific advertising content from an Advertisement Content Storage via an integrated IPTV Application Server. Once the subscriber has selected the advertisement content that piques his or her interests, this information will then be stored on the Ad Delivery Server using for example the STB's GUID (Globally Unique Identifier). Then once the broadcasted content calls for an advertisement to be inserted, the specific advertisement content that the subscriber specified will be spliced into the viewed video stream. If the subscriber does not select any content, then default ad insertion policies can be applied. The other service providers simply broadcast advertising content during specific time slots to all viewers.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> depicts an illustrative method <b>600</b> that operates in portions of the communication systems of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Method <b>600</b> can begin with step <b>602</b> in which the method at <b>602</b> presents a graphical user interface (GUI) enabling subscriber selectable advertisements for delivery of the subscriber selectable advertisements to a set top box (STB). At <b>604</b>, the method <b>600</b> can present filters for targeted ad delivery based on one or more of demographics, geographic location, purchased products, or purchased services. At <b>606</b>, the system (or subscriber) can select ads from an ad catalog server (based on subscriber selected preferences or subscriber selections) and transmit the STB's Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) to a billing server. At <b>608</b>, such selection can initiate storage of the subscriber selectable advertisements at a remote ad delivery server, where the storage of the subscriber selectable advertisement can be done using a STB's GUID. At <b>610</b>, the method can present the present the subscriber selectable advertisement, optionally using a unicast stream server. In one embodiment, the method at <b>612</b> can receive a unicast of a subscriber selectable advertisement selected by an ad campaign manager and play the subscriber selectable advertisement selected by the ad campaign manager when a que tone is delivered in a broadcast stream. Transmission of the ad can involve splicing the subscriber selectable ad at <b>614</b> into a digital video stream before the presentation (<b>610</b>). In yet another option, the method at <b>616</b> can collect EPG information or channel subscription information from an IPTV network to provide further automated targeted ad delivery. It should be understood that the order or inclusion of the steps should not be implied from the specific order described herein.</p>
