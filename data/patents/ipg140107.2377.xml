<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a perpendicular magnetic recording medium mounted on an HDD (hard disk drive) or the like of perpendicular magnetic recording type, and the perpendicular magnetic recording medium.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">With an increase in capacity of information processing in recent years, various information recording technologies have been developed. In particular, the surface recording density of an HDD using magnetic recording technology is continuously increasing at an annual rate of approximately 100%. In recent years, an information recording capacity exceeding 160 GB per one magnetic disk with a 2.5-inch diameter for use in an HDD or the like has been desired. To fulfill such demands, an information recording density exceeding 250 Gbits per one square inch is desired to be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To attain a high recording density in a magnetic disk for use in an HDD or the like, a magnetic disk of a perpendicular magnetic recording type has been suggested in recent years. In a conventional in-plane magnetic recording type, the axis of easy magnetization of a magnetic recording layer is oriented in a plane direction of a base surface. In the perpendicular magnetic recording type, by contrast, the axis of easy magnetization is adjusted so as to be oriented in a direction perpendicular to the base surface. In the perpendicular magnetic recording type, compared with the in-plane recording type, a thermal fluctuation phenomenon can be more suppressed at the time of high-density recording, and therefore the perpendicular magnetic recording type is suitable for increasing the recording density.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally, as a magnetic recording layer, CoCrPt&#x2014;SiO<sub>2 </sub>or CoCrPt&#x2014;TiO<sub>2 </sub>has been widely used. In Co, a crystal of a hcp structure (a hexagonal close-packed crystal lattice) grows in a columnar shape. And Cr and SiO<sub>2 </sub>(or TiO<sub>2</sub>) are subjected to segregation to form a non-magnetic grain boundary. By using such a granular structure, physically independent fine magnetic grains can be easily formed, and a high recording density can be easily attained.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Also, for example, Patent Document 1 discloses a perpendicular magnetic recording medium in which a recording density can be further increased. This includes two magnetic recording layers, thereby improving a coercive force Hc to increase the recording density. However, an oxide contained in each layer is of one type (SiO<sub>2</sub>), and each layer has a different composition ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the perpendicular magnetic recording medium, a medium protective layer is provided that protects the surface of the magnetic recording layer so that the surface is not damaged when the magnetic head collides with the perpendicular magnetic recording medium. The medium protective layer forms a high-hardness coating with carbon overcoat (COC), that is, carbon coating. In the medium protective layer, the carbon coating may include hard diamond-like coupling and soft graphite coupling in a mixed manner (for example, Patent Document 2). Also, a technology of manufacturing a diamond-like coupling protective film by CVD (Chemical Vapour Deposition) is also disclosed (for example, Patent Document 3).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">On the other hand, to increase reliability of shock resistance, abrasive resistance, corrosion resistance, and others of the perpendicular magnetic recording medium, it is known that increasing a spectral ratio Dh/Gh with a Raman spectrum of the medium protective layer with carbon hydride as a main component formed on the magnetic recording layer is effective. To increase Dh/Gh of the medium protective layer, it is known that heating the disk base having the magnetic recording layer formed thereon at the time of forming the medium protective layer is effective (for example, Patent Document 4).</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, if the heating temperature at the time of forming the medium protective layer becomes too high, even with an improvement in durability of the medium protective layer, the coercive force Hc decreases. It is thought that this is because the granular structure of the magnetic recording layer is destroyed due to excessive heating. In this manner, the coercive force Hc and reliability have a trade-off relation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention has been devised in view of the above problem in the vertical magnetic recording medium. An object of the present invention is to provide a method of manufacturing a perpendicular magnetic recording medium in which a high coercive force can be maintained even with heating and both of the coercive force Hc and reliability can be achieved at a higher level, and to provide the perpendicular magnetic recording medium.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Means for Solving the Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">To solve the above problem, the inventors of the present invention have performed diligent studies. As a result, it was found that, with a plurality of oxides (hereinafter referred to as a &#x201c;composite oxide&#x201d;) contained in a grain boundary part of the magnetic recording layer, the coercive force Hc can be increased, compared with a magnetic recording layer containing an oxide of a single type. And, according to this, it was found that the coercive force can be maintained higher even with heating, thereby completing the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">That is, to solve the above problem, in a typical structure of the present invention, in a method of manufacturing perpendicular magnetic recording medium including at least a magnetic recording layer, which is a ferromagnetic layer of a granular structure in which a non-magnetic grain boundary part is formed between crystal grains each grown in a columnar shape, and a medium protective layer with carbon hydride as a main component in this order on a base, the method includes: a magnetic recording layer forming step of forming the magnetic recording layer so that the grain boundary part contains oxides of a plurality of types; and a medium protective layer forming step of forming the medium protective layer in a state where the base having the magnetic recording layer formed thereon is heated at 160 to 200 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The coercive force Hc and reliability have a trade-off relation. According to the above structure, a magnetic recording layer containing oxides of a plurality of types inherently has a high coercive force Hc, compared with a magnetic recording layer containing an oxide of a single type. Therefore, even if these layers are heated to the same temperature, a high coercive force Hc can be maintained. Therefore, if heating is performed at the above-mentioned temperature, both of the coercive force Hc and reliability can be achieved at a higher level.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">To solve the above problem, in another typical structure of the present invention, a perpendicular magnetic recording medium including at least a magnetic recording layer, which is a ferromagnetic layer of a granular structure in which a non-magnetic grain boundary part is formed between crystal grains each grown in a columnar shape, and a medium protective layer with carbon hydride as a main component in this order on a base, wherein the grain boundary part contains oxides of a plurality of types, and the medium protective layer is formed in a state where the base having the magnetic recording layer formed thereon is heated at 160 to 200 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The magnetic recording layer has a coercive force Hc equal to or larger than 5000 (Oe), and a peak ratio Dh/Gh when a D peak Dh appearing near 1350 cm&#x2212;1 of a spectrum obtained by excluding fluorescence from a Raman spectrum at a wave number of 900 cm&#x2212;1 to a wave number of 1800 cm&#x2212;1 obtained by pumping the medium protective layer with argon ion laser light having a wavelength of 514.5 nm and a G peak Gh appearing near 1520 cm&#x2212;1 thereof are subjected to waveform separation with a Gaussian function can be 0.75 to 0.95. This is to maintain high reliability of the perpendicular magnetic recording layer.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The above oxides of the plurality of types can be SiO<sub>2 </sub>and TiO<sub>2</sub>. This is because the coercive force Hc is improved with these oxides.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The above perpendicular magnetic recording medium further includes a lower magnetic recording layer below the magnetic recording layer, the lower magnetic recording layer is a ferromagnetic layer of a granular structure in which a non-magnetic grain boundary part is formed between crystal grains each grown in a columnar shape, and the grain boundary part of the lower magnetic recording layer may contain an oxide of one or more types.</p>

<heading id="h-0013" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0043">In the following, with reference to the attached drawings, preferred embodiments of the present invention are described in detail. The dimensions, materials, and others such as specific numerical values shown in these embodiments are merely examples so as to facilitate understanding of the invention, and are not meant to restrict the present invention unless otherwise specified. Note that, in the specification and drawings, components having substantially the same functions and structures are provided with the same reference characters and are not redundantly described, and components not directly relating to the present invention are not shown in the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0044">Embodiments of the perpendicular magnetic recording medium according to the present invention are described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram for describing the structure of a perpendicular magnetic recording medium <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment. The perpendicular magnetic recording medium <b>100</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is configured of a disk base <b>110</b>, an adhesion layer <b>112</b>, a first soft magnetic layer <b>114</b><i>a</i>, a spacer layer <b>114</b><i>b</i>, a second soft magnetic layer <b>114</b><i>c</i>, a preliminary ground layer <b>116</b>, a first ground layer <b>118</b><i>a</i>, a second ground layer <b>118</b><i>b</i>, a non-magnetic granular layer <b>120</b>, a magnetic recording layer <b>122</b><i>b</i>, a continuous layer <b>124</b>, a medium protective layer <b>126</b>, and a lubricating layer <b>128</b>. Note that the first soft magnetic layer <b>114</b><i>a</i>, the spacer layer <b>114</b><i>b</i>, and the second soft magnetic layer <b>114</b><i>c </i>together form a soft magnetic layer <b>114</b>. The first ground layer <b>118</b><i>a </i>and the second ground layer <b>118</b><i>b </i>together form a ground layer <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0045">As described below, in the perpendicular magnetic recording medium <b>100</b> shown in the present embodiment, oxides of a plurality of types (composite oxide) are contained in the magnetic recording layer <b>122</b><i>b</i>. With this, the composite oxide is subjected to segregation in the non-magnetic grain boundary.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0046">For the disk base <b>110</b>, a glass disk molded in a disk shape by direct-pressing amorphous aluminosilicate glass can be used. Note that the type, size, thickness, and others of the glass disk are not particularly restricted. A material of the glass disk can be, for example, aluminosilicate glass, soda lime glass, soda alumino silicate glass, aluminoborosilicate glass, borosilicate glass, quartz glass, chain silicate glass, or glass ceramic, such as crystallized glass. This glass disk is sequentially subjected to grinding, polishing, and chemical strengthening, thereby allowing the smooth, non-magnetic disk base <b>110</b> made of chemically-strengthened glass disk to be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0047">On the disk base <b>110</b>, the adhesion layer <b>112</b> to the continuous layer <b>124</b> are sequentially formed by DC magnetron sputtering, and the medium protective layer <b>126</b> can be formed by CVD. Then, the lubricating layer <b>128</b> can be formed by dip coating. Note that, in view of high productivity, using an in-line-type film forming method is also preferable. In the following, the structure of each layer and its manufacturing method are described.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0048">The adhesion layer <b>112</b> is an amorphous ground layer. The adhesion layer <b>112</b> is formed in contact with the disk base <b>110</b>, and includes a function of increasing a peel strength between the soft magnetic layer <b>114</b> formed on this layer and the disk base <b>110</b>, and also a function of making crystal grains of each layer formed on this layer finer and more uniform. When the disk base <b>110</b> is made of amorphous glass, the adhesion layer <b>112</b> is preferably an amorphous alloy film so as to comply with that amorphous glass surface.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0049">As the adhesion layer <b>112</b>, for example, any can be selected from a CrTi-type amorphous layer, a CoW-type amorphous layer, a CrW-type amorphous layer, a CrTa-type amorphous layer, and a CrNb-type amorphous layer. Among all, a CoW-type alloy film is particularly preferable because of forming an amorphous metal film containing microcrystallines. The adhesion layer <b>112</b> may be a single layer formed of a single material, but may be formed by multilayering a plurality of layers. For example, a CoW layer or a CrW layer may be formed on a CrTi layer. These adhesion layers <b>112</b> are preferably subjected to sputtering with a material containing carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen, or oxygen, or have their surface layer exposed with any of these gases.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0050">The soft magnetic layer <b>114</b> is a layer in which a magnetic path is temporarily formed at the time of recording so as to let a magnetic flux pass through a recording layer in a perpendicular direction in a perpendicular magnetic recording type. By interposing the non-magnetic spacer layer <b>114</b><i>b </i>between the first soft magnetic layer <b>114</b><i>a </i>and the second soft magnetic layer <b>114</b><i>c</i>, the soft magnetic layer <b>114</b> can be configured to include Antiferro-magnetic exchange coupling (AFC). With this, magnetizing directions of the soft magnetic layer <b>114</b> can be aligned with high accuracy along the magnetic path (magnetic circuit), the number of perpendicular components in the magnetizing direction becomes extremely small, and therefore noise occurring from the soft magnetic layer <b>114</b> can be reduced. As the composition of the first soft magnetic layer <b>114</b><i>a </i>and the second soft magnetic layer <b>114</b><i>c</i>, a cobalt-type alloy, such as CoTaZr; a Co&#x2014;Fe-type alloy, such as CoCrFeB and FeCoTaZr; a Ni&#x2014;Fe-type alloy having a [Ni&#x2014;Fe/Sn]n multilayered structure or the like can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0051">The preliminary ground layer <b>116</b> is a non-magnetic alloy layer. The preliminary ground layer <b>116</b> includes an operation of protecting the soft magnetic layer <b>114</b>, and also a function of orienting in a disk perpendicular direction an easy axis of magnetization of a hexagonal close-packed structure (hcp structure) included in the ground layer <b>118</b> formed on the preliminary ground layer.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0052">In the preliminary ground layer <b>116</b>, a (111) surface of a face-centered cubic structure (fcc structure) is preferably parallel to a main surface of the disk base <b>110</b>. Also, the preliminary ground layer <b>116</b> may have a structure in which these crystal structures and amorphous are mixed. As a material of the preliminary ground layer <b>116</b>, a selection can be made from Ni, Cu, Pt, Pd, Zr, Hf, Nb, and Ta. Furthermore, an alloy including any of these metals as a main element and any one or more additional elements from among Ti, V, Ta, Cr, Mo, and W may be used. For example, NiW, CuW, CuCr, or Ta can be suitably selected.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0053">The ground layer <b>118</b> has a hcp structure, and has an operation of growing crystals of the hcp structure of the magnetic recording layer <b>122</b> as a granular structure. Therefore, as the crystal orientation of the ground layer <b>118</b> is higher, that is, a (0001) surface of a crystal of the ground layer <b>118</b> is more parallel to the main surface of the disk base <b>110</b>, the orientation of the magnetic recording layer <b>122</b><i>b </i>can be improved. As a material of the ground layer <b>118</b>, Ru is typical. Other than that, a selection can be made from RuCr and RuCo. Ru has a hcp structure, and a lattice space of the crystal is similar to that of Co. Therefore, the magnetic recording layer <b>122</b> having Co as a main component can be oriented in good condition.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0054">When the ground layer <b>118</b> is made of Ru, by changing the gas pressure at the time of sputtering, a two-layer structure made of Ru can be achieved. Specifically, when the second ground layer <b>118</b><i>b </i>on an upper-layer side is formed, the gas pressure of Ar is made higher than that when the first ground layer <b>118</b><i>a </i>on a lower-layer side is formed. When the gas pressure is made higher, a free traveling distance of plasma ions to be sputtered is shortened, and therefore the film-forming speed becomes slow, thereby improving the crystal separation ability. Also, with a high pressure, the size of the crystal lattice becomes smaller. Since the size of the crystal lattice of Ru is larger than that of the crystal lattice of Co, when the crystal lattice of Ru is made smaller, it becomes closer to that of Co, thereby further improving the crystal orientation of the Co granular layer.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0055">The non-magnetic granular layer <b>120</b> is a non-magnetic granular layer. The non-magnetic granular layer <b>120</b> is formed on the hcp crystal structure of the ground layer <b>118</b>. And, by making a granular layer of the magnetic recording layer <b>122</b><i>b </i>grown on the non-magnetic granular layer <b>120</b>, an operation of separating the magnetic granular layer from a stage of initial growth (leading) is provided. The composition of the non-magnetic granular layer <b>120</b> can be a granular structure by forming a grain boundary by causing segregation of non-magnetic substance between non-magnetic crystal grains made of a Co-type alloy. In particular, CoCr&#x2014;SiO<sub>2 </sub>and CoCrRu&#x2014;SiO<sub>2 </sub>can be suitably used and, furthermore, in place of Ru, Rh (rhodium), Pd (palladium), Ag (silver), Os (osmium), Ir (iridium), and Au (gold) can also be used. Still further, the non-magnetic substance is a substance in which a grain boundary part can be formed around magnetic particles so that an exchange interaction operation between magnetic particles (magnetic grains) is suppressed or interrupted, and can be any as long as it is a non-magnetic substance that is not incorporated into cobalt (Co). Examples can include silicon oxide (SiOx), chrome (Cr), chrome oxide (CrO<sub>2</sub>), titanium oxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>), zircon oxide (ZrO<sub>2</sub>), and tantalum oxide (Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0056">The magnetic recording layer <b>122</b><i>b </i>is a ferromagnetic layer having a granular structure. This granular structure is such that a grain boundary is formed by causing segregation of a non-magnetic substance around magnetic particles made of a hard magnetic body selected from a Co-type alloy, a Fe-type alloy, and a Ni-type alloy, and a non-magnetic grain boundary part is formed between crystal grains grown in a columnar shape. By providing the non-magnetic granular layer <b>120</b>, these magnetic particles can make an epitaxial growth continuously from their granular structure.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0057">Furthermore, in the present embodiment, a magnetic recording layer forming process is included in which the grain boundary part of the magnetic recording layer <b>122</b><i>b </i>is formed so as to contain oxides of a plurality of types as a non-magnetic substance. Here, the types of non-magnetic substance to be contained are not restrictive and, for example, any can be arbitrarily selected from SiO<sub>2</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, CoO, and Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Among all, SiO<sub>2 </sub>and TiO<sub>2 </sub>are preferable. This is because the coercive force is improved with these oxides. The magnetic recording layer <b>122</b><i>b </i>contains, in the grain boundary part, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>and TiO<sub>2 </sub>as an example of a composite oxide (oxides of a plurality of types). With this, an hcp crystal structure of CoCrPt&#x2014;Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;TiO<sub>2 </sub>can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0058">The continuous layer <b>124</b> is formed of a thin film that is magnetically continuous in an in-plane direction of the main surface of the disk base <b>110</b> on the magnetic recording layer <b>122</b><i>b </i>having a granular structure. By providing the continuous layer <b>124</b>, a high-density recording property and a low-noise property of the magnetic recording layer <b>122</b><i>b </i>can be improved. In addition, it is possible to enhance the inverted-magnetic-domain nucleation magnetic field Hn, improve the heat-resistant fluctuation characteristic, and improve the overwrite characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0059">The composition of the continuous layer <b>124</b> may be any of CoCrPt, CoCrPtB, and CoCrPtBCu. This is because both of the S/N ratio and the overwrite characteristic are improved by using the continuous layer of any composition.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0060">Note that, as the continuous layer <b>124</b>, not a single layer but a layer of a CGC structure (Coupled Granular Continuous) may be used in which a thin film (continuous layer) is formed that shows a high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and a high saturation magnetization Ms. Note that the CGC structure can be configured of a magnetic recording layer having a granular structure, a thin-film coupling control layer made of a non-magnetic substance, such as Pd or Pt, and an exchange energy control layer formed of an exchange multilayered film in which thin films of CoB and Pd are multilayered.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0061">The medium protective layer <b>126</b> has carbon hydride as a main component. In the present embodiment, a medium protective layer forming process of forming the medium protective layer <b>126</b> is performed by CVD in a state where the disk base having the magnetic recording layer <b>122</b><i>b </i>formed thereon is heated at 160 to 200 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0062">Note that, the medium protective layer <b>126</b> can be formed by forming a film out of carbon by CVD while keeping a vacuum state. The medium protective layer <b>126</b> is a protective layer for protecting the perpendicular magnetic recording layer from a shock of the magnetic head. In general, a carbon film formed by CVD has an improved film hardness compared with the one formed by sputtering, and therefore the perpendicular magnetic recording medium can be more effectively protected from a shock from the magnetic head.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a descriptive diagram for describing an image of a Raman spectrum. Here, within a range of wave numbers of 900 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>to 1800 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>of a Raman spectrum, a background due to fluorescence was corrected with linear approximation. And, a ratio in peak height between a D peak and a G peak was found as Dh/Gh.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a graph depicting a trade-off relation between the coercive force Hc and reliability of the perpendicular magnetic recording medium of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, which will be described further below (however, other than fourth and fifth examples). The coercive force Hc is represented by a curve &#x201c;&#x2666;&#x201d; (a magnetic recording layer containing an oxide of a single type) and a curve &#x201c;&#x25aa;&#x201d; (a magnetic recording layer containing a composite oxide). Dh/Gh indicative of reliability is represented by a curve &#x201c;&#x25b4;&#x201d; (a magnetic recording layer containing an oxide of a single type) and a curve &#x201c;&#x25be;&#x201d; (a magnetic recording layer containing a composite oxide). As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the coercive force Hc and reliability (Dh/Gh) have a trade-off relation. The magnetic recording layer containing a composite oxide (curve &#x201c;&#x25aa;&#x201d;) inherently has a high coercive force Hc, compared with the magnetic recording layer containing an oxide of a single type (curve &#x201c;&#x2666;&#x201d;). Thus, even if the layer is heated to the same temperature, the coercive force Hc can be maintained higher. Moreover, Dh/Gh indicative of reliability (curves &#x201c;&#x25b4;&#x201d; and &#x201c;&#x25be;&#x201d;) approximately match each other. Therefore, as for the perpendicular magnetic recording medium having a magnetic recording layer containing an oxide of a single type, to achieve both of the coercive force Hc and Dh/Gh having a trade-off relation, heating at a temperature T<b>1</b>, which corresponds to a point of intersection of the curves representing these indexes, can be thought. However, if the perpendicular recording medium having a magnetic recording layer containing a composite oxide is heated at a temperature T<b>2</b>, which achieves both of the coercive force Hc and Dh/Gh, both of the coercive force Hc and reliability can be achieved at a higher level.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0065">In the above-described method, a nitriding process is further performed on the surface of the medium protective layer <b>126</b>. Specifically, after the medium protective layer <b>126</b> is formed, it may be further exposed under a nitrogen atmosphere at a flow rate of 100 to 350 sccm for surface treatment of the medium protective layer <b>126</b>. With the exposure under a nitrogen atmosphere at a flow rate of 100 to 350 sccm, an atomic weight ratio (N/C) between nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) is increased. Thus, adhesiveness and hardness of the medium protective layer <b>126</b> and the lubricating layer <b>128</b> become suitable.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0066">The lubricating layer <b>128</b> can be formed by forming a film out of perfluoropolyether (PFPE) by dip coating. PFPE has a molecular structure in a long chain shape, and is coupled to an N atom on the surface of the medium protective layer <b>126</b> with high affinity. With this operation of the lubricating layer <b>128</b>, a damage or loss of the medium protective layer <b>126</b> can be prevented even if the magnetic head makes contact with the surface of the perpendicular magnetic recording medium <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagram for describing the structure of another perpendicular magnetic recording medium <b>200</b> according to the present embodiment. A difference from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is that a lower magnetic recording layer <b>122</b><i>a </i>is further provided below the magnetic recording layer <b>122</b><i>b</i>. The lower magnetic recording layer <b>122</b><i>a </i>is a ferromagnetic layer of a granular structure in which a non-magnetic grain boundary part is formed between crystal grains each grown in a columnar shape. And, the grain boundary part of the lower magnetic recording layer <b>122</b><i>a </i>contains an oxide of one or more types.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0068">By further providing the lower magnetic recording layer <b>122</b><i>a</i>, the coercive force Hc is further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0069">The oxide of one or more types contained in the above-described lower magnetic recording layer <b>122</b><i>a </i>may be oxide selected from silicon oxide (SiOx), chrome (Cr), chrome oxide (CrO<sub>2</sub>), titanium oxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>), zircon oxide (ZrO<sub>2</sub>), and tantalum oxide (Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), and cobalt oxide (CoO).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0070">As an oxide, any substance can be used as long as it allows a grain boundary part to be formed around magnetic particles so that an exchange interaction operation between magnetic particles (magnetic grains) is suppressed or interrupted. In particular, SiO<sub>2 </sub>and TiO<sub>2 </sub>are preferably both included. SiO<sub>2 </sub>has a characteristic of promoting finer and more isolated magnetic grains, and TiO<sub>2 </sub>has a characteristic of improving an electromagnetic transducing characteristic (in particular, SNR). And, by combining these oxides for segregation over the grain boundaries of the magnetic recording layer, both of the advantages can be enjoyed.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0071">With the above manufacturing processes, the perpendicular magnetic recording medium <b>200</b> can be obtained. In the following, effectiveness of the present invention is described by using an example and comparative examples.</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="1">EXAMPLES AND EVALUATION</heading>
<p id="p-0057" num="0072">The process of manufacturing the perpendicular magnetic recording medium <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is described below by using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>a</i>). On the disk base <b>110</b>, by using a vacuumed film forming device, the adhesion layer <b>112</b> to the non-magnetic granular layer <b>120</b> were sequentially formed in an Ar atmosphere by DC magnetron sputtering (step S<b>300</b>). The adhesion layer <b>112</b> was of CrTi. In the soft magnetic layer <b>114</b>, the composition of the first soft magnetic layer <b>114</b><i>a </i>and the second soft magnetic layer <b>114</b><i>c </i>was of CoCrFeB, and the composition of the spacer layer <b>114</b><i>b </i>was of Ru. The composition of the preliminary ground layer <b>116</b> was of an NiW alloy with an fcc structure. In the ground layer <b>118</b>, the first ground layer <b>118</b><i>a </i>was formed out of Ru under low-pressure Ar, and the second ground layer <b>118</b><i>b </i>was formed out of Ru under high-pressure Ar. The composition of the non-magnetic granular layer <b>120</b> was of non-magnetic CoCr&#x2014;SiO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0073">The magnetic recording layer <b>122</b><i>b </i>was formed with a structure in examples below (step S<b>310</b>). The composition of the continuous layer <b>124</b> was of CoCrPtB (step S<b>320</b>). As for the medium protective layer <b>126</b>, a film was formed by CVD with the use of carbon hydride C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4 </sub>after a heating process of heating the disk base having the air recording layer <b>122</b><i>b </i>formed thereon at 160 to 200 degrees Celsius (step S<b>330</b>). On the surface of the formed medium protective layer <b>126</b>, a nitriding process is performed by using a nitriding process CN (step S<b>332</b>). With this, the atomic weight ratio (N/C) between nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) is increased, thereby making adhesiveness and hardness of the medium protective layer and the lubricating layer suitable. Then, the lubricating layer <b>128</b> was formed by dip coating with the use of PFPE (step S<b>340</b>). Processes to the point in the present example are steps S<b>310</b> and S<b>330</b>.</p>
