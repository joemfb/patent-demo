<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A clutch mechanism for use with a carrier of a linear drive device includes a housing, a first gear, and a first clutch arrangement. The first gear coupled to the housing and has gear teeth to engage a threaded shaft of a linear drive device . Rotation of the shaft causes the housing to move along the shaft in a first mode of operation. The first clutch arrangement prevents substantial rotation of the first gear. The first gear permits rotation of the first gear with respect to the housing. The housing can be manually moved along a length of the shaft, in a second mode of operation, by exerting a force on the housing. The rotational force applied to the first gear through the interaction of the threaded shaft and the gear teeth exceeds the first threshold.</p>

<p id="p-0006" num="0005">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments of the present invention relate to a clutch mechanism for use with a linear drive device, a linear drive device including such a clutch mechanism, and a surgical tool holding mechanism including such a linear drive device. Specifically, embodiments of the present invention relate to a surgical tool holding mechanism including a linear drive device and clutch mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">2. Description of Related Art Including Information Disclosed Under 37 CFR 1.97 and 37 CFR 1.98</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Linear drive devices are known for use in various applications. Generally, these devices comprise a motor coupled to a threaded shaft and a carrier mounted on the threaded shaft. The carrier has an element which engages the thread of the shaft and the carrier is prevented from rotation about the shaft such that when the motor drives rotation of the shaft, the carrier is driven along a length of the shaft in a linear movement. Reversing the rotation of the shaft causes a reversal in the direction of the linear movement of the carrier along the shaft. Thus, a motor can be used to impart linear motion to a carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An example of an application for such linear drive device is in the operation of a surgical robot or other surgical tool holding mechanism to drive a zoom motion of an endoscope mounted on the carrier of the device&#x2014;in other words, to move an endoscope or endoscopic instrument into and out of a surgical site.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Linear drive devices used in applications such as surgical robotics (and the like) are often configured to drive the carrier at a low speed&#x2014;for example, for safety reasons. If a large movement is required, then it is convenient for faster movement of the carrier to be permitted. This may be achieved by providing an actuator coupled to the element of the carrier. The actuator, when activated, causes the element to disengage the thread of the threaded shaft of the linear drive device. The carrier is, therefore, free to be manually moved along the length of the threaded shaft without requiring rotation of the shaft itself. When the carrier has been moved to the desired location along the length of the shaft, the actuator is deactivated to cause the element to re-engage the thread of the shaft. Movement of the carrier can then be driven in the normal manner.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A problem associated with disengaging the element entirely from the threaded shaft is that the element is either fully engaged or disengaged. As such, when the element is initially disengaged, the weight of the carrier may cause an inadvertent movement of the carrier as the weight of the carrier and any instruments attached to it are suddenly no longer supported by the tool holding mechanism and, for example, may be heavier than the user anticipated. In addition, movement to the carrier with the element disengaged increases the risk of other erroneous movements of the carrier. In surgical applications, erroneous movements of the carrier can be a serious safety concern (potentially causing injury to a patient or the surgeon).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is an object of embodiments of the present invention to seek to ameliorate the problems associated with the prior art.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Accordingly, an aspect of the present invention provides a clutch mechanism for use with a carrier of a linear drive device, the mechanism comprising: a housing; a first gear coupled to the housing and having gear teeth configured to engage a threaded shaft of a linear drive device, such that rotation of the shaft causes the housing to move along the shaft in a first mode of operation; and a first clutch arrangement associated with the first gear and configured to prevent substantial rotation of the first gear with respect to the housing when a rotational force applied to the first gear is less than a threshold force and to permit rotation of the first gear with respect to the housing when a rotational force applied to the first gear is greater than the threshold force, such that the housing can be manually moved along a length of the shaft, in a second mode of operation, by exerting a force on the housing such that the rotational force applied to the first gear through the interaction of the threaded shaft and the gear teeth exceeds the first threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, the first clutch arrangement comprises a first clutch plate and a second clutch plate arranged to apply a compressive force on the first gear.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Preferably, the second gear is substantially freely rotatable with respect to the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Advantageously, the mechanism further comprises a second clutch arrangement associated with the second gear and configured to prevent substantial rotation of the second gear with respect to the housing when a rotational force applied to at least one of the gear teeth of the second gear is less than a threshold force and to permit rotation of the second gear with respect to the housing when a rotational force applied to the second gear is greater than the threshold force, such that the housing can be moved along the shaft by rotation of the shaft of a linear drive device in a first mode of operation and can be manually moved along a length of the shaft in a second mode of operation.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an embodiment of the present invention comprises a linear drive device <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The linear drive device <b>1</b> comprises a threaded shaft <b>2</b> and a motor <b>16</b> coupled to the threaded shaft <b>2</b> such that activation of a motor <b>16</b> causes the threaded shaft <b>2</b> to rotate. Preferably, the motor <b>16</b> is coupled to a proximal end of the threaded shaft <b>2</b>. This coupling may be achieved by the use of a gearbox (not shown) or through a direct coupling.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The threaded shaft <b>2</b> and motor <b>16</b> are fitted to a housing <b>4</b>. The motor <b>16</b> is secured to the housing <b>4</b> and prevented from rotation with respect thereto. This may be achieved by, for example, the use of an adhesive, or one or more bolts. Alternatively, the motor <b>16</b> may have a casing (not shown) which is integrally formed with the housing <b>4</b>. Other arrangements are also possible.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The threaded shaft <b>2</b> is free to rotate with respect to the housing <b>4</b> driven by the motor <b>16</b>. In an embodiment, a bearing (not shown) is provided at a distal end of the threaded shaft <b>2</b> which supports the threaded shaft <b>2</b> with respect to the housing <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a carrier comprising a housing <b>3</b> and a clutch mechanism <b>5</b> is provided. The housing <b>3</b> defines a first <b>31</b> and may define a second <b>32</b> cavity. Each cavity <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> may comprise a pair of walls <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> separated from each other by one or more spacers <b>35</b> (this can be best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the clutch mechanism <b>5</b> is configured to be fitted to the housing <b>3</b> and comprises a first <b>6</b> and a second <b>7</b> gear. The first gear <b>6</b> is fitted within the first cavity <b>31</b> of the housing <b>3</b> (between the walls thereof <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>), and the second gear <b>7</b> is fitted within the second cavity <b>32</b> of the housing <b>3</b> (between the walls thereof <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>). A path <b>21</b> is defined between the first <b>6</b> and second <b>7</b> gears, the path <b>21</b> being configured to receive the threaded shaft <b>2</b> of the linear drive device <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The first <b>6</b> and second <b>7</b> gears have teeth <b>61</b>, <b>71</b> which are adapted to engage the thread <b>22</b> of the threaded shaft <b>2</b> of the linear drive device <b>1</b> received in the path <b>21</b> defined by the gears <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The first <b>6</b> and second <b>7</b> gears are mounted on respective axles <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>. The axles <b>8</b>, <b>9</b> are fitted to the housing <b>3</b>, and the first <b>6</b> and second <b>7</b> gears are each substantially free to rotate about a longitudinal axis of the associated axle <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>. The axles <b>8</b>, <b>9</b> may be elongate members which pass through an orifice <b>62</b>, <b>72</b> in each of the gears <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>; a length of the axles <b>8</b>, <b>9</b> may be greater than a length of the respective gear <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Rotational movement of the first gear <b>6</b> about the longitudinal axis of its axle <b>8</b> is restricted or restrained, for example, by a compressive force across two end faces <b>63</b>, <b>64</b> of the gear <b>6</b>. This compressive force may be achieved through the use of a pair of clutch or brake plates <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> (or any other such member or mechanism).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Each clutch plate <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> is disposed adjacent a respective end face <b>63</b>, <b>64</b> of the first gear <b>6</b>, and is configured to apply a force to the respective end face <b>63</b>, <b>64</b> of the gear <b>6</b>. The clutch plates <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> are located within the first cavity <b>31</b> of the housing <b>3</b> along with the first gear <b>6</b>. The arrangement is such that the clutch plates <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> are generally parallel to the walls <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> of the cavity <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The compressive force applied to the first gear <b>6</b> can be adjusted through the use of an adjustment mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">For example, in an embodiment, a first end of the axle <b>8</b> passes through a hole <b>111</b> defined by the first clutch plate <b>11</b> adjacent a first end face <b>63</b> of the gear <b>6</b> and out of the first cavity <b>31</b> of the housing <b>3</b>. A handle <b>12</b> is secured to the first end <b>81</b> of the axle <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A resilient biasing element <b>17</b> (for example, a helical spring) is provided, which may form part of the adjustment mechanism. The resilient biasing element <b>17</b> is provided to bias apart an inner surface <b>121</b> of the handle <b>12</b> and an outer surface of one of the walls <b>33</b> of the housing <b>3</b>. In this embodiment, the handle <b>12</b> may be secured to the axle <b>8</b> such that it is not operable to move along a length of the axle <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A second end <b>82</b> of the axle <b>8</b> (opposing the first end <b>81</b> of the axle <b>8</b> across a length of the axle <b>8</b>) extends through a second end face <b>64</b> of the gear <b>6</b> (which opposes the first end face <b>63</b> of the gear <b>6</b> across a length of the gear <b>6</b>) and into a second clutch plate <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The axle <b>8</b> is preferably prevented from rotation about its longitudinal axis with respect to the housing <b>3</b> by, for example, the use of a keyed section at the second end <b>82</b> of the axle <b>8</b>, wherein the keyed section of the axle <b>8</b> is configured to fit a correspondingly keyed section of the second clutch plate <b>10</b> and the clutch plate <b>10</b> is keyed with the first cavity <b>31</b> of the housing <b>3</b> (to prevent relative rotational movement), for example, by abutment with one or more of the cavity spacers <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In addition, the second end <b>82</b> of the axle <b>8</b> is secured to the second clutch plate <b>10</b> such that a linear movement of the axle <b>8</b> with respect to the first cavity <b>31</b> of the housing <b>3</b> causes a corresponding linear movement of the second clutch plate <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The first clutch plate <b>11</b> is configured to abut an inner surface of one of the walls <b>33</b> of the first cavity <b>31</b> and the first end face <b>63</b> of the gear <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Thus, the resilient biasing element <b>17</b> biases the second clutch plate <b>10</b> (through the axle <b>8</b>) such that a force is applied to the second end face <b>64</b> of the gear <b>6</b>. This causes the first end face <b>63</b> of the gear <b>6</b> to abut the first clutch plate <b>11</b> which is prevented from further movement (in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the axle <b>8</b> and away from the gear <b>6</b>) by the inner surface of one of the walls <b>33</b> of the first cavity <b>31</b> of the housing <b>3</b> (which it also abuts). As such, a compressive force is applied to the first <b>63</b> and second <b>64</b> end faces of the gear <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The compressive force applied to the gear <b>6</b> by the two clutch plates <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> defines a threshold force which must be applied to the teeth <b>61</b> of the first gear <b>6</b> in order to cause the first gear <b>6</b> to rotate about its axle <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The second gear <b>7</b> is mounted on its axle <b>9</b> and is free to rotate about a longitudinal axis of the axle <b>9</b>. First <b>91</b> and second <b>92</b> ends of the axle <b>9</b> may be fitted to the housing <b>3</b> (the fitting may include the use of bearings&#x2014;not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The first clutch plate <b>10</b> may be integrally formed with the housing <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">An attachment arrangement <b>18</b> may be mounted on or attached to the carrier (for example to the housing <b>3</b>) and may be configured to receive a tool or instrument. For example, the attachment arrangement may be suitable to receive an endoscope or endoscopic surgical tool <b>15</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The linear drive device <b>1</b> is, in some embodiments, mounted on an arm <b>12</b>. The arm <b>12</b> is, in turn, mounted on a member <b>13</b> which may permit and drive rotational motion of the member <b>13</b> and an arm <b>12</b> about a support which forms part of a robot body <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Together, the linear drive device <b>1</b>, the arm <b>12</b>, the member <b>13</b> and the robot body <b>14</b> (or any sub-combination of these features) may be considered to form a robot <b>17</b> (or another type of mechanism) which may be a surgical robot (or other type of surgical tool holding mechanism). The surgical robot is, in some embodiments, an endoscopic surgical assistant robot (or tool holding mechanism) configured to assist a surgeon during an endoscopic surgical operation by, for example, supporting an endoscope <b>15</b> or other tools.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In embodiments (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), the second gear <b>7</b> is not provided and instead a substantially smooth support surface configured to slide over the thread <b>22</b> of the threaded shaft <b>2</b> may be provided. This support surface may form part of an abutment block <b>19</b> positioned in generally the same location as the above described second gear <b>7</b>. Thus, the above described path <b>21</b> is defined between the abutment block <b>19</b> and the first gear <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In operation, movement of the carrier (i.e. the housing <b>3</b> and clutch mechanism <b>5</b>) can be achieved by actuating the motor <b>16</b> to cause rotation of the threaded shaft <b>2</b>. As the threaded shaft <b>2</b> rotates, the thread <b>21</b> of the shaft <b>2</b> cooperates with the teeth <b>61</b>, <b>71</b> of the first gear <b>6</b> and the second gear <b>7</b>. As the first gear <b>6</b> is held such that it is prevented or is substantially prevented from rotation by the compressive force applied thereto, the carrier is driven along a length of the threaded shaft <b>2</b> (as is conventional, the carrier is prevented from rotation with respect to the motor <b>16</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The second gear <b>7</b> substantially freely rotates during this movement of the carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Movement of the carrier along the threaded shaft <b>2</b> can be achieved in this manner under the control of the motor <b>16</b> (which may be controlled be the robot <b>17</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">When a larger linear movement of the carrier is desired, then a user may grasp the carrier housing <b>3</b> and manually push or pull the carrier along the length of the shaft <b>2</b> as desired. When this occurs, the threshold force defined by the compression force applied by the two clutch plates <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> (for example) to the first gear <b>6</b> is overcome. The first gear <b>6</b> rotates about the longitudinal axis of its axle <b>9</b> and the carrier may be moved up or down the shaft <b>2</b>. When the desired location along the length of the shaft <b>2</b> is reached by the carrier, the user releases the carrier and the force applied to the teeth <b>61</b> of the first gear <b>6</b> once again falls below the threshold force required to cause rotation of the first gear <b>6</b> about the longitudinal axis of its axle <b>9</b>. As such, the carrier is held in that location along the length of the shaft <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Movement of the carrier driven by the motor <b>16</b> is a first mode of operation and movement of the carrier by manual action is a second mode of operation. The two modes of operation do not occur simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As will be appreciated, this arrangement may ameliorate the issues discussed above in relation to the prior art. Specifically, the clutch mechanism <b>5</b> can help to reduce the risk of erroneous movements of the carrier (and anything attached thereto).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the above described embodiment, a user may be able to apply a force to the handle <b>12</b> in the direction of the housing <b>3</b> against the force of the resilient biasing element <b>17</b>. This action results in a reduction in the compressive force applied to the gear <b>6</b> and, hence, reduces the threshold force&#x2014;to allow more easy movement of the carrier along the shaft <b>2</b>. Alternatively, the handle <b>12</b> may be enclosed by the housing <b>3</b> and inaccessible to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In an embodiment (best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), the adjustment mechanism may not include a resilient biasing element <b>17</b>. For example, the handle <b>12</b> may be coupled to the axle <b>8</b> by a threaded portion <b>83</b> at the first end <b>81</b> thereof. A corresponding thread may be provided in an axle receiving hollow <b>122</b> in the handle <b>12</b>. This allows the handle <b>12</b> to be secured to the threaded <b>83</b> portion of the axle <b>8</b> by mounting the axle receiving hollow <b>122</b> of the handle <b>12</b> on the threaded portion <b>83</b> of the axle <b>8</b> such that the threads mate. The handle <b>12</b> is located outside of the first cavity <b>31</b> of the housing <b>3</b> and the inner surface <b>121</b> of the handle <b>12</b> is configured to abut the outer surface of one of the walls <b>33</b> of the housing <b>3</b>. Rotation of the handle <b>12</b> causes the handle <b>12</b> to move along the threaded portion <b>83</b> of the axle <b>8</b> (towards or away from the first end face of the gear <b>6</b>&#x2014;depending on the direction of rotation). When the handle <b>12</b> is rotated such that the inner surface <b>121</b> of the handle <b>12</b> abuts the outer surface the wall <b>33</b> of the housing <b>3</b>, further rotation of the handle <b>12</b> (in the same direction) causes the axle <b>8</b> to be drawn into the handle <b>12</b>. This causes the second clutch plate <b>10</b> to apply a force to the second end face <b>64</b> of the first gear <b>6</b>. Thus, a compressive force is applied to the gear <b>6</b> substantially as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In an embodiment (best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), a resilient biasing element <b>17</b> is provided to bias the first clutch plate <b>11</b> away from an inner surface of one of the walls <b>33</b> of the housing <b>3</b>. The second clutch plate <b>10</b> is located within the first cavity <b>31</b> of the housing <b>3</b> adjacent a wall <b>34</b> of the housing <b>3</b> and the second end face <b>64</b> of the gear <b>6</b>. Thus, the resilient biasing element <b>17</b> applies a force on the first clutch plate <b>11</b> which abuts the first end face <b>63</b> of the gear <b>6</b> and presses the second end face <b>64</b> of the gear <b>6</b> against the second clutch plate <b>10</b> (which, in turn, is pressed against an inner surface of one of the walls <b>34</b> of the cavity <b>31</b> of the housing <b>3</b>). In this manner a compressive force is applied to the gear <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In an embodiment (best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), the wall <b>33</b> of the housing <b>3</b> is configured to receive a threaded element <b>112</b> of the first clutch plate <b>11</b> in a correspondingly threaded hole defined by the wall <b>33</b> of the housing. In this embodiment, rotation of the handle <b>12</b> may be used to force (or press) the first clutch plate <b>11</b> against the first end face <b>63</b> of the gear <b>6</b> to apply a compressive force (in combination with the second clutch plate <b>10</b>) substantially as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In this and similar embodiments, the axles <b>8</b>, <b>9</b> may each comprise two separate elongate members secured so as to extend from opposing end faces of the gears <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>. Alternatively, each of the axles <b>8</b>, <b>9</b> may be integrally formed with each respective gear <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As will be appreciated, different instruments or tools may be attached to the housing <b>3</b> of the carrier and, therefore, the total weight of the carrier and tools may vary. As such, the handle <b>12</b> can be used to vary the compressive force applied to the first gear <b>6</b> such that the threshold force is altered. A higher compressive force on the first gear <b>6</b> means a higher threshold force required to cause rotation of the first gear <b>6</b> about the longitudinal axis of its axle <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In addition, during setup of a robot <b>17</b> including such a linear drive device <b>1</b> and clutch mechanism <b>5</b>, the handle <b>12</b> can be adjusted so as to decrease the compressive force applied to the first gear <b>6</b> considerably thus allowing easy movement of the carrier along the threaded shaft <b>2</b>. When the desired setup location is reached, the handle <b>12</b> can be adjusted to increase the compressive force applied by the clutch plates <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> (for example) on the first gear <b>6</b>. Thus, the carrier is secured in the desired location.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The use of the axle <b>9</b>, clutch plates <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and handle <b>12</b> in relation to the first gear <b>6</b> are just one example implementation of a biasing mechanism which defines a threshold force which must be applied to the teeth of the first gear <b>6</b> in order to cause rotation of the gear <b>6</b> about the longitudinal axis of its axle <b>8</b>. Other arrangements may not require clutch or brake plates. Instead, other mechanisms may be utilized to define a threshold force.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">It is envisaged that the second gear <b>7</b> may, in some embodiments, be provided with a clutch mechanism which may be the same or identical to the clutch mechanism <b>5</b> associated with the first gear <b>6</b>. As such, the clutch mechanism <b>5</b> may comprise a first clutch arrangement associated with the first gear <b>6</b> and a second clutch arrangement associated with the second gear <b>7</b>.</p>
