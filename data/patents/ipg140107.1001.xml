<heading id="h-0001" level="1">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The disclosure of Japanese Patent Applications No. 2010-246512 filed on Nov. 2, 2010, No. 2009-264381 filed on Nov. 19, 2009, No. 2010-049192 filed on Mar. 5, 2010, and No. 2010-049193 filed on Mar. 5, 2010, including the specification, drawings and abstract is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a drive device for a vehicle equipped with an input member drivingly connected to an internal combustion engine, an output member drivingly connected to a wheel, a rotary electric machine, a fluid coupling drivingly connected to the rotary electric machine, an engagement device selectively drivingly connecting the input member with the rotary electric machine and the fluid coupling, and a case housing at least the rotary electric machine, the engagement device, and the fluid coupling.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As a drive device for a vehicle such as those described above, for example, a device disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. JP-A-2006-137406 described below has already been known. As shown in FIG. 1 and so on of Japanese Patent Application Publication No. JP-A-2006-137406, in the drive device for a vehicle, a rotary electric machine (motor in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. JP-A-2006-137406; hereinafter the same reference applies), a fluid coupling (torque converter 1), and an engagement device (clutch mechanism 16) selectively drivingly establishing a connection therebetween are arranged in a case (motor housing 6) housing these devices. In this device, oil for operation is supplied to an operating oil pressure chamber of the engagement device from an oil passage formed in a support wall (engine-side sidewall portion) of an internal combustion engine (engine). Furthermore, a rotor member (a rotor <b>12</b> and a support member thereof) of the rotary electric machine is radially supported in a rotatable state by a case wall different from the support wall on the side axially opposite to the internal combustion engine with respect to the engagement device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In this way, in the device of Japanese Patent Application Publication No. JP-A-2006-137406, the two wall portions different from each other are required on both axial sides relative to the engagement device in order to respectively achieve appropriate supply of hydraulic pressure to the operating oil pressure chamber of the engagement device and appropriate rotational support of the rotor member appropriately. As a result, there has been a problem that an axial length increases by that amount, inevitably resulting in an increase in the size of the entire device.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, it is desired to realize a drive device for a vehicle that can appropriately supply oil to an operating oil pressure chamber of an engagement device and can rotatably support a rotor member of a rotary electric machine appropriately, and that can be downsized as a whole by further reducing an axial length of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A drive device for a vehicle according to a first aspect of the present invention includes an input member drivingly connected to an internal combustion engine, an output member drivingly connected to a wheel, a rotary electric machine, a fluid coupling drivingly connected to the rotary electric machine, an engagement device selectively drivingly connecting the input member with the rotary electric machine and the fluid coupling by hydraulic pressure, and a case housing at least the rotary electric machine, the engagement device, and the fluid coupling. A structure of the drive device for a vehicle has a characteristic structure in which the case includes a support wall extending at least radially on a side in an axial first direction that is axially on the internal combustion engine side relative to the engagement device, and also includes a cylindrical projecting portion projecting from the support wall toward a side in an axial second direction that is in a direction opposite to the axial first direction, the engagement device includes an operating oil pressure chamber supplied with the hydraulic pressure, a rotor member of the rotary electric machine is radially supported by the cylindrical projecting portion in a rotatable state via a support bearing, and the cylindrical projecting portion is formed with an operating oil supply passage supplying oil to the operating oil pressure chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Note that the term &#x201c;drivingly connected&#x201d; refers to a state in which two rotational elements are connected so as to be capable of transmitting a driving force, and is used as a concept including a state in which the two rotational elements are connected so as to rotate as a unit with each other, or a state in which the two rotational elements are connected so as to be capable of transmitting the driving force via one or two or more transmitting members. Such transmitting members include various members that transmit rotation at the same speed or at a changed speed, such as shafts, gear mechanisms, belts, and chains. Such transmitting members may also include engagement devices that selectively transmit the rotation and the driving force, such as friction clutches and dog clutches.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The term &#x201c;rotary electric machine&#x201d; is used as a concept including all of a motor (electric motor), a generator (electric generator), and a motor-generator that serves as a motor or a generator depending on the necessity.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Moreover, the term &#x201c;fluid coupling&#x201d; is used as a concept including both of a torque converter having a torque amplifying function and an ordinary fluid coupling having no torque amplifying function.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the first aspect as described above, the rotor member of the rotary electric machine can be radially supported on the cylindrical projecting portion of the case so as to be rotatable via the support bearing. Furthermore, oil can be supplied to the operating oil pressure chamber of the engagement device via the operating oil supply passage formed in the cylindrical projecting portion radially supporting the rotor member. In this way, because the cylindrical projecting portion provided as a unit with the support wall can achieve appropriate supply of hydraulic pressure to the operating oil pressure chamber of the engagement device and appropriate rotational support of the rotor member, an axial length of the entire device can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, the drive device for a vehicle can be achieved that can appropriately supply oil to the operating oil pressure chamber and can rotatably support the rotor member appropriately, and that can be downsized as a whole by further reducing the axial length.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The drive device for a vehicle according to a second aspect of the present invention may be structured such that the engagement device further includes an engagement input side member connected to the input member and an engagement output side member that is paired with the engagement input side member and is connected to the fluid coupling, and the engagement output side member and the rotor member are connected so as to rotate as a unit with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the second aspect, the engagement output side member connected so as to rotate as a unit with the rotor member can be radially supported on the cylindrical projecting portion via the rotor member and the support bearing appropriately.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The drive device for a vehicle according to a third aspect of the present invention may be structured such that the case includes, separately from a first support wall serving as the support wall, a second support wall extending at least radially on the side in the axial second direction relative to the fluid coupling, the fluid coupling includes a coupling input side member and a coupling output side member paired with the coupling input side member, the engagement output side member and the coupling input side member are connected so as to rotate as a unit with each other, and the coupling input side member is radially supported by the second support wall in a rotatable state via a second support bearing provided separately from a first support bearing serving as the support bearing.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the third aspect, the first support wall and the second support wall located on both axial sides relative to the rotary electric machine, the engagement device, and the fluid coupling can radially support, over an axially long supporting span, the rotor member, the engagement output side member, and the coupling input side member that are connected so as to rotate as a unit with each other. As a result, the whole of the rotor member, the engagement output side member, and the coupling input side member can be supported with a high degree of accuracy of center axis.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The drive device for a vehicle according to a fourth aspect of the present invention may be structured to further include an intermediate output member drivingly connected to the fluid coupling and also drivingly connected to the output member, and structured such that the fluid coupling includes a body portion housing chamber housing a body portion of the fluid coupling, and the intermediate output member is formed with a coupling supply oil passage supplying oil to the body portion housing chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the fourth aspect, the oil supplied to the operating oil pressure chamber of the engagement device is supplied via the operating oil supply passage formed in the cylindrical projecting portion, and the oil supplied to the body portion housing chamber of the fluid coupling is supplied via the coupling supply oil passage formed in the intermediate output member. Accordingly, when compared with a case in which both the operating oil supply passage and the coupling supply oil passage are formed in the intermediate output member, the intermediate output member can be downsized. Consequently, the entire device can be downsized by reducing the radial dimension thereof while supplying the oil respectively to the operating oil pressure chamber of the engagement device and the body portion housing chamber of the fluid coupling appropriately.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The drive device for a vehicle according to a fifth aspect of the present invention may be structured such that the engagement device further includes an engagement member and a pressing member pressing the engagement member, and the engagement output side member includes an opposed cylindrical portion that is formed in a cylindrical shape so as to cover at least the radially outside of the engagement member and is arranged so as to be radially opposed to the cylindrical projecting portion on the radially inside of the engagement member, at least a part of the operating oil pressure chamber is defined by the pressing member slidably arranged relative to the opposed cylindrical portion and by the opposed cylindrical portion, and the opposed cylindrical portion is formed with an oil hole communicating between the operating oil supply passage and the operating oil pressure chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the fifth aspect, the engagement output side member can further be radially supported on the cylindrical projecting portion via the opposed cylindrical portion. The engagement output side member can be thus rotatably supported in a more reliable manner. Furthermore, in this structure, in the case of defining at least a part of the operating oil pressure chamber with the opposed cylindrical portion of the engagement output side member and the pressing member, the oil can be appropriately supplied from the operating oil supply passage to the operating oil pressure chamber via the oil hole formed in the opposed cylindrical portion.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">An embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the drive device <b>1</b> is a drive device for a hybrid vehicle (hybrid drive device) that uses one or both of an internal combustion engine E and a rotary electric machine MG as a source of vehicle driving force. The drive device <b>1</b> is structured as a drive device for a so-called one-motor parallel type hybrid vehicle. The drive device <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment will be described below in detail.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">1. Overall Structure of Drive Device</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">First of all, an overall structure of the drive device <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment will be described. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the drive device <b>1</b> is provided with an input shaft I drivingly connected to the internal combustion engine E serving as a first source of driving force of the vehicle, an output shaft O drivingly connected to wheels W, the rotary electric machine MG serving as a second source of driving force of the vehicle, and a torque converter TC. The drive device <b>1</b> is also provided with an input clutch C<b>1</b> and a speed change mechanism TM. These components are arranged on a power transmission path in the order of the input shaft I, the input clutch C<b>1</b>, the rotary electric machine MG, the torque converter TC, the speed change mechanism TM, and the output shaft O, from the side of the internal combustion engine E. These components are housed in a case (drive device case) <b>3</b> except a part of the input shaft I and a part of the output shaft O. In the present embodiment, the input shaft I corresponds to an &#x201c;input member&#x201d; in the present invention, and the output shaft O corresponds to an &#x201c;output member&#x201d; in the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Note that, in the present embodiment, all of the input shaft I, the rotary electric machine MG, the torque converter TC, and the output shaft O are arranged on a center axis X (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and the drive device <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment has a single-axis structure suitable for being mounted in a vehicle of an FR (front engine, rear drive) type. Note also that, in the description below, the directions of &#x201c;axial direction&#x201d;, &#x201c;radial direction&#x201d;, and &#x201c;circumferential direction&#x201d; are defined with respect to the center axis X, unless otherwise specifically distinguished. Moreover, regarding directions along the axial direction at a particular part in the drive device <b>1</b>, the direction toward the side of the internal combustion engine E (left side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) as one side of the axial direction is referred to as an &#x201c;axial first direction A<b>1</b>&#x201d;, whereas the direction toward the side of the output shaft O (right side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) as the other side of the axial direction is referred to as an &#x201c;axial second direction A<b>2</b>&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The internal combustion engine E is a device to take out power by being driven by combustion of fuel inside the engine. For example, various known engines, such as a gasoline engine and a diesel engine, can be used as the internal combustion engine E. In the present example, an output rotational shaft such as a crankshaft of the internal combustion engine E is drivingly connected to the input shaft I via a first damper <b>16</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The input shaft I is drivingly connected to the rotary electric machine MG via the input clutch C<b>1</b>, thus being selectively drivingly connected to the rotary electric machine MG by the input clutch C<b>1</b>. The internal combustion engine E is drivingly connected to the rotary electric machine MG via the input shaft I while the input clutch C<b>1</b> is engaged, and separated from the rotary electric machine MG while the input clutch C<b>1</b> is disengaged. In the present embodiment, the input clutch C<b>1</b> corresponds to an &#x201c;engagement device&#x201d; in the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The rotary electric machine MG is structured to have a stator St and a rotor Ro, and can serve as a motor (electric motor) producing power by receiving electric power supply and as a generator (electric generator) producing electric power by receiving power supply. Therefore, the rotary electric machine MG is electrically connected with an electrical storage device (not shown). In the present example, a battery is used as the electrical storage device. A capacitor or the like may also be suitably used as the electrical storage device. The rotary electric machine MG operates in a power running mode by receiving the electric power supply from the battery, or charges the battery by supplying thereto the electric power generated by a torque (here, used as a synonym of &#x201c;driving force&#x201d;) produced by the internal combustion engine E or an inertial force of the vehicle. The rotor Ro of the rotary electric machine MG is drivingly connected to a pump impeller <b>41</b> of the torque converter TC constituting a power transmission member T.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The torque converter TC is a device that converts a torque of one or both of the internal combustion engine E and the rotary electric machine MG and transmits the converted torque to an intermediate shaft M. The torque converter TC is provided with the pump impeller <b>41</b> drivingly connected to the rotor Ro of the rotary electric machine MG a turbine runner <b>51</b> drivingly connected to the intermediate shaft M so as to rotate as a unit therewith, and a stator <b>56</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) provided between the pump impeller <b>41</b> and the turbine runner <b>51</b>. The torque converter TC can transmit, via oil filled therein, a torque between the pump impeller <b>41</b> and the turbine runner <b>51</b>. In that operation, when a rotational speed difference is produced between the pump impeller <b>41</b> and the turbine runner <b>51</b>, a torque converted depending on a rotational speed ratio is transmitted. In the present embodiment, the torque converter TC corresponds to a &#x201c;fluid coupling&#x201d; in the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The torque converter TC is also provided with a lock-up clutch C<b>2</b>. The lock-up clutch C<b>2</b> selectively drivingly connects the pump impeller <b>41</b> with the turbine runner <b>51</b>. In the engaged state of the lock-up clutch C<b>2</b>, the torque converter TC transmits the torque of one or both of the internal combustion engine E and the rotary electric machine MG not through the oil filled inside but directly to the intermediate shaft M. The intermediate shaft M serves as an output shaft (coupling output shaft) of the torque converter TC, and also as an input shaft (speed change input shaft) of the speed change mechanism TM. In the present embodiment, the intermediate shaft M corresponds to an &#x201c;intermediate output member&#x201d; in the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The speed change mechanism TM is a device that changes a rotational speed of the intermediate shaft M at a predetermined speed ratio and transmits the changed speed to the output shaft O. As such a speed change mechanism TM, the present embodiment uses an automatic stepped speed change mechanism provided, in a switchable manner, with a plurality of shift speeds with different speed ratios. Note that it is possible to use, as the speed change mechanism TM, another type of mechanism such as an automatic stepless speed change mechanism that can change the speed ratio in a stepless manner, or a manual stepped speed change mechanism provided, in a switchable manner, with a plurality of shift speeds with different speed ratios. The speed change mechanism TM changes the rotational speed and converts the torque of the intermediate shaft M at a predetermined speed ratio at each point of time, and transmits the changed speed and the converted torque to the output shaft O. The rotation and the torque transmitted to the output shaft O are distributed and transmitted, via a differential gear unit DF for output, to the two right and left wheels W. The drive device <b>1</b> can thus drive the vehicle to run by transmitting the torque of one or both of the internal combustion engine E and the rotary electric machine MG to the wheels W.</p>

Description will also be made of a structure for discharging oil from the circulating oil pressure chamber H<b>2</b>, etc. In the present embodiment, these structures are achieved by being mainly constituted by the four oil passages (first oil passage L<b>1</b>, second oil passage L<b>2</b>, third oil passage L<b>3</b>, and fourth oil passage L<b>4</b>) formed in the end portion support wall <b>5</b> and the cylindrical projecting portion <b>11</b> of the case <b>3</b>. The description will be made below in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The first oil passage L<b>1</b> is an oil supply passage communicating with the operating oil pressure chamber H<b>1</b> of the input clutch C<b>1</b> for supplying oil to the operating oil pressure chamber H<b>1</b>. In the present embodiment, the first oil passage L<b>1</b> corresponds to an &#x201c;operating oil supply passage&#x201d; in the present invention. The first oil passage L<b>1</b> is supplied, via a first oil passage forming member <b>96</b><i>a </i>(refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), with the pressurized oil that is discharged by the oil pump <b>9</b> and regulated to the predetermined pressure level by the hydraulic pressure control device (not shown). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the first oil passage L<b>1</b> has a first axial oil passage L<b>1</b><i>a </i>axially extending in the cylindrical projecting portion <b>11</b>, a first radial oil passage L<b>1</b><i>b </i>radially extending in the cylindrical projecting portion <b>11</b>, and a first in-wall oil passage L<b>1</b><i>c </i>radially extending in the end portion support wall <b>5</b> of the case <b>3</b>. The first in-wall oil passage L<b>1</b><i>c </i>is connected, at an end portion located radially outside thereof, to the first oil passage forming member <b>96</b><i>a </i>(refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), and communicates, at an end portion located radially inside thereof, with the first axial oil passage L<b>1</b><i>a</i>. The first axial oil passage L<b>1</b><i>a </i>is formed so as to extend linearly from the end portion radially inside of the first in-wall oil passage L<b>1</b><i>c </i>in the axial second direction A<b>2</b> along the axial direction. The first radial oil passage L<b>1</b><i>b </i>is formed so as to communicate with the first axial oil passage L<b>1</b><i>a</i>, and to extend at least radially outward from the first axial oil passage L<b>1</b><i>a</i>. In the present example, the first radial oil passage L<b>1</b><i>b </i>is formed so as to extend linearly along a direction slightly inclined relative to the radial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">An end portion on the side in the axial second direction A<b>2</b> of the first axial oil passage L<b>1</b><i>a </i>is closed by a closing member (a plug, in the present example) provided in the cylindrical projecting portion <b>11</b>. The first radial oil passage L<b>1</b><i>b </i>is open to a first outer circumferential opening portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>formed on the outer circumferential face of the cylindrical projecting portion <b>11</b>. The first outer circumferential opening portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>is formed on the outer circumferential face of a minimum diameter portion on the side in the axial second direction A<b>2</b> relative to the second step portion <b>11</b><i>c </i>of the cylindrical projecting portion <b>11</b>, thus being formed radially inside the sleeve <b>86</b> fitted around the end portion on the side in the axial second direction A<b>2</b> of the cylindrical projecting portion <b>11</b>. The sleeve <b>86</b> is formed with a recessed groove that continues circumferentially while being radially recessed relative to the outer circumferential face, and also formed, at a plurality of circumferential locations, with communication holes communicating between the inner circumferential face and the recessed groove of the sleeve <b>86</b>. The communication holes and the first outer circumferential opening portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>are arranged in positions having portions overlapping with each other when viewed radially.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The cylindrical projecting portion <b>32</b><i>e </i>of the cylindrical connecting member <b>32</b> is formed with an oil hole <b>32</b><i>h </i>communicating the inner circumferential face with the outer circumferential face of the cylindrical projecting portion <b>32</b><i>e</i>. The oil hole <b>32</b><i>h </i>and the communication holes formed in the sleeve <b>86</b> are arranged in positions having portions overlapping with each other when viewed radially. The oil hole <b>32</b><i>h </i>communicates with the operating oil pressure chamber H<b>1</b> via an opening portion located radially outside of the sleeve <b>86</b>. Consequently, the first radial oil passage L<b>1</b><i>b </i>communicates with the operating oil pressure chamber H<b>1</b> via the first outer circumferential opening portion <b>12</b><i>a</i>, the communication holes of the sleeve <b>86</b>, and the oil hole <b>32</b><i>h</i>. Accordingly, oil supplied from the first oil passage L<b>1</b> is appropriately supplied to the operating oil pressure chamber H<b>1</b> via the first outer circumferential opening portion <b>12</b><i>a</i>, the communication holes, and the oil hole <b>32</b><i>h. </i></p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Note that, in the present embodiment, it is structured such that the oil leaks out little by little in the axial direction through a small space between the outer circumferential face of the sleeve <b>86</b> and the inner circumferential face of the cylindrical projecting portion <b>32</b><i>e</i>. Then, the oil leaking out through the small space to the side in the axial first direction A<b>1</b> flows into the bearing arrangement space P, thus lubricating the first bearing <b>71</b> arranged in the bearing arrangement space P.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The second oil passage L<b>2</b> is an oil supply passage communicating with the circulating oil pressure chamber H<b>2</b> of the input clutch C<b>1</b> for supplying oil to the circulating oil pressure chamber H<b>2</b>. In the present embodiment, the second oil passage L<b>2</b> corresponds to a &#x201c;circulating oil supply passage&#x201d; in the present invention. The second oil passage L<b>2</b> is supplied, via a second oil passage forming member <b>96</b><i>b </i>(refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), with the pressurized oil that is discharged by the oil pump <b>9</b> and regulated to the predetermined pressure level by the hydraulic pressure control device (not shown). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>, the second oil passage L<b>2</b> has a second axial oil passage L<b>2</b><i>a </i>axially extending in the cylindrical projecting portion <b>11</b> and a second in-wall oil passage L<b>2</b><i>c </i>radially extending in the end portion support wall <b>5</b> of the case <b>3</b>. The second in-wall oil passage L<b>2</b><i>c </i>is connected at an end portion located radially outside thereof to the second oil passage forming member <b>96</b><i>b </i>(refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), and communicates at an end portion located radially inside thereof with the second axial oil passage L<b>2</b><i>a</i>. The second axial oil passage L<b>2</b><i>a </i>is formed so as to extend linearly from the end portion radially inside of the second in-wall oil passage L<b>2</b><i>c </i>toward the axial second direction A<b>2</b> along the axial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The second axial oil passage L<b>2</b><i>a </i>is open to an end face opening portion <b>12</b><i>e </i>formed on the end face on the side in the axial second direction A<b>2</b> of the cylindrical projecting portion <b>11</b>. The second axial oil passage L<b>2</b><i>a </i>then communicates with the circulating oil pressure chamber H<b>2</b> via the end face opening portion <b>12</b><i>e</i>. Accordingly, oil supplied from the second oil passage L<b>2</b> is appropriately supplied to the circulating oil pressure chamber H<b>2</b> via the end face opening portion <b>12</b><i>e</i>. More specifically, in the present embodiment, the second axial oil passage L<b>2</b><i>a </i>communicates with a first space V<b>1</b> located on the side in the axial first direction A<b>1</b> relative to the clutch hub <b>31</b> radially extending in the circulating oil pressure chamber H<b>2</b>. Thus, the oil from the second oil passage L<b>2</b> is supplied to the first space V<b>1</b> in the circulating oil pressure chamber H<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">By being supplied with the oil via the second oil passage L<b>2</b>, the circulating oil pressure chamber H<b>2</b> formed as an independent sealed space in the case <b>3</b> is basically placed in a state of being filled with oil. Then, the oil flows through inside of the circulating oil pressure chamber H<b>2</b> while maintaining, as a whole, the state in which the circulating oil pressure chamber H<b>2</b> is filled with oil. That is, the oil supplied from the second oil passage L<b>2</b> to the first space V<b>1</b> of the circulating oil pressure chamber H<b>2</b> flows radially outward through between the piston <b>34</b> and the clutch hub <b>31</b> in the axial direction, and reaches the plurality of friction members <b>33</b>. The oil cools the plurality of friction members <b>33</b> through heat exchange therewith. In the present embodiment, the plurality of friction members <b>33</b> of the input clutch C<b>1</b> can be cooled efficiently by the oil filled in the circulating oil pressure chamber H<b>2</b>. The oil after cooling the plurality of friction members <b>33</b> flows radially inward through a second space V<b>2</b> located on the side in the axial first direction A<b>1</b> relative to the clutch hub <b>31</b> in the circulating oil pressure chamber H<b>2</b>, that is, located between the clutch hub <b>31</b> and the inner radially extending portion <b>45</b> of the cover portion <b>42</b> in the axial direction, and reaches a shaft-end hole portion Ib formed in an end portion on the side in the axial second direction A<b>2</b> of the input shaft I. A space radially inside of the shaft-end hole portion Ib is located in a radially central portion of the second space V<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">A fifth oil passage L<b>5</b> is formed at an end portion on the side in the axial second direction A<b>2</b> of the input shaft I. The fifth oil passage L<b>5</b> is supplied with the oil that has reached the shaft-end hole portion Ib after flowing through the inside of the circulating oil pressure chamber H<b>2</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the fifth oil passage L<b>5</b> has a fifth axial oil passage L<b>5</b><i>a </i>axially extending inside the input shaft I along the center axis X, and a fifth radial oil passage L<b>5</b><i>b </i>radially extending inside the input shaft I. The fifth axial oil passage L<b>5</b><i>a </i>is formed so as to be open to a side face on the side in the axial second direction A<b>2</b> in the shaft-end hole portion Ib of the input shaft I, and to extend linearly from the open portion toward the axial first direction A<b>1</b> over a predetermined range. In the present example, the fifth axial oil passage L<b>5</b><i>a </i>is formed so as to extend at least up to a location on the side in the axial first direction A<b>1</b> relative to a first inner circumferential opening portion <b>12</b><i>c </i>(to be described later). The fifth radial oil passage L<b>5</b><i>b </i>is formed so as to communicate with the fifth axial oil passage L<b>5</b><i>a</i>, and to extend linearly from the fifth axial oil passage L<b>5</b><i>a </i>along the radial direction. The fifth radial oil passage L<b>5</b><i>b </i>is open to the outer circumferential face of the input shaft I between the two third bearings <b>73</b> arranged axially side by side with a predetermined space therebetween. Thus, the fifth oil passage L<b>5</b> communicates the circulating oil pressure chamber H<b>2</b> with a space between the outer circumferential face of the input shaft I and the inner circumferential face of the cylindrical projecting portion <b>11</b>. Accordingly, the oil from the radially central portion of the second space V<b>2</b> of the circulating oil pressure chamber H<b>2</b> can be guided to the space between the input shaft I and the cylindrical projecting portion <b>11</b> via the fifth oil passage L<b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In the present embodiment, out of the two third bearings <b>73</b> arranged axially side by side, the third bearing <b>73</b><i>b </i>located on the side in the axial second direction A<b>2</b> communicates side faces on both axial sides thereof with the first space V<b>1</b> and the second space V<b>2</b>, respectively, either directly or via the fifth oil passage L<b>5</b>. That is, in the third bearing <b>73</b><i>b</i>, the side face on the side in the axial second direction A<b>2</b> directly communicates with the first space V<b>1</b> in the circulating oil pressure chamber H<b>2</b>, whereas the side face on the side in the axial first direction A<b>1</b> communicates with the second space V<b>2</b> in the circulating oil pressure chamber H<b>2</b> via the fifth oil passage L<b>5</b>. An equal hydraulic pressure can be thus applied to the side faces on both axial sides of the third bearing <b>73</b><i>b</i>. Consequently, leakage of the oil need not be taken into account between the third bearing <b>73</b><i>b </i>and the cylindrical projecting portion <b>11</b>, and between the third bearing <b>73</b><i>b </i>and the input shaft I, thereby simplifying the structure of the third bearing <b>73</b><i>b </i>so as to reduce cost. Note that, in the present example, the third bearings <b>73</b> can also be lubricated by using a part of the oil discharged from the circulating oil pressure chamber H<b>2</b> via the fifth oil passage L<b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The third oil passage L<b>3</b> is an oil discharge passage communicating with the circulating oil pressure chamber H<b>2</b> separately from the second oil passage L<b>2</b> for discharging oil from the circulating oil pressure chamber H<b>2</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>, the third oil passage L<b>3</b> has a third axial oil passage L<b>3</b><i>a </i>axially extending in the cylindrical projecting portion <b>11</b>, a third radial oil passage L<b>3</b><i>b </i>radially extending in the cylindrical projecting portion <b>11</b>, and a third in-wall oil passage L<b>3</b><i>c </i>radially extending in the end portion support wall <b>5</b> of the case <b>3</b>. The third radial oil passage L<b>3</b><i>b </i>is open to the first inner circumferential opening portion <b>12</b><i>c </i>formed on the inner circumferential face of the cylindrical projecting portion <b>11</b>, between the two third bearings <b>73</b> arranged axially side by side with the predetermined space therebetween. Therefore, the third radial oil passage L<b>3</b><i>b </i>communicates with the radially central portion of the second space V<b>2</b> of the circulating oil pressure chamber H<b>2</b>, via the first inner circumferential opening portion <b>12</b><i>c</i>, the space between the input shaft I and the cylindrical projecting portion <b>11</b>, and the fifth oil passage L<b>5</b> formed inside the input shaft I. Note that, in the present example, the first inner circumferential opening portion <b>12</b><i>c </i>and the fifth radial oil passage L<b>5</b><i>b </i>constituting the fifth oil passage L<b>5</b> are arranged in positions having portions overlapping with each other when viewed radially.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The third radial oil passage L<b>3</b><i>b </i>is formed so as to extend at least radially outward from the first inner circumferential opening portion <b>12</b><i>c</i>. In the present example, the third radial oil passage L<b>3</b><i>b </i>is formed so as to extend linearly along a direction inclined relative to the radial direction. The third axial oil passage L<b>3</b><i>a </i>is formed so as to communicate with an end portion located radially inside of the third radial oil passage L<b>3</b><i>b</i>, and to extend linearly along the axial direction. An end portion on the side in the axial second direction A<b>2</b> of the third axial oil passage L<b>3</b><i>a </i>is closed by a closing member (a plug, in the present example) provided in the cylindrical projecting portion <b>11</b>. The third in-wall oil passage L<b>3</b><i>c </i>communicates, at an end portion located radially inside thereof, with an end portion on the side in the axial first direction A<b>1</b> of the third axial oil passage L<b>3</b><i>a</i>, and connected, at an end portion located radially outside thereof, to a third oil passage forming member <b>96</b><i>c </i>(refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref>). Accordingly, the oil after cooling the plurality of friction members <b>33</b> while flowing through the inside of the circulating oil pressure chamber H<b>2</b> is discharged via the fifth oil passage L<b>5</b> and the third oil passage L<b>3</b>, and then returned to the oil pan (not shown) via the third oil passage forming member <b>96</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The fourth oil passage L<b>4</b> is an oil discharge passage for discharging oil from the bearing arrangement space P. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the fourth oil passage L<b>4</b> has a fourth axial oil passage L<b>4</b><i>a </i>axially extending in the cylindrical projecting portion <b>11</b>, a fourth radial oil passage L<b>4</b><i>b </i>radially extending in the cylindrical projecting portion <b>11</b>, and a fourth in-wall oil passage L<b>4</b><i>c </i>radially extending in the end portion support wall <b>5</b> of the case <b>3</b>. The fourth radial oil passage L<b>4</b><i>b </i>is open to a second outer circumferential opening portion <b>12</b><i>b </i>formed on the outer circumferential face of the cylindrical projecting portion <b>11</b>. The second outer circumferential opening portion <b>12</b><i>b </i>is formed so as to face the bearing arrangement space P between the first seal member <b>81</b> and the first bearing <b>71</b> in the axial direction. In the present example, the second outer circumferential opening portion <b>12</b><i>b </i>is formed across the large-diameter and the small-diameter portions at the location where the first step portion <b>11</b><i>b </i>is provided on the outer circumferential face of the cylindrical projecting portion <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The fourth radial oil passage L<b>4</b><i>b </i>is formed so as to extend at least radially inward from the second outer circumferential opening portion <b>12</b><i>b</i>. In the present example, the fourth radial oil passage L<b>4</b><i>b </i>is formed so as to extend linearly along a direction inclined relative to the radial direction. In the present embodiment, the fourth radial oil passage L<b>4</b><i>b </i>is also open to a second inner circumferential opening portion <b>12</b><i>d </i>formed on the inner circumferential face of the cylindrical projecting portion <b>11</b> between the second seal member <b>82</b> and the third bearings <b>73</b> (the third bearing <b>73</b><i>a </i>arranged on the side in the axial first direction A<b>1</b>, in the present example) in the axial direction.

<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The fourth axial oil passage L<b>4</b><i>a </i>is formed so as to communicate with the fourth radial oil passage L<b>4</b><i>b</i>, and to extend linearly along the axial direction. An end portion on the side in the axial second direction A<b>2</b> of the fourth axial oil passage L<b>4</b><i>a </i>is closed by a closing member (a plug, in the present example) provided in the cylindrical projecting portion <b>11</b>. The fourth in-wall oil passage L<b>4</b><i>c </i>communicates, at an end portion located radially inside thereof, with an end portion on the side in the axial first direction A<b>1</b> of the fourth axial oil passage L<b>4</b><i>a</i>, and connected, at an end portion located radially outside thereof, to a fourth oil passage forming member <b>96</b><i>d </i>(refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). As described above, a part of the oil supplied via the first oil passage L<b>1</b> to the operating oil pressure chamber H<b>1</b> flows into the bearing arrangement space P through the small space between the outer circumferential face of the sleeve <b>86</b> and the inner circumferential face of the cylindrical projecting portion <b>32</b><i>e </i>of the cylindrical connecting member <b>32</b>, and lubricates the first bearing <b>71</b> arranged in the bearing arrangement space P.
