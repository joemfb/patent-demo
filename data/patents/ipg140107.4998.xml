<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a Continuation of co-pending Application No. 13/829,992, filed on Mar. 14, 2013, which claims the benefit of U.S. 61/730,977, filed on Nov. 29, 2012, the Korean Patent Application Nos. 10-2013-0009050, filed on Jan. 28, 2013 and 10-2013-0020481, filed on Feb. 26, 2013, which are all hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present specification relates to a mobile device and a method for controlling the same, and more particularly, to a mobile device and a method for controlling the same, in which different lock states are provided depending on a mode which is currently being implemented in a dual mode of a child mode and an adult mode and different unlock interfaces are provided depending on the lock state which is set.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With the development of electronic devices and communication technologies, users could perform various functions that include text message transmission and reception functions and phone communication by using a mobile device. In particular, with the mass spread of smart phones, various applications have been developed together. Accordingly, the users could install an application having a desired function in the mobile device and perform various functions such as games and Internet banking.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In particular, various animation applications that play animations which children likes and various children's song applications that play children's songs which children likes have been provided recently. Accordingly, a user who is a mother or father of a child may implement animation applications or children's song applications installed in his/her mobile device to allow the child to use the applications.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, when the child is using the mobile device of the user, a call or text message for a task of the user may be received. At this time, if the child of the user receives the call or text message, a problem occurs in that the user may miss an important contact. Particularly, if the child is too young, such a problem may be likely to occur.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, the present specification is directed to a mobile device and a method for controlling the same, which substantially obviate one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An object of the present specification is to provide a mobile device and a method for controlling the same, in which a dual mode of a child mode and an adult mode is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another object of the present specification is to provide a mobile device and a method for controlling the same, in which different lock states of a first lock state and a second lock state are provided, and different unlock interfaces are provided depending on the lock state.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Still another object of the present specification is to provide a mobile device and a method for controlling the same, in which an enter mode (child mode or adult mode) after a lock state is unlocked is varied depending on a first unlock interface unlocking a first lock state and a second unlock interface unlocking a second lock state.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further still another object of the present specification is to provide a mobile device and a method for controlling the same, in which an adult mode is implemented to process an event for the adult mode when the event for the adult mode occurs while the mobile device is being used in a child mode.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further still another object of the present specification is to provide a mobile device and a method for controlling the same, in which an application implemented in a child mode and an application implemented in an adult mode are provided separately and detailed configuration of an application may be set in a corresponding mode which is being implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Additional advantages, objects, and features of the specification will be set forth in part in the description which follows and in part will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned from practice of the specification. The objectives and other advantages of the specification may be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Also, if the display unit <b>110</b> includes a touch sensitive display, it may sense a user input such as a touch input.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Accordingly, the processor <b>150</b> may generate a control signal by using an input signal based on the user input through the sensor unit <b>120</b> or the display unit <b>110</b> and control the mobile device <b>100</b> by using the control signal.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In other words, the processor <b>150</b> may receive the user input through the sensor unit <b>120</b> or the display unit <b>110</b> as the input signal and generate the control signal by using the input signal. For example, the control signal may include a signal (hereinafter, referred to as &#x2018;unlock signal&#x2019;) for unlocking the lock state of the mobile device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Also, the processor <b>150</b> may control the units included in the mobile device <b>100</b> in accordance with the control signal.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Hereinafter, if each step or operation performed by the mobile device starts is performed through the user input, it is to be understood that the procedure of generating the input signal and the control signal in accordance with the user input is included in the aforementioned description.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Also, it may be expressed that the processor controls the mobile device or the units included in the mobile device in accordance with the user input. The processor may be described to mean the mobile device.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The storage unit <b>130</b> may store various digital data such as audio, photos, moving pictures, and applications. The storage unit <b>130</b> refers to various digital data storage areas, such as a flash memory, a random access memory (RAM), and a solid state drive (SSD).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Also, the storage unit <b>130</b> may temporarily store data received from an external device through the communication unit <b>140</b>. At this time, the storage unit <b>130</b> may be used for buffering for outputting the data, which are received from the external device, from the mobile device <b>100</b>. In this case, the storage unit <b>130</b> may selectively be provided on the mobile device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Also, the storage unit <b>130</b> may store information on at least one application implemented in a child mode and at least one application implemented in an adult mode.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The communication unit <b>140</b> may transmit and receive data to and from the external device by performing communication with the external device by using various protocols.

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In addition, although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the mobile device may include audio input and output units or a power unit.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The audio output unit (not shown) includes an audio output means such as a speaker and earphone. Also, the audio output unit may output voice on the basis of contents implemented in the processor <b>150</b> or the control command of the processor <b>150</b>. At this time, the audio output unit may selectively be provided on the mobile device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The power unit is a power source connected with a battery inside the device or an external power, and may supply the power to the mobile device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Also, the mobile device <b>100</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as a block diagram. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, respective blocks are shown to logically identify the elements of the device. Accordingly, the aforementioned elements of the device may be provided as one chip or a plurality of chips in accordance with design of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the meantime, the mobile device according to one embodiment may provide a dual mode of a child mode and an adult mode. To this end, the mobile device according to one embodiment may provide two lock states of a first lock state and a second lock state, and may provide a first unlock interface for unlocking the first lock state and a second unlock interface for unlocking the second lock state. Hereinafter, a description as to a lock state set in accordance with a dual mode and when the lock state is set will be made, and a mode provided when the lock state is unlocked in accordance with the first unlock interface and the second unlock interface will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">First of all, the mobile device according to one embodiment may provide the first unlock interface that unlocks the first lock state. The first lock state is the state that input of the user or occurrence of an event is on standby. Accordingly, if the mobile device enters the first lock state, it may make a screen become an off state in the form of a dark screen until it detects the input of the user or occurrence of an event.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In other words, in order to reduce unnecessary power consumption, the mobile device may enter the first lock state if a previously set time passes without input of the user or occurrence of an event. At this time, the mobile device may enter the first lock state in a child mode or an adult mode. In other words, the mode for entering the first lock state is not limited to a specific mode, and the child mode and the adult mode may be the mode for entering the first lock state.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The mobile device of the first lock state is on standby for input of the user or occurrence of an event. If the mobile device detects the input of the user or occurrence of an event, it may provide the first unlock interface for unlocking the first lock state.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The first unlock interface is an unlock interface provided if the mobile device of the first lock state detects the input of the user or occurrence of an event. Also, the first unlock interface may unlock the first lock state and allow entrance to the child mode or adult mode.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In other words, the mobile device may unlock the first lock state and enter into the child mode or adult mode in accordance with the input signal of the user for the first unlock interface. To this end, the first unlock interface may allow a first unlock signal for entrance to the child mode and a second unlock signal for entrance to the adult mode.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">If the mobile device detects the input signal for the first unlock interface, which is input by the user, it may determine whether the input signal is the first unlock signal for entrance to the child mode or the second unlock signal for entrance to the adult mode, and may enter into the child mode or the adult mode.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram illustrating embodiments of a first unlock interface for unlocking a first lock state.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The mobile device may enter into the child mode or the adult mode by receiving an unlock signal from the user through the first unlock interface. The unlock signal may be the signal generated if the user performs a touch input in accordance with a pattern which is previously set, as shown in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Also, the unlock signal may be the signal generated if the user inputs a series of numbers which are previously set, as shown in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Also, the unlock signal may be the signal generated if a fingerprint of the user is input as shown in (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. At this time, the mobile device may further include a unit for fingerprint input to receive the fingerprint of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As described above, the unlock signal is intended to unlock the lock state of the mobile device, and may have various types such as text, number, touch pattern, and fingerprint. The unlock signal is not limited to a specific type. However, the mobile device may sense touch and hovering of the user for the screen, and may also sense a motion of the user based on the mobile device through a gyroscope sensor and recognize a voice. Accordingly, the unlock signal may be generated by at least one of touch, hovering, fingerprint, motion and voice of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Also, as shown in (a) to (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, even though the first unlock interface receives different types of unlock signals, it receives the first unlock signal for entering into the child mode separately from the second unlock signal for entering into the adult mode. In other words, if the mobile device detects the first unlock signal for the first unlock interface, it may provide an environment based on the child mode after unlocking the lock state. If the mobile device detects the second unlock signal, it may provide an environment based on the adult mode after unlocking the lock state.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In this respect, the unlock signal will be described as an example of the signal generated when the user performs a touch input in accordance with a pattern which is previously set, as shown in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram illustrating that a mobile device of a first lock state enters into a child mode through a first unlock signal for a first unlock interface in accordance with one embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Since the child mode means that the user is a child, as shown in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the mobile device <b>300</b> may set a first unlock signal in accordance with a pattern <b>310</b> which is easy for children to remember or input. The mobile device <b>300</b> may basically provide the pattern <b>310</b> for the first unlock signal, and the user may previously set the pattern <b>310</b> for the first unlock signal through the mobile device <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">If the mobile device <b>300</b> detects the first unlock signal, it may provide a user interface <b>320</b> implemented in the child mode as shown in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The user interface <b>320</b> may include at least one application implemented in the child mode.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As described above, if the mobile device <b>300</b> enters into the child mode, among at least one application installed in the mobile device <b>300</b>, the application set to be performed in the child mode may only be displayed. The application which is not allowed to be used in the child mode cannot be displayed. This will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagram illustrating that a mobile device of a first lock state enters into an adult mode through a second unlock signal for a first unlock interface in accordance with one embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Since the adult mode means that the user is an adult, as shown in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the mobile device <b>400</b> may set a second unlock signal in accordance with a complicated pattern <b>410</b> which is difficult for children to unlock the lock state.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The mobile device <b>400</b> according to one embodiment may set a first unlock signal for entering into the child mode differently from a second unlock signal for entering into the adult mode. As a result, it is advantageous in that data of the mobile device may be prevented from being deleted due to mistake or error manipulation of the child and contents harmful to children may be blocked. Accordingly, if the pattern for the second unlock signal is the pattern which is difficult for the child to remember, the above advantages may be more increased.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Also, the mobile device <b>400</b> may basically provide the pattern <b>410</b> for the second unlock signal, and the user may previously set the pattern <b>410</b> for the second unlock signal through the mobile device <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">If the mobile device <b>400</b> detects the second unlock signal, it may provide a user interface <b>420</b> implemented in the adult mode as shown in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The user interface <b>420</b> may include at least one application implemented in the adult mode.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">If necessary, the user interface implemented in the adult mode may display all the applications installed in the mobile device <b>400</b>. The user of the adult mode may identify the application implemented in the child mode by allowing the user of the adult mode to view the application implemented in the child mode, and may set the mode where the application is implemented. This will be described in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In the meantime, the mobile device may provide a call transmission and reception function, a message transmission and reception function and an e-mail transmission and reception function. At this time, if the child of the user receives a call or text message related to business of the user with using the mobile device of the user, a problem may occur in business of the user. Accordingly, the mobile device according to one embodiment may allow the above functions to be used in the adult mode only.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">However, in case of a function in which event processing is important at the time when an event occurs, such as the function for call reception, the mobile device may allow the user to enter into the adult mode and process the corresponding event by notifying the user that the event has occurred even though it restricts event processing in the child mode. As a result, the mobile device according to one embodiment may allow the user to immediately process an event regarded by the user to be important or an event of which processing is important at the time when the event occurs. This will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram illustrating that an event for an adult mode occurs in a mobile device of a child mode in accordance with one embodiment. It is assumed that the mobile device detects the first unlock signal for the first unlock interface unlocking the first lock state and enters into the child mode.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">(a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates that the mobile device of the child mode displays an implementation screen of a specific application <b>510</b> implemented in the child mode. When the mobile device of the child mode implements the specific application <b>510</b>, it may detect an event for the adult mode.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The event means occurrence of an operation or work that affects implementation of an application or task of the mobile device, and may occur when an operation or work generated by the user occurs or data are received from an external device. For example, the mobile device may detect occurrence of the event if it receives a call, text message or e-mail.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">However, if the mobile device is allowed to process such an event even in the child mode, a problem may occur in that the user of the mobile device may miss an important call or message due to the child. Accordingly, the mobile device may be set such that event processing cannot be processed in the child mode. In other words, the mobile device may process an event in the adult mode only. However, the mobile device of the child mode may detect occurrence of the event even though it cannot process the event. Accordingly, if the mobile device of the child mode detects occurrence of the event, it may enter into the adult mode to process the event.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">If the mobile device detects an event for the adult mode in the child mode, as shown in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it may enter a second lock state and display a second unlock interface <b>520</b> that unlocks the mobile device of the second lock state. At this time, the second unlock interface <b>520</b> may display information <b>521</b> related to the detected event.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The second lock state is on standby for input of the user. If the mobile device detects the event for the adult mode in the child mode, it may enter the second lock state. Also, the mobile device may enter the second lock state and at the same time may display the second unlock interface that unlocks the second lock state.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Hereinafter, the first lock state and the second lock state, and the first unlock interface and the second unlock interface will be described in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">First of all, the mobile device may enter the first lock state in the child mode or adult mode. In other words, the mobile device may enter the first lock state regardless of the fact that the current mode is the child mode or the adult mode if there is no input of the user or occurrence of an event until a previously set time passes.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">On the other hand, the mobile device may enter the second lock state in the child mode only. In other words, the mobile device may enter the second lock state only if it detects the event for the adult mode in the current child mode.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Also, the mobile device that has entered the first lock state is on standby for input of the user or occurrence of the event. Accordingly, the mobile device that has entered the first lock state may provide the first unlock interface for unlocking the first lock state if it detect the input of the user or occurrence of the event.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">On the other hand, the mobile device that has entered the second lock state is in the state that it detects the event for the adult mode. Accordingly, the mobile device may enter the second lock state and at the same time provide the second unlock interface for unlocking the second lock state.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In other words, the first unlock interface is provided if the input of the user or occurrence of the event is detected in the first lock state, whereas the second unlock interface may be provided at the same time when the mobile device enters the second lock state.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Also, the first unlock interface may allow both the first unlock signal for entering into the child mode and the second unlock signal for entering into the adult mode. However, the second unlock interface may allow only the second unlock signal for entering into the adult mode. This is because that the mobile device should enter into the adult mode to allow the user to process the event as the mobile device of the child mode detects the event for the adult mode. Accordingly, the second unlock interface may entrance to the adult mode only after unlocking the lock state.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Also, the second unlock interface is different from the first unlock interface, which receives the unlock signal only, in that it includes information on the event.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">(b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates that information <b>521</b> on an event includes caller information and caller number together with a call icon for notifying occurrence of an event for call reception. For example, if the mobile device detects an event for message reception, information related to the event may include at least one of message sender information, message sender number and message together with a message icon for notifying occurrence of the event for message reception. In other words, the information on the event may include information that may allow the user to identify the event, for example, information as to what the generated event is.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a diagram illustrating that a mobile device of a second lock state is unlocked by a second unlock interface in accordance with one embodiment. In the same manner as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it is assumed that the mobile device of the child mode enters the second lock state by detecting the event for the adult mode and provides the second unlock interface.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">As shown in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the mobile device may detect a second unlock signal <b>611</b> for the second unlock interface <b>610</b>. The mobile device that has detected the second unlock signal <b>611</b> may unlock the second lock state and enter into the adult mode.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Also, the mobile device that has unlocked the second lock state through the second unlock interface <b>610</b> and entered into the adult mode may process the detected event. If the event detected by the mobile device is the event for call reception, as shown in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the mobile device may receive a call.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">At this time, the mobile device may enter into the adult mode and at the same time process the event for call reception even though there is no separate input of the user. Even though the user does not perform a touch or input for a call, the operation of entrance to the adult mode through the second unlock interface <b>610</b> may be regarded as that for call reception. If the mobile device receives an input signal of the user, which is for event processing, after entering into the adult mode, it may process the detected event.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">However, in the same manner as that a call ends, the mobile device that has completely processed the detected event may enter the first lock state as shown in (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, and may provide the first unlock interface <b>620</b> for unlocking the first lock state. As described above, the first unlock interface <b>620</b> may allow the first unlock signal for entering into the child mode and the second unlock signal for entering into the adult mode.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Accordingly, if the user intends to perform additional task in the adult mode, the user may unlock the first lock state by inputting the second unlock signal and enter into the adult mode. On the other hand, if the user desires to enter into the child mode to allow the child to use the mobile device, the user may unlock the first lock state by inputting the first unlock signal and enter into the child mode.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">As described above, if the detected event is completely processed, the mobile device may enter the first lock state and provide the first unlock interface, whereby the user may enter into a desired mode to perform a desired task.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">However, after the detected event is completely processed, it may be more preferable for the user that the mobile device continues to implement the application implemented in the child mode. Also, it may be more preferable that the mobile device maintains the adult mode to allow the user to perform additional task after the detected event is completely processed. This will be described in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">First of all, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a diagram illustrating that a mobile device of a second lock state is unlocked by a second unlock interface in accordance with another embodiment. In the same manner as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it is assumed that the mobile device of the child mode enters the second lock state by detecting the event for the adult mode and provides the second unlock interface.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">As shown in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the mobile device may detect a second unlock signal <b>711</b> for a second unlock interface <b>710</b>. The mobile device that has detected the second unlock signal <b>711</b> may unlock the second lock state and enter into the adult mode.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Also, the mobile device that has entered into the adult mode may process the detected event. (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an event for call reception as an example of the detected event. As described above, the mobile device may process the event simultaneously with unlocking the second lock state or may process the event if there is a request of the user after unlocking the second lock state.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">At this time, if the detected event is completely processed, the mobile device may automatically be switched from the adult mode to the child mode. As a result, as shown in (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the mobile device may continue to implement the application <b>720</b> implemented at the time when detecting the event.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Also, in a state that the mobile device displays the first unlock interface after entering the first lock state as shown in (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, if the user enters into the child mode through the first unlock signal, the mobile device may continue to implement the application implemented at the time when detecting the event.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">However, as shown in (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, if the mobile device continues to implement the application which is being implemented, without entering the lock state, the user does not need to unlock the lock state, whereby convenience is improved. This is because that the adult has only to pass the mobile device to the child.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a diagram illustrating that a mobile device of a second lock state is unlocked by a second unlock interface in accordance with other embodiment. In the same manner as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it is assumed that the mobile device of the child mode enters the second lock state by detecting the event for the adult mode and provides the second unlock interface. Also, since (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> are the same as (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, their detailed description will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">As shown in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, if the mobile device detects a second unlock signal for a second unlock interface, it may unlock the second lock state and enter into the adult mode. Also, as shown in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the mobile device that has entered into the adult mode may process the detected event.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">At this time, if the detected event is completely processed, the mobile device may provide a basic home screen <b>810</b> provided in the adult mode as shown in (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The basic home screen may include an icon corresponding to at least one application implemented in the adult mode.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">If the event for the adult mode occurs in the mobile device of the child mode, a task related to the event may be performed even after the event is completed. For example, the user who has ended a call may make an important note or should write and send a mail in respect of the call message. Accordingly, the mobile device according to one embodiment may allow the user to continue to perform a necessary task by maintaining the adult mode after processing the event.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Also, although the mobile device may continue to maintain the adult mode, it may maintain the adult mode for a previously set time after the event is completely processed and may switch the adult mode to the child mode after the previously set time is exceeded. For example, the mobile device may automatically switch the adult mode to the child mode if the previously set time is exceeded without input of the user or occurrence of the event after processing the event.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">As described above, the mobile device may perform the task related to the event by maintaining the adult mode for a given time. Afterwards, the mobile device may return to the child mode to continue to implement the application implemented in the child mode, whereby user convenience may be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In the meantime, as shown in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, if the mobile device of the child mode may enter the second lock state by detecting the event for the adult mode and displays the second unlock interface, it may disable the function for processing the event in the child mode.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">For example, the mobile device that has received a call, that is, the mobile device that has detected the event for call reception may press a previously set button or reject a received call by touching a menu button on the screen. Alternatively, the mobile device that has detected the event for message reception, the event for mail reception, etc. may turn off an alarm function even though the user does not check the message or mail.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">As described above, the rejection of the received call or turn-off of the alarm function for message reception or mail reception may be regarded as event processing. However, if the function for processing the event is able to be performed in the child mode, the user may miss the important event processing due to the child. Accordingly, the mobile device according to one embodiment of the present specification may disable the function for processing the event in the child mode by detecting the event for the adult mode in the child mode.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">As described above, if the mobile device of the child mode detects the event for the adult mode, it may disable the function for processing the event in the child mode. Alternatively, if the mobile device of the child mode detects the event for the adult mode, since it enters the second lock state and displays the second unlock interface, it may disable the function for processing the event at the second lock state. Accordingly, the child may be prevented from rejecting the received call or the user may be prevented from missing the important call or message due to turn-off of the message alarm function.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a diagram illustrating that a mobile device of a second lock state provides information guiding mode switching in accordance with one embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">As shown in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, if the mobile device of the child mode detects the event for the adult mode, it may enter the second lock state and provide a second unlock interface <b>910</b>. The second unlock interface <b>910</b> may include information <b>911</b> related to the detected event. Also, the second unlock interface <b>910</b> may allow only a second unlock signal for entering into the adult mode. In other words, the second unlock interface <b>910</b> does not allow the first unlock signal for entering into the child mode.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">However, as shown in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the mobile device may detect the first unlock signal <b>913</b> for entering into the child mode, with respect to the second unlock interface <b>910</b>. This is because that the child who is using the mobile device in the child mode may input the first unlock signal <b>913</b> to enter into the child mode from the lock state. Accordingly, the mobile device may provide information <b>920</b> that guides mode switching from the child mode to the adult mode.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The information <b>920</b> guiding mode switching from the child mode to the adult mode may be displayed as a graphic image as shown in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. However, the information guiding mode switching is not limited to the graphic image and may also be provided as a voice guide message.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In the meantime, at least one application provided in the mobile device according to one embodiment may include at least one application implemented in the child mode only, at least one application implemented in the adult mode only, and at least one application implemented in the child mode and the adult mode. Accordingly, the mobile device according to one embodiment may provide a first setup interface that configures a mode for implementing the provided application.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a diagram illustrating a first setup interface for an application provided by a mobile device in accordance with one embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the first setup interface may include an application interface <b>1010</b> displaying at least one application provided in the mobile device, an adult application interface <b>1020</b> displaying at least one application which will be implemented in the adult mode, and a child application interface <b>1030</b> displaying at least one application which will be implemented in the child mode.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The first setup interface may provide an environment where the user may shift an icon corresponding to the application included in the application interface <b>1010</b> to the adult application interface <b>1020</b> and the child application interface <b>1030</b> through an input method such as a touch.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">At this time, the application included in the application interface <b>1010</b> may be shifted to the adult application interface <b>1020</b> and the child application interface <b>1030</b>. In this case, the corresponding application may be implemented in both the adult mode and the child mode. In other words, the application may be implemented in the child mode only, or the adult mode only, and may be implemented in both the child mode and the adult mode in accordance with configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Also, the first setup interface may be provided in the adult mode. This is because that it is not reasonable to allow the child, who is the user of the child mode, to determine an application and a mode to be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">However, in case of the application which will be implemented in the child mode, the main user of the corresponding application is the child. Accordingly, the mobile device may provide a second setup interface, which configures an environment for implementing at least one application in the child mode, in the child mode.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a diagram illustrating a second setup interface for an application provided by a mobile device in accordance with one embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The second setup interface <b>1110</b> may configure an environment for implementing at least one application in the child mode. The environment may include all the items that may be configured by the user when the user implements the application, such as the time when the application is implemented, sound control when the application is implemented, and brightness control when the application is implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Also, the second setup interface <b>1110</b> may provide a user interface (UI) that may easily configure the environment of the application to be implemented in the child mode. Accordingly, even in case of the same application, if the environment is configured in the child mode, a user interface different from the user interface provided in the adult mode may be provided to be acquainted with the child.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a block diagram illustrating that mode switching is performed between a child mode and an adult mode in a mobile device in accordance with one embodiment. Hereinafter, the mode switching procedure between the child mode and the adult mode will be described together with the first lock state and the second lock state.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">If the mobile device is powered on, it may enter the first lock state <b>1210</b>. The first lock state <b>1210</b> is the state that input of the user or occurrence of the event is on standby. The mobile device may configure the first lock state <b>1210</b> in case of the power-on state, and may provide the first unlock interface for unlocking the first lock state <b>1210</b> to allow the user to use the mobile device.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">The mobile device of the first lock state <b>1210</b> may enter into the child mode <b>1220</b> or the adult mode <b>1260</b> in accordance with the unlock signal detected through the first unlock interface. The unlock signal may be configured previously, and may be varied after being configured.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">In other words, if the mobile device of the first lock state <b>1210</b> detects the first unlock signal, it may enter into the child mode <b>1220</b>. If the mobile device of the first lock state <b>1210</b> detects the second unlock signal, it may enter into the adult mode <b>1260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">In the meantime, after the mobile device of the first lock state <b>1210</b> enters into the child mode <b>1220</b> or the adult mode <b>1260</b>, if there is no input of the user or occurrence of the event for a previously set time, or in accordance with the request of the user, the mobile device may enter the first lock state <b>1210</b>. In this way, as the mobile device enters the first lock state from the child mode or the adult mode, it may reduce unnecessary power consumption, especially reduce unnecessary and frequent reaction of a touch sensor display.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Also, if the mobile device of the child mode <b>1220</b> detects the event for the adult mode, it may enter the second lock state <b>1230</b>. The second lock state <b>1230</b> is the state that the input of the user is on standby. The mobile device may prepare entrance to the adult mode by entering the second lock state <b>1230</b> to process the detected event. In other words, if the mobile device detects the event for the adult mode, it may provide the second lock state and the second unlock interface to allow the user to input the second unlock signal for entering into the adult mode.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">If the mobile device of the second lock state <b>1230</b> detects the second unlock signal for entering into the adult mode in accordance with the input of the user, it may enter into the adult mode to process the detect event (<b>1240</b>). At this time, the adult mode may be the same mode as the adult mode <b>1260</b> entering at the first lock state, and for convenience of description, these adult modes are shown at different blocks. However, the mobile device that has completely processed the event (<b>1240</b>) may enter the first lock state <b>1210</b>, and may enter into the adult mode or the child mode in accordance with the configuration. This will be described in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">In the meantime, if the mobile device of the second lock state <b>1230</b> detects the first unlock signal for entering into the child mode, in accordance with the input of the user, it may send an error report <b>1250</b> and maintain the second lock state <b>1230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The second lock state <b>1230</b> may allow the entrance to the adult mode only unlike the first lock state that allows the entrance to the child mode and the adult mode.

<p id="p-0161" num="0160">The second unlock interface allows the entrance to the adult mode only. Accordingly, if the signal detected by the mobile device is the first unlock signal for entering into the child mode, the mobile device may disable the function for processing the detected event (S<b>1440</b>).
