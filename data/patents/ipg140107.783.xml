<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A tool designed to aid in the removal of a drain from a basin.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As anyone who performs a lot of physical work will attest, nothing beats having the proper tool for a job. The proper tool can save time and money, produce a higher quality job, reduce damage to equipment, and provide for the increased safety of the worker. Each field of physical work has its own type of specialty tools, each performing a specialized task. Plumbing is one of these fields in which very specific tools perform very specific tasks that would otherwise be almost impossible to perform.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One (1) task that is commonly performed in many types of plumbing repairs is the removal of the drain flange from basins of tubs, sinks, showers, and the like. Current tools produced for performing this task typically break the bottom of the drain, requiring additional repair work and resulting in additional time for the plumber and costs for the consumer. Accordingly, there exists a need for a means by which drain flanges from tubs, sinks, showers, and the like can be easily removed without the disadvantages of current methods.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The principles of the present invention provide for a drain removal tool insertable into a drain flange of a basin to assist in removing said drain flange for subsequent repair of the basin or drain flange.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An aspect of the invention provides for a resilient and durable drain removal tool comprising unitary device having a head portion and a shaft portion, wherein the head portion is adapted to receive an auxiliary driving tool to drive said drain removal tool, and said shaft portion is adapted to be inserted into and firmly grasp an inner surface of said drain flange.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A further aspect of the invention is to provide a cylindrical shape of the head portion and a conical shape of the shaft portion, wherein the shaft portion tapers downward from the head portion to a terminal end.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A further aspect of the invention is to provide a tool attachment recess centrally located on an upper surface of the head portion, preferably comprising a size and shape to adaptably receive a common three-eighths (%) size ratchet head for the auxiliary tool.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Yet another aspect of the invention is to provide the shaft portion with a spiraling set of left-handed threads with pointed threads on an outer surface of the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Yet another further aspect of the invention is to provide a method where the shaft portion of the drain removal tool is inserted into a drain flange having a through-hole and the auxiliary hole is inserted into the tool attachment recess, such that a counter-clockwise driving force on the auxiliary tool is transferred to the drain removal tool, such that the left-handed pointed threads on the shaft portion engage an inner surface of the drain flange, thereby enabling the drain flange to disengage from the basin simultaneously with the driving force of the auxiliary tool.</p>
