<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a US National Stage of International Application No. PCT/CN2010/074300, filed Jun. 23, 2010, which claims the benefit of CN 200910237546.8, filed Nov. 11, 2009.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device and a method of manufacturing the same, and more specifically, relates to a device with a sidewall spacer structure which advantageously leads to higher performance of a high-k gate dielectric CMOS device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">With the development of the semiconductor technology, integrated circuits with higher performance and more powerful functions require greater element density. Thus, the sizes of the components need to be scaled further. The utilization of the core technology for 32/22 nanometer process of integrated circuits has been the inevitable trend for the development of integrated circuits, which are also the projects for major international semiconductor companies and institutions to compete to develop. Study on CMOS device gate engineering with &#x201c;high-k/metal gate&#x201d; as the core technology is the most representative in 32/22 nanometer technology, and relevant studies on materials, processes and structures are conducted extensively.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For an MOS device having a high k/metal gate structure, the quality of high-k gate dielectric film, especially the oxygen vacancies and defect density of the high-k gate dielectric film, is essential for the continuous improvement of the performance of the whole device. Currently, hafnium (HO-base high-k gate dielectric film has become the most promising candidate for industrial materials, and has been successfully applied to the 45 nm and 32 nm processes of Intel Corporation. However, there exists serious problems caused by oxygen vacancies in the Hf-base high-k gate dielectric film, for example, degradation of the threshold voltage, mobility of channel carriers, and reliability, etc. It also has negative influence on the threshold voltage of a device, for example, Fermi level pinning effect, and flat band voltage roll-off (V<sub>fb </sub>roll-off) in a PMOS device, etc. Therefore, it has become a challenge in production of an MOS device, particularly a PMOS device, to alleviate the density of oxygen vacancy defects in the high-k gate dielectric film.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the current method of manufacturing a high-k gate dielectric/metal gate structured MOS device, the high-k film layer grown by a chemical method (for example, an Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) or Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD)) generally has more defects and charge traps, and insufficient compactness in the high-k gate dielectric film. In order to increase the compactness of the high-k gate dielectric film and meanwhile alleviate oxygen vacancy and defect traps, a post-deposition-annealing (PDA) process may be conducted at a temperature in the range of about 400-1100&#xb0; C. However, in this process, oxygen in the annealing atmosphere will enter into the MOS device having a high-k gate dielectric/metal gate structure due to diffusion at a high temperature, and pass through the dielectric layer, and finally arrive at the SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si interface to react with the silicon substrate and generate SiO<sub>2</sub>, and thereby the thickness of SiO<sub>2 </sub>interface layer will be decreased. This will disadvantageously lead to increase of Equivalent Oxide Thickness (EOT) of the whole gate structure, and finally lead to degradation of the overall performance for the MOS device. Furthermore, during the MOS device manufacturing process, annealing is required at a temperature in the range of about 950-1100&#xb0; C. to activate the dopants in source/drain regions. During this thermal treatment process, oxygen in the high-k gate dielectric film will be diffused into the SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si interface, and lead to oxygen vacancy defects in the high-k gate dielectric film. Utilization of the high-k gate dielectric and the metal gate electrode in a PMOS device may have some disadvantages. For example, these defects may seriously affect the threshold voltage of the device, in particular the threshold voltage feature of the PMOS device. Therefore, it has become a challenge in production of nanometer CMOS devices to alleviate the increase of the threshold voltage caused by oxygen vacancy.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, in order to improve the performance of a CMOS device having a high-k gate dielectric/metal gate structure, there is a need for a semiconductor device and a method of manufacturing the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Next, the device may be processed, for example, by dopant implantation to form source/drain regions, and by processes such as annealing for activating the dopants.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The above embodiment that a sidewall spacer structure may be used to improve the high-k gate dielectric CMOS device performance is merely a typical example of the present invention. In this embodiment, for the nMOS and pMOS devices, the high-k gate dielectric is made of the same material, and the work function metal gate layers are made of two different materials. However, in other embodiments (not shown), for the nMOS and pMOS devices, high-k gate dielectric of different materials may be used, and the metal gates may use the same material. Meanwhile, for the same or different high-k gate dielectric materials used in the nMOS and pMOS devices, different kinds of cap layer materials may be selectively formed thereon. For example, for an nMOS device, it may be a rare earth oxide, such as La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>and Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. And for a pMOS device, it may be Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, etc. These modifications all fall within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to the present invention, for a pMOS device, the first layer oxide sidewall spacer may provide oxygen atoms for the high-k gate dielectric film to alleviate oxygen vacancy defects in the high-k gate dielectric layer during the annealing process for activating the source/drain dopants, so as to achieve the characteristic of the improved threshold voltage. Additionally, since the oxygen element has a great electronegativity, if the oxygen in the sidewall spacer is partially diffused into the metal gate electrode, the effective work function of the metal electrode will be increased, which may further reduce the threshold voltage of the device. Furthermore, oxygen in the sidewall spacer may be diffused to the SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si interface and react with the Si substrate to generate SiO<sub>2</sub>, which disadvantageously leads to increase of the EOT for the device. Thus, for an NMOS device, since the first layer sidewall spacer is nitride, when performing annealing for activating source/drain dopants, the increase of EOT caused by oxygen diffusion in the sidewall spacer is avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">By virtue of the present invention, during the CMOS device processing process, sidewall spacers of different structures are introduced in the nMOS device and pMOS device, respectively, to improve the performance of the CMOS device having a high-k gate dielectric/metal gate structure. Application of this process may not only alleviate the oxygen vacancy in the high-k gate dielectric in the pMOS device, but also may avoid the problem of EOT growth of the nMOS device during the high-temperature thermal treatment process, and therefore may effectively improve the overall performance of the high-k gate dielectric CMOS device.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Although the embodiments and their advantages have been described in detail, it is readily apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art that various alterations, substitutions and modifications may be made to the embodiments without departing from the spirit of the present invention and the scope as defined by the appended claims. For other examples, it may be easily recognized by a person of ordinary skill in the art that the order of the process steps may be changed without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
