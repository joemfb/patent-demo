<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is the U.S. national stage application of International Patent Application No. PCT/FR2008/050301, filed Feb. 22, 2008, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, including all figures, tables and amino acid or nucleic acid sequences.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of hemostasis, more specifically to that of hemophilia A. The invention relates to human factor VIII variants and to the uses thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">TECHNICAL BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Factor VIII (FVIII) is mainly synthesized by hepatocytes and sinusoidal endothelial cells. The plasma concentration of FVIII is comprised between 0.1 and 0.2 mg/l; the circulating form is inactive and associates with von Willebrand factor (vWF). FVIII plays a key role in the endogenous (so-called intrinsic) pathway of blood coagulation. When a blood vessel is damaged by trauma, bleeding is triggered. In response, the process of hemostasis is initiated, consisting of a complex chain of events leading to the formation of a blood clot which seals the site of injury. Blood coagulation begins when platelets adhere to injured vessel walls. If the injury is severe, the platelet aggregates at the site of injury are insufficient to form a hemostatic plug to staunch the blood flow. Thus coagulation factors intervene whose purpose is to form the fibrin network, generated from soluble fibrinogen molecules by the action of thrombin. The formation of this network composed of insoluble fibers is crucial to firmly anchor the blood clot. Cascade shall be understood to mean that, sequentially and at each step, a precursor protein is converted to an activated protease which cleaves or acts as cofactor for cleavage of the next precursor protein of the cascade. Thus, FVIII is proteolytically cleaved in FVIIIa by the action of thrombin and factor Xa. In this active procoagulant form (FVIIIa), FVIII strikingly increases the proteolytic efficiency of factor FIXa towards factor FX.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Hemophilia A is a bleeding disorder characterized by a deficiency of activated FVIII due to a mutation in the recessive gene encoding FVIII. In some rare cases, hemophilia A may arise from the spontaneous development of auto-antibodies directed against FVIII; this is known as acquired hemophilia A.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Hemophilia is manifested as a defect of blood clotting in response to a hemorrhage. Untreated type A hemophiliacs exhibit symptoms such as excessive bleeding after trauma and sometimes even spontaneous hemorrhages, particularly into the articulation joints. Hemophilia A is the most common coagulation disorders and occurs in 1 in 5,000-10,000 male births. Not all hemophiliacs are affected in the same manner or to the same extent. For instance, hemophilia A is considered i) severe when FVIII levels are less than or equal to 1% of &#x201c;normal&#x201d; circulating levels; ii) moderate when FVIII levels are within the range of 1 to 5% of &#x201c;normal&#x201d;; and iii) mild when FVIII levels are between 5 and 30% of normal. These three types of hemophilia A occur at the following frequencies: 50% of hemophiliac patients have the severe form, 10% the moderate form and 40% the mild form.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Many genetic abnormalities have been associated with the gene coding for FVIII. Said gene is located at the tip of the long arm of the X chromosome (locus Xq28). Hemophilia A results from an abnormality in this gene. It is an X-linked recessive disorder: males and females can transmit the disorder but only males are affected. The molecular defects may be gene mutations, deletions or inversions. The majority of patients harboring missense point mutations have mild or moderate disease. Deletions are classified into two types: i) small deletions; ii) large deletions (&#x3e;1 kb). Most large deletions confer a severe phenotype. With respect to genetic inversions, the intron 22 inversion is the most frequent and is responsible for the majority of cases of severe hemophilia A (45%). Another inversion, the intron 1 one, can cause severe disease while less frequent (3%).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In summary, these mutations result in either a decreased production of functionally normal FVIII molecules, or a quantitatively normal production of functionally defective FVIII molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The FVIII gene codes for a polypeptide chain of 2,351 amino acids (aa) (SEQ ID No. 2) corresponding to a 19 aa signal peptide and a 2332 aa mature protein (330 kDa) (SEQ ID No. 3). The nucleotide sequence of the FVIII precursor is given in SEQ ID No. 1 and the corresponding protein sequence in SEQ ID No. 2. The FVIII precursor consists of a succession of the following seven functional domains: A1, a1, A2, a2, B, a3, A3, C1 and C2, from the N-terminal to the C-terminal (Vehar et al., 1984, Nature, 312:337-342).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">FVIII undergoes a first intracellular proteolysis at arginines 1313 and 1648, producing a FVIII heterodimer consisting of: i) an A1-a1-A2-a2-B heavy chain; ii) an a3-A3-C1-C2 light chain. It circulates in plasma as a heterodimer. The interaction between the two chains is ensured among others by the presence of a chelated copper molecule in domains A1 and A3. Immediately after being secreted in plasma, FVIII forms a very high affinity association with von Willebrand factor (vWF) which protects it from proteases. FVIII and vWF form a noncovalent complex in which binding takes place mainly via two regions of FVIII: the N-terminal region and the C-terminal region at 2303-2332 (C2 domain) of the light chain. During coagulation, FVIII is cleaved by thrombin and factor Xa at three sites: i) thrombin cleaves at Arginine 1689 of the light chain and at Arginine 372 and Arginine 740 of the heavy chain; ii) factor XA cleaves FVIII at Arginine 336, Arginine 372 and Arginine 740. Two of these cleavages are common (Arginine 372 and Arginine 740). Cleavages at Arginine 372 and Arginine 1689 are essential for FVIII to participate in the coagulation cascade. These cleavages activate FVIII, also known as FVIIIa (&#x201c;a&#x201d; for &#x201c;active&#x201d;); in addition to FVIIIa activation, these cleavages result in removal of the 170 kDa B domain and dissociation of FVIIIa from vWF.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The B domain of FVIII, defined by amino acids 741 to 1648, can be totally or partially deleted with no loss of activity of recombinant FVIII (Toole et al., 1986, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 83 (16):5939-5942; Eaton et al., 1986, Biochemistry, 25 (26):8343-8347; Langer et al., 1988, Behring Inst. Mitt, 82:16-25; Meulien et al., 1988, Protein Eng, 2(4):301-6; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,868,112), including for porcine FVIII (U.S. Pat. No. 6,458,563; WO01/68109; U.S. Pat. No. 6,770,744), which in some cases can be used to replace the human FVIII.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Mutations, most of them point mutations, can be inserted at different sites of FVIII without causing a loss of FVIII procoagulant activity (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,744,446; 5,859,204; 6,060,447; 6,180,371; 6,228,620; 6,376,463; EP 1561757; WO02/24723; WO97/49725). EP1502921 and WO2005/111074 describe human FVIIII variants with improved stability.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Other patents (US 2003/0083257; WO2005/040213; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,780,614) may be cited which describe modifications of FVIII cDNA for increasing its production in animal cells. The modifications of the cDNA are disclosed in patents US20021165177; US2002/0182684; EP1048726; EP1283263.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The number of units of FVIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU) with reference to the WHO standard for FVIII. FVIII activity is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to an international standard). One International Unit (IU) of FVIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of FVIII contained in one milliliter of normal human plasma. Plasmatic FVIII assays may be carried out either by a chronometric method or by a chromogenic method.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Hemophilia A (severe and moderate forms) is generally treated by preventive or curative replacement therapy, which is based on repeated injections of the deficient coagulation factor or perfusion thereof. Patients with hemophilia A are treated with different types of plasma-derived or recombinant FVIII: i) recombinant; ii) semipurified plasma products; iii) plasma products purified on conventional or immunoaffinity columns. The first recombinant FVIII concentrates contained albumin as stabilizing agent. These included Kogenate&#xae; (Bayer), Helixate&#xae; (manufactured by Bayer, distributed by Aventis), and Recombinate&#xae; (Baxter). New albumin-free formulations have been developed, such as Kogenate&#xae; FS (Bayer), Helixate&#xae; FS (Bayer), and ReFacto<sup>MC </sup>(Wyeth). These nonetheless contain trace amounts of albumin arising from the cell culture medium used during the step of production of these recombinant proteins.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Recombinant human FVIII still needs to be optimized. Indeed, FVIII is relatively unstable in physiologic conditions, has a low activity in blood, is present at very low concentrations (0.1 to 0.2 &#x3bc;g/ml), and has a half-life of 10 to 12 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In about 30% of severe hemophiliac A patients, replacement therapy causes complications specific to FVIII which lead to failure of the treatments usually used. In fact, after replacement therapy, patients may develop antibodies directed against the exogenous recombinant FVIII. These anti-FVIII antibodies inhibit the procoagulant activity of FVIII, hence the name &#x201c;inhibitory antibodies&#x201d; or else &#x201c;inhibitors&#x201d;. Further FVIII perfusion are rendered ineffective by these antibodies, and result in an increase of inhibitory antibody amount through a phenomenon known as &#x201c;anamnestic reaction&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Rapidly, patients can no longer be treated with FVIII, in which case the inhibitor &#x201c;titer&#x201d; is determined. This titer is expressed in international Bethesda units (BU). One BU of inhibitors corresponds to inactivation of half of the amount of FVIII in 1 ml of normal plasma. A titer is &#x201c;low&#x201d; when less than 10 BU, and &#x201c;high&#x201d; when more than 10 BU.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">When the inhibitor titer is relatively low, hemophiliac patients may be given the aforementioned FVIII concentrates such as Kogenate&#xae; FS, Helixate&#xae; FS, Recombinate&#xae;, and ReFacto<sup>MC</sup>, but this carries a significant risk of inducing a rise in inhibitor titers which must therefore be closely monitored.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">One of the ways to control inhibitory antibodies is to induce immune tolerance through administration of large doses of FVIII according to &#x201c;de Bonn&#x201d; protocol. In some patients, the inhibitory antibody titer is so high that they cannot be treated with large doses of FVIII for toxicity reasons.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A second approach known as the &#x201c;Bonn-Malmo protocol&#x201d; is based on one hand on ex vivo immunoadsorption of inhibitors immediately followed by reinjection of the blood, and on the other hand on injection of large doses of FVIII combined with immunosuppressive agents. These treatments are extremely costly in terms of recombinant FVIII and have achieved partial success.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Another approach consists in supplying coagulation factors in order to &#x201c;bypass&#x201d; the requirement of FVIII in the intrinsic coagulation pathway by using: i) plasma-derived activated prothrombin complex (FEIBA&#xae; VH, Factor Eight Inhibitor Bypassing Activity; Baxter) containing Factors II, VII, IX and X; ii) recombinant activated Factor VIIa (rFVIIa; NovoSeven&#xae;/Niastase&#xae;; NovoNordisk).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Said approaches have clear-cut success, nevertheless counterbalance by the development of side effects associated with this type of therapy (such as additional bleeding or conversely thrombotic events related to the frequency of administration).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">It should be noted that circulating FVIII level increases after injection and then gradually declines related to its half-life. FVIII half-life ranges from 8 to 16 hours, with an average of 12 hours, raising the problem of repeated injections.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Another option consists in using a porcine FVIII with the aim to avoid antibodies directed against human FVIII. Patients who developed inhibitors to human FVIII have been successfully treated with semi-purified porcine FVIII (Hyate:C). Yet, this success has only been partial because after several injections of porcine FVIII, anti-porcine FVIII inhibitors have also developed, as mentioned in US2004/0249134. This phenomenon may necessitate to end treatment. Ipsen and Octagen are now co-developing a recombinant porcine FVIII known as OBI-1 in collaboration with Emory University in the USA, as a replacement for Hyate:C (WO2005107776).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Administration of porcine FVIII is therefore not a definitive solution for the treatment of hemophilia A patients with inhibitors.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As it can be seen, today there is no ideal treatment for individuals with hemophilia A, with or without inhibitors. The various problems encountered with commercial FVIII-based treatments associated with the development of these inhibitory antibodies have driven efforts to rapidly design a novel FVIII which has retained procoagulant specific activity and having lost the epitopes recognized by the inhibitory antibodies.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Few studies have addressed the epitope specificities of &#x201c;inhibitory&#x201d; antibodies. Some inhibitory antibodies appear to recognize small regions of the FVIII molecule: i) C2 domain in the light chain (2181-2321); ii) A2 domain in the heavy chain (484-509); iii) A3 domain (1694-2019) (Prescott et al., 1997, Blood, 89:3663-3671; Barrow et al., 2000, Blood, 95:557-561).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The 18 kDa C2 domain, between Serine 2173 and Tyrosine 2332, contains the membrane phospholipid binding domain and a part of the vWF binding domain. Inhibitory antibodies directed against the C2 domain mainly block the binding to phospholipids binding required for procoagulant activity but also the interaction with vWF. Mutations at positions Methionine 2199, Phenylalanine 2200, Valine 2223, Lysine 2227, Leucine 2251 and Leucine 2252 illustrate the importance of these amino acids in FVIIII activity and binding to phospholipids and/or to vWF (Pratt et al., 1999, Nature, 402:439-442).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Anti-A2 antibodies inhibit the function of FVIIIa as cofactor of Factor X (Lollar et al., 1994, J. Clin. Invest. 93:2497-2504). The main A2 epitope has been located between Arginine 484 and Leucine 508 (Healey et al., 1995, J. Biol. Chem., 270:14505-14509).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Antibodies directed against A3 and/or C2 domain prevent stabilization of the interaction between FVIII and vWF and also interfere with binding of the FVIII light chain to activated FIX.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Inhibitors are very heterogeneous from one patient to another and epitope specificity may change over time. Kinetic study of FVIII inhibition have revealed two types of allo-antibodies: type I antibodies which completely neutralize exogenous FVIII, and type II antibodies which never totally inhibit FVIII activity. Type II antibodies not completely block the procoagulant activity of FVIII because they are not saturable or display decreasing affinity according to their concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Regions which can be recognized by inhibitory antibodies are cited in patents US2003/147900 and WO00/48635. These exposed and antigenic FVIII regions are between positions 1649-2019, 108-355, 403-725 and 2085-2249.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Moreover, US 2005/0256304 describes the following set of positions in human FVIII, where substitutions are likely to decrease antigenicity: 197, 198, 199, 201, 202, 407, 411, 412, 419, 515, 517, 613, 617, 636, 637, 638, 639, 823, 1011, 1013, 1208, 1209, 1210, 1254, 1255, 1257, 1262, 1264, 1268, 1119, 1120, 1121, 1122, and 1123.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The antigenicity of human FVIII can be decreased by glycosylation of recognition sites of inhibitors. Said method is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,759,216 and JP2004141173.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Another option consists in substituting the human FVIII epitopes usually recognized by inhibitors in domains: i) A2 (484-509); ii) A3 (1694-2019), a3 (1649-1687); iii) C2 (2181-2321). This solution is based on the use of a hybrid recombinant protein: a human/porcine FVIII.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The main targets of inhibitory antibodies are located in the A2 and C2 domains of FVIII (Saenko et al., Haemophilia, 2002). In fact, it is generally thought that 90% of inhibitory antibodies are directed against the human A2 and C2 domains (Barrow et al., 2000, Blood, 95:564-569). Moreover, it has been shown that human inhibitors have weak activity against porcine FVIII (Koshihara et al., Blood, 1995).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">It is therefore expected that a substitution of human FVIII epitopes by porcine sequences would lead to a hybrid molecule less reactive towards inhibitory antibodies. Thus, the human A2 and C2 domains were replaced by their corresponding porcine domains (Lubin et al., 1994, J. Biol. Chem., 269:8639-8641). However, once again, anti-porcine FVIII antibodies eventually developed during the treatment of patients with inhibitors.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Many patents describe human/animal FVIII hybrids having retained a procoagulant activity. Human/animal hybrid, as used herein, denotes any combination (substitution) of at least one amino acid between a human FVIII sequence and a FVIII sequence of animal origin. Said hybrids have been produced, on the one hand, by substituting regions (functional subunits or structural domains) by the corresponding animal regions. For instance, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,888,974; 5,663,060; 5,583,209; EP1359222; U.S. Pat. No. 5,744,446; WO93/20093; and WO95/24427 provide hybrid FVIII molecules derived from combinations of heavy and light chains of human and non-human FVIII, and/or derived from combinations of human/porcine FVIII domains.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">U.S. Pat. No. 5,744,446 describes human/porcine FVIII variants wherein sequences of the human A2 domain are substituted by the corresponding murine or porcine sequences. The substituted fragments of the A2 domain are: 373-540; 373-508, 445-508, 484-508, 404-508, 489-508 and 484-489.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">U.S. Pat. No. 5,364,771 provides a method for purifying FVIII hybrids derived from combinations of light and heavy chains from human and non-human FVIII: human FVIII in which the A2 domain is replaced by the porcine A2 domain.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">On the other hand, in some patents, said hybrids are formed by point substitutions of one or several amino acids of human FVIII by the corresponding amino acid(s) of animal origin (porcine, canine or murine). For example, US2004/0197875 discloses modifications in codon charges at certain positions of human FVIII. Said positions are defined related to porcine FVIII sequence. EP1454916 describes the introduction of porcine codons into the human cDNA.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Among these patents, studies have been addressed to develop human/porcine FVIII hybrids in the region of the A2 domain. EP1359222 describes a study of the porcine A2 domain sequence, with a view to generating such hybrid. US2003/166536; U.S. Pat. No. 6,376,463; WO00/71141 describe amino acid substitutions in human FVIII at key epitopes in the A2 domain, between positions 484 and 508: 486, 490, 491, 493, 494, 496, 498, 499, 500, 502, 503, 504, 505, 506, 507 for WO00/71141; and 485, 487, 488, 489, 492, 495, 501, 508 for U.S. Pat. No. 5,859,204. In particular, Alanine substitutions were made at positions: Arginine 484, Proline 485, Tyrosine 487, Serine 488, Arginine 489, Proline 492, Valine 495, Phenylalanine 501, and Isoleucine 508. These substitutions conferring decreased antigenicity might be of interest from a therapeutic standpoint.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Likewise, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,180,371, Arginine 484 is substituted by Serine, Proline 485 by Alanine, Arginine 489 by Glycine, Proline 492 by Leucine. With these variants, inhibition of the procoagulant function of FVIII by antibodies was alleviated or disappeared altogether. The therapeutic interest of a double or triple mutant at Arginine 484, Arginine 489 and Phenylalanine 501, where each codon is substituted with an Alanine, is suggested.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">There are also patents disclosing FVIII variants in which the substitutions only affect the C2 domain.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">US2004/249134; WO03/047507; WO02/24723; U.S. Pat. No. 6,770,744 describe substitutions at positions Methionine 2199, Phenylalanine 2200, Valine 2223, Lysine 2227, Leucine 2251 and Leucine 2252. Said substitutions were introduced into a FVIII lacking the B domain. Amino acids at positions 2215, 2220, 2320, 2195, 2196, 2290 and 2313 were substituted with an Alanine.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">With regard to position 2223, Valine is replaced by an Alanine, by comparison between human and porcine FVIII. This mutation is mentioned in Pratt's article &#x201c;Structure of the C2 domain of human FVIII&#x201d; (Nature, 1999, 402:439-442) and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,770,744.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Combinations of certain mutated positions such as 2199, 2200, 2223 and 2227 have been described as reducing the antigenicity of FVIII with regard to some anti-C2 domain inhibitory antibodies, all while retaining the coagulant activity of FVIII.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In patents WO99/46274 and US2005/0079584, J. Lollar's group describes a region of potential interest for constituting a less immunogenic FVIII: 2181 to 2243. This region was defined very roughly by an antigenicity study of human/porcine hybrids. An alignment between human and porcine FVIII of the sequence 2181 to 2243 disclosed 17 differences at the following positions: 2181, 2182, 2195, 2196, 2197, 2199, 2207, 2216, 2222, 2224, 2225, 2226, 2227, 2228, 2234, 2238, 2243. J. Lollar's group speculate that a substitution at these 17 positions by an Alanine, a Methionine, a Serine, a Glycine, or else a Leucine might generate a FVIII protein that can avoid inhibitory antibodies. This hypothesis is not supported by any antigenicity studies of mutants of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Lastly, patents such as U.S. Pat. No. 6,180,371; US2002/182670; US 2003/068785; US2005/079584; WO99/46274; U.S. Pat. No. 7,012,132; WO2005/046583 provide human/porcine hybrids harboring substitutions in both the A2 and C2 domains of FVIII with the aim of reducing inhibition by inhibitory antibodies that recognize both domains. In particular, WO2005/046583 describes amino acid substitutions in the A2 and C2 domains at positions 484, 489, 492, 2199, 2200, 2251 and 2252. The FVIII which was used lacks the B domain. Only position 484 has an Arginine substituted by an Alanine.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">To summarize, while many studies make reference to novel FVIII variants, there is still a need for a novel, less immunogenic FVIII, because there are no modified FVIII variants capable of treating patients with inhibitors currently on the market. Moreover, variants with an improved specific activity or an improved capacity to be secreted are also of major interest to promote the production of recombinant FVIII or to improve the treatment of patients.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The present invention therefore provides novel improved FVIII variants. Said variants may have lost the epitopes recognized by inhibitory antibodies all while retaining the core of their procoagulant activity, or have an improved specific activity, or else have an improved secretion capacity. Said variants may also have a combination of these features. For example, the invention relates to variants which are less immunogenic and have an improved specific activity and/or an improved secretion capacity. Likewise, the invention relates to variants having an improved specific activity and/or an improved secretion capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A first object of the present invention is an improved human FVIII variant or a biologically active derivative thereof comprising a substitution of at least one amino acid selected from the group consisting of the residues at positions 462, 409, 507, 629, 400, 562, 403, 518, 414, 496, 421, 493, 486, and 494 of the A2 domain and the residues at positions 2206, 2212, 2226, 2244, 2261, 2275, 2280, 2281, 2282, 2289, 2294, 2311, 2312, and 2316 of the C2 domain. In a particular embodiment, the human FVIII variant or biologically active derivative thereof consists of a single substitution. In another particular embodiment, the human FVIII variant or biologically active derivative thereof further comprises a substitution of at least one amino acid selected from the group consisting of the residue at position 2202 of the C2 domain and the residue at position 437 of the A2 domain. In a particular embodiment, the human FVIII variant or biologically active derivative thereof comprises the substitution of at least two, three, four, five six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen or fifteen amino acids, preferably selected from the aforementioned groups. Preferably, the amino acid is substituted by an amino acid selected from an Alanine, a Methionine, a Serine, a Glycine, and a Leucine. More preferably, the amino acid is substituted by an Alanine. Preferably, the biologically active FVIII derivative is a FVIII consisting in a partial or whole deletion of the B domain.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In a particular embodiment, the variant has decreased antigenicity towards inhibitory antibodies as compared to natural human FVIII and retains a procoagulant activity at least equal to 50% of that of natural human FVIII. In a preferred embodiment, the invention relates to an improved human FVIII variant or a biologically active derivative thereof comprising a substitution of at least one amino acid selected from the group consisting of the residues at positions 462, 409, 507 and 629 of the A2 domain and the residues at positions 2289, 2294, 2312, and 2316 of the C2 domain. Said variant can further comprise a substitution of at least one amino acid selected from the group consisting of the residue at position 2202 of the C2 domain and the residue at position 437 of the A2 domain. In a more preferred embodiment, the invention relates to an improved human FVIII variant or a biologically active derivative thereof comprising the substitution of at least one amino acid selected from the group consisting of the residues at positions 462, 409, 507 and 629 of the A2 domain. In another embodiment, the invention relates to an improved human FVIII variant or a biologically active derivative thereof comprising or consisting of the combination of two substitutions selected from the group consisting of 409+462, 409+507, 462+507, 409+629, 462+629, 507+629. In yet another embodiment, the invention relates to an improved human FVIII variant or a biologically active derivative thereof comprising or consisting of the combination of three substitutions selected from the group consisting of 409+462+507, 462+507+629, 409+462+629, 409+507+629. In another particular embodiment, the invention relates to an improved human FVIII variant or biologically active derivative thereof comprising or consisting of the combination of four substitutions at positions 409, 462, 507 and 629.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Furthermore, these mutations which confer abolition to inhibition by inhibitory antibodies may prove to be of great interest in combination with mutations conferring a higher specific activity, allowing compensating an optional relative loss of activity of these less antigenic mutants. In a particular embodiment, the variant has an improved specific activity as compared to that of natural human FVIII. In a preferred embodiment, the invention relates to an improved human FVIII variant or a biologically active derivative thereof further comprising the substitution of at least one amino acid selected from the group consisting of the residues at positions 2177, 2183, 2186, 2191, 2196, 2204, 2205, 2213, 2217, 2235, 2258, 2264, 2268 and 2269 of the C2 domain.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Said mutations which confer abolition to inhibition by inhibitory antibodies may also prove to be of great interest in combination with mutations conferring an improved capacity to be secreted, by allowing compensating an optional relative loss of secretion of these less antigenic mutants. In a particular embodiment, the invention relates to an improved human FVIII variant or a biologically active derivative thereof further comprising the substitution of at least one amino acid selected from the group consisting of the residues at positions 2175, 2199, 2200, 2215, 2251, 2252 and 2278 of the C2 domain. Massive production of mutants having retained at least 50% of FVIII activity also makes it possible to encompass their use in a context of analyzing additional functions of the protein. In addition to a modulation of its immunogenicity, secretion and specific activity, the following properties of FVIII might be improved by using the herein described mutated molecules: &#x2014;binding to von Willebrand factor and therefore improved half-life of FVIII or circulating FVIIIa; &#x2014;improved intrinsic stability of the molecule by stabilization of the A2 domain and therefore an increased efficiency period; &#x2014;binding to phospholipids derived from blood platelets, cell surfaces or circulating microparticles and therefore improved formation of FXa; &#x2014;binding to FIXa and FX and therefore improved formation of FXa; &#x2014;decreased binding of FVIII or FVIIIa to the molecules responsible for its catabolism such as for example low density Lipoprotein Receptor-related Protein (LRP), Low density Lipoprotein Receptor (LDLR), Very Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor (VLDLR), megaline or any other receptor which might be identified and therefore improved half-life of circulating FVIII; &#x2014;proteolysis decrease of FVIII or FVIIIa by vascular proteases such as for example activated protein C, FXa, FIXa, and therefore increase efficiency period.</p>

<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The present invention provides a solution to resolve a serious complication that occurs in <b>30</b>% of hemophilia A patients treated with recombinant FVIII: the development of an immune response induced by the treatment and directed against the exogenous recombinant FVIII.

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The different properties conferred by the mutations in these variants may be of major interest in combination. In a non-limiting example, mutations which confer a specific activity improvement of a variant could compensate an optional relative loss of activity in variants whose mutations confer a abolition to inhibition by inhibitory antibodies and being therefore less antigenic. In another non-limiting example, mutations which confer a higher capacity to be secreted may interesting in combination with mutations conferring an abolition to inhibition by inhibitory antibodies, by allowing, for example, to compensate a optional relative loss of secretion of said less antigenic mutants.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the present document, the following terminology is used to designate a substitution: <b>5409</b>A indicates the substitution of the serine residue at position <b>409</b> of SEQ ID No. <b>3</b> by an alanine.

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">the chromogenic assay mentioned above. This assay was also performed on the robotic platform of the National Hemophilia Treatment Center (Hospices Civils de Lyon). The chromogenic activity of the <b>158</b> selected Alanine mutants was carried out with the Coamatic Factor VIII kit (Chromogenix, Instrumentation Laboratory, Milan, Italy) according to the supplier's instructions. Briefly, culture supernatants (50 &#x3bc;l) were diluted in the dilution buffer provided and preincubated at 37&#xb0; C. for 4 min. The reaction medium (50 &#x3bc;<b>1</b>), preheated at 37&#xb0; C., was then added for 4 min, after which 50 &#x3bc;l of development medium at 37&#xb0; C. were added. The formation of product over time was measured immediately on a spectrophotometer at 405 nm after shaking the microtiter plate. Product formation is expressed as mUOD/min.

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Example <b>4</b>: Secondary screen: Evaluation of loss of antigenicity towards human FVIII inhibitory antibodies</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The secondary screen correlates to an assay similar to the Bethesda assay, carried out as described below on the <b>158</b> mutants selected following the primary screening; said assay comprises a step of contacting a inhibitory serum (or antibody) with a FVIII molecule to be tested or a reference standard and a step of measuring FVIII coagulant activity by chronometric assay.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Culture supernatants obtained after <b>48</b> h of contact with COS cells transfected by different FVIII constructs were used. Said supernatants were produced in complete medium [(IMDM, Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin]. Supernatants were diluted in fresh complete medium to obtain a final chronometric activity comprised in the range of about 10-20% (1 FVIII unit =100% activity =200 ng/ml). The culture supernatant diluted or not (140 &#x3bc;l) was added to 150 &#x3bc;l of FVIII-depleted human plasma (Stago, Asnieres, France). An antibody dilution (10 &#x3bc;l) was then added to the mix. These antibodies are IgG fractions purified on protein A- from hemophiliac patients with inhibitors. An IgG fraction from a non-hemophiliac control was similarly obtained. Bethesda inhibitor titers were identical to the inhibitory activity from the plasma. The purification protocol therefore did not affect the inhibitory activity of the antibodies. The antibodies were first diluted in fresh complete medium, the measurement being carried out either with a fixed antibody dilution or with serial dilutions. The fixed antibody concentration which was used was that which produced 50% inhibition of a recombinant FVIII standard solution with 12.5% activity. Samples were incubated in a 37&#xb0; C. water-bath for 1h30. Coagulant activity was then determined on a MDA-II apparatus (BioM&#xe9;rieux, Marcy-l&#x2032;Etoile) and compared to that of a standard curve established from an identical FVIII stably produced in the CHO cell line. Results are expressed as a percentage which represents the abolition to inhibition of coagulant activity of a given mutant by inhibitory antibodies from a patient's serum. Said percentage was calculated as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> for the FVIII mutant E<b>518</b>A. Abolition to inhibition expressed is a percentage =&#x2212;[(b&#x2212;a)/a] x 100;where &#x201c;a&#x201d; is the percentage residual activity of the WT (serum + IgG / serum&#x2014;IgG) and &#x201c;b&#x201d; is the percentage residual activity of the mutant (serum + IgG/serum &#x2212;IgG).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-18</figref> show for 30 single mutants the percentages of abolition to inhibition for sera from five hemophiliac patients. Said mutants were selected in the secondary screen of the 158 mutants selected in the primary screen. Several mutants show a high percentage of abolition to inhibition with certain sera, such as mutant <b>2316</b> for sera TD and SL, mutant <b>2294</b> for serum GC, mutant <b>403</b> for serum FS and mutant <b>2275</b> for serum PR.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Patients' sera were selected for their high Bethesda titers (greater than 10 BU) and their different inhibitor profiles. These patients can no longer be treated with FVIII injections and need bypassing agents. Thus, obtaining FVIII Alanine mutants which abolish, even partially, the inhibition of FVIII activity by the inhibitory antibodies of one of these patients, is a major step forward to the future approaches of treating hemophiliac patients with inhibitors. The different data obtained on a large number of mutants as well as the different sera tested will make it possible to create combinations of mutations leading to an improved FVIII which can avoid a majority of inhibitory antibodies while retaining its procoagulant activity.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The reproducibility of FVIII expression level related to transfections was controlled by following the specific activity of wild-type FVIII. Indeed, specific activities calculated from antigen determinations (Stago commercial ELISA kit) were identical for wild-type FVIIIs produced in different transfections. Likewise, antigen concentrations were determined for mutants having retained at least <b>50</b>% of wild-type FVIII activity and their specific activity was determinate throw. Specific activity corresponds to raw activity measured in the chromogenic assay (mUOD/min) relative to protein concentration (ng/ml) obtained with an ELISA kit (Stago FVIII kit). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows comparative data of raw and specific activities of <b>30</b> mutants selected in the secondary screen.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The eight FVIII Alanine mutants <b>2175</b>, <b>2199</b>, <b>2200</b>, <b>2215</b>, <b>2251</b>, <b>2252</b>, <b>2278</b> and <b>2316</b> displayed a far above average capacity to be secreted in the COS cell production medium used in the scope of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts the data obtained for these eight mutants. Raw coagulant activity of these mutants was determined by chromogenic assay. Their concentration was approximately two to four times higher than that of wild-type FVIII. This property is interesting for producing recombinant FVIII and might make it possible to lower production costs of a new generation FVIII. Also, it might be advantageous in a gene therapy for hemophiliac patients. Moreover, these mutations which confer a greater capacity to be secreted may be of major interest in combination with mutations conferring abolition to inhibition by inhibitory antibodies, by allowing, for example, to compensate an optional relative loss of secretion of said less antigenic mutants.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The 15 mutants <b>2177</b>, <b>2183</b>, <b>2186</b>, <b>2191</b>, <b>2196</b>, <b>2204</b>, <b>2205</b>, <b>2206</b>, <b>2213</b>, <b>2217</b>, <b>2235</b>, <b>2258</b>, <b>2264</b>, <b>2268</b> and <b>2269</b> displayed far higher specific activity than wild-type FVIII, while maintaining a high production level, around to that of wild-type FVIII (concentration greater than 10 ng/ml). The specific activities of these 15mutants are given in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Raw coagulant activity of these mutants was determined by chromogenic assay. This property is interesting because it would allow smaller or less frequent doses of FVIII to be injected in patients. Moreover, these mutations which confer a higher specific activity might be of major interest in combination with mutations conferring abolition to inhibition by inhibitory antibodies, by allowing to compensate an optional relative loss of activity of said less antigenic mutants.</p>

<p id="p-0097" num="0099">The eight selected mutants were mutants <b>409</b>, <b>462</b>, <b>507</b> and <b>629</b> in the A<b>2</b> domain and mutants <b>2289</b>, <b>2294</b>, <b>2312</b> and <b>2316</b> in the C<b>2</b> domain.

<p id="p-0106" num="0108">The present invention provides a solution to resolve a serious complication that occurs in 30% of hemophilia A patients treated with recombinant FVIII: the development of an immune response induced by the treatment and directed against the exogenous recombinant FVIII. The solution provided consists in generating recombinant human FVIII molecules having decreased antigenicity of the epitopes usually recognized by inhibitory antibodies.

<p id="p-0108" num="0110">Lastly, the present invention provides with FVIII variants having a greater capacity to be secreted, which is interesting for the production of recombinant FVIII and in a potential gene therapy.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0111">The different properties conferred by the mutations in these variants may be of major interest in combination. In a non-limiting example, mutations which confer a specific activity improvement of a variant could compensate an optional relative loss of activity in variants whose mutations confer an abolition to inhibition by inhibitory antibodies and being therefore less antigenic. In another non-limiting example, mutations which confer a higher capacity to be secreted may be interesting in combination with mutations conferring an abolition to inhibition by inhibitory antibodies, by allowing, for example, to compensate an optional relative loss of secretion of said less antigenic mutants.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0112">In the present document, the following terminology is used to designate a substitution: S409A indicates the substitution of the serine residue at position 409 of SEQ ID No. 3 by an alanine. Substitution refers to the replacement of an amino acid residue by another one selected from the other 19 amino acids or by a non-naturally occurring amino acid. The terms &#x201c;substitution&#x201d; and &#x201c;mutation&#x201d; are interchangeable. The sign &#x201c;+&#x201d; indicates a combination of substitutions.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0113">&#x201c;Comprise&#x201d; means that the variant or the fragment thereof has one or more substitutions such as indicated with reference to SEQ ID No. 3, but that the variant or the fragment thereof may have other modifications, particularly substitutions, deletions or insertions.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0114">&#x201c;Consists of&#x201d; means that the variant or the fragment thereof contains only the substitution(s) indicated with reference to SEQ ID No. 3.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0115">&#x201c;Variant&#x201d; refers in particular to a polypeptide which differs from a polypeptide represented by sequence SEQ ID No. 3 by at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15 residue(s), preferably by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 residues.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0116">Amino acids of the A2, A3 or C2 domains of FVIII were systematically substituted by an Alanine. The production of these human FVIII mutants was carried out in mammalian cells. The primary screening of these variants was based on their procoagulant activity. The raw activity of each mutant was measured by chromogenic assay and compared with chromogenic assay of non-mutated human FVIII as reference. The activity of the FVIII variants can be determined by any method known to one skilled in the art, preferably according to method described in example 3 herein after. The FVIII variants selected as being the most active in the primary screen were then assessed for a second feature: loss of antigenicity towards sera from hemophiliac patients selected for their capacity to inhibit FVIII activity. Said secondary screening with said antibodies corresponds to a modified Bethesda assay. The antigenicity modification of the FVIII variants can be determined by any method known to one skilled in the art, preferably according to the method described in example 4 below.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0117">Improved variants could be selected. Not only did some of these candidate medicaments retain a coagulant activity, but they also partially avoided inhibition by inhibitory antibodies from the sera of selected hemophiliac patients. These FVIIIs have lost one or more epitopes usually recognized by inhibitory antibodies from patients' sera. Furthermore, the candidate medicaments had a specific coagulant activity higher to that of wild-type FVIII.

<p id="p-0130" num="0132">The broad production of mutants having retained at least 50% of FVIII activity also makes it possible to encompass their use in the context of analyzing additional functions of the protein. In addition to a modulation of its immunogenicity, secretion and specific activity, the following FVIII properties might be improved by using the mutants molecules described: &#x2014;binding to von Willebrand factor and therefore improved half-life of FVIII or circulating FVIIIa; &#x2014;improved intrinsic stability of the molecule by stabilization of the A2 domain and therefore increase of its efficiency period; &#x2014;binding to phospholipids derived from blood platelets, cell surfaces or circulating microparticles and therefore improved generation of FXa; &#x2014;binding to FIXa and FX and therefore improved formation of FXa; &#x2014;decreased binding of FVIII or FVIIIa to the molecules responsible of its catabolism such as for example low density Lipoprotein Receptor-related Protein (LRP), Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor (LDLR), Very Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor (VLDLR), megaline or any other receptor which might be identified and therefore improvement of the circulating FVIII half-life of; &#x2014;decreased proteolysis of FVIII or FVIIIa by vascular proteases such as for example activated protein C, FXa, FIXa, and therefore increased of its efficiency period.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0133">Preferably, the biologically active FVIII derivative is a FVIII consisting in a whole or partial deletion of the B domain. The human FVIII variant of the present invention is not a hybrid FVIII. It does not contain a substitution of the A2 or C2 domain or of a segment of at least 15 consecutive amino acids thereof by a FVIII domain of another species. In particular, segments of the A2 domain 373-540, 373-508, 445-508, 484-508, 404-508, 489-508 and/or 484-489 are not substituted by those of another species. In a particular embodiment, the polypeptide sequence of the variant differs from that of human FVIII such as described in SEQ ID No. 3 by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15 substitutions, preferably by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 substitutions, without including an optional deletion or truncation. In a particular embodiment, the variant comprises a single substitution. In another particular embodiment, the variant comprises a combination of 1 to 8 substitutions selected from a group according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0134">&#x201c;Inhibitory antibodies&#x201d; or &#x201c;inhibitors&#x201d; refers to any antibody which recognizes or binds to FVIII and inhibits the biological activity thereof, in particular the procoagulant activity thereof. In particular, said antibodies can preferably recognize i) the C2 domain of the light chain (2181-2321); ii) the A2 domain of the heavy chain (484-509); or iii) the A3 domain (1694-2019). Examples of commercially available inhibitory antibodies comprise ESH-8 (strong inhibitor; recognized the region 2248/2285; 6300 BU/mg; anti-C2; America Diagnostica), GMA-8015 (anti-A2; Green Mountain), anti-C2 ESH-4 antibody (strong inhibitor; region 2303/2332; America Diagnostica), anti-C2 Bo2C11 antibody (Jacquemin et al., 1998, Blood, 92(2):496-506).</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0135">&#x201c;Patients with inhibitors&#x201d; are patients who have FVIII inhibitory antibodies in their serum. The recognition profile of said antibodies differs from a patient to another. An improved FVIII according to the present invention is a FVIII which at least partially avoids one or more types of inhibitory antibodies.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0136">&#x201c;Biologically active derivative of FVIII&#x201d; refers to any protein or peptide derived from human FVIII which retains a procoagulant activity of FVIII. For example, such biologically active FVIII derivative may be a FVIII whose B domain (741-1648) has been partially or totally deleted (Toole et al., 1986, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 83 (16):5939-5942; Pittman, 1993, Blood, 81:2925-2935; Eaton et al., 1986, Biochemistry, 25 (26):8343-8347; Langer et al., 1988, Behring Inst. Mitt, 82:16-25; Meulien et al., 1988, Protein Eng, 2(4):301-6; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,868,112). Moreover, this term also refers to FVIII mutants with a stabilized A2 domain (WO 97/40145), FVIII mutants allowing a higher expression (Swaroop et al., 1997, JBC, 272:24121-24124), FVIII mutants having decreased antigenicity (Lollar, 1999, Thromb. Haemost. 82:505-508), a FVIII reconstituted from separately expressed light and heavy chains (Oh et al., 1999, Exp. Mol. Med. 31:95-100), FVIII mutants displaying decreased binding to FVIII catabolic associated receptors such as HSPG (heparan sulfate proteoglycans) and LRP (low density lipoprotein receptor related protein) (Ananyeva et al., 2001, TCM, 11:251-257), FVIII mutants displaying an improved specific activity (US2004/0249134). Also considered are FVIII variants in which FVIII segments are replaced by the corresponding segments of factor V (Marquette et al., 1995, JBC, 270:10297-10303, Oertel et al., 1996, Thromb. Haemost., 75:36-44). Moreover, said term refers to any FVIII comprising one or more substitutions, deletions or insertions. For example, it comprises the variants described in the introduction of the present application, in particular those comprising point mutations. In particular, it comprises a FVIII less susceptible to cleavage by APC (activated protein C) comprising mutations of Arginines 336 and 562 and in the region comprised between the positions 2001-2020, as described in application WO 2006/027111. It further comprises a stabilized FVIII mutant in which one or more Cysteines have been introduced so as to create one or more disulfide bonds, for example between the A2 and A3 domains (WO02103024; Gale et Pellequer, 2003, J Thromb Haemost, 1(9):1966-71). Patents JP2005112855 and RU2244556/RU2253475 respectively provide biologically stable and albumin-free compositions, allowing the stabilization of FVIII alone or in association with vWF. This term also refers to any FVIII having been modified by conjugation of a functional group, for example PEGylation, glycosylation (for example US2005009148, US2003077752, etc.). Furthermore, the variant can comprise peptide bonds modified in order to resist to hydrolysis.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0137">In particular, the variant has a decreased antigenicity towards inhibitory antibodies as compared to natural human FVIII and retains a procoagulant activity at least equal to 50% that of natural human FVIII. For example, one suitable assay is the one or two-stage clotting assay described in Rizza et al. (Rizza et al., 1982, Coagulation assay of Factor VIIIa and FIXa in Bloom ed. The Hemophilias. NY Churchchill Livingston 1992). In a preferred embodiment, the variant retains a procoagulant activity equal to that of natural human FVIII. In a more preferred embodiment, the variant has a procoagulant activity higher than that of natural human FVIII.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0138">The procoagulant activity of FVIII is determined by any method known to one skilled in the art. Preferably, said procoagulant activity is determined by chronometric assay or by chromogenic assay. Even more preferably, FVIII activity is determined by chronometric assay, for example as described by Von Clauss (A. Acta Haematologica, 1957, 17:237) or by chronometric assay such as described by Rosen (Scand. J. Haematol. 1984, 33 (Suppl 40):139-145).</p>

<p id="p-0141" num="0143">The coding sequence for FVIII according to the present invention can comprise or not comprise the signal peptide. In the case where coding sequence does not comprise signal peptide, a methionine can optionally be added at the N-terminal end. Alternatively, a heterologous signal peptide can be introduced. Said heterologous signal peptide can be derived from a prokaryote such as <i>E. coli </i>or from a eukaryote, in particular from a mammalian, insect or yeast cell. Moreover, the nucleotide sequence can also comprise intron segments, particularly heterologous introns. Said intron segments can enable improved expression of the FVIII variant. Such constructs are described in application WO 2005/040213.

<p id="p-0142" num="0144">The present invention relates to the use of a nucleic acid, an expression cassette or a vector according to the invention in order to transform or transfect a cell. The invention relates to a host cell comprising a nucleic acid, an expression cassette or a vector coding for a human FVIII variant and the use thereof to produce a recombinant human FVIII variant according to the invention. In a particular embodiment, the cell is non-human and non-embryonic. The invention also relates to a method for producing a recombinant human FVIII variant according to the invention comprising transforming or transfecting a cell by a nucleic acid, an expression cassette or a vector according to the invention; culturing the transformed/transfected cell; and collecting the human FVIII variant produced by the cell. In an alternative embodiment, the method for producing a recombinant human FVIII variant according to the invention comprises providing a cell comprising a nucleic acid, an expression cassette or a vector according to the invention; culturing the transfected/transformed cell; and collecting the human FVIII variant produced by the cell. In particular, the cell can be transformed/transfected in a transient or stable manner by the nucleic acid coding for the variant. Said nucleic acid can be contained in the cell in an episome form of or in chromosomal form. Method for producing recombinant proteins are well known to one skilled in the art. For example, one can mention the specific method described in WO0170968 for a production in an immortalized human cell line, WO2005/123928 for production in a plant, US2005/229261 for production in the milk of a transgenic animal, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0145">The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising human FVIII variants according to the invention, and to the use of said FVIII variants for preparing a medicament for the treatment of hemophilia A. Preferably, the hemophilia A is severe and moderate. Said treatment can be curative or preventive. In a particular embodiment, the treated patients are patients with inhibitors.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0146">Thus, the FVIII variants according to the invention can be used in two major categories of hemophiliac patients: those who have developed FVIII inhibitory antibodies, thanks to their capacity to avoid said inhibitory antibodies, and those who have not yet developed such inhibitors, thanks to their lower risk of inducing the development of inhibitory antibodies as compared to the molecules currently used. Said FVIII variants will be usable by all patients with hemophilia A.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0147">The present invention therefore relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a FVIII variant according to the invention. The pharmaceutical composition can further comprise compounds for stabilizing the mutant FVIII, for example serum albumin, vWF (von Willebrand factor) or a fragment thereof comprising the FVIII binding site, vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors, and polysaccharides such as sucrose. The present invention can also relate to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a nucleic acid coding for a FVIII mutant according to the invention, a vector or a host cell according to the invention. Such composition might be useful in the context of a gene therapy. The pharmaceutical composition can further comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier. Such excipients and carriers are well known to one skilled in the art [Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th edition, A. R. Gennaro, Ed., Mack Publishing Company (1990); Pharmaceutical Formulation Development of Peptides and Proteins, S. Frokjaer and L. Hovgaard, Eds., Taylor &#x26; Francis (2000); and Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 3rd edition, A.

<p id="p-0147" num="0149">The human FVIII variants of the invention can be used as replacement therapy in case of severe and moderate hemophilia A. The possibility of a continuously use with a lower risk of developing inhibitory antibodies is a major advantage over the different existing recombinant human or hybrid FVIIIs.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0150">Said improved human FVIII variants are preferably intended for treating patients who have already developed inhibitors, but also for preventive treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0151">In addition, systematic administration of said FVIII might be encompass for a prophylactic treatment in any patient with hemophilia A. One might therefore imagine decreasing the risks of bleeding, for example during surgical procedures, or else preventing the development of inhibitors. The administration of said FVIII might also be considered in the case of an emergency treatment, for example during an accidental, pathological hemorrhage or caused by a surgical procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0152">The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are suitable for oral, sublingual, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, topical, local, intratracheal, intranasal, transdermal, rectal, intraocular, intra-auricular administration, said active ingredient being able to be administered as a unit dose. Preferably, the pharmaceutical compositions are suitable for intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular administration.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0153">The dosages of the treatment can differ according to the severity of FVIII deficiency. Usually, the dosage is adjusted for frequency, period and units related to the severity and length of the bleeding episodes of the considered patient. FVIII is dosed so as to arrest bleeding, for example with standard clotting assays. An efficient dose of FVIII variant according to the invention can comprise, but is not limited to, between about 5 to 50 units per kg of body weight, preferably between 10 to 50, even more preferably between 20 to 40. The dosing frequency can be for example every 8 to 24 hours. The treatment duration can be for example from 1 to 10 days, or until bleeding stops. [See for example: Roberts, H. R., and M. R. Jones, &#x201c;Hemophilia and Related Conditions&#x2014;Congenital Deficiencies of Prothrombin (Factor II, Factor V, and Factors VII to XII), &#x201c;Ch. 153, 1453-1474,1460, in Hematology, Williams, W. J. et al., ed. (1990)].</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0154">The treatment can be in the form of a single intravenous injection or periodic or continuous administration over an extended period of time, as necessary. The treatment can also be administered by the subcutaneous or oral route with liposomes in one or more doses at different time intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0155">The present invention relates to the use of a human FVIII variant or a biologically active derivative thereof according to the invention for preparing a medicament for the treatment of coagulation disorders, in particular hemophilia A. The treatment can be curative or preventive. In a particular embodiment, the patient to be treated is a patient with inhibitors. The present invention also relates to a method for treating hemophilia A comprising administering a human FVIII variant or a biologically active derivative thereof according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0156">The present invention further relates to the use of a nucleic acid coding for a FVIII variant according to the invention for preparing a medicament for the treatment of coagulation disorders, in particular hemophilia A.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0157">The FVIII variant of the invention can also be combined with another active compound. For example, the present invention also relates to the use of a FVIII variant according to the invention in combination with factor IXa for treating coagulation disorders, and in particular hemophilia A or B. Said combination is described in WO2004/103397.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0158">The present invention further relates to the use of one or more human FVIII variants or a biologically active derivative thereof according to the invention for the diagnosis of inhibitor type in a patient with hemophilia A. In particular, the presence of inhibitory antibodies is assayed in serum samples or biological fluids (lymph, urine, etc.). Detection of inhibitory antibodies can be carried out by ELISA, immunodetection by electrophoretic blotting, radioimmunoassay, and FVIII activity assays (for example, clotting assay).</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0159">In fact, inventors have identified in wild-type human FVIII the positions specifically recognized by the inhibitors. Said positions can be used individually, combined within a same domain, or combined between the A2 and C2 domains, so as to reveal the type(s) of inhibitory antibodies present in a hemophiliac. In fact, the need to diagnose inhibitory antibodies is crucial. The titration of said inhibitors is a prerequisite prior to any replacement therapy. The inventors therefore propose to use of the present findings to diagnose inhibitory antibodies. A Bethesda assay (assay of inhibitor titer) in a hemophiliac patient can be carried out before and after passage on ELISA where the capture antigen corresponds to the FVIII variants of the present invention taken separately or combined. The inhibitor titer will significantly decrease for the control carried out with wild-type FVIII. The variant or variants combination for which the inhibitor titer remains unchanged is used as treatment for the hemophiliac patient with inhibitors. This diagnosis therefore renders possible to control and target the delivery of the human FVIII variant according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0160">Thus, the present invention relates to a method for treatment comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0161">a recognition test of inhibitory antibodies contained in a serum sample of patient on one or more FVIII variants according to the invention;</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0162">selection of the FVIII mutant or mutants which are not recognized by said inhibitory antibodies; and</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0163">administration of one or more FVIII mutants selected from b).</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0164">In a preferred manner, the recognition test between the patient's sample and the FVIII variant(s) according to the invention is carried out by a Bethesda assay. As a control, a recognition test is preferably carried out on wild-type FVIII.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0165">The present invention relates to a diagnostic kit comprising one or more FVIII variants according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0166">The present invention also relates to the use of one or more human FVIII variants or a biologically active derivative thereof according to the invention for preparing a medicament for the treatment of hemophilia A in patients with inhibitors whose serum does not contain antibodies recognizing said human FVIII variant(s) or a biologically active derivative thereof.</p>

<p id="p-0166" num="0168">FVIII complementary DNA containing two truncated introns of factor IX at position 1 and 13 (5012 bp) (SEQ ID No. 4) was cloned between the NotI and Xho1 restriction sites in a vector (pcDNA3.1 GS, Invitrogen) allowing expression of the protein in mammalian cells. The pcDNA/FVIII construct corresponded to a 10,439 bp plasmid. This gene comprises the five functional domains A1, A2, A3, C1 and C2 essential for FVIII activity. As it has previously been shown that the B domain does not play any predominant role in the procoagulant function of FVIII, the inventors chose to produce FVIII with a deletion of this domain. The regions coding for the A1 and A2 domains each contain an intron. Insertion of these two intron regions among the coding exons significantly improves the expression of human FVIII. The protein sequence encoded by this gene is given in SEQ ID No. 5.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0169">The mutagenesis strategy consisted in systematically generating all the single Alanine mutants in the targeted domains of FVIII, i.e., A2, A3 and C2. Said mutants were generated by the Massive Mutagenesis&#xae; method described in US2004/0048268.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0170">As mentioned earlier, it has been shown that domains A2, C2 and A3 are the preferential targets of FVIII recognition by inhibitory antibodies. Each amino acid in these functional domains was substituted by an Alanine, apart from the intron segment of the A2 domain. A series of 795 oligonucleotides (32-mers) was designed and produced so as to introduce an Alanine mutation at positions i) 376 to 719 [A2]; ii) 2173 to 2325 [C2]; iii) 1691 to 2025 [A3]. The numbering system for the mutations of human FVIII used in the invention is that defined by Wood et al. (Nature, 1984, 312:330-337). After site-directed mutagenesis, the inventors performed two successive sequencings to check that each mutant of the library contained the Alanine mutation at the considered position. This collection of Alanine mutants in the C2, A2 and A3 domains of FVIII is the first comprehensive site-directed mutants library ever carried out for this molecule.</p>

<p id="p-0170" num="0172">In order to transfect COS-7 cells with the native or mutated pcDNA/FVIII constructs, said cells were trypsinized when they reached 90% confluence. The COS-7 cells were reseeded at a 1/4 ratio (that is, in order to obtain approximately 25% confluence once they adhered to the surface). Transient transfection of COS-7 cells was carried out in 90 mm culture plates (6 ml per well) when cells reached 70-80% confluence. Transfection was carried out with approximately 6 &#x3bc;g DNA for a volume of 18 &#x3bc;l FuGENE-6 (Roche, Meylan, France).</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0173">Prior to transfection, FuGENE-6 was diluted in serum-free IMDM medium and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The FuGENE-6/DNA mixture was left at room temperature for 15 min then deposited dropwise on the cells in complete medium. A first supernatant containing FVIII was collected 24 h after transfection; 6 ml of fresh medium were then placed on the cells. The culture supernatant was collected 48 h later (6 ml), aliquoted and stored at &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. pending the clotting assay (chromogenic). The mean level of expression of wild-type FVIII was estimated by ELISA (Stago commercial ELISA kit) and was comprised between 20 and 60 ng/ml.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0174">All cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. COS-7 cells (African green monkey SV40 transformed kidney cells) were grown in standard culture conditions (37&#xb0; C. in a humid 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere) using Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM). IMDM was supplemented with an L-glutamine analog (glutamax), decomplemented fetal calf serum (10% final concentration) and antibiotics (penicillin 40 U/ml and streptomycin 0.1 mg/ml).</p>

<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Primary Screen: Functional Analysis of Human FVIII Alanine Mutants</heading>
<p id="p-0173" num="0175">The primary screen correlates to raw coagulant activity determination (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) obtained in a same volume of COS-7 cell culture supernatant. Two different assays of clotting activity determination were used in the primary screen, the chronometric assay and the chromogenic assay.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0176">Chronometric activity was measured following incubation of a dilution of the FVIII molecules to be tested in imidazole buffer in the presence of FVIII-deficient plasma (Stago). Clotting was initiated by addition of calcium and the time to clot formation was determined on a MDA-II apparatus (BioM&#xe9;rieux, Marcy-I'Etoile). The coagulant activity of the 795 Alanine mutants was measured by chronometric assay on a robotic platform of the National Hemophilia Treatment Center (Hospices Civils de Lyon). The chronometric activity of all the Alanine mutants was compared to the activity of a wild-type FVIII used as internal standard for each transfection. Results of these determinations of raw activity relative to that of non-mutated FVIII distinguished two categories of mutants: I) mutants having retained at least 50% of wild-type FVIII activity; ii) mutants having less than 50% of wild-type FVIII activity. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the coagulant activity of 359 over 795 Alanine mutants analyzed. These data represent a functional mapping of each of these FVIII residues for coagulant activity; a coagulant activity suppressed by an Alanine mutation indicates that the considered residue is essential for FVIII coagulant activity.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0177">158 mutants having retained more than 50% of raw non-mutated FVIII activity were selected by this chronometric assay for secondary screen. Their activities were first confirmed by the second clotting assay, the chromogenic assay mentioned above. This assay was also performed on the robotic platform of the National Hemophilia Treatment Center (Hospices Civils de Lyon). The chromogenic activity of the 158 selected Alanine mutants was carried out with the Coamatic Factor VIII kit (Chromogenix, Instrumentation Laboratory, Milan, Italy) according to the supplier's instructions. Briefly, culture supernatants (50 &#x3bc;l) were diluted in the dilution buffer provided and preincubated at 37&#xb0; C. for 4 min. The reaction medium (50 &#x3bc;l), preheated at 37&#xb0; C., was then added for 4 min, after which 50 &#x3bc;l of development medium at 37&#xb0; C. were added. The formation of product over time was measured immediately on a spectrophotometer at 405 nm after shaking the microtiter plate. Product formation is expressed as mUOD/min. When values were greater than 200 mUOD/min, the assay was repeated using a higher dilution.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0178">Table 1 shows the activities of the 158 mutants which retained more than 50% of non-mutated FVIII activity. Said 158 mutants were selected for the secondary screening.</p>

<heading id="h-0015" level="1">Secondary Screen: Evaluation of Loss of Antigenicity Towards Human FVIII Inhibitory Antibodies</heading>
<p id="p-0177" num="0179">The secondary screen correlates to an assay similar to the Bethesda assay, carried out as described below on the 158 mutants selected following the primary screening; said assay comprises a step of contacting a inhibitory serum (or antibody) with a FVIII molecule to be tested or a reference standard and a step of measuring FVIII coagulant activity by chronometric assay.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0180">Culture supernatants obtained after 48 h of contact with COS cells transfected by different FVIII constructs were used. Said supernatants were produced in complete medium [(IMDM, Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin]. Supernatants were diluted in fresh complete medium to obtain a final chronometric activity comprised in the range of about 10-20% (1 FVIII unit=100% activity=200 ng/ml). The culture supernatant diluted or not (140 &#x3bc;l) was added to 150 &#x3bc;l of FVIII-depleted human plasma (Stago, Asni&#xe8;res, France). An antibody dilution (10 &#x3bc;l) was then added to the mix. These antibodies are IgG fractions purified on protein A&#x2014;from hemophiliac patients with inhibitors. An IgG fraction from a non-hemophiliac control was similarly obtained. Bethesda inhibitor titers were identical to the inhibitory activity from the plasma. The purification protocol therefore did not affect the inhibitory activity of the antibodies. The antibodies were first diluted in fresh complete medium, the measurement being carried out either with a fixed antibody dilution or with serial dilutions. The fixed antibody concentration which was used was that which produced 50% inhibition of a recombinant FVIII standard solution with 12.5% activity. Samples were incubated in a 37&#xb0; C. water-bath for 1 h 30. Coagulant activity was then determined on a MDA-II apparatus (BioM&#xe9;rieux, Marcy-I'Etoile) and compared to that of a standard curve established from an identical FVIII stably produced in the CHO cell line. Results are expressed as a percentage which represents the abolition to inhibition of coagulant activity of a given mutant by inhibitory antibodies from a patient's serum. Said percentage was calculated as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> for the FVIII mutant E518A. Abolition to inhibition expressed is a percentage=&#x2212;[(b&#x2212;a)/a]&#xd7;100; where &#x201c;a&#x201d; is the percentage residual activity of the WT (serum+IgG/serum&#x2212;IgG) and &#x201c;b&#x201d; is the percentage residual activity of the mutant (serum+IgG/serum&#x2212;IgG).</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0181">Table 2 shows for 30 single mutants the percentages of abolition to inhibition for sera from five hemophiliac patients. Said mutants were selected in the secondary screen of the 158 mutants selected in the primary screen. Several mutants show a high percentage of abolition to inhibition with certain sera, such as mutant 2316 for sera TD and SL, mutant 2294 for serum GC, mutant 403 for serum FS and mutant 2275 for serum PR.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0182">Patients' sera were selected for their high Bethesda titers (greater than 10 BU) and their different inhibitor profiles. These patients can no longer be treated with FVIII injections and need bypassing agents. Thus, obtaining FVIII Alanine mutants which abolish, even partially, the inhibition of FVIII activity by the inhibitory antibodies of one of these patients, is a major step forward to the future approaches of treating hemophiliac patients with inhibitors. The different data obtained on a large number of mutants as well as the different sera tested will make it possible to create combinations of mutations leading to an improved FVIII which can avoid a majority of inhibitory antibodies while retaining its procoagulant activity.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0183">The reproducibility of FVIII expression level related to transfections was controlled by following the specific activity of wild-type FVIII. Indeed, specific activities calculated from antigen determinations (Stago commercial ELISA kit) were identical for wild-type FVIIIs produced in different transfections. Likewise, antigen concentrations were determined for mutants having retained at least 50% of wild-type FVIII activity and their specific activity was determinate throw. Specific activity corresponds to raw activity measured in the chromogenic assay (mUOD/min) relative to protein concentration (ng/ml) obtained with an ELISA kit (Stago FVIII kit). Table 3 shows comparative data of raw and specific activities of 30 mutants selected in the secondary screen.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0184">The eight FVIII Alanine mutants 2175, 2199, 2200, 2215, 2251, 2252, 2278 and 2316 displayed a far above average capacity to be secreted in the COS cell production medium used in the scope of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts the data obtained for these eight mutants. Raw coagulant activity of these mutants was determined by chromogenic assay. Their concentration was approximately two to four times higher than that of wild-type FVIII. This property is interesting for producing recombinant FVIII and might make it possible to lower production costs of a new generation FVIII. Also, it might be advantageous in a gene therapy for hemophiliac patients. Moreover, these mutations which confer a greater capacity to be secreted may be of major interest in combination with mutations conferring abolition to inhibition by inhibitory antibodies, by allowing, for example, to compensate an optional relative loss of secretion of said less antigenic mutants.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0185">The 15 mutants 2177, 2183, 2186, 2191, 2196, 2204, 2205, 2206, 2213, 2217, 2235, 2258, 2264, 2268 and 2269 displayed far higher specific activity than wild-type FVIII, while maintaining a high production level, around to that of wild-type FVIII (concentration greater than 10 ng/ml). The specific activities of these 15 mutants are given in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Raw coagulant activity of these mutants was determined by chromogenic assay. This property is interesting because it would allow smaller or less frequent doses of FVIII to be injected in patients. Moreover, these mutations which confer a higher specific activity might be of major interest in combination with mutations conferring abolition to inhibition by inhibitory antibodies, by allowing to compensate an optional relative loss of activity of said less antigenic mutants.</p>

<heading id="h-0017" level="1">Selection and Combination of the Best Single Mutants Selected in the Secondary Screen</heading>
<p id="p-0184" num="0186">Among the 30 single mutants selected in the secondary screen, eight were chosen in order to combine their respective mutations, to obtain a cumulative/additive effect of remarkable properties of each. The selection criteria for these mutants were complex and considered the following parameters:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0187">at least 25% abolition to inhibition for at least one of the test sera from hemophiliac patients with inhibitors;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0188">raw coagulant activity at least 100% relative to non-mutated FVIII; and</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0189">reproducibly good level of expression.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0190">The eight selected mutants were mutants 409, 462, 507 and 629 in the A2 domain and mutants 2289, 2294, 2312 and 2316 in the C2 domain. As noted earlier, the selection criterion considered of a high specific activity (coagulant activity relative to expression level), as shown in Table 3. This specific activity level had to be constant in the different experiments.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0191">The 28 double mutants resulting from the combination of the eight single mutations 409, 462, 507, 629, 2289, 2294, 2312 and 2316 (six A2 double mutants+six C2 double mutants+sixteen A2-C2 double mutants presented in Table 4) were constructed by mutagenesis methods known to one skilled in the art. These mutants were transiently expressed in COS-7 mammalian cells as described in Example 2. Their expression level and their activity level were determined as described in the previous examples, respectively by ELISA and chromogenic assay (mUOD/min). These 28 mutants were then assessed for their abolition to inhibition by antibodies from hemophiliac patients. The A2 double mutants displayed a significant abolition to inhibition for one or all of the antibodies from the patients' sera, whereas the combinations containing C2 domain mutations (six C2 double mutants+sixteen A2-C2 double mutants) displayed an insignificant or null abolition to inhibition.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0192">Table 5 shows the specific activities of the six A2 double mutants and their percentage of abolition to inhibition by sera from four hemophiliac patients TD, GC, SL and PR calculated as in Example 4. Especially preferred double mutants significantly abolished antibodies from a minimum of three over the four patients. This illustrates the cumulative effect of the four single mutations in the A2 domain. The choice was therefore based on the combination of the four mutations 409, 507, 462 and 629. Triple mutants and the quadruple mutant comprising these four mutations 409, 507, 462 and 629 were also constructed.</p>
<heading id="h-0018" level="1">Example 6</heading>
<heading id="h-0019" level="1">Construction and Characterization of a Quadruple Mutant (FVIII-4A2)</heading>
<p id="p-0188" num="0193">The quadruple mutant derived from the combination of the four selected A2 mutations 409, 462, 507, 629 was constructed by a classical mutagenesis method known to one skilled in the art. The quadruple mutant was produced in a CHO cell line obtained as described in Example 9. This mutant was also characterized for its abolition to inhibition by antibodies from five hemophiliac patients FS, TD, GC, PR and SL. Residual activity determined after incubation with an inhibitory antibody is divided by residual activity remaining after incubation with a non-immune antibody. The percentage of residual activity was thus determined and is presented in the graphs of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. These graphs illustrate the residual activity of FVIII-4A2 after contact with different dilutions of antibodies from the different patients with inhibitors. It clearly appears that the FVIII-4A2 mutant retained a much higher chronometric activity after incubation with the inhibitory antibodies. Accordingly, the increases in residual activity for the highest inhibitory antibodies concentrations ranged from 230 to 450%, said percentage of residual activity depending on both the source of the inhibitory antibody and the concentration used.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0194">To determine whether direct binding of the antibodies to FVIII-4A2 was modified, three additional antibodies were used instead of the patients' sera according to the same protocol as above: an anti-A2 domain antibody (GMA012, Green Mountain Antibodies), an anti-C2 domain antibody (ESH4, American Diagnostica) and a rabbit polyclonal antibody, purified from the same protocol used for the patients' antibodies. The results of these controls are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> for the two anti-A2 domain antibodies, the rabbit polyclonal antibody and GMA012. Clearly, the mutations in the A2 domain of FVIII-4A2 allowed FVIII-4A2 to avoid the anti-A2 domain antibody, GMA012 and the rabbit polyclonal antibody (shown). On the other hand, no significant differences in inhibition of FVIII-4A2 versus wild-type FVIII were seen for ESH4 (data not shown). These findings correlate the abolition to inhibition data, showing on one hand that introduction of mutations in the A2 domain allow to avoid patients' antibodies and on the other hand that the C2 domain of FVIII-4A2 is undamaged since recognition is similar to that of wild-type FVIII. This latter point is important for FVIII-4A2 activity because it is the C2 domain which is responsible for interactions with von Willebrand factor and with the cofactors required for full FVIII activity (calcium and phospholipid binding).</p>
<heading id="h-0020" level="1">Example 7</heading>
<heading id="h-0021" level="1">Characterization of the FVIII 4A2 Mutant</heading>
<p id="p-0190" num="0195">a) ELISA</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0196">FVIII-4A2 was produced in the same CHO cell line as wild-type FVIII according to the protocol described in Example 9. It was purified by the same protocol (also described in Example 9) and was therefore compared to FVIII in functional analyses. FVIII-4A2 concentrations were determined with an ELISA kit (see protocol below). Additional controls were performed using a panel of monoclonal antibodies to check that the introduced mutations did not alter the quantification of mutant FVIII with this kit. Thereby, it was shown that similar concentrations of wild-type FVIII and FVIII-4A2 were identically recognized by antibody ESH-4 directed against the light chain C2 domain. In agreement with the abolition to inhibition data, there was a large decrease in recognition of FVIII-4A2 by the GMA012 antibody in comparison with wild-type FVIII. These data are presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0197">The protocol of the ELISA assays for these experiments is described below:</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0198">Reagent was diluted at least five-fold in 50 mM CAPS pH 9.0 and incubated overnight at 4&#xb0; C. to coat the interest product on the support of the ELISA plate (Nunc Maxisorb). Wells were then washed twice with TBS-T buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.05% BSA), then blocked for 1 h with TBS-3% BSA (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.01% Tween-20, 3% BSA). Reagent binding with the one coated on the plate was then diluted in TBS-3% BSA, incubated at room temperature for 1 h 30, then washed three times in TBS-T. Primary and secondary antibodies conjugated to horse radish peroxidase (HRP) were diluted in TBS-3% and respectively added for 1 h 30 at room temperature. Secondary antibodies were diluted 2000-fold. Between two antibody incubations, plates were washed three times with TBS-T, then washed again before addition of the substrate, a mixture of OPD/urea (Sigma). The enzymatic reaction was stopped by adding 2.5M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Optical density was read at 490 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0199">b) Measurement of Specific Activity</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0200">Specific activity of the FVIII-4A2 mutant was determined by dividing chromogenic activity by concentration. These specific activities were compared with those of the wild-type. The chromogenic activity of wild-type FVIII was about 15&#xb1;1 ODU/min&#xb7;&#x3bc;g and that of FVIII-4A2 was about 27&#xb1;1 ODU/min&#xb7;&#x3bc;g, that is, a higher activity.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0201">c) Activation by Thrombin</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0202">Wild-type FVIII and FVIII-4A2 (0.125 U or 25 ng) were diluted in 40 mM HEPES buffer, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2 </sub>containing 10 &#x3bc;M of an 80:20 mixture of Phosphatidylcholine:Phosphatidylserine and 0.1 mg/ml BSA, then incubated at 37&#xb0; C. for 5 min. Thrombin (0.05 U) was added and its action determined at different time. At each time, an aliquot was removed and incubated with a mixture of hirudin (0.5 U), factor IXa (50 nM) and factor X (200 nM) diluted in the same buffer, in order to generate FXa. The FXa substrate pNAPEP-25 was immediately added and formation of the chromogenic product was measured at 405 nm. The initial rate was determined and the amount of FXa formed per minute was calculated.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0203">Wild-type FVIII and FVIII-4A2 displayed an identical thrombin response profile, with a rapid increase in FVIII activity, reaching the peak at 1-2 min after addition of thrombin, followed by a rapid decrease of said activity with a half-life of approximately 2-3 min. The results shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> indicate that FVIII-4A2 is identically recognized by thrombin as wild-type FVIII with a relative decrease of activity which might be caused by one of the four mutations.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0204">d) Dissociation of the A2 Domain</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0205">Wild-type FVIII and FVIII-4A2 were activated as described above for 1 min. Hirudin was then added and FVIIIa was left at 37&#xb0; C. for different time periods. Aliquots were removed at said time and incubated with a mixture of phospholipids, FIXa and FX. FXa was allowed to form for 5 min, then Stop buffer was added (Iris 50 mM pH 8.8, 475 mM NaCl, 9 mM EDTA). The amount of FXa formed was determined as above.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0206">FVIIIa was incubated for different times before determining its residual activity. The loss of activity over time corresponds to dissociation of the A2 domain. The loss of activity profile of wild-type FVIII and FVIII-4A2 was similar but the respective kinetics differed. Indeed, wild-type FVIII had a half-life of 3 min while that of FVIII-4A2 was 11 min. This increased stability may explain the higher specific activity observed in the chromogenic assay. In this test, FVIIIa was incubated for 4 min before adding the substrate. Wild-type FVIII thus lost its activity faster than FVIII-4A2 during this test. The results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<heading id="h-0022" level="1">Example 8</heading>
<heading id="h-0023" level="1">Construction and Characterization of FVIII-3A2 Mutants</heading>
<p id="p-0202" num="0207">Four triple FVIII-3A2 mutants were constructed: FVIII-3A2 (409-462-507), FVIII-3A2 (462-507-629), FVIII-3A2 (409-462-629), FVIII-3A2 (409-507-629).</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0208">FVIII-3A2 (409-462-507) Specific Activity Determination</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0209">The specific activity of the FVIII-3A2 mutant (409-462-507) was determined by dividing chromogenic or chromogenic activity by concentration. These specific activities were compared with that of wild-type FVIII. The chromogenic activity of FVIII-3A2 (409-462-507) was 98% of the chromogenic activity of wild-type FVIII. These results indicate that the absence of mutation at position 629 in FVIII-3A2 yielded a higher coagulant activity than for FVIII-4A2.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0210">FVIII-3A2 (409-462-507) Abolition to Inhibition</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0211">This mutant was also analyzed for its abolition to inhibition by antibodies from the four hemophiliac patients FS, TD, GC and SL. Residual activity determined after incubation with an inhibitory antibody was divided by the activity remaining after incubation with a non-immune antibody. The percentage of residual activity was thus determined and is presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> curves. These curves illustrate the residual activity of FVIII-3A2 (409-462-507) after contact with different dilutions of antibodies from the different patients with inhibitors. It clearly appears that the use of the FVIII-3A2 mutant (409-462-507) enable to retain a much higher chronometric activity after incubation with inhibitory antibodies. The combination of mutations 409-462-507 therefore yields a greater abolition to inhibition resulting in an increase in residual activity. This percentage of residual activity depends on both the source of inhibitory antibody and the concentration used.</p>

<p id="p-0207" num="0212">Production of the CHO Cell Line</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0213">A CHO cell line (ECACC 85050302) expressing FVIII was generated as described in Plantier et al. (Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2001; 86 p. 596). Briefly, cells were maintained at 37&#xb0; C. in a humid 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere. Cells were grown in IMDM medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Cells (7&#xd7;10<sup>6</sup>) were trypsinized and resuspended in PBS, then subjected to electroporation in presence of a cDNA of interest (7 &#x3bc;g). Cells were then reseeded in the presence of geneticin (0.6 mg/ml). Individual clones were selected, subcultured and amplified. Cells' ability to synthesize FVIII was determined by measuring the chromogenic activity of the culture medium. The best producer clones were amplified and grown in triple flasks. Production took place over 5 days during which cells were incubated in complete medium during the day, washed three times, then incubated overnight in IMDM medium containing 1% BSA instead of serum. The BSA-containing medium was collected, centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 min at 4&#xb0; C. and stored at &#x2212;30&#xb0; C. Cells were put back into complete medium during the day.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0214">Purification and Production of FVIII Mutants (FVIII-3A2 and FVIII-4A2)</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0215">The purification protocol was based on the technique described by Jenkins et al. (Blood, 2004). The culture medium was thawed and 40% (m/V) (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>was added. The medium was shaken overnight at 4&#xb0; C., then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4&#xb0; C. The pellet was resuspended 1 in 10 by volume in 20 mM MES pH 6.0, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.01% Tween-20 buffer and dialyzed overnight against a similar buffer but containing 200 mM NaCl. Dialysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature, then loaded at 2 ml/min on a FLPC Sepharose FF column. The column was previously equilibrated with the same buffer. FVIII was eluted in a 0.2 to 1 M NaCl gradient. Fractions containing the highest chromogenic activity were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM NaCl and 0.01% Tween-20 buffer. Dialysate was aliquoted and stored at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. The quality of the protein was assessed after migration on SDS-PAGE 10% acrylamide by silver nitrate staining and by immunoblot. FVIII concentration was determined by the Asserachrom FVIII:Ag kit (Stago, Asnieres, France).</p>
