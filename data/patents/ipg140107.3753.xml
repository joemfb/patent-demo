<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a technique for driving a liquid crystal panel of a liquid crystal display (LCD) and, more particularly, to a driving circuit of an LCD capable of preventing degradation of characteristics of transistors constituting a gate driving unit, an element of a gate driving unit.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, as the information technology (IT) is advancing, the importance of a flat panel display device is further emphasized as a visual information transmission medium, and in order to obtain a competitive edge in the future, the flat panel display device is required to have low power consumption, to be thinner and lighter, and to have high picture quality. A liquid crystal display (LCD), a typical display device of the flat panel display devices, displays an image by using optical anisotropy of liquid crystal. With the advantages of being thinner and smaller and having low power consumption and high picture quality, the LCD is widely applied for display devices of various mobile terminals such as a TV receiver or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The LCD is a display device in which image information is individually supplied to liquid crystal pixels arranged in a matrix form to control light transmittance of the liquid crystal pixels to thereby display a desired image. Thus, the LCD includes a liquid crystal panel with liquid crystal pixels, the minimum unit for implementing an image, arranged in a matrix form and a driver for driving the liquid crystal panel. Because the LCD does not emit light by itself, it includes a backlight unit to provide light to the LCD.

<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The gate control signal GDC includes a gate start pulse GSP, a gate shift clock signal GSC, a gate out enable signal GOE, or the like, and the data control signal DDC includes a source start pulse SSP, a source shift clock signal SSC, a source out enable signal SOE, and a polarity signal POL.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The gate driving unit <b>12</b> sequentially supplies gate signals to the gate lines GL<b>1</b>&#x2dc;GLn in response to the gate control signal GDC inputted from the timing controller <b>11</b>, and accordingly, thin film transistors TFTs in the horizontal lines are turned on. Accordingly, pixel signals supplied via the data lines DL<b>1</b>&#x2dc;DLm are stored in each storage capacitor Cst via the TFTs.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In detail, the gate driving unit <b>12</b> shifts the gate start pulse GSP according to the gate shift clock GSC to generate a shift pulse. The gate driving unit <b>12</b> supplies a gate signal including a gate-on and gate-off intervals (signals) to a corresponding gate line GL at every horizontal period in response to the shift clock. In this case, the gate driving unit supplies a gate-on signal only during an enable period in response to the gate out enable signal GOE, and supplies a gate-off signal during other period.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In response to the data control signal DDC inputted from the timing controller <b>11</b>, the data driving unit <b>13</b> converts the pixel data RGB into an analog pixel signal (data signal or data voltage) corresponding to a gray scale value of the pixel data RGB, and supplies the converted pixel signal to the data lines DL<b>1</b>&#x2dc;DLm on the liquid crystal panel <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The liquid crystal panel <b>14</b> includes a plurality of liquid crystal cells C<sub>LC </sub>arranged in a matrix form and TFTs formed at every crossing of the data lines DL<b>1</b>&#x2dc;DLm and gate lines GL<b>1</b>&#x2dc;GLn and connected to each liquid crystal cell C<sub>LC</sub>. When the gate signals are supplied from the gate lines GL, the TFTs are turned on to supply the pixel signals supplied via the data lines DL to the liquid crystal cells C<sub>LC</sub>. When the gate off signal is supplied through the gate lines GL, the TFTs are turned off to allow the pixel signal charged in the liquid crystal cell C<sub>LC </sub>to be maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The liquid crystal cell C<sub>LC </sub>includes a common electrode and a pixel electrode connected with the TFTs with liquid crystals interposed therebetween. The liquid crystal cell C<sub>LC </sub>further includes a storage capacitor C<sub>ST </sub>in order to stably maintain the charged pixel signal until a next pixel signal is charged. The storage capacitor C<sub>ST </sub>is formed between the pixel electrode and a gate line of a previous stage. In the liquid crystal cell C<sub>LC</sub>, the arrangement of liquid crystals having dielectric anisotropy varies according to the pixel signal charged through the TFT, and accordingly, the light transmittance is adjusted to implement gray scales.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the gate driving unit <b>12</b> includes gate drivers GD<b>1</b>&#x2dc;GDn operating according to a shift register method, and outputs gate signals VGOUT[1]&#x2dc;VGOUT[N] at the same timing as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> by a clock signal CLK, a start signal VST and a reset signal RST supplied from the timing controller <b>11</b>. Namely, after the start signal VST is inputted, the gate drivers GD<b>1</b>&#x2dc;GDn sequentially output the gate signals VGOUT[1]&#x2dc;VGOUT[N] in synchronization with corresponding clock signals CLK[<b>1</b>]&#x2dc;CLK[N]. The gate lines GL<b>1</b>&#x2dc;GLn on the liquid crystal panel <b>14</b> are driven by the thusly outputted gate signals VGOUT[1]&#x2dc;VGOUT[N]. The operation of generating the gate signals VGOUT[1]&#x2dc;VGOUT[N] is repeated by frames.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a detailed circuit diagram showing the gate drivers GD<b>1</b>&#x2dc;GDn. A first AND gate AD<b>11</b> ANDs control signals CTL supplied from the timing controller <b>11</b> and supplies a set signal (S) of an RS flipflop FF<b>11</b>, and a second AND gate AD<b>12</b> ANDs the control signals CTL and supplies a reset signal (R) of the flip-flop FF<b>11</b>. The RS flipflop FF<b>11</b> are operated by the supplied set signal (S) and the reset signal (R) to output the opposite logic signals as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> to its output terminals Q and QB.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In other words, when a gate high voltage V<sub>GH </sub>is outputted to the output terminal (Q) of the RS flipflop FF<b>11</b>, a large-size charging transistor T<sub>U </sub>is turned on, and at this time, a small-size discharging transistor T<sub>PD </sub>is turned off by a gate low voltage V<sub>GL </sub>outputted from the inversion output terminal QB of the RF flipflop FF<b>11</b>. In this state, when the clock signal CLK is supplied, the gate high voltage VGH is supplied to the corresponding gate line GL from the charging transistor T<sub>U</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Thereafter, in a discharge mode, the discharging transistor T<sub>PD </sub>is turned on by the gate high voltage V<sub>GH </sub>outputted from the inversion output terminal QB of the RS flipflop FF<b>11</b>. Accordingly, the gate high voltage V<sub>GH</sub>, charging voltage of the gate line GL, is discharged via the discharging transistor T<sub>PD </sub>and maintained as a gate low voltage V<sub>GL</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The charging transistor T<sub>PU </sub>and the discharging transistor T<sub>PD </sub>are implemented as an a-Si:H TFT. When a positive polarity DC voltage is supplied between a source electrode and a gate electrode in such a transistor, a threshold voltage is increased to degrade the characteristics to reduce an output current.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In this respect, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it is noted that a high level voltage is outputted from the output terminal (Q) of the RS flipflop FF<b>11</b> to a gate electrode of the charging transistor T<sub>U </sub>during a short time corresponding to a charge time of the gate line. Thus, the charging transistor T<sub>U </sub>can receive a stress voltage during the short time period.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In comparison, it is noted that a high level voltage is outputted from the output terminal QB of the RF flipflop FF<b>11</b> to a gate electrode of the discharging transistor T<sub>PD </sub>during a long time excluding the charge time of the gate line. Thus, the discharging transistor T<sub>PD </sub>receives the stress voltage during a relatively even longer time compared with that of the charging transistor T<sub>U</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Thus, in the related art LCD, when the gate driving unit outputs the gate signals to the respective gate lines of the liquid crystal panel, the high level gate voltage is supplied to the charging transistor during a short time period, so degradation of characteristics proceeds relatively slow. Meanwhile, the discharging transistor at each gate driving unit receives the gate voltage of high level during a longer time compared with that of the charging transistor, so degradation of characteristics proceeds fast as much. This results in lengthening of a discharge time of the gate lines, causing a problem in that an interval, which is to be maintained in an OFF state, is not turned off to output an abnormal voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In addition, the charging transistor T<sub>U </sub>and the discharging transistor T<sub>D </sub>are implemented by a-Si:H, having a disadvantage that the charging transistor T<sub>PU </sub>and the discharging transistor T<sub>PD </sub>have low mobility. Thus, the related art LCD has the problem that gate lines are not discharged within a line time.</p>

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In response to the gate control signal GDC inputted from the timing controller <b>91</b>, the first and second driving units <b>92</b>A and <b>92</b>B are alternately driven by using at least one frame as a period to supply gate signals to the gate lines GL<b>1</b>&#x2dc;GLn of the liquid crystal panel <b>94</b>.

The operation of the gate drivers will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The gate driver circuit as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is one of the gate drivers GD<b>11</b>&#x2dc;GD<b>1</b><i>n </i>and GD<b>21</b>&#x2dc;GD<b>2</b><i>n </i>constituting the gate driving units <b>92</b>A and <b>92</b>B which operates at every odd number frame or even number frame. In the operation frame mode, the enable signal ENA is supplied with a high level from the timing controller <b>91</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">At the interval t<b>1</b> in a charge mode, a gate signal G[N&#x2212;1] of a previous stage is inputted with a high level to the set terminal (S) of the RS flipflop FF<b>21</b>, so a voltage VM of an intermediate level is outputted to the output terminal (Q), and accordingly, the charging transistor T<sub>U </sub>of the large size is turned on. The voltage VM of intermediate level is obtained by subtracting a threshold voltage of the input terminal transistor from a supplied voltage (V<sub>DD</sub>&#x2212;V<sub>TH</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">At this time, the reset signal RESET is inputted with a low level to the reset terminal (R) of the RS flipflop FF<b>21</b>, so the low-level signal is outputted to the inversion output terminal QB, and accordingly, because the signal of low level is outputted to the output terminal Gd of the AND gate AD<b>21</b>, the charging transistor T<sub>PD </sub>of the small size is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Thereafter, at the interval t<b>2</b> in the charge mode, a clock signal (CLK=CLK[<b>1</b>]) is inputted with a high level. Accordingly, because of a coupling phenomenon of a parasitic capacitance C<sub>gd </sub>between the gate electrode and the drain electrode of the charging transistor T<sub>PU</sub>, the voltage of the output terminal (Q) is bootstrapped to a voltage VH with a higher level as the voltage VM of the intermediate level and the voltage V<sub>GH </sub>of the clock signal CLK are added thereto. Accordingly, the gate signal G[N] is outputted with the voltage level VGH of the clock signal CLK from a corresponding gate driver at the interval t<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The gate signal G[N] outputted from the corresponding gate driver is commonly supplied to the corresponding gate line of the liquid crystal panel <b>84</b> and to the set terminal (S) of the RS flipflop FF<b>21</b> of the gate driver of the next stage.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Thereafter, at the interval t<b>3</b> in a discharge mode, the clock signal (CLK=CLK[<b>1</b>]) is dropped to a voltage VGL of a low level and a clock signal (CLK=CLK[<b>2</b>]) supplied to a gate driver of the next stage is increased to a high level voltage. At this time, a gate signal G[N&#x2212;1] of a previous stage is inputted with a low level to the set terminal (S) of the RS flipflop FF<b>21</b>. Accordingly, the charging transistor T<sub>U </sub>is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">At this time, the reset signal RESET is inputted with a high level to the reset terminal (R) of the RS flipflop FF<b>21</b>, so the high level signal is outputted to the inversion output terminal QB, and accordingly, because the high level signal is outputted to the output terminal Gd of the AND gate AD<b>21</b>, the discharging transistor T<sub>PD </sub>is turned on.

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">First, at the interval t<b>1</b>, a gate signal G[N&#x2212;1] of a previous stage is inputted with a high level to the set terminal (S) of the RS flipflop FF<b>21</b>, so a voltage VM of an intermediate level is outputted to the output terminal (Q), and accordingly, the charging transistor T<sub>U </sub>of the large size is turned on. However, because the clock signal (CLK=CLK[<b>1</b>]) is still inputted with the low level, the gate signal G[N] is outputted as the voltage VGL of the low level. The voltage VM of intermediate level is obtained by subtracting a threshold voltage of the input terminal transistor from a supplied voltage (V<sub>DD</sub>&#x2212;V<sub>TH</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">At this time, the reset signal RESET is inputted with a low level to the reset terminal (R) of the RS flipflop FF<b>21</b>, so the low-level signal is outputted to the inversion output terminal QB and the gate signal G[N+1] of the next stage is outputted with a low level, and accordingly, the low level signal is outputted to the output terminal Gd of the OR gate OR<b>1</b>, and thus, the charging transistor T<sub>PD </sub>of the small size is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Thereafter, at the interval t<b>2</b>, the clock signal (CLK) is inputted with a high level. Accordingly, because of a coupling phenomenon of a parasitic capacitance C<sub>gd </sub>between the gate electrode and the drain electrode of the charging transistor TPU, the voltage of the output terminal (Q) is bootstrapped to a voltage VH with a higher level as the voltage VM of the intermediate level and the voltage V<sub>GH </sub>of the clock signal CLK are added thereto. Accordingly, the gate signal G[N] is outputted with the voltage level V<sub>GH </sub>of the clock signal CLK from a corresponding gate driver at the interval t<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Thereafter, at the interval t<b>3</b>, the clock signal CLK is dropped to a voltage VGL of low level, and due to the coupling phenomenon of the parasitic capacitance C<sub>gd</sub>, the voltage supplied to the gate electrode of the charging transistor T<sub>PU </sub>is dropped to the voltage VM of the intermediate level, which is then, maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Accordingly, the charging transistor T<sub>PU </sub>is maintained in the turned-on state, and accordingly, the gate signal G[N] is discharged as a low level voltage VGL via the charging transistor T<sub>PU</sub>.</p>

<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Because the discharging operation of the gate signal G[N] is performed simultaneously through the charging transistor T<sub>PU </sub>and the discharging transistor T<sub>PD </sub>at the discharge interval t<b>3</b>, the discharging operation can be quickly performed compared with the general case where the discharging operation is performed through only one discharging transistor T<sub>PD</sub>, so a falling time of the gate signal G[N] can be shortened.</p>

In this case, however, because the high level signal is continuously outputted to the inversion output terminal QB, the high level signal is also continuously outputted from the OR gate OR<b>1</b>.
