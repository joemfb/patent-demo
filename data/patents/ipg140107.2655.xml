No. 7,786,011 entitled COMPOSITION AND METHODS FOR FORMING METAL FILMS ON SEMICONDUCTOR SUBSTRATES USING SUPERCRITICAL SOLVENTS, filed on Jan. 25, 2008 which claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/898,122 entitled COMPOSITION AND METHODS FOR FORMING METAL FILMS ON SEMICONDUCTOR SUBSTRATES USING SUPERCRITICAL SOLVENTS, filed Jan. 30, 2007, the entire content of each is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In the field of semiconductor manufacturing, deposition of materials such as metal films on semiconductor substrates can be carried out by a variety of techniques, including chemical vapor deposition (&#x201c;CVD&#x201d;), physical vapor deposition (&#x201c;PVD&#x201d;), and atomic layer deposition (&#x201c;ALD&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional CVD processes for metal film deposition occurs through the volatilization of metal precursors at high temperatures under vacuum. The selection of metal precursors available for CVD is limited by requirements such as high thermal stability and sufficient volatility of the metal precursors. When a precursor is selected and volatilized during the CVD process, the metal precursor is usually only present in the vapor at low concentrations. This can lead to limited film growth resulting in non-conformal films. Moreover, the high temperature requirements of CVD can significantly impact the thermal budget during wafer processing.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">With regard to conventional PVD of metal precursors, PVD is fundamentally limited by the nature of a line-of-sight deposition process that results in non-conformal film growth and inability to deposit material in certain types of high aspect ratio structures. Additional shortcomings of PVD include the significant particle levels that are generated in the PVD process, limited control and lack of homogeneity of the deposited film, and process control issues relating to diffusion of the sputtered material.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional ALD processes for deposition of thin films occurs through exposure of the substrate to alternating cycles of precursors to grow atomically thin films. While the ability to grow films in a carefully controlled manner at the atomic level results in conformal deposition, the high number of cycles required to prepare even very thin films leads to slow film growth. Moreover, repetitive valve cycling can also lead to particle generation and maintenance issues.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Currently, several integrated circuit (&#x201c;IC&#x201d;) processes require low cost deposition of conformal thin-films for both front end of line and back end of line applications, including capacitor electrodes, barriers, and interconnects.</p>

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">According to further embodiments, methods for the deposition of metal films using the compositions described in the above embodiments are disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the metal deposition process described herein, the formal oxidation state of the metal in the metal film is the same as or lower than the oxidation state of the metal in the metal precursor. In both cases, a preliminary step in the formation of the metal film is dissociation of at least some of the ligands on the metal precursor. Dissociation of ligands will open up coordination sites on the metal precursor that may become filled with anionic Lewis base ligands such as oxygen, halides, etc. that are adventitiously present in the deposition chamber and will increase the oxidation state of the metal. In the presence of excess, neutral, labile ligands, open coordination sites on the metal precursor become kinetically favored to bind with these ligands rather than adventitious oxidizing sources. The neutral, labile ligands act as temporary placeholders to fill the coordination sites on the precursor until they are dissociated or displaced by the ligand of choice. In this manner, the addition of excess neutral labile ligands helps to prevent oxidation and facilitate the deposition of metal films.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Early transition metal precursors such as Ta tend to be electropositive, oxophilic, and form unstable low valent complexes, wherein the metal in the metal precursor has a thermodynamically disfavored oxidation state. Any empty coordination sites that become available on the metal in the metal precursor during the deposition in supercritical fluids processing will tend to be rapidly filled by anionic Lewis base ligands (i.e., oxide, halide, etc.). Binding of the metal with these anionic Lewis base ligands leads to an increase in the formal oxidation state of the metal making it substantially difficult to prepare and obtain metal films.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">There is a strong thermodynamic driving force to fill empty coordination sites on early transition metal precursors, and so even very low levels of oxidizing sources during the deposition process tend to result in formation of unwanted oxidized metal species. While it is theoretically possible to remove all traces of oxidizing sources from a supercritical fluid deposition process, from a practical standpoint it is difficult to successfully remove all traces of oxidizing sources. Moreover, even if it was possible to remove all traces of oxidizing sources, such removal steps can render the deposition process ineffective based on efficiency and costs.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">According to various embodiments described herein is the use of neutral labile ligands that can temporarily fill empty coordination sites on metals during deposition processes. The temporary filling of these empty coordination sites can substantially eliminate oxidation of the metal thereby facilitating the generation of metal films.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The neutral labile ligands fill the empty coordination sites temporarily because the bond formed between the neutral labile ligand and the metal is in general substantially weaker in comparison to the bond formed between a metal and a Lewis base ligand with a negative formal charge. As a result of the weak bond formed between the neutral labile ligand and the metal, the neutral labile ligand easily disassociates from the metal. The molar excess of neutral labile ligands promotes the rapid filling of the empty coordination sites on the metal in the metal precursor. The rapid filling of the empty coordination sites thereby promotes the maintenance of the low oxidation state of the metal which in turn promotes further growth of the metal film.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Several types of metal films can be produced by the methods disclosed herein, including a pure elemental M(0) metal film, a film containing an intimate blend of one or more elemental M(0) metals, stratified films of one or more elemental M(0) metals, or films containing both metals and at least one of the main group elements B, C, N, Si or P.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">For a film containing both a metal and a main group element, the metal may be directly bound to the main group element, as in Ta(III) N; or it may be a metal film doped with a main group element, such as Co(0) doped with P. In both cases, the source of the main group element may be derived from the metal precursor, or from the addition of chemistry that contains the desired main group element. Ligands on the metal precursor that may be useful for the incorporation of main group elements into a metal film include boranes, borates, alkyls, arenes, alkenes, alkynes, carbenes, carbines, amines, imines, nitriles, isocyanides, nitrosyls, imides, amides, silanes, siloxanes, phosphines, phosphites, and phosphides. Sources of additional chemistry that can be added to the composition to provide the desired main group element includes, boranes, diborane, alkyls, arenes, alkenes, alkyllithium, Grignard agents, dimethyl magnesium, methyl zinc, organocuprates, peroxides, amines, imines, nitriles, cyanates, azides, azo compounds, silanes, siloxanes, phosphines, and phosphites. For example, a Ta precursor containing a terminal imide bond would be an appropriate precursor to prepare Ta(III)N. In another example, a deposition composition containing cobaltocene and triphenyl phosphine could be used to prepare a Co(0) film doped with P.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">For the deposition of metal films in supercritical fluids, metal precursors with metals having any oxidation state can be used. The metal precursor can comprise metals selected from the group consisting of scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, actinium, titanium, zirconium, hafnium, rutherfordium, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, dubnium, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, seaborgium, manganese, technitium, rhenium, bohrium, iron, ruthenium, osmium, hassium, cobalt, rhodium, iridium, meitnerium, nickel, palladium, platinum, darmstadtium, copper, silver, gold, zinc, cadmium, and mercury. The metal precursor can more preferably comprise metals selected from the group consisting of titanium, zirconium, vanadium, tantalum, hafnium, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, palladium, platinum, copper, silver, gold, zinc, cadmium, and mercury. The metal precursor can most preferably comprise metals selected from the group consisting of tantalum, hafnium, zirconium, titanium, tungsten, molybdenum, and chromium.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Early transition metals can be oxophilic and electropositive and can form thermodynamically stable complexes with higher formal oxidation states. In contrast, synthesis, storage, and manipulation of metal precursors comprising electropositive metals having low formal oxidation states can be very challenging.</p>

<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The neutral labile ligands used in the above process, as described herein, temporarily fill coordination sites on the metal in the metal precursor as they become available such that these empty coordination sites are not filled with anionic Lewis base ligands that can increase the oxidation state of the metal.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Moreover, the neutral labile ligands, described herein, are soluble in the supercritical solvent and can be added in a large molar excess such that they are kinetically favored to fill any empty coordination sites on the low valent metal precursor when it becomes available. The neutral labile ligands can be present in a ratio of at least about 10:1 of moles of neutral labile ligands to moles of the metal precursor, more preferably the neutral labile ligands can be present in a ratio of at least about 100:1 of moles of neutral labile ligands to moles of the metal precursor, and most preferably the neutral labile ligands can be present in a ratio of at least about 1000:1 of moles of neutral labile ligands to moles of the metal precursor.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The molar excess of neutral labile ligands promotes the rapid filling of the empty coordination sites on the metal in the metal precursor. The rapid filling of the empty coordination sites thereby promotes the maintenance of the low oxidation state of the metal which in turn promotes further growth of the metal film.</p>

Concurrently, by-products of the deposition operation can be continuously carried out of the deposition chamber via continuous flow of the SCF-based composition through the deposition chamber containing the heated pedestal and substrate.</p>
