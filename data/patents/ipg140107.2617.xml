<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNOLOGICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to semiconductor device manufacturing and, more particularly, relate to a method for reducing program disturbance in memory arrays.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">There is currently an ongoing drive toward the downscaling of device dimensions in virtually all aspects of electronic device manufacturing. Smaller electronic devices tend to be more popular than larger, more bulky devices when both devices have substantially equivalent capabilities. Accordingly, being able to fabricate smaller components would clearly tend to facilitate the production of smaller devices that incorporate those components. However, driving down component size often also means driving down the space between components, which may cause isolation issues.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In memory devices that include an array of tightly-packed memory cells, second bit effect and program disturb are phenomena that may impact the values stored in the memory cells. Improved isolation mechanisms can reduce the impact of these phenomena. However, with ever decreasing component sizes, isolation mechanisms must also continue to evolve.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Due to the high level of integration of devices and the large number of circuits on a single chip, interconnections are often no longer made by means of a single level of interconnections. Instead, at least two and sometimes more conductor interconnection levels may be formed, with each interconnection level having a pattern of wiring trenches being separated from the others by an insulating layer. Trenches may also be used for isolation. However, as even some of the trenches become smaller in size, filling the small spaces may become difficult. It may also be difficult to integrate vertical channel arrays with planar channel periphery circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, it may be desirable to provide an improved mechanism for filling small spaces in a semiconductor device such as a memory array. It may also be desirable to develop a mechanism for integrating vertical channel arrays with planar channel periphery circuits.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A method and apparatus are therefore provided that may provide a relatively-uncomplicated and cost-effective way to fill small spaces in a memory array. More particularly, some example embodiments may be employed to fill a physical isolation trench disposed between active structures of a vertical channel memory array. Some embodiments may also provide for integration of a vertical channel array with a planar channel periphery circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one exemplary embodiment, a method of processing a semiconductor structure is provided. The method may include preparing a vertical channel memory structure for filling of a physical isolation trench formed therein. The physical isolation trench may be formed between active structures adjacent to each other and extending in a first direction. The active structures may have channels adjacent to sides of the active structures that are opposite to sides of the active structures that are adjacent to the physical isolation trench. The method may further include filling the physical isolation trench in connection with multi-dielectric layer (ex. an oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) layer), a polysilicon liner and/or an oxide film.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another exemplary embodiment, a vertical channel memory structure is provided. The vertical channel memory structure may include at least a pair of active structures, channels and a filling material. The active structures may extend along a first direction and may be positioned adjacent to each other while having a physical isolation trench formed therebetween. The physical isolation trench may also extending in the first direction. The channels may be positioned adjacent to sides of the active structures that are opposite to sides of the active structures that are adjacent to the physical isolation trench.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Some embodiments of the present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all embodiments of the invention are shown. Indeed, various embodiments of the invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The employment of vertical channel Nbit technology has enabled further component shrinkage. This shrinkage promises to deliver devices capable of storing, for example, four bits per cell, with still further component shrinkage expected in the future. To provide improved protection against program disturbance, physical isolation trench (PIT) technology is proposed for use in connection with a vertical channel structure. The vertical channel structure may employ active-stacked structures aligned in a first direction to form channels. Word lines may extend substantially perpendicular to the channels and have portions that extend into the channels. In some embodiments, storage cells may be formed between the word lines and the active structures. PIT technology may involve the provision of trench isolation within the active-stacked structures. However, filling of the PIT may be difficult due to the relatively small size of the PIT (e.g., &#x3c;30 nm in some cases). Accordingly, some example embodiments described herein may provide relatively low cost and simple mechanisms by which the PIT may be filled with dielectric or semiconductor material.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which includes <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B, <b>1</b>C, <b>1</b>D and <b>1</b>E, illustrates several (but not necessarily all) operations that may be employed to fill the PIT according to one example embodiment. As shown, active structures <b>10</b> may be formed over a base comprising a substrate over which layers N-type and/or P-type material may be disposed. In an example embodiment, a PIT <b>20</b> may be formed between active structures <b>10</b> to provide isolation therebetween. The active structures <b>10</b> may extend linearly into and out of the page with respect to the view shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> with linearly-extending channels <b>22</b> on either side thereof. The channels <b>22</b> may be formed on each of the sides of the active structures <b>10</b> that are opposite to the sides of the active structures <b>10</b> that are adjacent to the PIT <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of the active structures <b>10</b> and the PIT <b>20</b> responsive to an etching process used to form a vertical channel array. As shown in FIG. <b>1</b>A, a layer of oxide <b>13</b> may initially be positioned on the active structures <b>10</b> and the PIT <b>20</b>, and a high density plasma (HDP) oxide <b>18</b> may be disposed over the PIT <b>20</b>. A cleaning process may then be used to remove the layer of oxide <b>13</b> and HDP oxide <b>18</b>, leaving the active structures <b>10</b> exposed along with the PIT <b>20</b> and the channels <b>22</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. A process may then be employed in connection with buried diffusion (BD) implantation. In the beginning, an oxide material <b>15</b> may fill the PIT <b>20</b> and coat exposed portions of the active structures and the base to protect the channels <b>22</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>. Then, buried diffusion implanted material <b>26</b> may be formed at the tops of the active structures and the bottoms of the channels <b>22</b>, as also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>. Thereafter, a clean process may be undertaken to remove the oxide material coating sidewalls of the active structures as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, leaving the buried diffusion implanted material <b>26</b> on top of the active structures and at the bottom of the channels <b>22</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref> illustrates completion of ONO deposition within the PIT <b>20</b> and over the exposed surfaces of the active structures and the buried diffusion implanted material <b>26</b>; this being followed by the formation of word lines <b>28</b> passing over the active structures and also filling in the channels <b>22</b>. The ONO deposited in a layer of ONO <b>30</b> may substantially fill the PIT <b>20</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>. Of note, the word lines <b>28</b> may be longitudinally extending, substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal extension of the channels <b>22</b>. In some embodiments, the word lines <b>28</b> may also be coated (e.g., with Tungsten Silicide (WSi)) via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or other processes during metallization of the resulting integrated circuit (e.g., when contact pads or other connections are formed for connecting portions of an integrated circuit to perform corresponding functions).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some cases, if the ONO deposited in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref> does not merge well in the PIT <b>20</b>, the PIT <b>20</b> may not be fully filled with ONO. If this occurs, there may be a risk of leaving the PIT <b>20</b> open to some degree. Thus, for example, polysilicon of the word lines <b>28</b> may form inside a portion of the PIT <b>20</b> during formation of the word lines <b>28</b>. This condition could pose a word line bridge risk after word line patterning. In this regard, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, vertical channels <b>22</b> are shown extending in a first direction with word lines <b>28</b> disposed over the top of the vertical channels <b>22</b> and the active structures <b>10</b>. The PIT <b>20</b> is also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and, if a portion of the PIT <b>20</b> is not filled, polysilicon may fill such portion to form a bridge between adjacent word lines <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In order to prevent or at least mitigate the risk of word line bridge formation, some embodiments may include either a polysilicon liner and/or oxide film in the PIT <b>20</b> to help fill the PIT <b>20</b> and reduce the PIT-open risk. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which includes <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3E</figref>, illustrates several (but not necessarily all) of the operations in a sequence to produce a product that is less susceptible to the PIT-open risk. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of the active structures <b>10</b> and the PIT <b>20</b> responsive to an etching process used to form a vertical channel array similar to the product of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, a thin oxide layer <b>100</b> may be formed over exposed surfaces of the active structures <b>10</b>, the channels <b>22</b> and also within the PIT <b>20</b>. A polysilicon layer <b>102</b> may then be formed over the oxide layer <b>100</b> including entirely filling the PIT <b>20</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> then shows the results of a chemical dry etching etch back process that may be employed to remove exposed portions of the polysilicon layer (i.e., portions of the polysilicon layer <b>102</b> that are substantially outside of the PIT <b>20</b>) to leave only a polysilicon liner <b>104</b> within the PIT <b>20</b>. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, in some cases, the polysilicon liner <b>104</b> may not fully fill the PIT <b>20</b>. However, it may not be necessary for the polysilicon liner <b>104</b> to fully fill the PIT <b>20</b> in some cases.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">After a process is employed in connection with buried diffusion (BD) implantation, buried diffusion implanted material <b>26</b> may be disposed on top of the active structures <b>10</b> and at the bottom of the channels <b>22</b> with the PIT <b>20</b> still filled by the polysilicon liner <b>104</b>, and a oxide layer <b>106</b> coating all exposed surfaces, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>. An ONO layer <b>110</b> may be deposited over exposed surfaces thereafter to cover over the PL liner <b>104</b> in the PIT <b>20</b>. As such, when the word lines <b>28</b> are formed to run substantially perpendicular to the channels <b>22</b>, the PIT <b>20</b> may be substantially fully filled with no PIT-open issues and thus, the chances of word line bridging may be reduced. Metallization may then occur without concern over word line bridging as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The use of the polysilicon liner <b>104</b> is just one example of a mechanism by which to reduce the likelihood of word line bridging. In some embodiments (such as the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), rather than using the polysilicon liner <b>104</b>, an oxide film <b>200</b> may be used to substantially fill the PIT <b>20</b>. For example, the oxide film <b>200</b> initially filling the PIT <b>20</b> may be retained as the HDP oxide <b>240</b> used to cap the open region of the PIT <b>20</b> to prevent word line bridging by reducing or eliminating the PIT-open risk. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, which includes <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</figref>, <b>4</b>B and <b>4</b>C, shows several (but not necessarily all) of the operations in a sequence to produce a product that is less susceptible to the PIT-open risk. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of the active structures <b>10</b> and the PIT <b>20</b> responsive to an etching process used to form a vertical channel array similar to the products of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. Here, top buried diffusion implanted material (TBD) <b>228</b> is formed before vertical channel process. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, a process may be employed in connection with buried diffusion (BD) implantation, such that bottom buried diffusion implanted material (BBD) <b>226</b> may be disposed at the bottom of the channels <b>22</b>. The oxide layer <b>236</b> may coat the exposed surfaces as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> including the filled PIT <b>20</b> (filled with oxide material <b>200</b> and capped with HDP <b>240</b>. Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, an ONO layer <b>244</b> may be deposited over exposed surfaces to cover over the HPD <b>240</b> (e.g., after a clean process that is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The ONO layer <b>244</b> may have the word lines formed thereon that run substantially perpendicular to the channels <b>24</b>, with the PIT <b>20</b> still substantially filled to prevent PIT-open issues. Accordingly, the chances of word line bridging may be reduced. Metallization may then occur without concern over word line bridging.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Example embodiments described herein, along with other examples that follow therefrom, may enable memory fabricators to fill-in small areas to effectively fill such areas in a relatively cheap and reliable manner. Small spaces, like the PIT formed within active structures of a vertical channel memory array, may be filled with ONO deposition, a polysilicon liner and/or an oxide film. In the context of example embodiments, ONO deposition may include the use of materials such as oxide-nitride-oxide, bandgap engineered silicon-oxide-nitride-oxide-silicon (BE-SONOS), nanocrystal and/or other possible storage mediums. Meanwhile, the polysilicon liner may utilize materials such as, for example, amorphous silicon (a-Si), polycrystalline silicon (P-Si) and/or single crystal silicon (c-Si). The oxide film may be a material such as, for example, HTO (high temperature oxidation), tetrethoxysilicide (TEOS), in situ steam generation (ISSG) and/or other oxide films with good step coverage.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Some embodiments of the present invention may provide a mechanism by which improvements may be experienced in relation to resisting program disturbance in a memory array such as a multi-level cell (MLC). In this regard, some embodiments may provide improved isolation between active structures proximate to which charge storage (and therefore memory functions) may be accomplished.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a flow diagram of a method for processing a semiconductor structure according to an example embodiment. The method may include preparing a vertical channel memory structure for filling of a physical isolation trench formed therein. The physical isolation trench may be formed between active structures adjacent to each other and extending in a first direction. The active structures may have channels adjacent to sides of the active structures that are opposite to sides of the active structures that are adjacent to the physical isolation trench. The method may further include filling the physical isolation trench in connection with application of an oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) layer.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, certain ones of the operations above may be modified or further amplified as described below. Moreover, in some embodiments additional optional operations may also be included (an example of which is shown in dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). It should be appreciated that each of the modifications, optional additions or amplifications below may be included with the operations above either alone or in combination with any others among the features described herein in any order. In this regard, for example, the method may further include patterning word lines on the vertical channel memory structure. The word lines may extend parallel to each other in a second direction that is substantially perpendicular to the first direction. The word lines may extend over the active structures and the physical isolation trench and filling corresponding portions of the channels.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, patterning the word lines is performed after filling the physical isolation trench to prevent word line bridging due to a physical isolation trench-open condition. In an example embodiment, filling the physical isolation trench may include filling the physical isolation trench with ONO during application of the ONO layer. In such an example, filling the physical isolation trench with ONO during application of the ONO layer may include performing a cleaning process prior to applying re-oxidation and employing buried diffusion implantation to top portions of the active structures and bottom portions of the channels. Thereafter, an ONO cleaning process may be performed prior to application of the ONO layer. In some cases, filling the physical isolation trench with ONO during application of the ONO layer may include filling the physical isolation trench with ONO, bandgap engineered silicon-oxide-nitride-oxide-silicon (BE-SONOS) or nanocrystal.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, filling the physical isolation trench may include filling the physical isolation trench with an oxide film. In such an example, filling the physical isolation trench with the oxide film comprises filling the physical isolation trench with HTO (high temperature oxidation), tetrethoxysilicide (TEOS), or in situ steam generation (ISSG). In some cases, filling the physical isolation trench with the oxide film may include providing the oxide film in the physical isolation trench having high density plasma (HDP) deposited over a top of the active structures and the oxide film in the physical isolation trench.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, filling the physical isolation trench may include filling the physical isolation trench with a polysilicon liner. In such an example, filling the physical isolation trench with the polysilicon liner may include filling the physical isolation trench with amorphous silicon (a-Si), polycrystalline silicon (P-Si), and single crystal silicon (c-Si). In an example embodiment, filling the physical isolation trench with the polysilicon liner may include providing an oxide film layer over the active structures and the channels, and then applying a polysilicon layer over the oxide film layer and filling the physical isolation trench, and performing a chemical dry etch process to etch back the polysilicon layer on substantially all portions of the vertical channel memory structure except portions within the physical isolation trench. In some embodiments, filling the physical isolation trench with the polysilicon liner may further include performing a cleaning process prior to applying re-oxidation, employing buried diffusion implantation to top portions of the active structures and bottom portions of the channels, and thereafter performing a ONO cleaning process prior to application of the ONO layer.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As indicated above, it may be desirable in some cases to integrate vertical channel arrays with a planar channel periphery. In an example embodiment, a vertical channel array portion may be processed with chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP) and silicon nitride removal to achieve reverse tone for vertical channel definition. Accordingly, dark tone at the array becomes vertical channel. For a planar channel MOS device, current planar processes may be utilized so that the dark tone at the periphery becomes an active region.</p>

In the vertical channel array portion <b>450</b>, photolithography and implantation operations may be performed to provide Vt control and suppression of hot electron generation and punch. Thereafter, silicon nitride deposits and oxide deposits are provided. The hard mask <b>480</b> is performed to prevent silicone nitride <b>470</b> damage during following spacer etching process.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a side view of the intersection between the vertical channel array portion <b>450</b> and the periphery portion <b>460</b> of a semiconductor device to open the space of the oxide spacer to facilitate defining the PIT. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, which includes <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A</figref> (showing a side view) and <b>8</b>B (showing a top view), illustrates the definition of trenches associated with the PIT and periphery trench at the same time. Thus, some embodiments provide for the formation of trench structures (e.g., PIT <b>485</b> and periphery trench <b>486</b>) in both the vertical channel array portion <b>450</b> and the periphery portion <b>460</b> at the same time. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the PIT <b>485</b> is formed in the vertical channel array portion <b>450</b> between dark tone regions where a photoresist <b>490</b> was placed over a portion of the array that abuts the periphery portion <b>460</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, an single or multi oxide material <b>498</b> may be used to fill up any STI and/or PIT trenches in the vertical channel array portion <b>450</b> and the periphery portion <b>460</b> at the same time. An STI CMP process may be performed, but stopped when the nitride deposits <b>470</b> are reached to exposed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, removing the nitride deposits <b>470</b> then. As shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, which includes <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>, vertical channels <b>500</b> may be formed with a photoresist <b>492</b> employed over the periphery portion <b>460</b> and over parts of the vertical channel array portion <b>450</b> that are adjacent to the periphery portion <b>460</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Vertical channel cleaning and re-oxidation operations may then be performed to protect the sidewalls of the vertical channels <b>500</b> and to seal the PIT <b>485</b> (e.g., as described above in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, which includes <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A</figref> (side view) and <b>12</b>B (top view), photo-lithography and implantation operations may then be provided to define buried diffusion <b>510</b>. Thereafter, as shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (and described with regard to the vertical channel array portion <b>450</b> above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>), ONO deposition processes may be performed to provide ONO <b>520</b> over the vertical channel array portion <b>450</b>. Post ONO ETCH at periphery region <b>460</b>, several photo-lithography and implantation operations may be performed to define the well and control the Vt of MOS. In some embodiments, gate oxide, polysilicon and WSi deposition operations may be performed, after which time word line patterning and metallization may be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The embodiments described above are not limiting, but merely illustrate some examples of specific processes that may be practiced in accordance with some embodiments. Thus, some additional operations could also be performed in some example embodiments. Moreover, some operations described above may be omitted or modified. For example, in some cases, no PIT may be formed (e.g., by skipping oxide spacer and PIT ETCH processes) as shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. In some embodiments, both of MOS and poly could be used to resist the flow of electrical current. Resistance may therefore be a generic term for MOS and poly in a circuit device. Additionally, as stated above, the dark tone at the array may be a generic term for the vertical channel and the dark tone at the periphery may be a generic term for an active region.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates an example method for integration of a vertical channel array and a planar channel periphery circuit. The method may include forming a vertical channel memory array at a first portion of a semiconductor device in which the first portion has a dark tone corresponding to regions where vertical channels are to be formed. The method may further include forming a planar periphery at a second portion of the semiconductor device in which the second portion has a dark tone corresponding to an active region of the planar periphery. In some embodiments, the method may further include forming trench structures in both the first region and the second region at the same time. In an example embodiment, forming the vertical channel memory array and forming the planar periphery may each include providing silicon nitride deposits in the first and second portions such that the trench structures are formed between the silicon nitride deposits. In some cases, forming the vertical channel memory array and forming the planar periphery may each include providing an oxide material to fill the trench structures and removing the silicon nitride between exposed portions of the oxide material. In an example embodiment, forming the vertical channel memory array may include forming vertical channels extending in a first direction substantially parallel to a border defining an intersection of the first portion and the second portion. In some embodiments, forming the vertical channel memory array may include forming word lines extending longitudinally in a second direction substantially perpendicular to the first direction into and over the vertical channels.</p>
