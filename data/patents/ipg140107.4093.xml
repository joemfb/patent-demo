<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This Nonprovisional application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a) on Patent Application No. 2010-146314 filed in Japan on Jun. 28, 2010, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an image processing apparatus for carrying out a density correction with respect to an image forming apparatus. More specifically, the present invention relates to (i) an image processing apparatus which has a function of carrying out a plurality of halftone processes, carries out a density correction by actual measurement with respect to only one of the plurality of halftone processes that is required to be subjected to the density correction, and carries out the density correction with respect to the other halftone processes by conversion from a result of the density correction by actual measurement carried out with respect to the only one halftone process and (ii) an image forming apparatus including the image processing apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, a display device which has a resolution of approximately 75 dpi (Dot Per Inch) to 100 dpi is commonly used for a personal computer (hereinafter, referred to as a PC). In contrast, as for a resolution of an image forming apparatus, an electrophotographic printer has a resolution of approximately 600 dpi to 2400 dpi, and an inkjet printer has a resolution of approximately 360 dpi to 2880 dpi. This shows that an image forming apparatus has a higher resolution than a PC display device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As for gradation, a PC display device provides 256-level gray scale for each of RGB. In contrast, an image forming apparatus providing two-level gray scale is commonly used, and an image forming apparatus provides approximately 64-level gray scale at most. Even an image forming apparatus providing approximately 64-level gray scale often fails to appropriately express gradation in a low-density part and a high-density part of a printed image.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As described earlier, a PC display device which displays a digital image and an image forming apparatus which prints the digital image greatly differ mainly in resolution and gradation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, in order to absorb a difference in gradation, an image forming apparatus carries out a halftone process (also referred to as a gradation reproduction process or quantization means) such as a dither method or an error diffusion method in printing a digital image. Such a halftone process has a characteristic of obtaining gradation in exchange for resolution or obtaining resolution in exchange for gradation. The image forming apparatus properly uses a plurality of halftone processes in accordance with a type of a digital image to be printed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, in order to print a text, the image forming apparatus carries out a halftone process which places greater importance on reproduction of resolution than on reproduction of gradation. In contrast, in order to print a photograph, the image forming apparatus carries out a halftone process which places greater importance on reproduction of gradation than on reproduction of resolution. In this case, it is known that a shape (a curved line) of a density characteristic to be reproduced varies depending on a kind and/or a setting of a halftone process.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a graph illustrating density characteristics of respective halftone processes. The density characteristics of the respective halftone processes differ among the halftone processes. For example, a halftone process for providing a high resolution such as an error diffusion method or a high lpi (line per inch) dither method has a density characteristic which is close to a density characteristic of an image forming apparatus itself. In contrast, a halftone process for providing a low resolution such as a low lpi dither method tends to have a density characteristic which is close to a straight line (an ideal density characteristic). Note that a curved line which shows such a density characteristic of a halftone process changes over time depending on, for example, conditions such as temperature and humidity, and a usage state.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, an image forming apparatus having a function of carrying out a plurality of halftone processes carries out process control so as to keep a printing density and a color tone constant among the plurality of halftone processes. Then, the image forming apparatus carries out a density correction with respect to each of the plurality of halftone processes. The process control, which is an image quality adjustment for achieving both user convenience and a stable image quality, is carried out at turn-on, when a change over time or an environmental change is detected, or at a timing at which the number of sheets printed reaches a given number.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Patent Literature 1 discloses a density correction method. According to the density correction method, an arrangement having a function of carrying out plurality of halftone processes carries out a density correction by forming toner patches for all halftone processes that are required to be subjected to the density correction and actually measuring patch densities of the toner patches.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, according to the density correction method of Patent Literature 1, actual patch density measurement is carried out with respect to each of the halftone processes that is required to be subjected to the density correction. Therefore, this causes problems of (i) costs for materials to be consumed (e.g., toner and ink) and (ii) longer time required for the density correction.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Patent Literature 2 proposes a density correction method such that one of a plurality of halftone processes is set as a reference halftone process, a density correction is carried out with respect to only the reference halftone process by actual patch density measurement, and the density correction is carried out with respect to the other halftone processes by conversion from an output correction value of the reference halftone process (a result of the density correction carried out with respect to the reference halftone process).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Patent Literature 2 can solve the problems of Patent Literature 1. This is because according to Patent Literature 2, an output correction value is found by carrying out actual patch density measurement with respect to only the reference halftone process, and merely conversion from the output correction value of the reference halftone process is carried out with respect to the other halftone processes.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0018">However, the density correction method of Patent Literature 2 is designed such that a conversion value, which is fixed, cannot be reviewed in carrying out the density correction by conversion from the output correction value of the reference halftone process.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0019">Therefore, for a halftone process in which a density correction is carried out by use of a conversion value, the density correction method of Patent Literature 2 fails to respond to a case where a change over time in density characteristic of the halftone process occurs or an abnormality in the halftone process is indicated.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0020">It is desirable that a conversion value be set for each device in view of an individual difference between devices. However, a common conversion value set in accordance with actual measurement may be set for devices of an identical model in terms of cost. In a case where a density correction is carried out by use of a fixed common conversion value, the density correction method of Patent Literature 2 also fails to respond to such an individual difference between devices.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0021">The present invention has been made in view of the problems, and an object of the present invention is to make (i) an image processing apparatus in which a review of a conversion value and a conversion expression can be carried out with respect to the other halftone processes which are subjected to a density correction by conversion in accordance with an output correction value of a reference halftone process which has been subjected to the density correction, so that the density correction is carried out with high accuracy even by use of conversion, and (ii) an image forming apparatus including the image processing apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0022">In order to attain the object of the present invention, an image forming apparatus having a function of carrying out a plurality of halftone processes, the image forming apparatus includes: a density correction process section for carrying out a density correction process with respect to the plurality of halftone processes; and a density correction adjustment section for adjusting the density correction process carried out by the density correction process section, the density correction process section finding an output correction value of a reference halftone process of the plurality of halftone processes by use of a result of measurement of densities of respective patches of a patch pattern subjected to the reference halftone process, and finding an output correction value of at least one of the plurality of halftone processes which is other than the reference halftone process by conversion from the output correction value of the reference halftone process by use of a conversion parameter set for the at least one halftone process, the density correction adjustment section receiving an instruction to adjust the density correction process carried out by the density correction process section and reviewing the conversion parameter used by the density correction process section, so as to adjust the density correction process.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0023">According to the arrangement, the density correction adjustment section receives an instruction to adjust the density correction process carried out by the density correction process section and reviews the conversion parameter used by the density correction process section, so as to adjust the density correction process.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0024">According to this, also for a halftone process using a conversion parameter, the conversion parameter can be reviewed properly in accordance with a change over time in density characteristic of the halftone process and/or an individual difference between apparatuses. This enables enhancement of a density correction accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0025">Therefore, it is possible to make an image processing apparatus which carries out a density correction process with higher accuracy even by use of conversion as compared with a conventional arrangement in which a density correction process is carried out by use of a conversion parameter (a conversion value or a conversion expression) which cannot be rewritten and is fixed.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0026">As described earlier, the image processing apparatus in accordance with the present invention includes the density correction adjustment section receiving an instruction to adjust the density correction process carried out by the density correction process section and reviewing the conversion parameter used by the density correction process section, so as to adjust the density correction process.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0027">Therefore, the present invention yields an effect of making an image processing apparatus which carries out a density correction process with higher accuracy even by use of conversion as compared with a conventional arrangement in which a density correction process is carried out by use of a conversion parameter (a conversion value or a conversion expression) which cannot be rewritten and is fixed.</p>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0038">A first embodiment of the present invention is described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 7</figref>. The present embodiment discusses an application of an image processing apparatus in accordance with the present invention to an image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating an example of an arrangement of an image forming apparatus <b>100</b> including an image processing section <b>20</b> in accordance with the present invention. In accordance with image data read by the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> or received from outside, the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> forms a multicolor or single color image on a given recording sheet which is a recording material.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0040">The image forming apparatus <b>100</b> includes an apparatus body <b>110</b> and an automatically document processing device <b>121</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0041">The apparatus body <b>110</b> mainly includes an exposure unit <b>1</b>, developing units <b>2</b>, photoreceptor drums <b>3</b>, cleaner units <b>4</b>, chargers <b>5</b>, an intermediate transfer belt unit <b>6</b>, a fixing unit <b>7</b>, a paper feeding cassette <b>81</b>, a document reading device <b>90</b>, and a paper output tray <b>91</b>. The apparatus body <b>110</b> further includes the image processing section (image processing apparatus) <b>20</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0042">A platen <b>92</b> which is made of transparent glass and on which a document is placed is provided in an upper part of the apparatus body <b>110</b>, and the automatically document processing device <b>121</b> is provided above the platen <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0043">The automatically document processing device <b>121</b> automatically carries a document placed thereon to a reading position located in a vicinity of the platen <b>92</b>. The automatically document processing device <b>121</b>, which is rotatable about an axis which is parallel to a horizontal direction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, is arranged to uncover the platen <b>92</b>, so that a document can be manually placed on the platen <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0044">The document reading device <b>90</b> reads a document placed on the platen <b>92</b> or a document automatically carried to the reading position in the vicinity of the platen <b>92</b>. Then, an image forming section <b>42</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) receives image data indicative of an image of the read document.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0045">Image data handled by the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> correspond to color images of black (K), cyan (C), magenta (M), and yellow (Y). Accordingly, the number of each of (i) the developing units <b>2</b>, (ii) the photoreceptor drums <b>3</b>, (iii) the chargers <b>5</b>, and (iv) the cleaner units <b>4</b> is set to four so that four kinds of latent images corresponding to the respective colors are formed. A set of a developing unit <b>2</b>, a photoreceptor drum <b>3</b>, a charger <b>5</b>, and a cleaner unit <b>4</b> is provided for a corresponding one of black, cyan, magenta, and yellow, so that four image forming stations are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0046">The chargers <b>5</b> are charging devices for uniformly charging top surfaces of the respective photoreceptor drums <b>3</b> at a given electric potential. Not only a charger illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> but also a contact roller type charger or a brush type charger is usable as each of the chargers <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0047">The exposure unit <b>1</b>, which corresponds to an image writing device, is arranged as a laser scanning unit (LSU) mainly including a laser emitting section and a reflection mirror. A polygon mirror for scanning a laser beam and optical elements such as a lens and a mirror for guiding, to the photoreceptor drums <b>3</b>, laser light reflected by the polygon mirror are provided in the exposure unit <b>1</b>. Alternatively, for example, an arrangement using an EL or LED write head in which light emitting devices are arranged in an array pattern can be employed as the exposure unit <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0048">The exposure unit <b>1</b> has a function of subjecting the photoreceptor drums <b>3</b> thus charged to exposure in accordance with image data received, so as to form static latent images on the top surfaces of the respective photoreceptor drums <b>3</b> in accordance with the image data.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0049">The developing units <b>2</b> make the static latent images formed on the respective photoreceptor drums <b>3</b> visible as toner images by use of toners of four colors (YMCK).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0050">The cleaner units <b>4</b> remove and collect the toners remaining on the top surfaces of the respective photoreceptor drums <b>3</b> after development and image transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0051">The intermediate transfer belt unit <b>6</b> provided above the photoreceptor drums <b>3</b> includes an intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b>, an intermediate transfer belt driving roller <b>62</b>, an intermediate transfer belt driven roller <b>63</b>, intermediate transfer rollers <b>64</b>, and an intermediate transfer belt cleaning unit <b>65</b>. The number of the intermediate transfer rollers <b>64</b> is set to four so that the intermediate transfer rollers <b>64</b> correspond to the respective colors of YMCK.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0052">The intermediate transfer belt driving roller <b>62</b>, the intermediate transfer belt driven roller <b>63</b>, and the intermediate transfer rollers <b>64</b> stretch the intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b> so as to rotatably drive the intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b>. The intermediate transfer rollers <b>64</b> apply transfer biases, so as to transfer the toner images on the respective photoreceptor drums <b>3</b> onto the intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0053">The intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b> is provided so as to be in contact with the photoreceptor drums <b>3</b>. The intermediate transfer belt unit <b>6</b> forms a color toner image (multicolor toner image) thereon by sequentially superimposing the toner images of the respective colors formed on the respective photoreceptor drums <b>3</b> on the intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b> so as to transfer the toner images. The intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b> is made of, for example, a film having a thickness of approximately 100 &#x3bc;m to 150 &#x3bc;m so as to have no end.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0054">The intermediate transfer rollers <b>64</b> which are in contact with a backside of the intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b> transfer the toner images of the respective colors from the photoreceptor drums <b>3</b> onto the intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b>. High-voltage transfer biases (high voltages of polarity (+) reverse to charging polarity (&#x2212;) of toner) are applied to the respective intermediate transfer rollers <b>64</b> so that the toner images are transferred onto the intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0055">Each of the intermediate transfer rollers <b>64</b> is a roller whose base is a metal (e.g., stainless) shaft having a diameter of 8 mm to 10 mm and whose top surface is covered with an electroconductive elastic material (e.g., EPDM or urethane foam). Such an electroconductive elastic material enables uniform application of a high voltage to the intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b>. The present embodiment uses a roller type transfer electrode. Alternatively, a brush type transfer electrode or the like is also usable.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0056">As described earlier, the toner images made visible on the respective photoreceptor drums <b>3</b> in accordance with the respective colors are stacked on the intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b>. Rotation of the intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b> causes information on the images thus stacked to be transferred onto a recording sheet by a transfer roller <b>10</b> (described later) provided in a part in which the recording sheet and the intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b> are in contact with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0057">In this case, the intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b> and the transfer roller <b>10</b> are pressure-joined with a given nip, and a voltage (a high voltage of polarity (+) reverse to charging polarity (&#x2212;) of toner) is applied to the transfer roller <b>10</b> so that the toner images are transferred onto the recording sheet. Of the transfer roller <b>10</b> and the intermediate transfer belt driving roller <b>62</b>, one is made of a rigid material (e.g., metal) and the other is made of a flexible material (e.g., rubber or plastic foam), so that the given nip is obtained steadily.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0058">Toners which have been attached to the intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b> due to their contact with the photoreceptor drums <b>3</b> and remain on the intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b> without being transferred onto the recording sheet by the transfer roller <b>10</b> may cause a color mixture of the toners in a subsequent step. Therefore, the intermediate transfer belt cleaning unit <b>65</b> removes and collects the toners remaining on the intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0059">The intermediate transfer belt cleaning unit <b>65</b> includes a cleaning member such as a cleaning blade which is in contact with the intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b>. The driven roller <b>63</b> supports, from a backside of the intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b>, a part of the intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b> which part is in contact with the cleaning blade.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0060">A sensor (a detection section) <b>21</b> is provided to face a surface of the intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b> on which surface toner patches (described later) are formed. The sensor <b>21</b> is a reflective sensor for detecting densities of the respective toner patches formed on the intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0061">The paper feeding cassette <b>81</b>, which is a tray in which recording sheets to be used for image formation are accumulated, is provided under the exposure unit <b>1</b> of the apparatus body <b>110</b>. Recording sheets to be used for image formation can also be placed in a manual paper feeding cassette <b>82</b>. The paper output tray <b>91</b> provided above the apparatus body <b>110</b> is a tray in which printed recording sheets are accumulated facedown.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0062">The apparatus body <b>110</b> has a recording sheet carrying path S which is substantially vertical and through which the recording sheets in the paper feeding cassette <b>81</b> and the manual paper feeding cassette <b>82</b> are sent to the paper output tray <b>91</b> via the transfer roller <b>10</b> and the fixing unit <b>7</b>. Pickup rollers <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b</i>, a plurality of carrying rollers <b>12</b><i>a </i>through <b>12</b><i>d</i>, a registration roller <b>13</b>, the transfer roller <b>10</b>, the fixing unit <b>7</b>, etc. are provided in a vicinity of the recording sheet carrying path S from the paper feeding cassette <b>81</b> or the manual paper feeding cassette <b>82</b> to the paper output tray <b>91</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0063">The plurality of carrying rollers <b>12</b><i>a </i>through <b>12</b><i>d </i>are small rollers which are provided along the recording sheet carrying path S so as to accelerate and assist carriage of recording sheets. The pickup roller <b>11</b><i>a</i>, which is provided in a vicinity of an end of the paper feeding cassette <b>81</b>, picks up the recording sheets one by one from the paper feeding cassette <b>81</b>, so as to supply the recording sheets thus picked up to the recording sheet carrying path S. Similarly, the pickup roller <b>11</b><i>b</i>, which is provided in a vicinity of an end of the manual paper feeding cassette <b>82</b>, picks up the recording sheets one by one from the manual paper feeding cassette <b>82</b>, so as to supply the recording sheets thus picked up to the recording sheet carrying path S.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0064">The registration roller <b>13</b> temporarily holds a recording sheet which is being carried through the recording sheet carrying path S. The registration roller <b>13</b> carries the recording sheet to the transfer roller <b>10</b> at a timing at which an end of a toner image transferred onto the intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b> and a given part of the recording sheet are positionally adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0065">The fixing unit <b>7</b> includes a fixing roller <b>71</b> and a pressure roller <b>72</b>. The fixing roller <b>71</b> and the pressure roller <b>72</b> rotate with a recording sheet sandwiched therebetween. The image forming section <b>42</b> sets a temperature of the fixing roller <b>71</b> to not less than a given fixing temperature in accordance with a signal from a thermistor. The fixing roller <b>71</b> and the pressure roller <b>72</b> bond by thermocompression unfixed toner with the recording sheet, so as to melt, mix, and pressure-join the multicolor toner image transferred onto the recording sheet and then heat fix the resulting image to the recording sheet. A heater lump for heating the fixing roller <b>71</b> is provided in the fixing roller <b>71</b>. Note that the fixing temperature (given temperature) refers to a temperature at which a fixing process can be carried out favorably.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0066">The following description specifically discusses a recording sheet carrying path. As described earlier, the paper feeding cassette <b>81</b> and the manual paper feeding cassette <b>82</b> for storing recording sheets are preliminarily provided in the image forming apparatus <b>100</b>. The pickup rollers <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b </i>are provided for the paper feeding cassettes <b>81</b> and <b>82</b>, respectively so that the recording sheets are fed from the paper feeding cassettes <b>81</b> and <b>82</b>. The pickup rollers <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b </i>guide the recording sheets one by one to the recording sheet carrying path S.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0067">Each of the recording sheets is carried from the paper feeding cassette <b>81</b> or <b>82</b> to the registration roller <b>13</b> by the carrying roller <b>12</b><i>a </i>provided in the recording sheet carrying path S. The recording sheet is carried to the transfer roller <b>10</b> at a timing at which a given part of the recording sheet and an end of image information on the intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b> is positionally adjusted, so that the image information is written onto the recording sheet (namely, the toner image is transferred onto the recording sheet). Thereafter, the recording sheet passes through the fixing unit <b>7</b>, so that unfixed toner on the recording sheet is molten by heat to be fixed to the recording sheet. Then, the recording sheet is discharged to the paper output tray <b>91</b> via the carrying roller <b>12</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0068">The carrying path described earlier applies to a case where a request is made for carrying out single-side printing with respect to a recording sheet. In contrast, assume that a request is made for carrying out double-side printing with respect to the recording sheet. When the carrying roller <b>12</b><i>b</i>, which is the last carrying roller, holds a rear end of the recording sheet which has passed through the fixing unit <b>7</b> and has been subjected to single-side printing, the carrying roller <b>12</b><i>b </i>reversely rotates, so as to guide the recording sheet to the carrying roller <b>12</b><i>c </i>and the carrying roller <b>12</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0069">Note that a display section (not illustrated) for indicating information to a user and an instruction input section <b>41</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) for receiving an instruction from the user to the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> are provided in the upper part of the apparatus body <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0070">Note here that the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> in accordance with the present embodiment has a plurality of printing modes and properly uses a plurality of halftone processes in accordance with the respective plurality of printing modes so that gradation can be expressed favorably in accordance with the plurality of printing modes.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0071">Therefore, the image processing section <b>20</b> of the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> carries out a density correction with respect to the plurality of halftone processes so that density characteristics such as a printing density and a color tone are kept constant between the plurality of halftone processes.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a functional block diagram illustrating an arrangement of the image processing section <b>20</b> of the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> in accordance with the present embodiment. The image processing section <b>20</b> includes a halftone process section <b>38</b>, a density correction process section <b>30</b>, a density correction adjustment section <b>33</b>, a conversion value table storage section <b>22</b>, an output correction value table storage section <b>23</b>, and a sensor output value storage section <b>24</b>. Note that the image processing section <b>20</b> is constituted mainly by a CPU (Central Processing Unit), a ROM (Read Only Memory), and a RAM (Random Access Memory).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0073">The halftone process section <b>38</b> carries out a halftone process in accordance with a function and a mode with respect to image data. For example, the halftone process section <b>38</b> carries out the following five halftone processes A through E in accordance with a combination of a function and a mode.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0074">Halftone process A: dither method&#x2022;medium&#xb7;lpi (copy function&#x2014;for text and photograph mixture mode)</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0075">Halftone process B: simple quantization method (copy function&#x2014;all modes for text region)</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0076">Halftone process C: error diffusion method (copy function&#x2014;for text document mode)</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0077">Halftone process D: dither method&#x2022;low lpi (copy function&#x2014;for photograph mode)</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0078">Halftone process E: dither method&#x2022;high lpi (for printer function)</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0079">In the process control carried out at turn-on or when a change over time or an environmental change is detected, the density correction process section <b>30</b> carries out a density correction with respect to the plurality of halftone processes carried out by the halftone process section <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0080">The density correction process section <b>30</b> finds an output correction value of a reference halftone process in accordance with a result of actual measurement of densities of respective toner patches formed on the intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b>, the reference halftone process serving as one reference halftone process of the plurality of halftone processes carried out in the image forming apparatus <b>100</b>. The following description may refer to the output correction value of the reference halftone process found by actual measurement as a reference output correction value.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0081">The density correction process section <b>30</b> finds output correction values of halftone processes other than the reference halftone process (hereinafter referred to as the other halftone processes) in accordance with the reference output correction value by conversion by use of a conversion value table (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The following description may refer to the output correction values of the other halftone processes found by conversion from the reference output correction value as conversion output correction values as opposed to the reference output correction value.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0082">According to the present embodiment, the density correction process section <b>30</b> finds an output correction value (a reference output correction value) by actually measuring a patch density assuming that the halftone process A, i.e., dither method &#x2022;medium lpi is the reference halftone process, and the density correction process section <b>30</b> finds output correction values (conversion output correction values) of the halftone processes B through E by conversion.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0083">An output correction value table provided in the output correction value table storage section <b>23</b> stores the output correction values found by the density correction process section <b>30</b>. The output correction table stores the output correction values with respect to a given density value for each of the halftone processes. The halftone process section <b>38</b> reads out, from the output correction table, an output correction value corresponding to a halftone process to be carried out, so as to carry out the halftone process.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0084">The conversion value table storage section <b>22</b> stores the conversion value table. The conversion value table stores conversion values with respect to a given density value so that the conversion values correspond to the respective halftone processes whose output correction values are found by use of conversion values (specifically described later). The conversion value table storage section <b>22</b> is constituted by, for example, a nonvolatile memory so that data is held even after the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> turns off.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0085">The sensor output value storage section <b>24</b> stores sensor outputs which the density correction process section <b>30</b> uses to carry out a density correction in accordance with actual measurement and which serve as a reference for an output adjustment. How to find the sensor outputs serving as the reference for the output adjustment is to be described later. The sensor output value storage section <b>24</b> stores values (the sensor outputs) which are obtained when the sensor <b>21</b> (described later) reads patch densities as much as 15 points indicative of a density characteristic of the image forming section <b>42</b> for each of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. The sensor output value storage section <b>24</b> is also constituted by a nonvolatile memory since data needs to be held even after the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> turns off.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0086">The density correction adjustment section <b>33</b> receives, from the instruction input section <b>41</b>, an instruction to adjust a density correction process. Then, the density correction adjustment section <b>33</b> reviews the conversion value table which stores the conversion values (conversion parameters) to be used by the density correction process section <b>30</b> for calculation of output correction values, so as to adjust the density correction process.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0087">The following description more specifically discusses the density correction process section <b>30</b> and the density correction adjustment section <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0088">First, the density correction process section <b>30</b> is to be described. The density correction process section includes an output correction value actual measurement section <b>31</b>, an output correction value conversion section <b>32</b>, and an internal patch formation instruction section <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0089">In the process control, in response to an instruction from the output correction value actual measurement section <b>31</b>, the internal patch formation instruction section <b>34</b> generates a command to form an internal patch pattern subjected to the reference halftone process, so as to give the command to the image forming section <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0090">According to the present embodiment, in order to adjust the density correction process, the internal patch formation instruction section <b>34</b> generates a command to form an internal patch pattern subjected to a halftone process carried out as instructed from the density correction adjustment section <b>33</b>, so as to give the command to the image forming section <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0091">The image forming section <b>42</b> which has obtained the command mainly controls the image forming stations (described earlier) to form the internal patch pattern on the intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b>. Note here that a patch which is merely formed on the intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b> but is not printed out is referred to as an internal patch.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0092">In the process control, the output correction value actual measurement section <b>31</b> carries out a density correction with respect to the reference halftone process by actual patch density measurement, so as to update the output correction value of the reference halftone process which is stored in the output correction value table.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0093">More specifically, the output correction value actual measurement section <b>31</b> instructs the internal patch formation instruction section <b>34</b> to form an internal patch pattern subjected to the reference halftone process. The sensor <b>21</b> reads a patch density of the internal patch pattern formed on the intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b>. From sensor outputs of the sensor <b>21</b> which has read the patch density of the internal patch pattern thus formed, the output correction value actual measurement section <b>31</b> determines a patch which is identical in value to a sensor output stored in the sensor output storage section <b>24</b> and serving as the reference for the output adjustment, so as to set, to an output correction value, an output value used to form the determined patch.

<p id="p-0107" num="0108">Namely, in response to the instruction to adjust the reference halftone process, the density correction adjustment section <b>33</b> newly finds a reference output correction value so as to update the reference output correction value stored in the output correction value table, and recalculates the conversion values of all the halftone processes stored in the conversion value table so that conversion values of the other halftone processes which have been obtained by conversion from the new output correction value of the reference halftone process are identical to output correction values obtained by conversion from the reference output correction value which is old and has not been updated.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0109">The following description specifically discusses processes carried out in the image processing section <b>20</b> and including the density correction adjustment process carried out by the density correction adjustment section <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0110">First, how to prepare a conversion value table is to be described. Note that it is desirable to set a conversion value table for each image forming apparatus so that an individual difference between apparatuses can be absorbed. However, a common conversion value table prepared in accordance with actual measurement is commonly preliminarily set for image forming apparatuses of an identical model.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an example of the conversion value table. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the reference output correction value which is the output correction value of the reference halftone process (hereinafter referred to as a reference halftone process A) and serves as a reference for calculation of a conversion value is stored in a first tier of the conversion value table. Conversion values of the other halftone processes (hereinafter referred to as the other halftone processes B through E) are stored in second through fifth tiers of the conversion value table.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0112">In order to make it easy to understand how output correction values are calculated by use of conversion values, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the example as if the reference output correction value was also stored in the conversion value table. However, what is described in the first tier shows the reference output correction value stored in the output correction value table.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0113">Note that it is not necessarily required that a conversion value table preparation section (not illustrated) be provided in the image processing section <b>20</b>. Alternatively, a conversion value table commonly set for image forming apparatuses of an identical model can be initially set for the conversion value table storage section <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0114">The conversion value table preparation section causes the image forming section <b>42</b> to print a patch set (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) on a recording sheet in a state where no output adjustment is carried out. The patch set forms a plurality of patches for each of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. According to the present embodiment, since a density value indicative of the density characteristic of the image forming section <b>42</b> is set to 15 points, 32 patches which are sufficiently more than 15 points are formed for each of the colors. Note here that data on the patch set can be preliminarily stored in the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> or can be received from an external PC. The document reading device <b>90</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) reads the recording sheet thus printed.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0115">From a result of reading by the document reading device <b>90</b> of the patch set which has been printed on the recording sheet, the conversion value table preparation section selects, for each of the colors, 15 patches which correspond to the density value of 15 points that are suitable for defining a curved line and indicative of the density characteristic of the image forming section <b>42</b>. Then, the conversion value table preparation section causes the selected 15 patches to be formed on the intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b>, so as to cause the sensor to read reflectances (densities) of the respective patches. The sensor output value storage section <b>24</b> stores the reflectances of the respective patches read here as sensor output values serving as the reference for the output adjustment. The sensor output values which are stored in the sensor output value storage section <b>24</b> and correspond to the reflectances of the respective patches thus serve as a reference for a density correction to be carried out in a subsequent process control.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0116">Next, the conversion value table preparation section instructs the internal patch formation instruction section <b>34</b> to form an internal patch pattern subjected to the reference halftone process A. From sensor outputs of the sensor <b>21</b> which has read a patch density of the internal patch pattern formed on the intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b>, the conversion value table preparation section determines a patch which is identical in value to a sensor output value stored in the sensor output storage section <b>24</b> and serving as the reference for the output adjustment, so as to set, to a reference output correction value, an output value used to form the determined patch. The output correction value table stores the reference output correction value.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0117">For example, in a case where a density of a patch formed by the reference halftone process A when an input value is &#x201c;118&#x201d; is identical to a density of a patch formed when an input value stored in the sensor output value storage section <b>24</b> is &#x201c;128&#x201d;, a registered output correction value of the reference halftone process A is set to &#x201c;118&#x201d; with respect to the input value of &#x201c;128&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0118">Similarly, the conversion value table preparation section causes the internal patch formation instruction section <b>34</b> to form internal patch patterns subjected to the other halftone processes B through E, so as to find, also by actual measurement, output correction values of the other halftone processes B through E. In this case, differently from the case of the reference halftone process A, the output correction values of the other halftone processes B through E found by actual measurement are not stored as they are but are stored in the form of conversion values with respect to the reference output correction value of the reference halftone process A.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0119">In the example of the conversion value table of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a ratio to the reference output correction value is stored as a conversion value for the halftone process B. Differences from the reference output correction value are stored as conversion values for the halftone processes C through E. Equations (1) and (2) by which a conversion value is calculated are described below.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0120">When a conversion value is a ratio:
<br/>

<p id="p-0120" num="0121">When a conversion value is a difference:

</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0122"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an example of a program for calculating a conversion value to be stored in the conversion value table. For example, a program as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> enables calculation of a conversion value.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0123">The conversion value table in which the conversion values of the other halftone processes B through E are stored are thus prepared so that conversion output correction values are calculated by use of the reference output correction value of the reference halftone process A.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0124">The following description discusses the density correction process carried out in the process control at turn-on or when a change over time or an environmental charge is detected.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0125">in the process control, in response to the instruction from the output correction value actual measurement section <b>31</b>, the internal patch formation instruction section <b>34</b> generates a command to form the internal patch pattern subjected to the reference halftone process A, so as to give the command to the image forming section <b>42</b>. The image forming section <b>42</b> which has obtained the command mainly controls the image forming stations (described earlier) to form the internal patch pattern on the intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0126">The sensor <b>21</b> reads a patch density of the internal patch pattern thus formed.

Then, the output correction value actual measurement section <b>31</b> sets, to an output correction value, an output value used to form the determined patch, so as to update the reference output correction value of the reference halftone process stored in the output correction value table.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0127">In response to the update to the reference output correction value stored in the output correction value table, the output correction value conversion section <b>32</b> calculates conversion output correction values of the other halftone processes B through E by use of the updated reference output correction value and the conversion values stored in the conversion value table, so as to update the output correction values of the other halftone processes B through E stored in the output correction value table.

<p id="p-0129" num="0130">As described earlier, the density correction process section <b>30</b> forms an internal patch pattern for only the reference halftone process A, so as to calculate an output correction value by actual patch density measurement. The density correction process section <b>30</b> calculates, by conversion, conversion correction values for the other halftone processes B through E without forming internal patch patterns. This enables a reduction in printing material and processing time.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0131">The following description discusses the density correction adjustment process in which the density correction process is adjusted by reviewing the conversion values stored in the conversion value table. As described earlier, in the common density correction process carried out in the process control or the like, the density correction is carried out with respect to the other halftone processes B through E by calculating output correction values by conversion.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0132">However, in a case where a conversion value is fixed and density characteristics of the halftone processes A through E change over time or a property of an apparatus is not in conformity with a commonly set conversion value, a density characteristic assumed when the conversion value is set and an actual density characteristic may not match.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0133">According to the image processing section <b>20</b> in accordance with the present embodiment, for example, in a case where a density abnormality occurs in a printed image due to a change over time in density characteristics of the other halftone processes B through E, the density correction adjustment section <b>33</b> receives an instruction from the user, so as to rewrite, in accordance with the instruction, conversion values which (i) are associated with the other halftone processes in which the density abnormality has occurred and (ii) are stored in the conversion value table.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0134"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flow chart illustrating how the image processing section <b>20</b> carries out the density correction adjustment process when the density adjustment instruction is given to the other halftone processes.

<p id="p-0134" num="0135">When the density correction adjustment section <b>33</b> receives the instruction inputted at S<b>1</b>, the actual measurement instruction section <b>37</b> gives the instruction to the internal patch formation instruction section <b>34</b> via the output correction value actual measurement section <b>31</b>. The internal patch formation instruction section <b>34</b> generates a command to form an internal patch pattern subjected to the halftone process C, so as to give the command to the image forming section <b>42</b>. The image forming section <b>42</b> which has obtained the command mainly controls the image forming stations to form, on the intermediate transfer belt <b>61</b>, the internal patch pattern subjected to the halftone process C (S<b>2</b>).</p>

Then, the conversion value calculation section <b>36</b> and the conversion value table update section <b>39</b> of the density correction adjustment section <b>33</b> rewrite the conversion values in accordance with the new output correction value thus determined (S<b>5</b>).

<p id="p-0156" num="0157">However, a change of reference halftone processes enables an output adjustment which is more suitable for a user's mode of use. For example, in a case where one of the plurality of halftone processes which is used most frequently is changed to a reference halftone process, it is possible to more properly express halftone of an image formed by the reference halftone process.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0158"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example of an arrangement of an image processing section <b>120</b> in accordance with the present embodiment. The image processing section <b>120</b> further includes a counter (a counting section) <b>25</b> and a reference halftone process changing section <b>35</b> in addition to members of the image processing section <b>20</b> described in the First Embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0159">The counter <b>25</b> measures a frequency of use of the plurality of halftone processes in a given period.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0160">The reference halftone process changing section <b>35</b> selects a halftone process from the plurality of halftone processes and changes the selected halftone process to a reference halftone process in accordance with an instruction from the user or the frequency of use measured by the counter <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0161">Note that the other members of the image processing section <b>120</b> are identical to those of the image processing section <b>20</b> described in the First Embodiment and a description thereof is omitted here.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0162">The following description discusses how the image processing section <b>120</b> carries out the reference halftone process changing process. Note that as in the case of the First Embodiment, the image forming apparatus of the present embodiment is arranged such that five halftone processes A through E are carried out and the halftone process A is set as a reference halftone process.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0163"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a flow chart illustrating how the image processing section <b>120</b> carries out the reference halftone process changing process. First, the reference halftone process changing section <b>35</b> determines a frequency of use of the halftone processes A through E in a given period, the frequency having been measured by the counter <b>25</b> (S<b>31</b>) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0164">In accordance with the frequency of use determined at S<b>31</b>, the reference halftone process changing section <b>35</b> selects, as a reference halftone process, a halftone process which is used most frequently (S<b>32</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0165">Next, the reference halftone process changing section <b>35</b> determines whether or not it is necessary to rewrite the reference halftone process (S<b>33</b>), Specifically, the image processing section <b>120</b> determines whether or not a reference halftone process set at the time of the determination by the reference halftone process changing section <b>35</b> and the halftone process selected at S<b>32</b> are identical (S<b>33</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0166">In a case where it is unnecessary to rewrite the reference halftone process (NO at S<b>33</b>), i.e., in a case where the reference halftone process set at the time of the determination by the reference halftone process changing section <b>35</b> and the reference halftone process selected at S<b>32</b> are identical, the reference halftone process changing section <b>35</b> finishes carrying out the reference halftone process changing process.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0167">In contrast, in a case where it is necessary to rewrite the reference halftone process (YES at S<b>33</b>), i.e., in a case where the reference halftone process set at the time of the determination by the reference halftone process changing section <b>35</b> and the reference halftone process selected at S<b>32</b> are not identical, the reference halftone process changing section <b>35</b> rewrites a reference output correction value stored in a conversion value table (S<b>34</b>). For example, in a case where the halftone process C is used most frequently, the reference halftone process changing section <b>35</b> sets the halftone process C as a new reference halftone process instead of the halftone process A, so as to rewrite the conversion value table.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0168">Specifically, the reference halftone process changing section <b>35</b> calculates a reference output correction value of the halftone process C by calculating a difference between a reference output correction value (an output correction value table) of the halftone process A and a conversion value (the conversion value table) of the halftone process C.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0169">Next, the reference halftone process changing section <b>35</b> not only sets a conversion value of the halftone process A but also rewrites conversion values (S<b>35</b>). Specifically, the reference halftone process changing section <b>35</b> rewrites the conversion values by calculating conversion values with respect to the reference output correction value of the halftone process C for the other halftone processes A, B, D, and E. A process carried out in this case is substantially identical to that carried out at S<b>16</b> in the flow chart illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0170">As described earlier, according to the image processing section <b>120</b> in accordance with the present embodiment, it is possible to not only review registered conversion values but also change reference halftone processes. Therefore, a density correction is carried out in which a halftone process that is used most frequently by the user is a reference halftone process. This allows implementation of an optimum density correction process in accordance with a user's mode of use.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0171">Note that, though the present embodiment discussed an arrangement in which a halftone process that is used most frequently is selected to be changed to a reference halftone process, the present invention is not limited to this. For example, the present invention can be arranged such that reference halftone processes are not changed in a case where a difference between a frequency of use of a reference halftone process set at the time of determination whether or not it is necessary to rewrite the reference halftone process and a frequency of use of the halftone process that is used most frequently is less than a threshold which is separately set.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0172">Note also that, though the present embodiment discussed an arrangement in which the counter <b>25</b> is provided and reference halftone processes are changed in accordance with a frequency of use measured by the counter <b>25</b>, the present invention is not limited to this. For example, the present invention can be arranged such that no counter <b>25</b> is provided and a reference halftone process changing process is carried out in accordance with a reference halftone process changing instruction inputted into an instruction input section <b>41</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Summary of Embodiments</heading>
<p id="p-0172" num="0173">The image forming apparatus in accordance with the embodiments having a function of carrying out a plurality of halftone processes, the image forming apparatus includes: a density correction process section for carrying out a density correction process with respect to the plurality of halftone processes; and a density correction adjustment section for adjusting the density correction process carried out by the density correction process section, the density correction process section finding an output correction value of a reference halftone process of the plurality of halftone processes by use of a result of measurement of densities of respective patches of a patch pattern subjected to the reference halftone process, and finding an output correction value of at least one of the plurality of halftone processes which is other than the reference halftone process by conversion from the output correction value of the reference halftone process by use of a conversion parameter set for the at least one halftone process, the density correction adjustment section receiving an instruction to adjust the density correction process carried out by the density correction process section and reviewing the conversion parameter used by the density correction process section, so as to adjust the density correction process.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0174">According to the arrangement, the density correction adjustment section receives an instruction to adjust the density correction process carried out by the density correction process section and reviews the conversion parameter used by the density correction process section, so as to adjust the density correction process.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0175">According to this, also for a halftone process using a conversion parameter, the conversion parameter can be reviewed properly in accordance with a change over time in density characteristic of the halftone process and/or an individual difference between apparatuses. This enables enhancement of a density correction accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0176">Therefore, according to the embodiments, it is possible to make an image processing apparatus which carries out a density correction process with higher accuracy even by use of conversion as compared with a conventional arrangement in which a density correction process is carried out by use of a conversion parameter (a conversion value or a conversion expression) which cannot be rewritten and is fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0177">The image processing apparatus in accordance with the embodiments can be arranged such that: the density correction adjustment section includes: a first output correction value actual measurement section for, in response to an instruction to adjust a halftone process of the plurality of halftone processes which is other than the reference halftone process, finding an output correction value of the halftone process by use of a result of measurement of densities of respective patches of a patch pattern subjected to the halftone process whose adjustment has been instructed; a first conversion parameter calculation section for, in accordance with (i) the output correction value found by the first output correction value actual measurement section and (ii) the output correction value of the reference halftone process already found by the density correction process section, finding a new conversion parameter for the halftone process whose adjustment has been instructed; and a first conversion parameter update section for updating a conversion parameter of the halftone process whose adjustment has been instructed to the new conversion parameter calculated by the first conversion parameter calculation section.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0178">According to the arrangement, in response to an instruction to adjust a halftone process of the plurality of halftone processes which is other than the reference halftone process, a first output correction value actual measurement section gives an instruction to form a patch pattern subjected to the halftone process whose adjustment has been instructed, so as to find an output correction value of the halftone process by actual measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0179">After the output correction value has been found by actual measurement, in accordance with (i) the output correction value found by actual measurement and (ii) the output correction value of the reference halftone process already found by the density correction process section, a first conversion parameter calculation section finds a new conversion parameter for the halftone process whose adjustment has been instructed, and a first conversion parameter update section updates a conversion parameter of the halftone process whose adjustment has been instructed to the new conversion parameter calculated by the first conversion parameter calculation section.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0180">According to this, it is possible to easily make an image processing apparatus in which for a halftone process using a conversion parameter to carry out a density correction process, the conversion parameter can be reviewed properly in accordance with a change over time in density characteristic of the halftone process and/or an individual difference between apparatuses in response to an instruction to adjust the density correction process carried out by the halftone process.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0181">The image processing apparatus in accordance with the embodiments can be arranged such that: the density correction adjustment section includes: a second output correction value actual measurement section for, in response to an instruction to adjust the reference halftone process of the plurality of halftone processes, finding an output correction value of the reference halftone process by use of the result of the measurement of the densities of the respective patches of the patch pattern subjected to the reference halftone process; a second conversion parameter calculation section for finding new conversion parameters for all the halftone processes having conversion parameters in accordance with (i) the output correction value of the reference halftone process found by the second output correction value actual measurement section, (ii) the output correction value of the reference halftone process already found by the density correction process section, and (iii) predetermined conversion parameters so that an output correction value found by conversion from the output correction value of the reference halftone process found by the second output correction value actual measurement section is identical to an output correction value found by conversion from the output correction value of the reference halftone process already found by the density correction process section; and a second conversion parameter update section for updating the conversion parameters of all the halftone processes to the new conversion parameters calculated by the second conversion parameter calculation section.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0182">According to the arrangement, in response to an instruction to adjust the reference halftone process of the plurality of halftone processes, a second output correction value actual measurement section gives an instruction to form a patch pattern subjected to the reference halftone process, so as to find an output correction value of the reference halftone process by actual measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0183">After the output correction value of the reference halftone process has been found by actual measurement, a second conversion parameter calculation section finds new conversion parameters for all the halftone processes having conversion parameters in accordance with (i) the output correction value of the reference halftone process found by the second output correction value actual measurement section, (ii) the output correction value of the reference halftone process already found by the density correction process section, and (iii) predetermined conversion parameters, and a second conversion parameter update section updates the conversion parameters of all the halftone processes to the new conversion parameters calculated by the second conversion parameter calculation section.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0184">Note here that the second conversion parameter calculation section finds the new conversion parameters so that an output correction value found by conversion from the output correction value of the reference halftone process found by the second output correction value actual measurement section is identical to an output correction value found by conversion from the output correction value of the reference halftone process already found by the density correction process section.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0185">According to this, in a case where an adjustment instruction is given to the reference halftone process, it is possible to adjust only the density correction process carried out by the reference halftone process while conversion parameters of the other halftone processes, which do not need to be adjusted, are rewritten so that output values of the other halftone processes remain unchanged before and after the reference halftone process is adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0186">The image forming apparatus in accordance with the embodiments can be arranged to further include a reference halftone process changing section which enables a change of reference halftone processes in the density correction process section.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0187">According to the arrangement, a reference halftone process changing section enables a change of reference halftone processes in the density correction process section. Therefore, it is possible to not only review a conversion parameter but also change, in accordance with user's needs, reference halftone processes in which a density correction process is carried out in accordance with actual measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0188">The image forming apparatus in accordance with the embodiments can be arranged to further include: a counting section for measuring a frequency of use, in a given period, of the plurality of halftone processes, each being a possible reference halftone process, the reference halftone process changing section setting, as a reference halftone process, a halftone process of the plurality of halftone processes whose frequency of use measured by the counting section is the highest.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0189">According to the arrangement, a counting section measures a frequency of use, in a given period, of the plurality of halftone processes, each being a possible reference halftone process, and the reference halftone process changing section sets a halftone process of the plurality of halftone processes whose frequency of use is the highest as a reference halftone process whose output correction value is found by the density correction process section by use of a result of measurement of densities of respective patches of a patch pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0190">This allows a density correction process to be carried out in accordance with actual measurement with respect to a halftone process which is used by the user most frequently. Therefore, it is possible to carry out a density correction process which further meets user's needs.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0191">The image forming apparatus in accordance with the embodiments can be arranged such that the conversion parameter is a conversion value. The image forming apparatus in accordance with the embodiments can be arranged such that the conversion value is a difference from or a ratio to the output correction value of the reference halftone process.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0192">An image forming apparatus includes an image processing apparatus mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0193">According to the arrangement, it is possible to make an image forming apparatus in which a density correction is carries out with higher accuracy in a halftone process using conversion.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0194">Note that it is possible to cause a computer to implement an image processing apparatus mentioned above.
