<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A computer-implemented service integrates with merchant sites to enable registered users of the service to perform purchase transactions on the merchant sites. In one embodiment, a merchant can incorporate a reference to a display object served by the service into coding of a page of the merchant's site. When the page is loaded by a user's browser, the reference causes the browser to request the display object from the service for display on the page. If the user is recognized by the service, the service may return a personalized display object that includes functionality for the user to perform a purchase transaction using the service. Also disclosed are embodiments that enable users to initiate transfers of personal account information to the merchant sites.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 13/436,440, filed Mar. 30, 2012, which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 13/006,171, filed Jan. 13, 2011 (now U.S. Pat. No. 8,160,935), which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12/357,211, filed Jan. 21, 2009 (now U.S. Pat.

The disclosures of the aforesaid applications are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates generally to computer-implemented services for enabling users to conduct purchase transactions on third party merchant sites.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Consumers today routinely shop and make purchases of products and services over the Internet using web browsers. Numerous Internet merchants have set up web sites allowing customers to browse through descriptions of products and services. After the customer has selected one or more products for purchase, Internet merchants typically provide the customer with a checkout page requesting payment information from the customer. The payment information usually comprises a credit card number, expiration date, cardholder name, and any other information that may be required to authorize a charge against the customer's card. If applicable, shipping information may also be requested on the checkout page.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is often considered an inconvenience for a customer to have to enter in the often lengthy amount of information required to process a credit card transaction each time the customer makes a purchase. As a consequence, a number of merchants allow the customer to select a user ID and a password when providing payment and/or delivery information. The merchant catalogs the customer's information and associates it with the user ID and password. In this manner the customer only needs to enter in her user ID and password in order to make subsequent purchases. Customers typically, however, make purchases from more than one merchant. Different merchants may have different formats for a user ID and a password. Furthermore, a customer's preferred user ID may already be in use by another customer at a particular merchant. Consequently, a customer will likely have to remember several user IDs and/or passwords.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another solution to the inconvenience of filling out lengthy forms, called a wallet or digital wallet, has been suggested. A digital wallet typically comprises a small software layer that functions in conjunction with a web browser on the customer's computer. The wallet stores customer payment and/or delivery information on the customer's computer and provides the information to merchants using a standardized protocol upon the direction of the customer. Many customers, however, consider the process of downloading, installing, and configuring the wallet software too complicated, time consuming or burdensome.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another advance is the advent by Amazon.com of 1-Click&#x2122; shopping. With this feature, the user initially specifies a credit card, shipping address, shipping method, and/or other default information to be used for 1-Click purchases, and can thereafter purchase items with a single mouse click. The 1-Click feature involves placing an identifying cookie on the customer's computer. The customer's web browser returns the cookie to Amazon.com's web server when the web site is accessed. The web server can then read the cookie to identify the customer and present to the customer a web page with the option of purchasing a product with a single click using the information already on file. Additional details of the 1-Click feature are set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5,960,411, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Other solutions (see, e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,715,314 and 5,815,665) involve the use of a third party payment or brokering service. The customer first registers with the payment or brokering service. The payment or brokering service can then authenticate the customer during subsequent transactions with merchants. The payment or brokering service bills the customer for each authorized transaction and provides payments to the merchants.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which show, by way of illustration, specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. Numerous specific details of these embodiments are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be obvious to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without the specific details or with certain alternative components and methods to those described herein. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, and components have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">I. System Components</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the principal components of a preferred embodiment of a customer authentication and data transfer system <b>100</b>. A customer <b>102</b> can be any entity or individual that wishes to make purchases of products or services from a merchant <b>104</b>. The merchant <b>104</b> is preferably an entity that sells products or services from a merchant web site <b>106</b>, which is implemented using one or more physical servers <b>108</b>. In order to select and purchase products or services, the customer <b>102</b> preferably uses a web browser <b>109</b> running on a computer <b>110</b>. The computer <b>110</b> is connected to the merchant server <b>108</b> through a communications network <b>112</b>, which is preferably the Internet.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In order to make purchases, the customer <b>102</b> typically provides various types of customer information to merchants <b>104</b>. The customer information may include, for example, the customer's name, shipping address(es), email address, payment information, 1-Click settings, and the names and addresses of common gift recipients. The customer may also be required to provide authentication information, such as a user ID (which may be the user's email address) and password. The merchant <b>104</b> may also collect and store various other types of customer information, including purchase histories and other data that indicates customers' interests.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The information service <b>114</b> is an entity that serves as an intermediary for providing customer information to the merchant <b>104</b> in a secure and convenient manner through the communications network <b>112</b>. The customer <b>102</b>, using the computer <b>110</b>, interacts with the information service <b>114</b> through an information service web site <b>116</b> that is serviced by an information service server <b>118</b>. The information service server <b>118</b> prompts the user to enter various types of customer information and authentication information and stores and associates this information in a database <b>120</b>. The information service <b>114</b>, through its server <b>118</b> and database <b>120</b>, authenticates the customer <b>102</b> using the authentication information, and electronically provides some or all of the customer's information to the merchant <b>104</b> and possibly other merchants. For purposes of the following description, the terms &#x201c;customer information&#x201d; and &#x201c;customer's information&#x201d; will be used to refer primarily to information other than the authentication information (user ID and password).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the context of the present disclosure, actions indicated as being taken by the customer <b>102</b> are preferably performed by or through, as applicable, the web browser <b>109</b> and/or the computer <b>110</b>. Actions indicated as being taken by the merchant <b>104</b> are preferably performed by or through, as applicable, the merchant server <b>108</b> and its associated software components. Actions indicated as being taken by the information service <b>114</b> are preferably performed by or through, as applicable, the information service server <b>114</b> and its associated software components. The computers and servers referenced herein are preferably general-purpose computers, although application-specific hardware could be used to perform certain tasks.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one preferred embodiment, the information service <b>114</b> is also an Internet merchant, separate and different from the merchant <b>104</b>. Accordingly, the information service <b>114</b> typically will have available to it an existing database of customer information acquired as an Internet merchant. Existing customers of the information service <b>114</b> (as an Internet merchant) will preferably be able to use the customer authentication and data transfer system <b>100</b>, without an additional registration, to make purchases from merchants <b>104</b> other than the information service <b>114</b>. For example, Amazon.com, acting as an information service <b>114</b>, can provide its customers the option to shop from web sites of other merchants (e.g. www.gap.com) using their Amazon.com user IDs and passwords. Although the information service <b>114</b> is preferably an Internet merchant, it may alternatively be a non-merchant entity.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">II. General Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A general embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. This general embodiment is intended to illustrate the basic operation of the customer authentication and data transfer system <b>100</b>. The three following sections will describe three specific embodiments based upon the general embodiment presented in this section.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A. Methods and Data Flows</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-B</figref> are two flowcharts <b>200</b>, <b>220</b> illustrating the operation of the general embodiment of the system <b>100</b>. The flowcharts <b>200</b>, <b>220</b> are presented in a three column format wherein the actions performed by each of the customer <b>102</b>, the information service <b>114</b>, and the merchant <b>104</b> are depicted in a respective column under the name of the acting entity. The remaining flowcharts in this disclosure also follow the same format.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a data flow diagram <b>300</b> showing the transfer of information between the customer <b>102</b>, the information service <b>114</b>, and the merchant <b>104</b> in accordance with the general embodiment. Information sent between the customer <b>102</b>, the information service <b>114</b>, and the merchant <b>104</b> is preferably sent through the computer <b>110</b>, the information service server <b>118</b>, or the merchant server <b>108</b> over the communications network <b>112</b>. In the alternative, the information service <b>114</b> could communicate with the merchant <b>104</b> over a separate communications network <b>112</b> other than the one used between the information service <b>114</b> and the customer <b>102</b>. For example, the transfer of customer information from the information provider <b>114</b> to the merchant <b>104</b> could occur over a direct dial telephone connection.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In steps <b>202</b>-<b>206</b> of the flowchart <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> a merchant <b>114</b> registers to use the authentication and data transfer system <b>100</b>. At a first step <b>202</b>, the information service <b>114</b> solicits merchants to register to use the system <b>100</b>. The solicitation can be accomplished through Internet advertising, e-mail, or any off-line forms of solicitation typically used by businesses. At a next step <b>204</b>, a merchant registers with the information service <b>114</b>. The registration can be performed on-line, through the information service web site <b>116</b>, or off-line, through conventional means. At step <b>204</b>, the identity of the merchant and its server information are preferably stored in the information service's database <b>120</b>. At a next step <b>206</b>, the information service <b>114</b> and the merchant <b>104</b> establish a secure communications link over the communications network <b>112</b> through which customer information and other information can be transferred. Step <b>206</b> may involve the installation and configuration of software on the merchant server <b>114</b>. Steps <b>202</b>-<b>206</b> are generally depicted in the data flow diagram <b>300</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) by the two-way link <b>302</b> between the information service <b>114</b> and the merchant <b>104</b>, titled &#x201c;Merchant Registration.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The process of registering merchants as in steps <b>202</b>-<b>206</b> is suggested primarily to improve the security aspects of the present invention, but is not essential to its operation. By registering the merchant <b>104</b>, the information service <b>114</b> can request information sufficient to verify that the merchant <b>104</b> is a valid business concern. In this manner, the information service <b>114</b> can, by one method, avoid inadvertently providing sensitive information to illegitimate entities. In alternative embodiments, steps <b>202</b>-<b>206</b> could be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In steps <b>210</b>-<b>214</b> of the flowchart <b>200</b> a customer <b>102</b> registers to use the authentication and data transfer system <b>100</b>. In the illustrated example, steps <b>202</b>-<b>206</b> occur before steps <b>210</b>-<b>214</b>, however, steps <b>210</b>-<b>214</b> could occur before or at the same time as steps <b>202</b>-<b>206</b>. At step <b>210</b>, the information service <b>114</b> solicits customers to register with the service and to provide customer information, a user ID, and a password. The solicitation may be accomplished either on-line on the Internet or through conventional means. At step <b>212</b>, the customer <b>102</b> registers with the information service <b>114</b> and provides customer information, a user ID, and a password. This registration is preferably performed through the information service web site <b>116</b> and may be performed in conjunction with a purchase made from the information service <b>114</b>. At a next step <b>214</b>, the information service <b>114</b> associates and stores the customer information, the user ID, and the password in the database <b>120</b>. Steps <b>210</b>-<b>214</b> are generally depicted in the data flow diagram <b>300</b> by the two-way link <b>304</b> between the customer <b>102</b> and the information service <b>114</b> titled &#x201c;Customer Registration.&#x201d; Many merchants <b>104</b> and many customers <b>102</b> will typically register with the information service <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring now to the flowchart <b>220</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the customer <b>102</b> browses at the merchant web site <b>106</b> and identifies product(s) and/or service(s) for purchase at step <b>222</b>. The exchange of web pages and selections by the customer <b>102</b> and merchant <b>104</b> are indicated by the two-way link <b>306</b> in the data flow diagram <b>300</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the customer information may be transferred to the merchant <b>104</b> without requiring the customer <b>102</b> to make a purchase. At a next step <b>224</b> of the flowchart <b>220</b>, the customer <b>102</b> requests (implicitly or explicitly) that the information service <b>114</b> provide the customer information to the merchant <b>104</b>. The request of step <b>224</b> is indicated by the one-way link <b>308</b> from the customer <b>102</b> to the information service <b>114</b> in the data flow diagram <b>300</b>. The request <b>308</b> results from a particular action by the customer <b>102</b>, such as a clicking on a &#x201c;transfer information&#x201d; link on the information service web site <b>116</b> or a clicking on a &#x201c;purchase&#x201d; link on the merchant web site <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">At step <b>226</b>, the information service <b>114</b> authenticates the customer <b>102</b>, preferably by requesting that the customer <b>102</b> provide the user ID and password. Step <b>226</b> is depicted by a larger block that extends above and below steps <b>222</b> and <b>224</b> to emphasize that the authentication step need not occur at a specific time relative to steps <b>222</b> and <b>224</b>. Although other steps are shown throughout the drawings in a particular order, it will be recognized that the order can be varied in many instances. The authentication of step <b>226</b> is indicated by the two-way link <b>310</b> between the customer <b>102</b> and the information service <b>114</b> in the data flow diagram <b>300</b>. Once steps <b>224</b> and <b>226</b> have been completed, the information service <b>114</b> provides some or all of the customer's information to the merchant <b>104</b> at step <b>228</b>. The transfer of the customer information of step <b>228</b> is indicated by the one-way link <b>312</b> from the information service <b>114</b> to the merchant <b>104</b> in the data flow diagram <b>300</b>. At step <b>230</b>, the merchant <b>104</b> receives the transferred customer information and processes the transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the preferred embodiment, the user ID is the e-mail address of customer <b>102</b>, and the password is a secret code selected by the customer <b>102</b>. The customer information transferred to the merchant preferably includes payment and delivery information, such as, for example, a customer name, a credit card number, a credit card expiration date, a billing address, and a delivery address. The transferred customer information may also include, for example, a preferred shipment method, the customer's 1-Click settings, and the names and addresses of gift recipients. The transferred information may also include the customer's purchase history (optionally including items purchased from other merchants) and &#x201c;interests&#x201d; profile (specified explicitly by the customer or derived from the customer's activities) and other types of information that may be used by the merchant <b>104</b> to generate personal purchase recommendations or otherwise customize the merchant web site <b>106</b>. In implementations in which the merchants store the transferred information for subsequent use, the customer's user ID and password may also be transferred, or may be captured by the merchant during authentication of the customer.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Further, specific types of customer information provided to a merchant by the information service <b>114</b> may be dependent upon the merchant's type of business. For example, when the customer <b>102</b> shops at a web site of a sporting goods merchant, the information service <b>114</b> may expose to the sporting goods merchant all prior purchases or interests falling within the &#x201c;sports&#x201d; category. The sporting goods merchant could then use this information to customize the web site for the customer <b>102</b>. When the customer sets up an account with an online stock trading firm, the transferred customer information may include a social security number or a bank account number.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The information service web site may present the customer an option to specify or restrict the customer information that is transferred, and/or an option to specify the merchants <b>102</b> to which the customer information is transferred.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">B. Security</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A number of the transactions involved in the above-described embodiment would pose security risks if transacted over an insecure communications link. Step <b>212</b>, for example, wherein the customer provides sensitive information is preferably conducted using encryption to provide a secure and private communication link. In the context of the present invention, communications of sensitive information, such as a user ID, a password, or customer information are preferably effectuated over secure communications links.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A number methods and protocols for providing secure communication links are presently available and well known in the art. Applicable methods and protocols include asymmetric key encryption (public-private key encryption), symmetric key encryption, and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). A secure communications link can also be established using a direct connection through a separate or secure communications network, such as, for example, a direct connection between the information service <b>114</b> and the merchant <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">C. Communications Protocol</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the preferred embodiment, the customer <b>102</b>, the merchant <b>104</b>, and the information service <b>114</b> communicate using the hypertext transfer protocol (hereinafter HTTP). HTTP is the principal protocol that web browsers use to communicate with web servers over the Internet. When a web browser follows a hypertext link on a web page, the browser is said to generate an HTTP request. Associated with each HTTP request is the uniform resource locator or URL of the hypertext link. The HTTP request is serviced by a server that handles the URLs within the domain of the server. As HTTP and its related concepts are well known in the art, they will not be discussed in further detail herein. It will be noted that while the use of HTTP is suggested in the preferred embodiment, other communications protocols could be used.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">III. First Specific Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In a first specific embodiment of the present invention, an Internet merchant <b>104</b> displays a form, preferably on a checkout page on the merchant web site <b>106</b>, requesting the entry of a customer's user ID and password. The Internet merchant <b>104</b> then submits the entered user ID and password to the information service <b>114</b>. The information service <b>114</b> in turn returns to the merchant <b>104</b> the customer information associated with the user ID and password, or returns an error message if the user ID/password pair is invalid. The merchant then presents to the customer <b>102</b> an order confirmation page that allows the customer <b>102</b> to confirm the sale. Once the customer <b>102</b> has confirmed the sale, the merchant <b>104</b> uses the customer information to process a payment and, if applicable, ship the order.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the first subsection below, a set of example web pages illustrates the present embodiment from the perspective of the customer <b>102</b>. In a next subsection, a flowchart and data flow diagram illustrate the present embodiment from an implementation perspective. In a third subsection, a number of alternative implementations of the embodiment are described.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A. Example Web Pages</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-G</figref> illustrate a number of example web pages that are displayed to a customer <b>102</b> in accordance with the first specific embodiment of the present invention. In the illustrated example, Merchant.com, a hypothetical merchant, serves as the Internet merchant <b>104</b>, and Amazonwallet.com serves as the hypothetical information service <b>114</b>. In the context of these web pages, &#x201c;Amazon Wallet&#x201d; represents the name of a service, provided by the present embodiment, that a customer <b>102</b> uses to make purchases from multiple Internet merchants using only a single user ID and password set.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates an Amazon Wallet New User Page of the Amazonwallet.com web site <b>116</b>. The page has form entry fields for a user ID, a password, and customer information such as a shipping address, a contact phone number, and payment information. In the illustrated embodiment, the payment information comprises a credit card number, the credit card expiration date, the name displayed on the card, and the billing address of the card. As will be discussed in further detail below, the customer's mother's maiden name is also preferably requested in order to maintain the security of the information submitted. Once a new customer <b>102</b> fills in the new user information and submits the form, the customer <b>102</b> can then use the wallet to shop at the web sites of Internet merchants that have registered with the information service <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">If the customer <b>102</b> is already an existing customer of Amazon.com, which operates Amazonwallet.com in this example, the process of filling in the new user information may be bypassed. In this case, the customer information already on file with Amazon.com could be used to make the Amazon Wallet automatically active.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates a Checkout Page of the Merchant web site <b>106</b> that a customer <b>102</b> reaches after selecting one or more products and/or services for purchase. The Checkout Page lists the order and presents to the customer <b>102</b> an option to enter payment and possibly delivery information manually or to use the Amazon Wallet. If the customer <b>102</b> chooses to use the Amazon Wallet, the customer <b>102</b> enters her user ID and password and clicks on the associated button.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> illustrates an Order Confirmation Page that is next displayed to the Amazon Wallet customer <b>102</b> on the Merchant.com web site <b>106</b>. The page again lists the order, the name of the customer <b>102</b> in order to confirm the identity of the customer, and displays a &#x201c;confirm order&#x201d; button. The Amazon Wallet customer <b>102</b> next sees a Thank You page on the Merchant.com web site <b>106</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>. The page confirms that the order has been placed, provides an order number for order tracking, and thanks the customer <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref> illustrates an Amazonwallet.com Login to Account Access Page of the Amazonwallet.com web site <b>116</b>. This page serves as a gateway to the customer's access to her own customer information. In addition to the Amazon Wallet user ID, and password, the page also requests that the customer <b>102</b> enter her mother's maiden name.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The maiden name of the customer <b>102</b> is requested in order to close security loopholes by only requesting the customer ID and password. A simple example will serve to illustrate one such security loophole. Suppose that only the user ID and customer password were required to gain access to the customer information. These two pieces of information are the same that are requested by other Internet merchants. Suppose an illegitimate entity posing as an Internet merchant posted a web site and purported to service Amazon Wallet customers <b>102</b>. The illegitimate entity could solicit Amazon Wallet customers <b>102</b> to enter their user IDs, and passwords. Supposing the Amazon Wallet Account Access Page did not require an additional element of information such as a mother's maiden name, the illegitimate entity could use the user IDs and passwords acquired from unsuspecting customers <b>102</b> to access and/or change confidential customer information on the Amazon Wallet web site. By requiring customers <b>102</b> to provide an extra element of information to gain access to their own information, the danger of this loophole is drastically reduced. This feature also prevents a registered merchant <b>104</b> from fraudulently modifying a customer's information on file with Amazonwallet.com.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4F</figref> illustrates the Amazon Wallet Account Access Page of the Amazonwallet.com web site <b>116</b>, which is reached by customers <b>102</b> after the Login Page. This page allows Wallet customers <b>102</b> to view and update the Wallet account information by clicking on a button. The button leads to an Update Page (not illustrated) that is similar in layout to the New User Page, but preferably has the information fields already filled in. The customer <b>102</b> can modify information as applicable and click an update button. The customer can also log out of Account Access by clicking on a Logout button. Another button allows a customer <b>102</b> to view a Wallet History Page.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4G</figref> illustrates the Wallet History Page reached from the Account Access Page of the Amazonwallet.com web site <b>116</b>. The History Page shows a list of when and to whom the customer's information has been provided. In the illustrated example, the History Page also lists the orders placed using the Amazon Wallet in terms of the associated merchants with whom the orders were placed, the associated order numbers, and the times the orders were placed. These and other types of order history data may be may be reported by the merchants to the information service on an order-by-order, periodic, or other basis.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">To assist the information service in creating an interests profile for each customer (which may in turn be disseminated to the merchants), the merchants could be requested or required to report keywords that describe the items purchased, and/or report &#x201c;standard&#x201d; product categories in which the purchased items fall. The standard set of item categories may be published by the information service to the various merchants. The use of keywords and or standard categories would allow the information service to build a customer profile without the need to maintain a database of the items offered by the various merchants.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">B. Implementation</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart <b>500</b> illustrating a process through which customer information is provided to a merchant <b>104</b> in accordance with the first specific embodiment. The process illustrated in the flowchart <b>500</b> assumes that the customer has already signed up with the information service <b>114</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a data flow diagram <b>600</b> showing the transfer of information between the customer <b>102</b>, the information service <b>114</b>, and the merchant <b>104</b> in accordance with the first specific embodiment. The flowchart <b>500</b> will now be described in conjunction with the data flow diagram <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring to the flowchart <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the customer <b>102</b> browses at the merchant web site <b>106</b> and identifies product(s) and/or service(s) for purchase at step <b>502</b>, which is similar to step <b>222</b> of flowchart <b>220</b>. The exchange of web pages and selections by the customer <b>102</b> and merchant <b>104</b> is indicated by the two-way link <b>602</b> in the data flow diagram <b>600</b>, which is similar to the link <b>306</b> of the data flow diagram <b>300</b>. Step <b>502</b> brings the customer <b>102</b> to a Checkout Page such as, for example, the one illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. At step <b>504</b>, the merchant <b>104</b> requests that the customer <b>102</b> provide her user ID and password, such as, for example, is requested in the Checkout Page of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. The transmission of the request for the user ID and password is indicated by the one-way link <b>604</b> from the merchant <b>104</b> to the customer <b>102</b> in the data flow diagram <b>600</b>. At step <b>506</b>, the customer <b>102</b> provides her user ID, and password, such as, for example, by filling out the form in the Checkout Page of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> and clicking to make the purchase. The submission of the user ID and password is indicated in the data flow diagram <b>600</b> by the one-way link <b>606</b> from the customer <b>102</b> to the merchant <b>104</b>. The request and submission of the customer's user ID and password as in steps <b>504</b>-<b>6</b> can be accomplished using well-known techniques such as HTML forms and Common Gateway Interface (CGI), as well as SSL for security.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">By sending her user ID and password to the merchant <b>104</b>, the customer <b>102</b> has authorized the merchant <b>104</b> to retrieve her customer information from the information service <b>114</b>. Accordingly, at step <b>508</b> the merchant <b>104</b> sends the user ID and password to the information service <b>114</b> as is depicted by the one-way link <b>608</b> from the merchant <b>104</b> to the information service <b>114</b> in the data flow diagram <b>600</b>. The transmission of the user ID and password can be performed over an insecure communications network <b>112</b> such as the Internet by using a secure communications protocol. Alternatively, a secure direct link between the merchant <b>104</b> and the information service <b>114</b> could be established for communication between the information service <b>114</b> and the merchant <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">At a next step <b>510</b>, the information service <b>114</b> receives the information request <b>608</b>, containing the customer's user ID and password, from the merchant <b>102</b>. At step <b>512</b>, in order to help prevent fraud, the information service <b>114</b> authenticates the merchant <b>104</b> by checking its database <b>120</b> to determine whether the merchant <b>104</b> requesting the information is registered with the information service <b>114</b>. At step <b>514</b> the information service <b>114</b> authenticates the customer <b>104</b> by verifying that the submitted user ID and password match entries in the database <b>120</b>. If the user ID and password match, then at step <b>516</b>, the information service <b>114</b> returns to the merchant <b>104</b> the customer information associated with the user ID and password. The one-way link <b>616</b> in the data flow diagram <b>600</b> indicates the passing of the customer information to the merchant <b>104</b>. In step <b>516</b>, the customer information is preferably communicated over the same communications link as was used in step <b>508</b>, but an alternate medium of communication could be used. It will be noted that steps <b>512</b> and <b>514</b> could be performed in an opposite order to that illustrated in the flowchart <b>500</b>. Furthermore, step <b>512</b> is not essential to the operation of the present embodiment and serves only as an extra security measure.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">At step <b>518</b> the merchant <b>104</b> receives the customer information and prepares the transaction for confirmation by the customer <b>102</b> by returning an order confirmation page to the customer <b>102</b>. The order confirmation page could be, for example, the Order Confirmation Page illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>. The order confirmation page preferably includes a button for the customer <b>102</b> to click, such as is illustrated in the Order Confirmation Page of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, to confirm her order. The order confirmation page may also be configured to allow a customer to modify the information for completing the transaction. Optionally, the customer information may include several credit card numbers, several delivery addresses, and other information selectable by the customer at the time of purchase. At the order confirmation page, the customer <b>102</b> could be prompted to select the appropriate information based upon which to complete the sale.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">At a next step <b>520</b>, the customer <b>102</b> confirms her order by clicking on the &#x201c;confirm order&#x201d; button. At this point, the merchant <b>104</b> can optionally display a Thank You page providing an order number, such as the one illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Once the order has been confirmed by the customer <b>102</b>, the merchant <b>104</b> can use the credit card information included in the customer information to initiate a charge. The merchant <b>104</b> can also use the shipping information to ship the order to the customer <b>102</b>, if necessary. At a next step <b>522</b>, the merchant <b>104</b> can optionally send order information, such as an order number, back to the information service <b>114</b> to be displayed on an order history page, such as the one illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4G</figref>. The one-way link <b>622</b> in the data flow diagram <b>600</b> indicates the passing of the order information to the information service <b>114</b>. As indicated above, the merchant may additionally or alternatively transfer other types of information about the order, such as keywords and categories of purchased items.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The merchant <b>104</b> may optionally create and account for the customer using the user ID and password entered by the user and the information obtained from the information service. In such implementations, the merchant and customer can subsequently transact business without the need for addition transfers of the customer's information. The merchant <b>104</b> may alternatively request the customer's information whenever the customer performs a transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">C. Alternative Implementations</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In one alternative implementation of the present embodiment, the additional element of security information, such as a mother's maiden name, is not used to protect the customer's account access to the information service <b>114</b>. In order to maintain the security of the system, Amazon Wallet holders can be informed to use their wallet only at well known Internet merchants <b>104</b> the legitimacy of which need not be questioned. For lesser-known Internet merchants, the information service <b>114</b> can post a listing of legitimate participants or registrants to the Amazon Wallet program. Amazon Wallet holders can consult this site if they are unsure of whether a particular merchant <b>104</b> is legitimate. Accordingly, the possibility that an illegitimate entity will be able to solicit user IDs and passwords is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The benefit of this alternative implementation is that many existing customer databases of Internet merchants may not include a second element of security information. By eliminating the use of the extra element of security information, these databases could be directly used to enable Amazon Wallet accounts for existing customers without additional user interaction or additional solicitations of information.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In another alternative implementation, request for the user ID and password in step <b>506</b> could be implemented with forms that, although located on the merchant web site <b>106</b>, are submitted directly to the information service <b>114</b>. In this embodiment, step <b>508</b> can be omitted and the merchant <b>104</b> does not see the customer's user ID or password.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">IV. Second Specific Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In a second specific embodiment of the present invention, an Internet merchant <b>104</b> displays a link to the information service web site <b>116</b>, preferably from an order page. After the link is followed, the information service web site <b>116</b> displays a form requesting the entry of a customer's user ID and password. Once the customer <b>102</b> submits her user ID and password to the information service <b>114</b>, the information service <b>114</b> returns to the merchant <b>104</b> the customer information associated with the user ID and password. The customer is then directed back to an order confirmation page on the merchant web site <b>106</b> to confirm the sale. Once the customer <b>102</b> has confirmed the sale, the merchant <b>104</b> uses the customer information to process a payment and, if applicable, ship the order.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The primary distinction between the present embodiment and the previous embodiment is that the customer's user ID and password are submitted directly to the information service <b>114</b> rather than being passed through the merchant <b>104</b> to the information service <b>114</b>. In accordance with the present embodiment, customers <b>102</b> are preferably informed only to submit their user IDs and passwords directly to the information service. Since customers <b>102</b> are informed only to submit their user ID and password to the information service web site <b>116</b>, illegitimate entities would be deterred from setting up deceptive web sites to collect user IDs and passwords. In this manner, the present embodiment is able to increase security without requiring customers <b>102</b> to verify that individual merchants <b>104</b> are registered with the information service <b>114</b>. The present embodiment also does not require an extra element of security information for account access in order to achieve this increased level of security. The present embodiment, therefore, could easily make use of existing customer databases that do not contain an extra element of security information. A further benefit is that user IDs and passwords need not be disclosed to the merchant <b>104</b>. The user IDs and passwords may be valuable and confidential information that the information service <b>114</b> or customers <b>102</b> wish to maintain in secrecy.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In the first subsection below, a set of example web pages illustrates the present embodiment from the perspective of the customer <b>102</b>. In a next subsection, a flowchart and data flow diagram illustrate the present embodiment from an implementation perspective.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">A. Example Web Pages</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-E</figref> illustrate a number of example web pages that are displayed to a customer <b>102</b> in accordance with the second specific embodiment of the present invention. Reference is also made back to some of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-G</figref> since certain example pages are the same or similar. The illustrated example also uses the hypothetical Merchant.com, Amazonwallet.com, and Amazon Wallet terms introduced in the first specific embodiment above.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> illustrates an Amazon Wallet New User Page of the Amazonwallet.com web site <b>116</b>. The page is similar to the page of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, however, the field requesting the mother's maiden name and the accompanying security note are omitted. In place of the security note is preferably a security note warning customers that they should only submit their user ID and password to the Amazonwallet.com web site. Once a new customer <b>102</b> fills in the new user information and submits the form, the customer <b>102</b> can then use the wallet to shop at the web sites of Internet merchants that have registered with the information service <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">If the customer <b>102</b> is already an existing customer of Amazon.com, which preferably operates Amazonwallet.com, the process of filling in the new user information may be bypassed. In this case, the customer information already on file with Amazon.com could be used to make the Amazon Wallet automatically active.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> illustrates a Checkout Page that a customer <b>102</b> reaches at the Merchant.com web site <b>106</b> after selecting one or more products and/or services for purchase. The Checkout Page lists the order and presents to the customer <b>102</b> a button to use the Amazon Wallet for entry of payment and/or shipping information. If the customer <b>102</b> chooses to use the Amazon Wallet, the customer <b>102</b> clicks on the associated button and is directed to the Amazon Wallet Authentication Page.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> illustrates the Amazon Wallet Authentication Page of the Amazonwallet.com web site <b>116</b>. The page requests the user ID and password of the customer <b>102</b>. The page provides a button for account access. The page also provides a button that can be clicked to send the customer information to the referring merchant <b>102</b>. Assuming that the latter button is clicked, the customer information is transferred to the referring merchant and the customer's web browser <b>109</b> is then directed back to the merchant's web site.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref> illustrates an Order Confirmation Page of the Merchant.com web site <b>106</b> that is displayed to the Amazon Wallet customer <b>102</b> after returning from the Amazon Wallet Authentication Page. The page again lists the order, the name of the customer <b>102</b> in order to confirm the identity of the customer, the shipping address, and the last several digits of the credit card being charged. The additional information such as the customer's shipping address can be safely displayed here since AmazonWallet.com has authenticated the customer and there is a low risk that the user ID and password have been compromised. The page also displays a &#x201c;confirm order&#x201d; button. After selecting the &#x201c;confirm order&#x201d; button, the Amazon Wallet customer next sees a Thank You page of the type illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>. The page confirms that the order has been placed, provides an order number for order tracking, and thanks the customer <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7E</figref> illustrates an Amazon Wallet Account Access Page of the Amazonwallet.com web site <b>116</b> that is reached by customers <b>102</b> by selecting the account access button from the Amazon Wallet Authentication Page of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>. This page of the Amazonwallet.com web site allows Wallet customers <b>102</b> to view and update their Wallet account information in a manner similar to the first specific embodiment. An optional link can be displayed if the customer entered the Account Access Page after being referred by a merchant to the AmazonWallet.com web site. The optional link allows the customer <b>102</b> to submit her customer information to the referring merchant and log out of Account Access simultaneously. The customer can also log out of Account Access by clicking on a Logout button. Another button allows a customer <b>102</b> to view a History Page that is similar to that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4G</figref>. As in the first specific embodiment, the history page can also display a listing of the purchases made using the Amazon Wallet.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">B. Implementation</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flowchart <b>800</b> illustrating a process through which customer information is provided to a merchant <b>104</b> in accordance with the second specific embodiment. The process illustrated in the flowchart <b>800</b> assumes that the customer has already signed up with the information service <b>114</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a data flow diagram <b>900</b> showing the transfer of information between the customer <b>102</b>, the information service <b>114</b>, and the merchant <b>104</b> in accordance with the second specific embodiment. The flowchart <b>800</b> will now be described in conjunction with the data flow diagram <b>900</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Referring to the flowchart <b>800</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the customer <b>102</b> browses at the merchant web site <b>106</b> and identifies product(s) and/or service(s) for purchase at step <b>802</b>, which is similar to step <b>502</b> of flowchart <b>500</b>. The exchange of web pages and selections by the customer <b>102</b> and merchant <b>104</b> is indicated by the two-way link <b>902</b> in the data flow diagram <b>900</b>, which is similar to the link <b>602</b> of the data flow diagram <b>600</b>. At step <b>804</b>, the merchant <b>104</b> returns to the customer <b>102</b> a Checkout Page such as, for example, the one illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. The Checkout Page displays a link to the information service web site <b>116</b> allowing the customer <b>102</b> to use the information service <b>114</b> to provide payment information. The transfer of the Checkout Page containing the link to the information service web site <b>116</b> is indicated by the one-way link <b>904</b> in the data flow diagram <b>900</b>. At step <b>806</b>, the customer <b>102</b>, choosing to use the information service <b>114</b>, follows the link to the information service web site <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In one implementation of the present embodiment, the link to the information service web site <b>116</b> provided in step <b>804</b> can be configured, using the well-known techniques of URL encoding and CGI (Common Gateway Interface), to transfer information to the information service server <b>118</b>. Using URL encoding, the merchant appends a code identifying itself and an identifying order number to the link to the information service web site <b>116</b>. Additionally, the merchant could encode other information, such as, for example, item numbers, prices, etc. in the link to the information service web site <b>116</b>. When the link is followed the appended information is submitted to a CGI program or script on the information service server <b>118</b>. The CGI program on the information service server <b>118</b> can then identify the merchant and an identifying order number.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">At step <b>808</b>, the CGI program returns to the customer <b>102</b> a request for the customer's user ID and password. The request is preferably implemented using a form such as, for example, the one illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>. The transmission of the request for the user ID and password is indicated by the one-way link <b>908</b> from the information service <b>114</b> to the customer <b>102</b> in the data flow diagram <b>900</b>. At step <b>810</b>, the customer <b>102</b> provides her user ID and password and submits the form to another CGI program located on the information service server <b>118</b>. The submission of the user ID and password is indicated in the data flow diagram <b>900</b> by the one-way link <b>910</b> from the customer <b>102</b> to the information service <b>114</b>. The request and submission of the customer's user ID and password as in steps <b>808</b>-<b>810</b> can be accomplished using well-known techniques such as HTML forms and Common Gateway Interface (CGI), as well as SSL for security.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">At step <b>812</b>, the CGI program authenticates the customer by checking that the submitted user ID and password combination is present in the information service database <b>120</b>. At step <b>814</b>, if the authenticity of the customer <b>102</b> is verified, the CGI program sends the customer information associated with the user ID to the merchant <b>104</b>. The information server <b>118</b> preferably appends to the customer information the identifying order number that was originally provided by the merchant <b>104</b>. The identifying order number allows the merchant <b>104</b> to associate the customer information received with a pending order. The transmission of the customer information from the information service <b>114</b> to the merchant <b>104</b> is indicated by the one-way link <b>914</b> in the data flow diagram <b>900</b>. The customer information can be sent in any number of ways, such as, for example, using URL encoding, CGI, and SSL over the Internet. Alternatively, the information could be transferred over a direct link between the information service <b>114</b> and the merchant <b>104</b>. There are also numerous other well-known protocols and methods that could be used to securely transfer the information.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">At a next step <b>816</b>, the merchant <b>104</b> receives the customer information and the associated order number. The merchant <b>104</b> then processes the customer information and returns, to the information service <b>114</b>, a link or uniform resource locator (URL) to a new order confirmation page. The transfer of the URL from the merchant <b>104</b> to the information service <b>114</b> is indicated by the one-way link <b>916</b> in the data flow diagram <b>900</b>. At a next step <b>818</b> the information service <b>114</b> receives the link to the order confirmation page and redirects the customer <b>102</b> to the page. The passing of the URL of the page to which the customer <b>102</b> is redirected is indicated by the one-way link <b>918</b> from the information service <b>114</b> to the customer <b>102</b> in the data flow diagram <b>900</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">From the perspective of the customer <b>102</b>, all of steps <b>812</b>-<b>816</b> appear as one step in which the customer submits her user ID and password and is then brought to the order confirmation page, such as, for example, the page illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>. The order confirmation page preferably includes a button for the customer <b>102</b> to click to confirm her order. The order confirmation page may also be configured to allow a customer to modify the information based upon which the sale will be completed. Optionally, the customer information may include several credit card numbers, delivery addresses, etc. that are selectable by the customer at the time of purchase.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">At step <b>820</b>, the customer <b>102</b> confirms the order by clicking on the &#x201c;confirm order&#x201d; button. At this point, the merchant <b>104</b> can optionally display a Thank You page providing an order number, such as the one illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> of the first specific embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Once the order has been confirmed by the customer <b>102</b>, the merchant <b>104</b> can use the credit card information included in the customer information to initiate a charge against the customer's credit card. The merchant <b>104</b> can also use the shipping information to ship the order to the customer <b>102</b>, if necessary. At step <b>822</b>, the merchant <b>104</b> can optionally send order information, such as an order number, back to the information service <b>114</b> to be displayed on an order history page, such as the one illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4G</figref> of the first specific embodiment. The one-way link <b>922</b> in the data flow diagram <b>900</b> indicates the passing of the order information to the information service <b>114</b>. As indicated above, the order information, which may include item keywords and categories, may be aggregated by the information service and used to generate and disseminate customer profiles.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">V. Third Specific Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In a third specific embodiment of the present invention, an Internet merchant <b>104</b> displays a button on an item detail or other page that allows a customer <b>102</b> to purchase an item with a single mouse click without ever having provided information to or registered with the merchant <b>104</b>. In response to the single mouse click, the information service <b>114</b> provides the customer information and an identification of the desired product to the merchant <b>104</b>. The customer <b>102</b> enables this single click feature, after registering with the information service <b>114</b>, by submitting her user ID and password to the information service <b>114</b> for authentication.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The use of a single mouse click or other action to make a purchase from a merchant is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,960,411. The present embodiment extends the use of the single-click concept to function with merchants with whom the customer has no previous established relationship. Like the presently implemented 1-Click system, the present embodiment is preferably configured to consolidate all purchases from a single merchant <b>104</b> using a single-click service within a time period, such as 90 minutes, into a single order. Alternatively, other single-click order consolidation schemes could be used.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In the first subsection below, a set of example web pages illustrates the present embodiment from the perspective of the customer <b>102</b>. In a next subsection, a flowchart and data flow diagram illustrate the present embodiment from an implementation perspective. In a third subsection, a number of alternative implementations of this embodiment are disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">A. Example Web Pages</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-E</figref> illustrate a number of example web pages that are displayed to a customer <b>102</b> in accordance with the third specific embodiment of the present invention. Reference is also made back to some of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-E</figref> since certain example pages are the same or similar. In the illustrated example, Merchant.com, a hypothetical merchant, serves as the Internet merchant <b>104</b>, and Amazon1-click.com serves as the hypothetical information service <b>114</b>. In the context of these web pages, &#x201c;1-Click&#x201d; represents the name of the service provided by the present embodiment that a customer <b>102</b> uses to make purchases using only a single mouse click from Internet merchants with which the customer may have no previous existing relationship.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, a New User Page similar to that illustrated for the second specific embodiment could also be used to register customers for the third specific embodiment. The 1-Click New User Page is located on the Amazon1-click.com web site <b>116</b>. The security note warning customers that they should only submit their user ID and password to, in this case, the Amazon1-click.com web site, is preferably retained. Once a new customer <b>102</b> fills in the new user information and submits the form, the customer <b>102</b> can then activate the 1-Click feature to shop at the web sites of Internet merchants that have registered with the information service <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">If the customer <b>102</b> is already an existing customer of Amazon.com, which operates Amazon1-click.com in this example, the process of filling in the new user information may be bypassed. In this case, the customer information already on file with Amazon.com could be used to make the Amazon Wallet automatically active.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> illustrates a Login to Account Access Page located on the Amazon1-click.com web site <b>116</b>. This page serves as a gateway to the customer's access to her own customer information and 1-Click settings. An additional button can be displayed on this page allowing a customer to turn the 1-Click service off if it is presently turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> illustrates a 1-Click Account Access Page, located on the Amazon1-click.com web site <b>116</b>, that is reached from the Login page of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>. One button on the page allows a customer <b>102</b> to activate the 1-Click feature. The page also allows 1-Click customers <b>102</b> to view and update the 1-Click account information by clicking on an Update button. The Update button leads to an Update Page (not illustrated) that is similar in layout to the New User Page, but preferably has the information fields already filled in. An Order History button allows a customer <b>102</b> to view an Order History Page that will be discussed below. The customer can also log out of Account Access by clicking on a Logout button.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref> illustrates an Item Detail Page that is displayed on the Merchant.com web site <b>106</b> if the customer <b>102</b> has activated the 1-Click feature. A 1-Click purchase graphic <b>1010</b>, allowing the customer <b>102</b> to purchase the displayed product using the 1-Click feature, is displayed with the name of the customer <b>102</b>. By clicking on the 1-Click graphic <b>1010</b>, an order is automatically generated and the customer's information is automatically retrieved from the information service <b>114</b> with no further action on the part of the customer <b>102</b>. Preferably, after a waiting time, such as 90 minutes, the customer <b>102</b> is charged and (if applicable) shipment is initiated. The waiting time gives the customer an additional opportunity to make additional purchases using the 1-Click feature and have the additional purchases consolidated into a single order and possibly shipped together. Another button titled &#x201c;Add Item to shopping cart&#x201d; gives the customer <b>102</b> the option of adding the displayed item to a shopping cart in order to make a purchase using conventional methods.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10D</figref> illustrates a 1-Click Order History Page that can be accessed by a customer on the Amazon1-click.com web site <b>116</b> from the Account Access Page. The Order History page displays a listing, for each merchant <b>104</b>, of the pending and placed orders using the 1-Click service. Pending orders are those for which the waiting time has not expired. Associated with each merchant <b>104</b> is a link or button that takes the customer <b>102</b> to an Order History and Review Page for the respective merchant <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10E</figref> illustrates the Order History and Review Page located on the Merchant.com web site <b>106</b>. The page displays a history of placed orders and some information relating to the orders. The page also displays any pending orders and gives the customer <b>102</b> the option of changing the quantities of the products in the pending order. The time remaining before the pending order will be placed may also be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">B. Implementation</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A-B</figref> are a flowchart <b>1100</b> illustrating a process through which customer information is provided to a merchant <b>104</b> in accordance with the third specific embodiment. The process illustrated in the flowchart <b>1100</b> assumes that the customer has already signed up with the information service <b>114</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates a data flow diagram <b>1200</b> showing the transfer of information between the customer <b>102</b>, the information service <b>114</b>, and the merchant <b>104</b> in accordance with the third specific embodiment. The flowchart <b>1100</b> will now be described in conjunction with the data flow diagram <b>1200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Referring now to the flowchart <b>1100</b>, at step <b>1102</b>, the information service server <b>118</b>, in response to the customer <b>102</b> accessing the information service web site <b>116</b>, requests the customer's user ID and password. The request is preferably implemented using a form such as, for example, the one illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>. The transmission of the request for the user ID and password is indicated by the one-way link <b>1202</b> from the information service <b>114</b> to the customer <b>102</b> in the data flow diagram <b>1200</b>. At step <b>1104</b>, the customer <b>102</b> provides her user ID and password and submits the form to a CGI program located on the information service server <b>118</b>. The submission of the user ID and password is indicated in the data flow diagram <b>1200</b> by the one-way link <b>1204</b> from the customer <b>102</b> to the information service <b>114</b>. The request and submission of the customer's user ID and password as in steps <b>1102</b>-<b>1104</b> can be accomplished using well-known techniques such as HTML forms and Common Gateway Interface (CGI), as well as SSL for security.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">At step <b>1106</b>, the CGI program authenticates the customer by checking that the submitted user ID and password combination is present in the information service database <b>120</b>. If the authenticity of the customer <b>102</b> is verified, the CGI program directs the customer's web browser <b>109</b> to an account access page such as the one illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>. The account access page allows the customer <b>102</b> to activate the single click feature by clicking on a button. At step <b>1108</b>, if the customer <b>102</b> chooses to activate the single click feature, the information service server <b>118</b> returns to the customer <b>102</b> a new web page (not illustrated by example in the figures) informing the customer <b>102</b> that the single click feature has been activated. In returning the new web page, server <b>118</b> places a cookie on the customer's computer <b>110</b>. The cookie contains information identifying the customer <b>102</b> and indicating that the customer <b>102</b> has activated the single click feature. The transfer of the cookie is indicated in the data flow diagram <b>1200</b> by the one-way link <b>1208</b> from the information service <b>114</b> to the customer <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The use and characteristics of cookies in conjunction with web browsers are well known in the art and will not be discussed in detail herein. One important characteristic of cookies, however, should be kept in mind. Each cookie has a parameter, called its domain, that specifies the valid domain of the cookie. Whenever a link is followed to a web server with a domain name within the cookie's domain, the information in the cookie is also passed along to the server. Furthermore, in placing a cookie on a customer's computer <b>110</b>, a server may only assign to it a domain to which the server belongs. Accordingly, in the present embodiment, the cookie placed on the customer's computer <b>110</b> by the information service server <b>118</b> is only returned to servers with the same domain name as the information service server <b>118</b>. As a consequence, the cookie identifying the customer <b>102</b> and signifying that the customer has enabled the single click feature will not be passed on to merchant servers <b>108</b> having different domain names than the information service server <b>118</b>. Although the cookie will not be submitted to the merchant server <b>108</b>, the merchant server can display a web page with a link to the information service server <b>118</b>. This link, in turn, will cause the cookie to be submitted to the information service server.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Once the customer <b>102</b> has activated the single click feature, the customer <b>102</b> browses a merchant web site <b>106</b> at step <b>1110</b>. At step <b>1112</b>, the merchant <b>104</b> displays an item detail page on the customer's web browser <b>109</b>, such as for example, the page in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>. The item detail page identifies the item and provides a single click purchase graphic <b>1010</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>) for which the image is retrieved from the information service server <b>118</b>. The transfer of the item detail page is indicated by the one-way link <b>1212</b> from the merchant <b>104</b> to the customer <b>102</b> in the data flow diagram <b>1200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">At step <b>1114</b>, when the customer's web browser <b>109</b> encounters the URL of the graphic <b>1010</b>, the browser <b>109</b> automatically generates an HTTP request to retrieve the graphic <b>1010</b> from the information service server <b>118</b>. Since the domain name of the information service server <b>118</b> is within the domain of the cookie placed on the customer's computer <b>110</b>, the cookie is also sent in conjunction with the request. The transmission of the cookie with the request for the graphic <b>1010</b> is indicated by the one way link <b>1214</b> from the customer <b>102</b> to the information service <b>114</b> in the data flow diagram <b>1200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">At step <b>1116</b>, a CGI program on the information service server <b>118</b> receives the HTTP request for the graphic <b>1010</b> from the customer's web browser <b>109</b>. If the customer <b>102</b> has activated the single click feature, the CGI program retrieves the customer information associated with the cookie that was sent along with the request. At a next step <b>1118</b>, the CGI program responds to the web browser's request for the graphic <b>1010</b> with an image that is displayed by the customer's web browser <b>109</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>, the image is preferably in form of a box that identifies the customer and gives the customer <b>102</b> the option of clicking on a button to purchase the featured item. The transfer of the image is represented by the one-way link <b>1218</b> from the information service <b>114</b> to the customer <b>102</b> in the data flow diagram <b>1200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Returning to step <b>1116</b>, if the customer <b>102</b> has not activated the single click feature, no cookie is sent to the CGI program processing the request on the information service server <b>118</b>. In this case the CGI program can respond to the HTTP request for the graphic with an image offering the customer <b>102</b> the opportunity to activate or sign up with the single click service. Alternatively, during a previous step, the information service <b>114</b> could have placed a cookie on the customer's computer <b>110</b> indicating that the customer <b>102</b> has signed up for the service but has not activated it. In this case the CGI program can display the appropriate image offering the customer <b>102</b> the opportunity to either sign up for or activate the single click feature as applicable.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">At a next step <b>1120</b>, a customer <b>102</b> who has activated the single click feature clicks on the single click purchase graphic <b>1010</b> downloaded from the information service server <b>118</b>. The associated with the graphic <b>1010</b> is a link that is also serviced by the information service server <b>118</b> through another CGI program. Therefore, at step <b>1122</b>, the customer's web browser <b>109</b> again submits the cookie to the information service server <b>118</b>. The link associated with the graphic <b>1010</b> also has appended to it, preferably using URL encoding, a merchant identifier by which the information service <b>114</b> can identify the merchant <b>104</b>, as well as a product identifier by which the merchant <b>104</b> can identify the selected product. In sum, by clicking on the graphic <b>1010</b> and following the link to the information service server <b>118</b>, the customer <b>102</b> provides the cookie identifying the customer <b>102</b> as well as the identity of the desired product and the identity of the associated merchant, which are encoded within the URL of the link associated with the graph <b>1010</b>. The customer's clicking on the graphic <b>1010</b> generates another HTTP request that is indicated by the one-way link <b>1120</b> from the customer <b>102</b> to the information service <b>114</b> in the data flow diagram <b>1200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">At step <b>1124</b> the CGI program on the information service server <b>118</b> processes the HTTP request resulting from the click on the single click purchase graphic <b>1010</b>. The CGI program compiles the customer information associated with the cookie from the database <b>120</b>, appends the product ID that was URL encoded with the URL associated with the graphic <b>1010</b>, and sends the information to the merchant <b>104</b>. The communication of the information from the information service <b>114</b> to the merchant <b>104</b> is indicated by the one-way link <b>1224</b> in the data flow diagram <b>1200</b>. This communication can be effectuated through any of the methods suggested in conjunction with the first and second specific embodiments above. In response to the HTTP request resulting from the customer's selection of the graphic <b>1010</b>, the information service server <b>118</b> can return to the customer <b>102</b> a thank you page (not illustrated) confirming that the single click purchase has been processed.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">At a next step <b>1126</b>, the merchant <b>104</b> receives the customer information and product ID. At step <b>1128</b>, the merchant <b>104</b> creates an order for the identified product using the customer information. If an order from the same customer <b>102</b> is already pending, the merchant <b>104</b> can add the identified product to the pending order. Once the merchant <b>104</b> places the order, it can send a message back to the information service <b>114</b> indicating that the order has been placed.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In subsequent steps not illustrated in the flowchart <b>1100</b>, the customer <b>102</b> can log in to the information service web site <b>116</b>, access her order history page, and follow a link to the merchant's order history and review page. At the merchant's order history and review page, the customer can modify or cancel any pending order and view placed orders.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">C. Alternative Implementations</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In one alternative implementation of this third specific embodiment, the information service <b>114</b> could send the customer's user ID along with the customer information to merchant <b>104</b> so that merchant <b>104</b> can easily consolidate 1-Click orders without attempting to match customer information.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In another implementation, the graphic <b>1010</b> could include a text entry box in which the customer <b>102</b> supplies a password. The password is sent along with the HTTP request <b>1120</b> to the information service and can be used as an extra element of security in authenticating the customer <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In another alternative implementation, the information service server <b>118</b> could direct the customer <b>102</b> to an order history and review page on the merchant's web site <b>106</b> after the customer clicks on the single click purchase graphic <b>1010</b>. This feature could be implemented by redirecting the customer's web browser <b>109</b> back to the merchant web site <b>106</b> after the information service server <b>118</b> receives a response from a single click link. Sufficient information could be appended to the redirect URL using URL encoding to allow the merchant server <b>108</b> to identify the customer <b>102</b> and display the appropriate web page.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In still another alternative implementation, the merchant <b>104</b> could also deposit a cookie on the customer's computer <b>110</b>. The merchant <b>104</b> could then use the cookie to allow the customer <b>102</b> to check an order history and review page without first logging into the information service <b>114</b>. The cookie could also be used to provide a separate single click feature that does not require interaction with the information service <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In other implementations, the features of the present embodiment could be implemented using more comprehensive web tools such as Java and frames. These other implementations could provide additional features. For example, using frames, the single click graphic <b>1010</b> could be replaced with a frame. The Java programming language could also be used in conjunction with the frame to provide some interactive and/or processing capabilities to the single click purchase frame.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">VI. Alternative Embodiments</heading>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In an alternative embodiment, any of the above embodiments could be modified to combine the user ID and password into a passcode. In another alternative embodiment, the information service <b>114</b>, instead of the customer <b>102</b>, could select and/or provide the user ID and/or password. In other embodiments, other forms of authentication, such as a key file or a talbage-response method, could replace the use of the user ID and passcode.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In further embodiments, the information service <b>114</b> could provide the customer's user ID and password to the merchant <b>104</b> in conjunction with providing the customer information. With this information, the merchant <b>104</b> could allow the customer <b>102</b> to login directly to the merchant web site <b>106</b>, access account information and make purchases using her existing information service <b>114</b> user ID and password.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In an additional embodiment, the information service <b>114</b> can act as a payment intermediary in addition to providing customer information. In accordance with this embodiment, the information service <b>114</b> can charge the customer <b>102</b> and in turn the information service <b>114</b> can make payment to the merchant <b>104</b>. The information service <b>114</b> can charge a commission to the customer <b>102</b> and/or the merchant <b>104</b> for using the payment intermediary service. The payment intermediary service can be combined with the information intermediary service such that the information service <b>114</b> provides customer information as well as serving as a payment intermediary. Alternatively, the information service <b>114</b> could act as a payment intermediary instead of providing customer information.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">In still other alternative embodiments, various features of the above-described embodiments could be combined to provide other conveniences to the Internet shopper.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Although the invention has been described in terms of certain preferred embodiments, other embodiments that are apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, including embodiments which do not provide all of the features and advantages set forth herein, are also within the scope of this invention.
