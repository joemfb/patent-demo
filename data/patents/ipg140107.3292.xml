<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of priority of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2009-0112188, filed on Nov. 19, 2009, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to electronics, and more particularly, to semiconductor devices and methods of fabricating the same.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Increases in integration densities of semiconductor devices, such as dynamic random access memory (DRAM) devices, has led to reductions in the area occupied by various semiconductor elements in the semiconductor devices. Capacitances of memory cells, however, should be maintained and/or increased. Methods used to ensure a sufficient cell capacitance within a limited area include use of a high dielectric material for a dielectric layer, reducing the thickness of a dielectric layer, and increasing the effective area of a lower electrode. Of these methods, increasing the effective area of a lower electrode has been employed most often in practical processes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To increase the effective area of the lower electrode, three-dimensional lower electrodes (such as cylindrical or fin shaped or stack type lower electrodes), hemispherical grains (HSGs) on lower electrodes, and increased heights of lower electrodes have been proposed. In the case of cylindrical or stack type lower electrodes, external surfaces of both of the external and internal surfaces of the lower electrodes may be used, so that the lower electrodes may have relatively large effective areas. However, for cylindrical or stack type lower electrodes having an integrated one cylinder stack (OCS) structure, heights of the lower electrodes should be increased to ensure a capacitance sufficient for operation of a semiconductor device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to some embodiments of the present invention, a semiconductor device may include a semiconductor substrate and a plurality of three-dimensional capacitors on the semiconductor substrate. Each of the plurality of three-dimensional capacitors may include a first three-dimensional electrode, a capacitor dielectric layer, and a second three-dimensional electrode with the first three-dimensional electrode between the capacitor dielectric layer and the semiconductor substrate and with the capacitor dielectric layer between the first and second three-dimensional electrodes. A plurality of capacitor support pads may be provided with each capacitor support pad being arranged between adjacent first three-dimensional electrodes of adjacent three-dimensional capacitors with portions of the capacitor dielectric layers between the capacitor support pads and the semiconductor substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to some other embodiments of the present invention, an electronic system may include an input/output unit through which data is input and/or output, an interface unit configured to receive and/or transmit the data, and a semiconductor device. The semiconductor device may include a semiconductor substrate, and a plurality of three-dimensional capacitors on the semiconductor substrate. Each of the plurality of three-dimensional capacitors may include a first three-dimensional electrode, a capacitor dielectric layer, and a second three-dimensional electrode with the first three-dimensional electrode between the capacitor dielectric layer and the semiconductor substrate and with the capacitor dielectric layer between the first and second three-dimensional electrodes.

<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a plan view of the semiconductor device with an array pattern of capacitor support pads <b>150</b><i>a</i>, according to some embodiments of the present invention. In the semiconductor device of current embodiments, the capacitor support pads <b>150</b><i>a </i>are arranged in stripes in a row direction to form a plurality of rows. Each pair of lines of cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b> is supported by one of the capacitor support pads <b>150</b><i>a</i>. Each of the capacitor support pads <b>150</b><i>a </i>extends to a boundary portion of a cell region, i.e., to a cell block edge which is a boundary of a cell region, in consideration of an amount of capacitor support pad material that melts during wet etching of a mold oxide layer performed when the cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b> are formed.</p>

In the semiconductor device of current embodiments, the array pattern of capacitor support pads <b>150</b><i>b </i>is formed in stripes similar to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. Pairs of capacitor support pads <b>150</b><i>b </i>formed in stripes are connected to each other at cell block edges, however, as shown in the dashed circle A.</p>

In the semiconductor device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, the capacitor support pads <b>150</b><i>c </i>are arranged in stripes in a diagonal direction to form a plurality of diagonal lines. The capacitor support pads <b>150</b><i>c </i>extend to a cell block edge in consideration of an amount of capacitor support pad material that melts during wet etching of a mold oxide layer as described above.</p>

The array pattern of capacitor support pads <b>150</b><i>d </i>are arranged in stripes similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>. Pairs of the capacitor support pads <b>150</b><i>d </i>are connected to each other at cell block edges, however, as shown in dashed circle A&#x2032;. Although in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1D</figref>, each of two of the capacitor support pads <b>150</b><i>b </i>and <b>150</b><i>d </i>are connected to each other at the cell block edges A and A&#x2032;, respectively, all of or each of three or more of the capacitor support pads <b>150</b><i>b </i>or <b>150</b><i>d </i>may be connected to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A variety of patterns of capacitor support pads are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1D</figref>. The semiconductor devices of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1C</figref> may provide improved electrical characteristics. In addition, capacitor support pads extending parallel in diagonal lines instead of rows or columns may be more advantageous to provide a space between the cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b> and to maintain symmetry during deposition of subsequent materials. That is, the array pattern of the capacitor support pads <b>150</b><i>c </i>formed in stripes as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> may provide an improved structure. Although the capacitor support pads <b>150</b><i>a</i>, <b>150</b><i>b </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> extend in parallel in rows or diagonal lines, capacitor support pads that extend in parallel in columns may also be used.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along the line I-I of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the semiconductor device includes semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, OCS-structured capacitors, i.e., cylindrical capacitors <b>140</b>, which are formed on semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, and capacitor support pads <b>150</b> supporting cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b> of cylindrical capacitors <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> includes a cell region and a peripheral or core region outside of the cell region, but only the cell region is shown for the convenience of description. Contact lines <b>110</b> (connected to conductive regions of the cell region) and inter-layered insulation layers <b>120</b> are formed on the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. The contact lines <b>110</b> may be a layer electrically connecting the conductive regions of the cell region with the cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b> of the capacitors <b>140</b>, and may be, for example, storage node contact plugs.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Each of the capacitors <b>140</b> (including cylindrical lower electrode <b>142</b>, dielectric layer <b>144</b>, and upper electrode <b>146</b>) is disposed on one of the contact lines <b>110</b>. Generally, cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b> may be formed to have a height of 10,000 Angstroms or greater, and an aspect ratio thereof may be increased. Therefore, the capacitor support pads <b>150</b> may be formed to reduce collapsing of the cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> also includes an etch-stop layer <b>130</b> formed of silicon nitride (SiN) or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Capacitor support pads <b>150</b> may be formed between upper portions of the cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b> but may be parallel in stripes between the cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b> in various ways as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1D</figref>. Capacitor support pads <b>150</b> may be formed of a material having an etching selectivity that is lower than that of a mold oxide layer used to form the cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b>, and may have dielectric characteristics. In addition, capacitor support pads <b>150</b> may have a low etch rate to a LAL (low ammonium fluoride liquid chemical) etchant when an LAL lift-off process is used to remove the mold oxide layer.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The capacitor support pads <b>150</b> may be nitride layers or oxide layers formed of a material selected from the group consisting of SiN, SiCN, TaO, and TiO<sub>2 </sub>but the material is not limited thereto. In current embodiments, capacitor support pads <b>150</b> may be formed of a material that is resistant to tensile stress and wet etching so that they reduce tearing of the capacitor at cell block edges. If capacitor support pads <b>150</b> are formed of, for example, SiN layers, then density of the SiN layers may be lowered by performing plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) or low pressure CVD (LPCVD) to enhance tensile stress thereof, and capacitor support pads <b>150</b> may be doped with carbon (C) to enhance resistance thereof to wet etching (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 8</figref> for more details).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Capacitor support pads <b>150</b> may have a thickness in the range of 500 to 1,500 Angstroms to stably support the cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b>, but thicknesses thereof are not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In current embodiments, since capacitor support pads <b>150</b> are formed in stripes between the cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b>, dielectric layer <b>144</b> may be symmetrically and uniformly formed on an entire surface of the cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b> including upper and lower surfaces of capacitor support pads <b>150</b>, and upper electrodes <b>146</b> may also be uniformly formed. Deterioration of electric characteristics due to asymmetrical and/or non-uniform deposition of subsequent materials may also be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Heights of cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b> on which capacitor support pad <b>150</b> is not formed may be less than that of other lower electrodes <b>142</b> on which capacitor support pad <b>150</b> are formed, since cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b> are etched and removed when capacitor support pads <b>150</b> are etched during patterning of capacitor support pads <b>150</b>. However, capacitor support pads <b>150</b> may be selectively etched using proper etching so that all cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b> are the same in height.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Although in current embodiments, capacitor support pads <b>150</b> are formed between the upper portions of cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b>, they may be formed between parts of the cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b>, which are lower than the upper portions of the cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b>. In addition, although not shown, a lower part of the mold oxide layer, for example, up to a thickness in the range of 1,000 to 2,000 Angstroms, may remain between cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b> when the mold oxide layer is etched to more securely reduce collapse of cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3G</figref> are cross-sectional views sequentially illustrating operations of fabricating the semiconductor device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, according to some embodiments of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, contact lines <b>110</b> and inter-layered insulation layers <b>120</b> are formed on a semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> in which a cell region and a peripheral or core region located outside the cell region are defined. A plurality of etch-stop layers <b>130</b> are formed of, for example, silicon nitride (SiN), on the contact lines <b>110</b> and inter-layered insulation layers <b>120</b>. Contact lines <b>110</b> may be, for example, storage node contact plugs which are electrically connected to conductive regions of the cell region of semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Mold oxide layer <b>170</b> is formed on an entire surface of each of the etch-stop layers <b>130</b>, and a support pad layer (not shown) used to form capacitor support pads <b>150</b> is formed on the mold oxide layer <b>170</b>. Mold oxide layer <b>170</b> may be formed of a material selected from the group consisting of SiO<sub>2</sub>, high density plasma oxide (HDP), tetra ethyl ortho silicate (TEOS), low hydrogen TEOS (LHTEOS), and boron phosphorous silicate glass (BPSG). The capacitor support pad layer may be formed of a material having an etching selectivity which is lower than that of mold oxide layer <b>170</b>. In addition, the capacitor support pad layer may be formed of a material having a low etch rate with respect to an LAL etchant when the LAL lift-off process is used to remove the mold oxide layers <b>170</b> and the support pad layer may have dielectric properties.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In current embodiments, the capacitor support pad layer may be patterned into capacitor support pads <b>150</b> used to support cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b> of cylindrical capacitor <b>140</b> that will be described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. Thus, capacitor support pads <b>150</b> may be nitride layers or oxide layers formed of a material selected from the group consisting of SiN, SiCN, TaO, and TiO<sub>2</sub>. Also, capacitor support pads <b>150</b> may be formed of a material that is resistant to tensile stress and wet etching to reduce tearing of the capacitor at the block edges. For example, capacitor support pads <b>150</b> may be C&#x2014;SiN layers obtained by PECVD or LPCVD. Here, a C&#x2014;SiN layer means an SiN layer doped with carbon, and may also be referred to as a C-HTSiN (C-doped High Temperature SiN) layer because PECVD or LPCVD is performed at a relatively high temperature relative to temperatures of other CVD processes.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">If the C&#x2014;SiN layer is formed by PECVD or LPCVD, then at least one silicon source gas selected from the group consisting of DCS (SiH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>), HCD(Si<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>), TCS(SiHCl<sub>3</sub>), SiH<sub>4</sub>, and BTBAS((C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>NH)<sub>2</sub>SiH<sub>2</sub>), a CM), gas, an N<sub>2 </sub>gas, and an NH<sub>3 </sub>gas may be used. For example, the capacitor support pads <b>150</b> may be formed of the C&#x2014;SiN material to a thickness in the range of 500 to 1,500 Angstroms.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Properties of the C&#x2014;SiN (or C-HTSiN) layer used to form capacitor support pads <b>150</b> according to current embodiments will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 8</figref> below.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">If capacitor support pads <b>150</b> are formed between portions of cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b>, which are lower than upper portions of cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b>, then capacitor support pads <b>150</b> may be obtained by patterning the capacitor support pad layer into stripes according to a photo resist (PR) patterning process. The mold oxide layers <b>170</b> may be formed to an appropriate thickness on the resultant structure, and subsequent processes which will be described later may be performed. In this case, since the capacitor support pads <b>150</b> have already been patterned, PR patterning processes that will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3D and 3E</figref> may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In addition, in current embodiments, mold oxide layers <b>170</b> may be formed of a material selected from the group consisting of SiO<sub>2</sub>, HDP, TEOS, LHTEOS, and BPSG. Embodiments of the present invention, however are not limited thereto, and mold oxide layers <b>170</b> may each be a stacked structure of various oxide layers formed of at least two materials selected from the group consisting of HDP, TEOS, LHTEOS, and BPSG.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">After capacitor support pads <b>150</b> are formed, a plurality of holes <b>160</b> are formed at locations where the cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b> are to be formed, respectively. Holes <b>160</b> may be formed by etching the capacitor support pad layer, the mold oxide layers <b>170</b>, and the etch-stop layers <b>130</b> using a PR mask or a hard mask until the contact lines <b>110</b> are exposed. The holes <b>160</b> may be formed such that the cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b> that are to be formed are formed in a matrix of rows and columns. In addition, holes <b>160</b> may also be formed to be arranged in diagonal lines. Alternatively, holes <b>160</b> may be formed to arrange the cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b> in a zigzag pattern to increase the space.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The capacitor support pad layers may have a greater thickness than a desired thickness of capacitor support pads <b>150</b> in consideration of an amount of the capacitor support pad layers that are etched when the etch-stop layers <b>130</b> are etched. Also, as will be described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the capacitor support pad layers may be formed of a material having an etching selectivity lower than that of the etch-stop layer <b>130</b> so that even if widths of etch-stop layers <b>130</b> are increased, distances between capacitor support pads <b>150</b> may be maintained at a predetermined level or less.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b> are formed by applying a conductive material onto all surfaces of a resultant structure of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, that is, on inner surfaces of holes <b>160</b> and capacitor support pad layers <b>150</b>. If an upper mold oxide layer is further formed on capacitor support pads <b>150</b> so that capacitor support pads <b>150</b> are lower than upper portions of the cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b>, then a conductive material may be applied on the upper mold oxide layer on the capacitor support pads <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, after cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b> are formed, an oxide layer <b>180</b> is formed on an entire surface of a resultant structure of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> so that holes defined by cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b> may be completely filled up. Then, oxide layer <b>180</b> is subject to planarization and removal until capacitor support pads <b>150</b> are exposed by chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) to separate the cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b>, that is, to perform node separation. If an upper mold oxide layer remains on capacitor support pads <b>150</b>, oxide layer <b>180</b> is planarized until the upper mold oxide layer is exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>, after the planarization process is performed, a PR (photoresist) pattern <b>190</b> is formed on the resulting structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> using an exposure process to pattern the capacitor support pads <b>150</b>. The PR pattern <b>190</b> may be formed such that capacitor support pads <b>150</b> are formed, for example, in stripes to connect a pair of neighboring rows, columns, or diagonal lines of cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">To form lattice type capacitor support pads, a micro-sized PR pattern may be used to form capacitor support pads between all lower electrodes. Accordingly, the exposure process may be difficult to perform due to problems such as alignment. However, since capacitor support pads <b>150</b> according to current embodiments are formed in stripes, a PR pattern having a relatively simple shape and a relatively large size may be formed, and thus the exposure process to form the PR pattern may be performed relatively easily.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1D</figref>, a PR pattern <b>190</b> may be formed such that capacitor support pads <b>150</b> extend to a cell block edge in consideration of an amount of a capacitor support pad material that melts during subsequent wet etching of mold oxide layer <b>170</b>. In some cases, PR pattern <b>190</b> may be formed such that each two or more of capacitor support pads <b>150</b> are connected at cell block edges.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>, capacitor support pads <b>150</b> formed in stripes and extending in parallel in various directions as described above are formed by dry etching capacitor support pads <b>150</b> by using PR pattern <b>190</b>.

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Capacitor support pads <b>150</b> are etched together with cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b>, and thus, heights of cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b> on which capacitor support pads <b>150</b> are not formed may be less than that of cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b> on which capacitor support pads <b>150</b> are formed, respectively. However, cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b> may not be etched when capacitor support pads <b>150</b> are etched using an appropriate etching method, for example, using an etching gas having different etch rates with respect to capacitor support pads <b>150</b> and cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As described above, if the PR patterning process is performed so that capacitor support pads <b>150</b> may be lower than upper portions of cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b> before a mold oxide layer is formed on capacitor support pads <b>150</b>, then patterning of capacitor support pads <b>150</b> according to the PR patterning processes described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3D and 3E</figref> may be skipped.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref>, after capacitor support pads <b>150</b> are formed in stripes, mold oxide layers <b>170</b> and oxide layers <b>180</b> are removed by wet etching, for example, using an LAL lift-off process.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3G</figref>, a dielectric material is applied onto entire surfaces of the resultant structure where oxide layers <b>180</b> and mold oxide layers <b>170</b> are removed to form dielectric layers <b>144</b>, and a conductive material is applied onto dielectric layers <b>144</b> to form upper electrodes <b>146</b>, thereby obtaining a plurality of cylindrical capacitors <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In current embodiments, dielectric layers <b>144</b> and upper electrodes <b>146</b> are symmetrically and uniformly formed after wet etching and removing mold oxide layers <b>170</b> and oxide layers <b>180</b>, owing to a sufficient space between cylindrical lower electrodes <b>142</b> obtained by forming capacitor support pads <b>150</b> in stripes. Accordingly, deterioration of electrical characteristics due to non-uniform deposition of materials may be reduced. Also, capacitor support pads <b>150</b> may be formed of a material that is resistant to tensile stress and wet etching, thereby reducing tearing of the capacitor at a cell block edge. For example, capacitor support pads <b>150</b> may be C-HTSiN layers formed by PECVD or LPCVD.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a graph showing an amount that a capacitor is torn versus a stress of layers used to form capacitor support pads. The graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> sequentially illustrates amounts that a capacitor or an anti-fuse is torn in a general SiN layer, a triple-layered SiN layer, a high-temperature (HT) SiN (HTSiN) layer, and an atomic layer deposition (ALD) SiN layer, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Here, the HTSiN layer means an SiN layer formed at a relative high temperature, and the ALD SiN layer means an SiN layer formed by ALD. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the x-axis denotes a compressive stress or tensile stress of these SiN layers, where &#x2018;C&#x2019; denotes a compressive stress and &#x2018;T&#x2019; denotes a tensile stress. Also, &#x2018;C cell ocs1&#x2019; denotes a capacitor having an OCS structure at the center of a cell region, and &#x2018;E cell ocs1&#x2019; denotes a capacitor having an OCS structure at a cell block edge which is a boundary of the cell region. An anti-fuse also has an OCS structure and is thus considered here.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows that the higher the tensile stress of a layer, the less the a capacitor may be torn, and shows that the amount that a capacitor is torn when the capacitor is located at the cell block edge may be greater than at the center of the cell region. In conclusion, tearing of a capacitor may be reduced at the cell block edge by increasing a tensile stress of a SiN layer used to form a capacitor support pad. To this end, the density of the SiN layer may be reduced to increase a tensile stress thereof. Accordingly, PECVD or LPCVD may be performed to form the SiN layer.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a graph showing amounts that an HTSiN layer is wet etched versus a compressive stress and a tensile stress of the HTSiN layer. In the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a right part denotes an amount that the HTSiN layer is wet etched versus a tensile stress of the HTSiN layer, and a left part denotes the amount that the HTSiN layer is wet etched versus a compressive stress of the HTSiN layer with respect to a thick central line. The x-axis denotes a stress of the HTSiN layer in Dyne/cm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>, and the y-axis denotes an amount in Angstroms that the HTSiN layer is etched according to the LAL lift-off process.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows that an amount that the HTSiN layer is etched is relatively uniform with respect to compressive stresses of the HTSiN layer. The higher a tensile stress of the HTSiN layer, however, the greater the amount that the HTSiN layer is etched.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">If a tensile stress of a capacitor support pad is increased to reduce tearing of the capacitor, then an amount that the capacitor support pad is to be etched during removal of a mold oxide layer or an oxide layer according to the LAL lift-off process should be considered. Thus, a support pad layer may need to be formed thick to a predetermined thickness or higher in consideration of an amount that the capacitor support pad is to be etched. 1,000 Angstroms, 1,200 Angstroms, and 1,400 Angstroms marked on the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> mean the thicknesses of the capacitor support pad layer required to form the capacitor support pad. That is, the capacitor support pad may be formed to a thickness of 1,000 Angstroms when the HTSiN layer has a predetermined compressive stress but should be formed thicker, e.g., to a thickness in the range of 1,200 to 1,400 Angstroms, when a tensile stress of the HTSiN layer is high.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a graph showing an amount that an HTSiN layer is wet etched versus the carbon (C) content thereof. The x-axis denotes the concentration of the carbon contained in the HTSiN layer and the y-axis denotes an amount that the HTSiN layer is wet etched. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, &#x2018;TMS&#x2019; stands for Tetramethysilane, i.e., a carbon-containing source gas.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the higher the concentration of the carbon contained in the HTSiN layer, the less the amount that the HTSiN layer is wet etched. Accordingly, it is concluded from the graphs of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 6</figref> that tearing of the capacitor may be reduced at a cell block edge, and the capacitor support pad may be resistant to wet etching, such as the LAL lift-off process when the capacitor support pad is formed of a material that is resistant to tensile stress and that contains a predetermined amount of carbon.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a graph showing amounts that the HTSiN layer is wet etched versus a compressive stress and a tensile stress of the HTSiN layer, based on the carbon (C) content of the HTSiN layer. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the greater the carbon content of the HTSiN layer, the less the amount that the HTSiN layer is wet etched when the HTSiN layer is under a compressive stress, and the greater the carbon content of the HTSiN layer, the less the amount that the HTSiN layer is wet etched when the HTSiN layer has a tensile stress. In this case, the tensile stress of a carbon-containing HTSiN layer, i.e., a C-HTSiN layer, is approximately 4.6E+09 (Dyne/cm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a table comparing the quality of C-HTSiN layers used to form a capacitor support pad according to some embodiments of the present invention with the quality of a general HTSiN layer, based on the carbon (C) contents thereof. Here, &#x2018;C-HTSiN1&#x2019; and &#x2018;C-HTSiN2&#x2019; denote carbon-containing HTSiN layers that have different tensile stresses relative to each other. The C-HTSiN1 layer has a tensile stress of about 330 MPa and the C-HTSiN2 layer has a tensile stress of about 500 MPa.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the general HTSiN layer, the C-HTSiN1 layer, and the C-HTSiN2 layer are formed at similar deposition temperatures or at similar deposition rates, and the thickness uniformities of the general HTSiN layer, the C-HTSiN1 layer, and the C-HTSiN2 layer are all 3% or less. However, the wet etching rates (WERs) of the general HTSiN layer, the C-HTSiN1 layer, and the C-HTSiN2 layer are greatly different from one another according to whether they contain carbon. That is, both the WERs of the C-HTSiN1 layer and the C-HTSiN2 layer that contain carbon are about 3 Angstroms/min but the WER of the general HTSiN is about 12 Angstroms/min and is thus about four times greater than those of the C-HTSiN1 layer and the C-HTSiN2 layer.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Accordingly, it is concluded from the graphs and table of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 8</figref> that it is possible to effectively reduce tearing of a capacitor at a cell block edge and to enhance the resistance of a capacitor support pad to wet etching by forming the capacitor support pad of a material that is resistant to tensile stress and that has a predetermined amount of carbon. For example, an HTSiN layer that has a tensile stress of 50 to 1000 MPa and that is doped with about 2 to 6% of carbon by mass may be used to form a capacitor support pad.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating various distances between capacitor support pads, by increasing the distance between etch-stop layers to ensure a sufficient low contact critical dimension (CD) of a capacitor, according to some embodiments of the present invention. First, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>a</i>), an amount that each etch-stop layer <b>130</b> is etched may be less than that of other layers that are etched when forming a hole for a lower electrode when capacitor support pads <b>150</b> and etch-stop layers <b>130</b> are formed of materials that have similar etching selectivity, e.g., when capacitor support pads <b>150</b> and etch-stop layers <b>130</b> are a SiN or HTSiN layer. Thus, a distance W<b>1</b> between the capacitor support pads <b>150</b> (or the width W<b>1</b> of the hole) may be greater than the distance CD<b>1</b> between the etch-stop layers <b>130</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, reference numeral <b>176</b> denotes an upper mold oxide layer, and reference numeral <b>178</b> denotes a mask used to form the hole, e.g., a PR (photoresist) mask or a hard mask.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">If etching is further performed to increase the distance between the etch-stop layers <b>130</b> to secure a lower contact CD of the lower electrode, capacitor support pads <b>150</b> are also etched, and widths of capacitor support pads <b>150</b> thus decrease (or becomes thin), thereby causing bridging problems. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>b</i>), if the distance CD<b>1</b> of etch-stop layers <b>130</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> (<i>a</i>) is increased to CD<b>2</b>, distance W<b>1</b> between the capacitor support pads <b>150</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> (<i>a</i>) is increased by the difference between the distances CD<b>2</b> and CD<b>1</b>, thus increasing to the distance W<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As described above, resistance of an SiN or HTSiN layer to etching may be enhanced by adding carbon thereto. Thus, if capacitor support pads <b>150</b> are formed of an SiN or HTSiN layer doped with carbon, a distance between capacitor support pads <b>150</b> may be maintained at a predetermined level or less even when etching is further performed to increase a distance between the etch-stop layers <b>130</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>c</i>), a distance between the capacitor support pads <b>150</b> may increase to W<b>3</b>, which is slightly greater than W<b>1</b>, even when etching is further performed to increase a distance between the etch-stop layers <b>130</b> to CD<b>2</b>. A ratio of the etching selectivity of an HTSiN layer that contains carbon to the etching selectivity of an HTSiN layer that does not contain carbon may be controlled to be about 1:5 by appropriately adjusting the amount of carbon doped into these layers.</p>
