<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a microorganism belonging to the genus <i>Escherichia </i>sp. having a sucrose assimilability and an L-amino acid producing ability, which is obtained by introducing a gene encoding a sucrose assimilative microorganism-derived sucrose metabolic enzyme to a sucrose non-assimilative microorganism belonging to the genus <i>Escherichia </i>sp. having an L-amino acid producing ability and a sucrose PTS (phosphoenolpyruvate dependent sucrose phosphotransferase system) activity, and a method for producing an L-amino acid using the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Due to the growing demand for bio-fuel production and crop failures caused by unusual climate, the price of starch sugar mainly used in industrial fermentation has rapidly increased. Alternatively, the use of sucrose or molasses containing a high concentration of sucrose, cheaper than starch sugar, as a carbon source in industrial fermentation, is advantageous to ensure the cost competitiveness.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Approximately 50% of wild-type naturally occurring <i>E. coli </i>is able to metabolize sucrose, but <i>E. coli </i>K12 strain, B strain, C strain or the like usually used in industrial fermentation, have no ability to assimilate sucrose (Mol. Microbiol, (1998) 2:1-8, Can. J. Microbiol. (1999) 45:418-422). Therefore, one of the most important challenges in the fermentation industry is the identification of genes involved in sucrose assimilation, the establishment of enhanced sucrose assimilation-related genes by improvement, and the application of the genes to the sucrose non-assimilative, industrial <i>E. coli </i>strains for the production of desired metabolites.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To impart a sucrose-assimilability to industrial <i>E. coli </i>strains, methods of introducing genes or gene cluster involved in sucrose assimilation, derived from a microorganism having a sucrose-assimilability have been generally used. For example, a method of imparting sucrose-assimilability to <i>E. coli </i>K12 by transformation with the scr regulon that is present in the species <i>Salmonella </i>belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae (J. Bacteriol. (1982) 151:68-76, Mol. Microbiol. (1998) 2:1-8, J. Bacteriol, (1991) 173:7464-7470, U.S. Pat. No. 7,179,623), <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae </i>(J. Gen. Microbiol. (1988) 134:1635-1644), and <i>Erwinia amylovora </i>(J. Bacteriol. (2000) 182:5351-5358) has been well known in the art. Introduction of the csc regulon derived from non-K12 <i>E. coli </i>or pathogenic <i>E. coli </i>having the sucrose-assimilability (Appl. Environ. Microbiol. (1992) 58:2081-2088, U.S. Pat. No. 6,960,455), introduction of gene cluster involved in sucrose assimilation that is present in conjugative plasmid scr53 isolated from <i>E. coli </i>AB1281 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,806,480), and introduction of scr regulon and sac operon derived from Gram-positive microorganism, <i>Streptococcus mutans </i>(J. Bacterial, (1989) 171:263-271) and <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>(J. Bacteriol, (1989) 171:1519-1523) are also known. U.S. Pat. No. 7,179,623 discloses a method of producing lysine, isoleucine and valine using <i>E. coli </i>K12 that is prepared by introducing an <i>E. coli </i>VKPM B-7915-derived scr regulon thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, there is still a need of an industrial microorganism having an efficient sucrose utilization system and a fermentation method using the same. Therefore, the present inventors found that an L-amino acid can be produced from sucrose at a high yield using an L-amino acid-producing microorganism belonging to the genus <i>Escherichia </i>sp., which is prepared by introducing a gene cluster involved in sucrose assimilation, derived from a sucrose assimilative <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, thereby completing the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In order to achieve the above objects, the present invention provides a microorganism belonging to the genus <i>Escherichia </i>sp. having a sucrose assimilability and an L-amino acid producing ability, which is obtained by introducing a gene encoding a sucrose assimilative microorganism-derived sucrose metabolic enzyme to a sucrose non-assimilative microorganism belonging to the genus <i>Escherichia </i>sp. having an L-amino acid producing ability and a sucrose PTS (phosphoenolpyruvate dependent sucrose phosphotransferase system) activity.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As used herein, the term &#x201c;sucrose non-assimilative microorganism&#x201d; means a microorganism that cannot utilize sucrose as a carbon source, and the term &#x201c;microorganism having sucrose assimilability and an L-amino acid producing ability&#x201d; means a microorganism that can metabolize sucrose as a carbon source so as to produce an L-amino acid.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As used herein, the term &#x201c;sucrose metabolic enzyme&#x201d; means an enzyme required for utilization of sucrose as a carbon source, and it includes fructokinase, sucrose porin, sucrose PTS permease, sucrose hydrolase, invertase or the like, but is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the present invention, the &#x201c;sucrose metabolic enzyme&#x201d; is also called &#x201c;Scr-PTS enzyme&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A metabolic system utilizing sucrose as a carbon source can be largely divided into PTS (phosphoenolpyruvate dependent sucrose phosphotransferase)-based sucrose metabolic system (Scr-PTS system) and non-PTS-based sucrose metabolic system (Scr-non PTS system) according to a phosphate source for phosphorylation of influent sucrose in a cell. Most microorganisms capable of utilizing sucrose have the Scr-PTS system.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A representative example of the PTS-based Scr-PTS system using phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) as a phosphate source for phosphorylation of sucrose includes a conjugative plasmid pUR400 of Gram-negative <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>, a scr regulon present on the chromosome of <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae </i>or the like. The scr regulon is composed of 5 genes, scrK (fructokinase), scrY (sucrose porin), scrA (sucrose-specific EIIBC component), scrB (sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase) and scrR (LacI-related sucrose-specific repressor), and two operons, scrK and scrYAB are negatively controlled by the ScrR repressor (Mol, Microbiol. (1993) 9:195-209). According to a mechanism of the scr regulon, external sucrose is transported into a periplasmic space through an outer membrane protein (OMP), ScrY. The transported sucrose is transported into a cell in the form of sucrose-6-phosphate through a sucrose PTS cycle including ScrA. Sucrose-6-phosphate is then hydrolyzed to glucose-6-phosphate and fructose which are metabolized by ScrB, and fructose is converted into fructose-6-phosphate by an ATP-dependent ScrK, and the resulting fructose-6-phosphate is metabolized via glycolysis, together with glucose-6-phosphate (J. Biotechnol, (2001) 92:133-158), The sucrose PTS cycle, which functions to convert sucrose into sucrose-6-phosphate and then transports it into the cell, is composed of Enzyme I (EI), histidine protein (HPr), glucose-specific enzyme IIA (EIIAcrr<sup>Glc</sup>), and sucrose-specific enzyme IIBC (EIIBC<sup>scr</sup>) (J.

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The Scr-PTS system of a Gram-positive microorganism is exemplified by the scr regulon of <i>Streptococcus mutans</i>, which is composed of scrK, scrA, scrB, and scrR genes (J. Bacteriol, (2003) 185:5791-5799).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The Scr-non PTS system, which requires no PTS for uptake of sucrose into the cell, is exemplified by the well known csc regulon. The csc regulon is mainly derived from a sucrose-assimilative <i>E. coli</i>, and exemplified by csc regulon from the wild type <i>E. coli </i>EC3132 (Mol. Gen. Genet. (1992) 235:22-32, U.S. Pat. No. 6,960,455), csc regulon from <i>E. coli </i>KO11 (Biotechnol. Lett. (2004) 26:689-693), csc regulon from the pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 (J. Bacteriol. (2002) 184:5307-5316), csc regulon from ATCC13281 (Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. (2007) 74:1031-1040) or the like. The csc regulon consists of cscB (proton symport-type sucrose permease), cscK (fructokinase), cscA (sucrose hydrolase), and cscR (LacI-related sucrose-specific repressor), and two operons, cscKB and cscA are negatively controlled by CscR (J. Bacteriol. (2002) 184: 5307-5316).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The Scr-non PTS system is disadvantageous in that it is not efficient for uptake of a low level of sucrose. It was reported that <i>E. coli </i>introduced with the csc regulon has a doubling time of 20 hrs in a medium containing sucrose of 0.2% or less (J. Bacteriol. (2002) 184:5307-5316). Unlike the Scr-non PTS system, the Scr-PTS system allows efficient uptake of even a low level of sucrose into the cell, because ScrA as a sucrose PTS permease functions to convert sucrose into sucrose-6-phosphate using a free phosphate produced by conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate via the sucrose PTS cycle composed of Enzyme I, histidine protein, and glucose-specific enzyme IIA, while it transports sucrose from the periplasm into the cell. That is, while the uptake of external sucrose by CscB of the Scr-non PTS system is driven by a hydrogen gradient, the Scr-PTS system requires PEP used as an energy source for the uptake of sucrose into the cell, and thus allows efficient uptake of even a low level of sucrose. The CscB of the Scr-non PTS system, which transports the external sucrose into the cell by a hydrogen gradient, has a Km value for sucrose of 1.0 mM (Biochem. BiophysRes. Commun. (1995) 208:1116-1123). In contrast, ScrA has a Km value of 10 &#x3bc;m (J. Bacteriol (1982) 151:68-76), which is 100 times lower than that of CscB. In the Scr-PTS system, the ScrY protein is also involved in efficient uptake of a low level of sucrose, in addition to ScrA. Reportedly, ScrY is a sucrose porin that functions to transport external sucrose into the periplasm, and abnormal expression of the sucrose porin greatly reduces the transport of sucrose (J. Bacteriol. (1991) 173:449-456). That is, in the Scr-PTS system, ScrY transports external sucrose into the periplasm, and ScrA rapidly transports the periplasmic sucrose into the cell via the PTS system, thereby efficiently utilizing even a low level of sucrose.</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As shown in Table 2, the pAscrEC-harboring <i>E. coli </i>ABA5G/pAscrEC utilized 44.3 g/L of sucrose (data not shown) and produced 12.2 g/L of L-threonine, and the pAscrKP-harboring <i>E. coli </i>ABA5G/pAscrKP utilized 70 g/L of sucrose which is all of the sucrose contained in the culture medium, and produced 26.5 g/L of L-threonine during 70 hr cultivation. It was found that the pAscrEC or pAscrKP-harboring <i>E. coli </i>ABA5G utilized sucrose, while the parental strain <i>E. coli </i>ABA5G transformed with no plasmid did not utilize sucrose. In addition, the pAscrKP-harboring ABA5G was found to show more excellent sucrose utilization and threonine productivity than the pAscrEC-harboring ABA5G. In particular, the pAscrKP-harboring ABA5G produced 21.2 g/L of L-threonine in the titration medium containing glucose, but 26.5 g/L of L-threonine in the titration medium containing sucrose, indicating a 1.3 times increase in the L-threonine productivity.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Therefore, the pAscrKP-harboring recombinant strain showed excellent sucrose utilization and L-threonine productivity, and thus the transformed microorganism was designated as CA03-0207, deposited in the international depository authority, Korean Culture Center of Microorganism, which is the Subsidiary Culture Collection of the Korean Federation of Culture Collections, (located at 361-221, Hongje-1-dong, Seodaemon-gu, Seoul, Korea) on Feb. 23, 2009, and assigned accession number KCCM 10993,</p>
