<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The invention provides a process for efficient synthesis of ammonia. The process includes a water-splitting step in which water is decomposed to obtain a first source gas comprising hydrogen and oxygen, a first oxygen removal step in which the oxygen contained in the first source gas is at least partially separated and removed by an oxygen separating membrane or hydrogen separating membrane to obtain a second source gas having a lower oxygen concentration than the first source gas, a second oxygen removal step in which the oxygen in the second source gas is reacted with hydrogen to produce water for removal, or is adsorbed onto an adsorption medium for removal, to obtain a third source gas having a lower oxygen concentration than the second source gas, and an ammonia synthesis step in which the hydrogen in the third source gas is reacted with nitrogen to synthesize ammonia.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an ammonia synthesis process for synthesizing ammonia by reaction between hydrogen and nitrogen.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Chemical synthesis of ammonia was successfully accomplished, by mass production, for the first time about 100 years ago by the German researchers Haber and Bosch. Haber-Bosch synthesis is the reaction represented by formula (1) below, and because it is simple and relatively efficient, it is still used in its same basic form even at the current time.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>N<sub>2</sub>3H<sub>2</sub>&#x2192;3NH<sub>3</sub>(about 400&#xb0; C.)&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Modifications to Haber-Bosch synthesis have been proposed in Patent document 1, for example, wherein the catalyst layer is separated into three layers, and heat exchange of reactive gas is carried out between each separated catalyst layer for intercooling, whereby the ammonia yield is increased based on equilibrium theory.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally, synthesis of ammonia from hydrogen and nitrogen has been accomplished using iron catalysts, but recently utilization of ruthenium-containing catalysts has been proposed for further reaction temperature reduction, so that increased ammonia yield can be achieved based on equilibrium theory.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The hydrogen used for synthesis of ammonia has conventionally been obtained using natural gas composed mainly of methane (CH<sub>4</sub>). Methane has a global warming potential of 23, where the global warming potential of carbon dioxide is defined as 1, and therefore leakage of natural gas during harvesting and use of natural gas composed mainly of methane has an adverse effect on global warming. Depletion of fossil fuels such as natural gas is also a serious issue. In addition, the use of natural as releases carbon dioxide as an essential combustion gas, and this also adversely affects global warming. It has therefore been proposed to obtain hydrogen by electrolysis of water, for synthesis of ammonia.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Patent document 2 relates to use of a ruthenium-containing catalyst for synthesis of ammonia from hydrogen and nitrogen, and to production of hydrogen for ammonia synthesis by electrolysis of water. The document teaches that ruthenium-containing catalysts are poisoned by water, carbon monoxide, oxygen and the like, and describes purification of the hydrogen and nitrogen used as starting materials for ammonia synthesis, in order to prevent such poisoning of ruthenium-containing catalysts. Specifically, Patent document 2 teaches that ruthenium-containing catalysts are poisoned by at least 1 ppm of trace oxygen, and at least 30 ppm of trace moisture, and trace carbon monoxide.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For purification of hydrogen and nitrogen as starting materials for ammonia synthesis, and particularly for removal of oxygen from hydrogen and nitrogen, Patent document 2 specifically proposes circulating a mixed gas of hydrogen and nitrogen through a reactor for removing trace oxygen (catalyst tube) packed with an oxidation catalyst, and thereby reacting the hydrogen and oxygen to produce water, and removing it.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0012">As mentioned above, removal of oxygen from hydrogen and nitrogen, as starting materials for ammonia synthesis, has been proposed with the aim of preventing poisoning of ammonia synthetic catalysts and especially ruthenium-containing catalysts. For removal of oxygen, there have been proposed utilization of oxidation catalysts to react hydrogen with oxygen to produce water, and adsorption of oxygen in metal oxide adsorption medium beds.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0013">However, when hydrogen and oxygen are reacted to remove oxygen, the large amount of oxygen to be removed increases the consumption of hydrogen in the oxygen removal step, thus lowering the efficiency of the ammonia synthesis process. Moreover, when oxygen is removed by adsorption in an adsorption medium bed, the large amount of oxygen to be removed requires the use of large amounts of adsorption medium in the oxygen removal step. Incidentally, removal of oxygen from the source gas for ammonia synthesis is preferred to prevent consumption of the final ammonia product by its reaction with oxygen.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0014">Furthermore, as mentioned above, when natural gas is used to obtain hydrogen for synthesis of ammonia, release of methane and/or carbon dioxide into the atmosphere produces an adverse effect on global warming.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0015">According to the invention, these problems are solved to provided a process for efficient synthesis of ammonia.</p>

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">EMBODIMENTS FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0060">The ammonia synthesis process of the invention comprises at least a water-splitting step (a), a first oxygen removal step (b), a second oxygen removal step (c) and an ammonia synthesis step (d).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0061">The steps (a) to (d) will now be explained in detail below.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">&#x3c;Water-Splitting Step (a)&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0062">The ammonia synthesis process of the invention comprises a water-splitting step (a), wherein water is decomposed to obtain a first source gas containing hydrogen and oxygen.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0063">Any thermal energy source may be used when thermal energy is necessary in this step, but nuclear thermal energy or solar energy, and especially solar energy, may be used and are preferred as they do not release carbon dioxide that is associated with the problem of global warming.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0064">In the water-splitting step (a), the water may be decomposed by any method to obtain the first source gas comprising hydrogen and oxygen. The water splitting methods described below may therefore be used for decomposition of the water in the water-splitting step (a).</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">(Electrolysis)</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0065">Electrolysis, which is a method employing electrolysis of water, can yield high-purity hydrogen, and further modifications thereof are expected from the standpoint of running cost and apparatus size.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">(Direct Thermal Decomposition)</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0066">Direct thermal decomposition of water is the most basic method in which water is decomposed to obtain hydrogen and oxygen, wherein water is directly decomposed to hydrogen and oxygen at a high temperature of several thousand degrees Celsius (&#xb0; C.) through the reaction represented by the following formula 1:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>H<sub>2</sub>O&#x2192;H<sub>2</sub>&#x2192;&#xbd;O<sub>2</sub>(several thousand degrees Celsius (&#xb0; C.))&#x2003;&#x2003;(Formula 1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0067">This reaction requires a temperature of a few thousand degrees Celsius, but usage of a catalyst allows the temperature to be lower to around 2,000&#xb0; C. However, the hydrogen obtained through direct thermal decomposition usually contains oxygen.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">(Thermochemical Decomposition)</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0068">Thermochemical decomposition is a method in which water is decomposed at a lower temperature than by direct thermal decomposition, through a combination of chemical reactions. Thermochemical decomposition, especially thermochemical decomposition using oxidation-reduction reaction between a metal and a metal oxide, or thermochemical decomposition using oxidation-reduction reaction between metal oxides having different oxidation states from each other, and more particularly thermochemical decomposition using oxidation-reduction reaction between iron oxides having different oxidation states from each other, is suitable for scaling up, and plans are being made for its implementation. However, the hydrogen obtained by thermochemical decomposition usually contains oxygen. The heat sources used for thermochemical decomposition include solar energy and nuclear thermal energy, and especially solar energy. A very great variety of methods have been proposed for thermochemical decomposition, and they include the following.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0069">(Thermochemical decomposition: Thermochemical decomposition using oxidation-reduction reaction between metals and metal oxides, or thermochemical decomposition using oxidation-reduction reaction between metal oxides having different oxidation states from each other)</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0070">A typical example of thermochemical decomposition is one utilizing oxidation-reduction reaction between a metal such as magnesium (Mg), aluminum (Al) or iron (Fe) and a metal oxide thereof, by the reaction formulas shown below (where M represents a metal element, and m represents the valence of the metal element M).

This will allow less sintering of the metal and/or metal oxide that is to be used, thereby allowing a relatively large surface area to be Maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0073">Among thermochemical decomposition methods utilizing oxidation-reduction reaction of metals and/or metal oxides, thermochemical decomposition methods utilizing zinc are known as Zn (zinc) methods.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0074">Methods of regenerating the metals and/or metal oxides used in such thermochemical decomposition include the following methods (i)-(iii):</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0075">(i) For regeneration of magnesium, aluminum, zinc, iron or the like, and especially for regeneration of magnesium, electrolytic methods in which a metal oxide produced by a hydrogen-producing reaction is reacted with seawater to yield a metal chloride, and the metal chloride is subjected to molten salt electrolysis.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0076">(ii) For regeneration of magnesium, aluminum, zinc, iron or the like, and especially for regeneration of magnesium, thermal reduction methods in which the produced metal oxide is heated at high temperature under reduced pressure together with a reducing agent such as carbon or silicon and/or an inert gas such as nitrogen, and the metal vapor is recovered. Since a relatively large apparatus is used for reduction by these methods, it is preferred that the decomposition of water using the metal and/or metal oxide is carried out in a separate location from the regeneration of the used metal oxide. Methods for obtaining magnesium by regeneration of magnesium oxide by this manner are commonly referred to as &#x201c;Pidgeon Processes&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0077">(iii) For regeneration of iron, reduction firing methods in which a supply of carbon or carbon monoxide is fed to a produced metal oxide and reduction is accomplished directly by heat. The heat source used for such methods may be obtained with a light collecting/heat collecting lens, or by fuel combustion.</p>

(Photocatalytic Decomposition)
</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0079">Photocatalytic decomposition is a method in which a photocatalyst in contact with water is irradiated with light to decompose the water into hydrogen and oxygen. The method is preferred, since it allows production of hydrogen with use of the inexhaustible resources of water and sunlight. However, further research is necessary for implementation of this method. Oxygen may often be present in the hydrogen obtained by photocatalytic decomposition.</p>

<p id="p-0057" num="0082">When an oxygen separating membrane is used for at least partial separation and removal of the oxygen present in the first source gas, the fraction that has not passed through the oxygen separating membrane is used as the second source gas having a lower oxygen concentration than the first source gas, while the fraction that has passed through the oxygen separating membrane is used as the fraction having a relatively high oxygen content, and may be discarded, recirculated for further removal of hydrogen, or utilized for another purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0083">Many such oxygen separating membranes are known, and reference may be made to Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2008-052188, for example.

<p id="p-0067" num="0092">The ammonia synthesis process of the invention comprises an ammonia synthesis step (d), wherein the hydrogen in the third source gas having a lower oxygen concentration than the second source gas is reacted with nitrogen to synthesize ammonia.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0093">A high temperature for synthesis of ammonia from hydrogen and nitrogen can be maintained accomplished with any desired thermal energy source, and especially with nuclear thermal energy or solar energy, particularly solar energy. This is preferred, since it does not involve release of carbon dioxide that is problematic in terms of global warming.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0094">A large body of literature is known in regard to synthesis of ammonia from hydrogen and nitrogen, and reference may be made to Patent documents 1-3, for example. The catalysts used for synthesis of ammonia include iron-containing catalyst and ruthenium-containing catalysts, as well as platinum-containing catalysts and nickel-containing catalysts.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0095">For synthesis of ammonia, therefore, as described in Patent document 3, for example, the ammonia synthesis catalyst layers are separated and a gas cooler is installed between each catalyst layer, so that the heat of reaction generated during the ammonia synthesis is recovered by the gas coolers, thereby lowering the outlet temperature of the ammonia synthesis reaction, whereby the conversion rate to ammonia can be improved and the circulating gas volume can be reduced as a result.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0096">The nitrogen that is reacted with hydrogen in step (d) may be added to any of the first to third source gases. Specifically, for example, the nitrogen to be reacted with the hydrogen in step (d) may be added to the third source gas, to allow reduction in the volume of the first and second source gases to be treated in the first and second oxygen removal steps.</p>
<p id="h-0023" num="0000">&#x3c;Nitrogen Purification Step&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0097">The nitrogen, as the other starting material for the ammonia synthesis process of the invention, may be obtained by any desired method. For example, it may be obtained by separation from air using cryogenic separation, membrane separation, pressure swing adsorption or the like. For cryogenic separation of air, the air is compressed while cooling to produce liquid air, and the difference in the boiling points of oxygen and nitrogen are utilized to separate the nitrogen from the liquid air. This method generally requires large-scale equipment, but high-purity nitrogen can be obtained.</p>
<p id="h-0024" num="0000">&#x3c;Ammonia Recovery Step&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0098">Recovery of the ammonia produced in the ammonia synthesis step may be accomplished in any desired manner. For example, it may be accomplished by a wet recovery step in which the ammonia is absorbed into water for separation from the unreacted hydrogen and nitrogen, or a condensation step in which the ammonia is liquefied for separation from the unreacted hydrogen and nitrogen.</p>
<p id="h-0025" num="0000">&#x3c;Utilization of Solar Energy for Water-Splitting Step (a) and/or Ammonia Synthesis Step (d)&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0099">As mentioned above, at least part of the required thermal energy, especially for the water-splitting step (a) and/or the ammonia synthesis step (d), may be obtained from solar energy. In this case, the water-splitting step (a) and/or the ammonia synthesis step (d) in the ammonia synthesis process of the invention may be carried out in the light collecting section of a solar collecting device to obtain at least part of the required thermal energy from solar energy.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0100">Specifically, the water-splitting step (a) and/or the ammonia synthesis step (d) may be carried out in an apparatus for ammonia synthesis having a water splitting section and/or an ammonia synthesizing section, situated in the light collecting section of the solar collecting device. The water splitting section and the ammonia synthesizing section are the sections for the water-splitting step and the ammonia synthesis step, respectively, in the ammonia synthesis process of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0101">The solar collecting device in this case may be a parabolic dish-type light collecting device, a solar tower-type light collecting device, a parabolic trough-shaped light collecting device, or the like. Specifically, a parabolic dish-type light collecting device is a light collecting device having a dish-shaped reflector for reflecting and converging sunlight, and a photo-receiving section that receives the converged light. Such a light collecting device achieves a high degree of concentration, and thus provides a high-temperature heat source, although at relatively high cost. A solar tower-type light collecting device is a light collecting device having a plurality of heliostats (reflectors) that reflect and converge sunlight, and a photo-receiving section situated above a photo-receiving tower. Such a light collecting device achieves high degree of concentration, and thus provides a high-temperature heat source, but the construction cost of the tower is high and advanced technology is required for control of the reflecting mirror. A parabolic trough-type light collecting device is a light collecting device having a trough-type reflector that reflects and converges sunlight, and a photo-receiving section that receives the converged light. Because such a light collecting device achieves a relatively low degree of concentration, the obtained heat source is a low-temperature heat source. In all of these light collecting devices, the reflector may be covered with a reflective material such as aluminum.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0102">The apparatus for ammonia synthesis used in the ammonia synthesis process of the invention may be as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0103">In the apparatus for ammonia synthesis <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a parabolic trough-type light collecting device <b>150</b> with legs <b>150</b><i>a </i>is used.

<p id="p-0079" num="0104">The apparatus for ammonia synthesis <b>100</b> may also have an optional ammonia collecting section <b>105</b>. In this apparatus for ammonia synthesis <b>100</b>, a heat-resistant conduit made of nickel/chromium alloy or the like may be used as a conduit for linking the constituent parts. Furthermore, in this apparatus for ammonia synthesis <b>100</b>, there is no need for the fluid channel to be linear, and it may be meandering to have a required fluid channel length.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0105">For use of the apparatus for ammonia synthesis <b>100</b>, water (H<sub>2</sub>O) is supplied to the water splitting section <b>101</b>, and a first source gas comprising hydrogen and oxygen is produced by decomposition of the water in the water splitting section <b>101</b>. The first source gas obtained in the water splitting section <b>101</b> is supplied to the oxygen separating membrane holder <b>102</b>, and at least a portion of the oxygen in the first source gas is separated and discharged as oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), to obtain a second source gas having a lower oxygen concentration than the first source gas.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0106">The second source gas obtained at the oxygen separating membrane holder <b>102</b> is supplied to the oxidation catalyst holder <b>103</b>, and the oxygen in the second source gas is reacted with hydrogen and removed as water (H<sub>2</sub>O), to obtain a third source gas having a lower oxygen concentration than the second source gas. The third source gas obtained at the oxidation catalyst holder <b>103</b> is combined with nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) and the recirculating flow (H<sub>2</sub>+N<sub>2</sub>), to be fed to the ammonia synthesizing section <b>104</b> as feed flow, and the hydrogen and nitrogen are reacted to synthesize ammonia.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0107">The product flow containing the synthesized ammonia is supplied to the ammonia collecting section <b>105</b>, and the ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) is recovered while the remainder is recirculated as recirculating flow (H<sub>2</sub>+<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0108">When hydrogen is generated at the water splitting section <b>101</b> by thermochemical decomposition, and especially by thermochemical decomposition using iron oxide, the used water splitting section <b>101</b> is can be replaced with the regenerated water splitting section <b>101</b>&#x2032;, to allow continuous production of hydrogen. In this case, regeneration treatment of the water splitting section <b>101</b> is carried out in, while the water splitting section <b>101</b>&#x2032; is used for production of hydrogen.</p>
<p id="h-0026" num="0000">&#x3c;Water-Splitting/Regenerating Apparatus&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0109">As mentioned above, in the water-splitting step (a) of the ammonia synthesis process of the invention, in order to obtain the first source gas, the water may be decomposed by thermochemical decomposition utilizing oxidation-reduction reaction between a metal and a metal oxide, or thermochemical decomposition utilizing oxidation-reduction reaction between metal oxides having different oxidation states from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0110">In such cases, the water-splitting step (a) is carried out in a water-splitting/regenerating apparatus having a plurality of water splitting sections that hold a metal and/or metal oxide to be used for thermal decomposition. Thereby, while the water-splitting step (a) is being conducted in at least one of the plurality of water splitting sections, at least one used water splitting section among the plurality of water splitting sections may be regenerated, and thus the regenerated water splitting section may be reutilized in the water-splitting step (a).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0111">Specifically, for example, the decomposition of water in the water splitting section and the regeneration of the water splitting section may be accomplished with a water-splitting/regenerating apparatus such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a side view of the water-splitting/regenerating apparatus <b>200</b>, while the right side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a front view of the water-splitting/regenerating apparatus <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0112">In the apparatus <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, four water splitting sections <b>101</b> are fixed to a displacement rotating ring <b>170</b>. By rotating the rotating ring <b>170</b>, as indicated by the arrow <b>171</b>, the four water splitting sections <b>101</b> are displaced between position P where the water is decomposed to produce hydrogen, and position R where the used water splitting section <b>101</b> is regenerated by the aforementioned thermal reduction method, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0113">The water splitting section <b>101</b> located at position P is situated so that it is supplied with solar energy by the parabolic trough-type light collecting device <b>150</b> with legs <b>150</b><i>a</i>. The water splitting section <b>101</b> located at position R is situated so that it is supplied with thermal energy <b>160</b> for regeneration, by fuel combustion or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0114">Also, in the apparatus <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it is possible that water splitting sections <b>101</b> are also located at positions Q and S between position P and position R, and thereby residual gas is removed and the catalyst is replenished at positions Q and S, and purging is accomplished with an inert gas at position S.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0115">The apparatus <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> has a linking column <b>180</b> with connectors <b>180</b><i>p</i>-<i>s </i>and a linking column <b>190</b> with connectors <b>190</b><i>p</i>-<i>s</i>. The connectors <b>180</b><i>p </i>and <b>190</b><i>p </i>are devices for linking the water splitting section <b>101</b> at position P to the previous and subsequent processes. The connectors <b>180</b><i>q</i>-<i>s </i>and <b>190</b><i>q</i>-<i>s </i>are devices for connecting the water splitting sections <b>101</b> at positions Q-S, respectively, to the inert gas feeder for purging, the reducing gas feeder for regeneration treatment, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0116">Thus, the apparatus <b>200</b> is designed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, so that at position P, water is supplied to the water splitting section <b>101</b> and the hydrogen and oxygen produced at the water splitting section <b>101</b>, together with the residual water, are removed out; at position Q, removal of the residual gas, replenishment of the catalyst are carried out, and the like; at position R, the gas and/or liquid for reduction are supplied to and discharged from the water splitting section <b>101</b>; and at position <b>5</b>, purging is accomplished by the inert gas.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0117">Specifically, for example, the decomposition of water in the water splitting section and the regeneration of the water splitting section may be accomplished with the apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a side view of the water-splitting/regenerating apparatus <b>400</b>.</p>

By displacing the water splitting section <b>101</b> in this manner, the water splitting section <b>101</b> is displaced between position P where hydrogen is produced, and position R where regeneration treatment of the used metal oxide is carried out, as indicated by the arrow <b>179</b>.

<p id="p-0109" num="0134">In the process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the water (H<sub>2</sub>O) is decomposed in the water splitting section <b>1</b> to obtain a first source gas A containing hydrogen and oxygen.

At the hydrogen separating membrane <b>2</b>, nitrogen flow E is supplied to the permeation side, so that the second source gas, that has passed through the hydrogen permeable film <b>2</b>, is mixed with nitrogen.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0135">The second source gas B is supplied to the oxidation catalyst holder <b>3</b>, and the oxygen in the second source gas B is reacted with hydrogen and removed as water, to obtain a third source gas D having a lower oxygen concentration than the second source gas.
