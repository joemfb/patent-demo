<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Wireless communication devices such as cellular telephones (cell phone), other mobile communication devices that are combined with cellular telephones, cellular telephones that are combined with other electronic devices, such as digital cameras, and the like have become prevalent in society. Due to the small form factors of these mobile devices, subscribers and other users may often have the mobile device with them at all times of the day and night. For example, a user may have a cell phone clipped to a belt, in a brief case, purse or a computer bag, for example. Due to this ready availability of cell phones, it is not uncommon for a user to receive a call when the user is not ready at that present time to take the call.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">When a cell phone user receives a call that the user cannot take at the time the call is received, both the user and the caller may face a frustrating situation. For example, in one instance, the cell phone user may either be on an existing call or in a location that prohibits taking a new call, such as a business meeting or the like, when the new call is received. In such a situation, the user may have to ignore the new call and let the new call self-terminate or perhaps let the new call be automatically redirected to a call message system, such as a voicemail system or the like. Thus, the user has missed the new call and may access a message from the call message system if a message was left by the caller. If no message was left by the caller, the user may only have the data from a call log to memorialize the call.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In another instance, the user may answer the new call, talk briefly and quickly with the caller and then put the call in a hold state, thereby maintaining ready access to the call. In this situation, the user, at least briefly, engages with the call before putting the call in the hold state. Also, the call in the hold state may wait until the user terminates the hold and engages the call or the call may self-terminate the hold state by ending the call and disconnecting from the user's cell phone or cellular network. A caller that is in a hold state for a period of time may come to believe that the user has forgotten about the call in the hold state, especially if the caller is given no status of the user's activity during the hold state. Thus, the call may be in the hold state for the entirety of the user's inconvenience with no clear indication of the user's status. Also, the caller who tires of waiting in the hold state may terminate the hold state by ending the call without the ability to leave the user any message.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus, mobile device users may benefit from a system that enables a user to put a call into a hold state without first conversing with the caller, but still providing the caller with a notification of the hold and the user's status during the hold. Callers to mobile devices may benefit by receiving a status of the mobile device user during the hold state. Callers may also benefit by having the ability to terminate a hold state by opting to leave a message on a call message system.</p>

The WCNS <b>116</b> may be configured to maintain the communication between the FPM <b>120</b> and the call when a second activation of the first mode is made.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The WCNS <b>116</b> may be configured to either connect the call to the CMS <b>118</b> or terminate the call if either the first or second predetermined time period ends without the caller terminating the call or opting to connect to the CMS <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The WCNS <b>116</b> may be configured to initiate a first or second activation of the first mode upon a signal from the user <b>126</b> through the mobile device <b>112</b> on a call-by-call instance. Upon receiving a new call, the user <b>126</b> may determine that the user <b>126</b> cannot take the call at the time the call is received, but wants to prevent the call from either self-terminating or being redirected to the CMS <b>118</b>. By way of example and not limitation, the user <b>126</b> may contact a first button on the mobile device <b>112</b>, which is a specific type of interface operator, perhaps referred to as a hold button, to signal the WCNS <b>116</b> to initiate the first activation of the first mode. The WCNS <b>116</b> may keep track of the number of activations of the first mode for each call. If the user <b>126</b> decides that additional hold time is needed, the user <b>126</b> may contact the first button for a second time for the same call to signal the WCNS <b>116</b> to initiate a second activation of the first mode.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The user <b>126</b> may signal the WCNS <b>116</b> to initiate an activation of the third mode by contacting a second button (or operator) of the mobile device <b>112</b>. Upon determining that the user <b>126</b> can engage with the call that is on hold, the user <b>126</b> may contact the second button to have the WCNS <b>116</b> initiate the third mode to put the call into communication with the user <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The WCNS <b>116</b> may be configured to provide the user <b>126</b> with the capability to, in-turn, configure or designate the WCNS <b>116</b> to initiate the first activation of the first mode when the WCNS <b>116</b> determines that a predetermined condition has occurred. Predetermined conditions could include, but are not limited to the WCNS <b>116</b> recognizing a call identification designated by the user <b>126</b>, the WCNS <b>116</b> receiving a call during a predetermined time of day designated by the user <b>126</b> or receiving a call during a predetermined calendar day designated by the user <b>126</b>, or combinations of these conditions or the like. If the WCNS <b>116</b> is configured or designated to initiate the first activation of the first mode upon an occurrence of a predetermined condition, then a call that satisfies one of the predetermined conditions may be placed in the hold state automatically by the WCNS <b>116</b>. The WCNS <b>116</b> may communicate to the mobile device <b>112</b> that a call has been put in the hold state automatically. The mobile device <b>112</b> may indicate to the user <b>126</b> that a call has been put in hold automatically by generating an audible, visual or vibration signal, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The WCNS <b>116</b> may be in communication with the Internet, and if so, the user <b>126</b> may configure the WCNS <b>116</b> through a computer interface such as <b>124</b> that is also in communication with the Internet.

It can be appreciated, however, that the above described embodiments of the WCNS <b>116</b> and/or the mobile device <b>112</b> can be incorporated into existing and future alternative architectures for wireless communication networks as well.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The global system for mobile communication (&#x201c;GSM&#x201d;) is one of the most widely utilized wireless access systems in today's fast growing communication environment. The GSM provides circuit-switched data services to subscribers, such as mobile telephone or computer users. The General Packet Radio Service (&#x201c;GPRS&#x201d;), which is an extension to GSM technology, introduces packet switching to GSM networks. The GPRS uses a packet-based wireless communication technology to transfer high and low speed data and signaling in an efficient manner. The GPRS attempts to optimize the use of network and radio resources, thus enabling the cost effective and efficient use of GSM network resources for packet mode applications.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As one of ordinary skill in the art can appreciate, the exemplary GSM/GPRS environment and services described herein also can be extended to 3G services, such as Universal Mobile Telephone System (&#x201c;UMTS&#x201d;), Frequency Division Duplexing (&#x201c;FDD&#x201d;) and Time Division Duplexing (&#x201c;TDD&#x201d;), High Speed Packet Data Access (&#x201c;HSPDA&#x201d;), cdma2000 1x Evolution Data Optimized (&#x201c;EVDO&#x201d;), Code Division Multiple Access-2000 (&#x201c;cdma2000 3x&#x201d;), Time Division Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access (&#x201c;TD-SCDMA&#x201d;), Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (&#x201c;WCDMA&#x201d;), Enhanced Data GSM Environment (&#x201c;EDGE&#x201d;), International Mobile Telecommunications-2000 (&#x201c;IMT-2000&#x201d;), Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (&#x201c;DECT&#x201d;), etc., as well as to other network services that become available in time.

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Generally, there can be four different cell sizes in a GSM network, referred to as macro, micro, pico, and umbrella cells. The coverage area of each cell is different in different environments. Macro cells can be regarded as cells in which the base station antenna is installed in a mast or a building above average roof top level. Micro cells are cells whose antenna height is under average roof top level. Micro-cells are typically used in urban areas. Pico cells are small cells having a diameter of a few dozen meters. Pico cells are used mainly indoors. On the other hand, umbrella cells are used to cover shadowed regions of smaller cells and fill in gaps in coverage between those cells.</p>

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">A mobile switching center can be connected to a large number of base station controllers. At MSC <b>771</b>, for instance, depending on the type of traffic, the traffic may be separated in that voice may be sent to Public Switched Telephone Network (&#x201c;PSTN&#x201d;) <b>782</b> through Gateway MSC (&#x201c;GMSC&#x201d;) <b>773</b>, and/or data may be sent to SGSN <b>776</b>, which then sends the data traffic to GGSN <b>778</b> for further forwarding.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">When MSC <b>771</b> receives call traffic, for example, from BSC <b>766</b>, it sends a query to a database hosted by SCP <b>772</b>. The SCP <b>772</b> processes the request and issues a response to MSC <b>771</b> so that it may continue call processing as appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The HLR <b>774</b> is a centralized database for users to register to the GPRS network. HLR <b>774</b> stores static information about the subscribers such as the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (&#x201c;IMSI&#x201d;), subscribed services, and a key for authenticating the subscriber. HLR <b>774</b> also stores dynamic subscriber information such as the current location of the mobile subscriber. Associated with HLR <b>774</b> is AuC <b>775</b>. AuC <b>775</b> is a database that contains the algorithms for authenticating subscribers and includes the associated keys for encryption to safeguard the user input for authentication.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the following, depending on context, the term &#x201c;mobile subscriber&#x201d; sometimes refers to the end user, like the above describer end user <b>126</b>, and sometimes to the actual portable device, such as the above described mobile device <b>112</b>, used by an end user of the mobile cellular service. Different element numbers may be used. When a mobile subscriber turns on his or her mobile device, the mobile device goes through an attach process by which the mobile device attaches to an SGSN of the GPRS network. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, when mobile subscriber <b>755</b> initiates the attach process by turning on the network capabilities of the mobile device, an attach request is sent by mobile subscriber <b>755</b> to SGSN <b>776</b>. The SGSN <b>776</b> queries another SGSN, to which mobile subscriber <b>755</b> was attached before, for the identity of mobile subscriber <b>755</b>. Upon receiving the identity of mobile subscriber <b>755</b> from the other SGSN, SGSN <b>776</b> requests more information from mobile subscriber <b>755</b>. This information is used to authenticate mobile subscriber <b>755</b> to SGSN <b>776</b> by HLR <b>774</b>. Once verified, SGSN <b>776</b> sends a location update to HLR <b>774</b> indicating the change of location to a new SGSN, in this case SGSN <b>776</b>. HLR <b>774</b> notifies the old SGSN, to which mobile subscriber <b>755</b> was attached before, to cancel the location process for mobile subscriber <b>755</b>. HLR <b>774</b> then notifies SGSN <b>776</b> that the location update has been performed. At this time, SGSN <b>776</b> sends an Attach Accept message to mobile subscriber <b>755</b>, which in turn sends an Attach Complete message to SGSN <b>776</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">After attaching itself with the network, mobile subscriber <b>755</b> then goes through the authentication process. In the authentication process, SGSN <b>776</b> sends the authentication information to HLR <b>774</b>, which sends information back to SGSN <b>776</b> based on the user profile that was part of the user's initial setup. The SGSN <b>776</b> then sends a request for authentication and ciphering to mobile subscriber <b>755</b>. The mobile subscriber <b>755</b> uses an algorithm to send the user identification (ID) and password to SGSN <b>776</b>. The SGSN <b>776</b> uses the same algorithm and compares the result. If a match occurs, SGSN <b>776</b> authenticates mobile subscriber <b>755</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Next, the mobile subscriber <b>755</b> establishes a user session with the destination network, corporate network <b>789</b>, by going through a Packet Data Protocol (&#x201c;PDP&#x201d;) activation process. Briefly, in the process, mobile subscriber <b>755</b> requests access to the Access Point Name (&#x201c;APN&#x201d;), for example, UPS.com (e.g., which can be corporate network <b>789</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) and SGSN <b>776</b> receives the activation request from mobile subscriber <b>755</b>. SGSN <b>776</b> then initiates a Domain Name Service (&#x201c;DNS&#x201d;) query to learn which GGSN node has access to the UPS.com APN. The DNS query is sent to the DNS server within the core network <b>770</b>, such as DNS <b>777</b>, which is provisioned to map to one or more GGSN nodes in the core network <b>770</b>. Based on the APN, the mapped GGSN <b>778</b> can access the requested corporate network <b>789</b>. The SGSN <b>776</b> then sends to GGSN <b>778</b> a Create Packet Data Protocol (&#x201c;PDP&#x201d;) Context Request message that contains necessary information. The GGSN <b>778</b> sends a Create PDP Context Response message to SGSN <b>776</b>, which then sends an Activate PDP Context Accept message to mobile subscriber <b>755</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Once activated, data packets of the call made by mobile subscriber <b>755</b> can then go through radio access network <b>760</b>, core network <b>770</b>, and interconnect network <b>780</b>, in a particular fixed-end system or Internet <b>784</b> and firewall <b>788</b>, to reach corporate network <b>789</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Thus, network elements that can invoke the functionality of the above described wireless communication system <b>110</b> and the embodiments of the WCNS <b>116</b> and/or the mobile device <b>112</b> can include but are not limited to Gateway GPRS Support Node tables, Fixed End System router tables, firewall systems, VPN tunnels, and any number of other network elements as required by the particular digital network.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates another exemplary block diagram view of a GSM/GPRS/IP multimedia network architecture <b>800</b> in which the above described embodiments of the WCNS <b>116</b> and/or the mobile device <b>112</b> can be incorporated. As illustrated, architecture <b>800</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> includes a GSM core network <b>801</b>, a GPRS network <b>830</b> and an IP multimedia network <b>838</b>. The GSM core network <b>801</b> includes a Mobile Station (MS) <b>802</b>, at least one Base Transceiver Station (BTS) <b>804</b> and a Base Station Controller (BSC) <b>806</b>. The WCNS <b>116</b> could be implemented in the BSC <b>806</b>. The MS <b>802</b> is physical equipment or Mobile Equipment (ME), such as a mobile phone (such as mobile device <b>112</b>) or a laptop computer that is used by mobile subscribers, with a Subscriber identity Module (SIM). The SIM includes an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), which is a unique identifier of a subscriber. The BTS <b>804</b> is physical equipment, such as a radio tower, that enables a radio interface to communicate with the MS. Each BTS may serve more than one MS. The BSC <b>806</b> manages radio resources, including the BTS. The BSC may be connected to several BTSs. The BSC and BTS components, in combination, are generally referred to as a base station (BSS) or radio access network (RAN) <b>803</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The GSM core network <b>801</b> also includes a Mobile Switching Center (MSC) <b>808</b>, a Gateway Mobile Switching Center (GMSC) <b>810</b>, a Home Location Register (HLR) <b>812</b>, Visitor Location Register (VLR) <b>814</b>, an Authentication Center (AuC) <b>818</b>, and an Equipment Identity Register (EIR) <b>816</b>. The MSC <b>808</b> performs a switching function for the network. The MSC also performs other functions, such as registration, authentication, location updating, handovers, and call routing. The GMSC <b>810</b> provides a gateway between the GSM network and other networks, such as an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) or Public Switched Telephone Networks (PSTNs) <b>820</b>. Thus, the GMSC <b>810</b> provides interworking functionality with external networks.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The HLR <b>812</b> is a database that contains administrative information regarding each subscriber registered in a corresponding GSM network. The HLR <b>812</b> also contains the current location of each MS. The VLR <b>814</b> is a database that contains selected administrative information from the HLR <b>812</b>. The VLR contains information necessary for call control and provision of subscribed services for each MS currently located in a geographical area controlled by the VLR. The HLR <b>812</b> and the VLR <b>814</b>, together with the MSC <b>808</b>, provide the call routing and roaming capabilities of GSM. The AuC <b>816</b> provides the parameters needed for authentication and encryption functions. Such parameters allow verification of a subscriber's identity. The EIR <b>818</b> stores security-sensitive information about the mobile equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">A Short Message Service Center (SMSC) <b>809</b> allows one-to-one Short Message Service (SMS) messages to be sent to/from the MS <b>802</b>. A Push Proxy Gateway (PPG) <b>811</b> is used to &#x201c;push&#x201d; (i.e., send without a synchronous request) content to the MS <b>802</b>. The PPG <b>811</b> acts as a proxy between wired and wireless networks to facilitate pushing of data to the MS <b>802</b>. A Short Message Peer to Peer (SMPP) protocol router <b>813</b> is provided to convert SMS-based SMPP messages to cell broadcast messages. SMPP is a protocol for exchanging SMS messages between SMS peer entities such as short message service centers. The SMPP protocol is often used to allow third parties, e.g., content suppliers such as news organizations, to submit bulk messages.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">To gain access to GSM services, such as speech, data, and short message service (SMS), the MS first registers with the network to indicate its current location by performing a location update and IMSI attach procedure. The MS <b>802</b> sends a location update including its current location information to the MSC/VLR, via the BTS <b>804</b> and the BSC <b>806</b>. The location information is then sent to the MS's HLR. The HLR is updated with the location information received from the MSC/VLR. The location update also is performed when the MS moves to a new location area. Typically, the location update is periodically performed to update the database as location updating events occur.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The GPRS network <b>830</b> is logically implemented on the GSM core network architecture by introducing two packet-switching network nodes, a serving GPRS support node (SGSN) <b>832</b>, a cell broadcast and a Gateway GPRS support node (GGSN) <b>834</b>. The SGSN <b>832</b> is at the same hierarchical level as the MSC <b>808</b> in the GSM network. The SGSN controls the connection between the GPRS network and the MS <b>802</b>. The SGSN also keeps track of individual MS's locations and security functions and access controls.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">A Cell Broadcast Center (CBC) <b>833</b> communicates cell broadcast messages that are typically delivered to multiple users in a specified area. Cell Broadcast is one-to-many geographically focused service. It enables messages to be communicated to multiple mobile phone customers who are located within a given part of its network coverage area at the time the message is broadcast.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The GGSN <b>834</b> provides a gateway between the GPRS network and a public packet network (PDN) or other IP networks <b>836</b>. That is, the GGSN provides inter-working functionality with external networks, and sets up a logical link to the MS through the SGSN. When packet-switched data leaves the GPRS network, it is transferred to an external TCP-IP network <b>836</b>, such as an X.25 network or the Internet. In order to access GPRS services, the MS first attaches itself to the GPRS network by performing an attach procedure. The MS then activates a packet data protocol (PDP) context, thus activating a packet communication session between the MS, the SGSN, and the GGSN.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In a GSM/GPRS network, GPRS services and GSM services can be used in parallel. The MS can operate in one three classes: class A, class B, and class C. A class A MS can attach to the network for both GPRS services and GSM services simultaneously. A class A MS also supports simultaneous operation of GPRS services and GSM services. For example, class A mobiles can receive GSM voice/data/SMS calls and GPRS data calls at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">A class B MS can attach to the network for both GPRS services and GSM services simultaneously. However, a class B MS does not support simultaneous operation of the GPRS services and GSM services. That is, a class B MS can only use one of the two services at a given time.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">A class C MS can attach for only one of the GPRS services and GSM services at a time. Simultaneous attachment and operation of GPRS services and GSM services is not possible with a class C MS.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">A GPRS network <b>830</b> can be designed to operate in three network operation modes (NOM<b>1</b>, NOM<b>2</b> and NOM<b>3</b>). A network operation mode of a GPRS network is indicated by a parameter in system information messages transmitted within a cell. The system information messages dictates a MS where to listen for paging messages and how signal towards the network. The network operation mode represents the capabilities of the GPRS network. In a NOM<b>1</b> network, a MS can receive pages from a circuit switched domain (voice call) when engaged in a data call. The MS can suspend the data call or take both simultaneously, depending on the ability of the MS. In a NOM<b>2</b> network, a MS may not received pages from a circuit switched domain when engaged in a data call, since the MS is receiving data and is not listening to a paging channel In a NOM<b>3</b> network, a MS can monitor pages for a circuit switched network while received data and vise versa.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The IP multimedia network <b>838</b> was introduced with 3GPP Release 5, and includes an IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) <b>840</b> to provide rich multimedia services to end users. A representative set of the network entities within the IMS <b>840</b> are a call/session control function (CSCF), a media gateway control function (MGCF) <b>846</b>, a media gateway (MGW) <b>848</b>, and a master subscriber database, called a home subscriber server (HSS) <b>850</b>. The HSS <b>850</b> may be common to the GSM network <b>801</b>, the GPRS network <b>830</b> as well as the IP multimedia network <b>838</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The IP multimedia system <b>840</b> is built around the call/session control function, of which there are three types: an interrogating CSCF (I-CSCF) <b>843</b>, a proxy CSCF (P-CSCF) <b>842</b>, and a serving CSCF (S-CSCF) <b>844</b>. The P-CSCF <b>842</b> is the MS's first point of contact with the IMS <b>840</b>. The P-CSCF <b>842</b> forwards session initiation protocol (SIP) messages received from the MS to an SIP server in a home network (and vice versa) of the MS. The P-CSCF <b>842</b> may also modify an outgoing request according to a set of rules defined by the network operator (for example, address analysis and potential modification).</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The I-CSCF <b>843</b>, forms an entrance to a home network and hides the inner topology of the home network from other networks and provides flexibility for selecting an S-CSCF. The I-CSCF <b>843</b> may contact a subscriber location function (SLF) <b>845</b> to determine which HSS <b>850</b> to use for the particular subscriber, if multiple HSS's <b>850</b> are present. The S-CSCF <b>844</b> performs the session control services for the MS <b>802</b>. This includes routing originating sessions to external networks and routing terminating sessions to visited networks. The S-CSCF <b>844</b> also decides whether an application server (AS) <b>852</b> is required to receive information on an incoming SIP session request to ensure appropriate service handling. This decision is based on information received from the HSS <b>850</b> (or other sources, such as an application server <b>852</b>). The AS <b>852</b> also communicates to a location server <b>856</b> (e.g., a Gateway Mobile Location Center (GMLC)) that provides a position (e.g., latitude/longitude coordinates) of the MS <b>802</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The HSS <b>850</b> contains a subscriber profile and keeps track of which core network node is currently handling the subscriber. It also supports subscriber authentication and authorization functions (AAA). In networks with more than one HSS <b>850</b>, a subscriber location function provides information on the HSS <b>850</b> that contains the profile of a given subscriber.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The MGCF <b>846</b> provides interworking functionality between SIP session control signaling from the IMS <b>840</b> and ISUP/BICC call control signaling from the external GSTN networks (not shown). It also controls the media gateway (MGW) <b>848</b> that provides user-plane interworking functionality (e.g., converting between AMR- and PCM-coded voice). The MGW <b>848</b> also communicates with other IP multimedia networks <b>854</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Push to Talk over Cellular (PoC) capable mobile phones register with the wireless network when the phones are in a predefined area (e.g., job site, etc.). When the mobile phones leave the area, they register with the network in their new location as being outside the predefined area. This registration, however, does not indicate the actual physical location of the mobile phones outside the pre-defined area.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">While the various embodiments have been described in connection with the preferred embodiments of the various figures, it is to be understood that other similar embodiments may be used or modifications and additions may be made to the described embodiment for performing the same function of the various embodiments without deviating there from. Therefore, the embodiments should not be limited to any single embodiment, but rather should be construed in breadth and scope in accordance with the appended claims.</p>
