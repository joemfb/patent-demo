<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) communication system adopting a multihop relay scheme. More particularly, the present invention relates to an apparatus and a method for allocating a dedicated access zone to a Relay Station (RS) which performs a distributed scheduling to communicate with a Mobile Station (MS).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A fourth generation (4G) communication system, which is a next-generation communication system, aims to provide users with services of various Quality of Service (QoS) levels at a data rate of about 100 Mbps. Particularly, present-day 4G communication systems are advancing in order to guarantee mobility and QoS in Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) communication systems such as Local Area Network (LAN) systems and Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) systems. Representative examples include an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.16d communication system and an IEEE 802.16e communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Both the IEEE 802.16d communication system and the IEEE 802.16e communication system adopt Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)/Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) schemes for physical channels. The IEEE 802.16d communication system considers only the fixed status of a current Subscriber Station (SS), that is, takes into account only a single-cell structure without considering the mobility of the SS. In comparison to the IEEE 802.16d communication system, the IEEE 802.16e communication system considers the mobility of the terminal. A mobile terminal is referred to herein as a Mobile Station (MS).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a simplified structure of a conventional IEEE 802.16e communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The IEEE 802.16e communication system has a multi-cell structure. For example, the IEEE 802.16e communication system may include a cell <b>100</b> and a cell <b>150</b>. The IEEE 802.16e communication system includes a Base Station (BS) <b>110</b> which manages the cell <b>100</b>, a BS <b>140</b> which manages the cell <b>150</b>, and MSs <b>111</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>151</b>, and <b>153</b> which are each located in one or more cells of the system. Between the BSs <b>110</b> and <b>140</b> and the MSs <b>111</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>151</b> and <b>153</b>, signals are transmitted and received according to the OFDM/OFDMA scheme. Of the MSs <b>111</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>151</b> and <b>153</b>, the MS <b>130</b> travels within a boundary between the cell <b>100</b> and the cell <b>150</b>. Such a boundary area between the cells is considered a handover area. For example, when the MS <b>130</b> moves into the cell <b>150</b>, managed by the BS <b>140</b>, while transmitting and receiving signals with the BS <b>110</b>, its serving BS is changed or handed over from the BS <b>110</b> to the BS <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Since the signaling is conducted between the fixed BS and the MS using a direct link as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the IEEE 802.16e communication system can easily establish a radio communication link of high reliability between the BS and the MS. However, because of the fixed BS, the IEEE 802.16e communication system has low flexibility regarding its wireless network configuration. Thus, in a radio environment that undergoes several changes of traffic distribution or traffic requirements, it is difficult for the IEEE 802.16e communication system to provide an efficient communication service.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">To address these shortcomings, a multihop relay data transmission schemed can be applied to a wireless cellular communication system such as an IEEE 802.16e communication system by using a stationary or mobile Relay Station (RS) or the general MSs. The multihop relay wireless communication system can be used to reconfigure a network in order to promptly handle a communication environment change and therefore operate the entire radio network more efficiently. In addition, the multihop relay wireless communication system can expand the cell service coverage and increase the system capacity. For example, if there is a poor channel condition between the BS and the MS, the multihop relay wireless communication system can establish a multihop relay path via an RS by installing the RS between the BS and the MS, to thus provide the MS with a better radio channel. Also, in a cell boundary in which signal conditions from the BS are weak and subject to greater interference, the multihop relay scheme can provide a high-speed data channel and expand the cell service coverage area.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Now, a structure of a conventional multihop relay wireless communication system that provides expansion of the service coverage area of a BS is illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a simplified structure of a multihop relay broadband wireless communication system for the service coverage expansion of the BS.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The multihop relay wireless communication system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> has a multi-cell structure. That is, the multihop relay wireless communication system includes a cell <b>200</b> and a cell <b>240</b>. The multihop relay wireless communication system includes a BS <b>210</b> which manages the cell <b>200</b> and a BS <b>250</b> which manages the cell <b>240</b>. The multihop relay wireless communication system also includes MSs <b>211</b> and <b>213</b> in the coverage area of the cell <b>200</b>, MSs <b>221</b> and <b>223</b> managed by the BS <b>210</b> but out of the coverage area of the cell <b>200</b>, and an RS <b>220</b> which provides multihop relay paths between the BS <b>210</b> and the MSs <b>221</b> and <b>223</b> in a coverage area <b>230</b>. The multihop relay wireless communication system further includes MSs <b>251</b>, <b>253</b> and <b>255</b> in the coverage area of the cell <b>240</b>, MSs <b>261</b> and <b>263</b> managed by the BS <b>250</b> but out of the coverage area of the cell <b>240</b>, and an RS <b>260</b> which provides multihop relay paths between the BS <b>250</b> and the MSs <b>261</b> and <b>263</b> in a coverage area <b>270</b>. Between the BSs <b>210</b> and <b>250</b>, the RSs <b>220</b> and <b>260</b>, and the MSs <b>211</b>, <b>213</b>, <b>221</b>, <b>223</b>, <b>251</b>, <b>253</b>, <b>255</b>, <b>261</b> and <b>263</b>, signals are transmitted and received using the OFDM/OFDMA scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Next, a structure of a multihop relay wireless communication system for increasing system capacity is described.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a simplified structure of a conventional multihop relay broadband wireless communication system for increasing system capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The multihop relay wireless communication system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes a BS <b>310</b> and MSs <b>311</b>, <b>313</b>, <b>321</b>, <b>323</b>, <b>331</b> and <b>333</b> located within a cell <b>300</b> that are managed by the BS <b>310</b>. The multihop relay wireless communication system also includes RSs <b>320</b> and <b>330</b> which provide multihop relay paths between the BS <b>310</b> and the MSs <b>311</b>, <b>313</b>, <b>321</b>, <b>323</b>, <b>331</b> and <b>333</b>. Between the BS <b>310</b>, the RSs <b>320</b> and <b>330</b>, and the MSs <b>311</b>, <b>313</b>, <b>321</b>, <b>323</b>, <b>331</b> and <b>333</b>, signals are transmitted and received using the OFDM/OFDMA scheme. The MSs <b>311</b>, <b>313</b>, <b>321</b>, <b>323</b>, <b>331</b> and <b>333</b> and the RSs <b>320</b> and <b>333</b> within the coverage of the cell <b>300</b> can transmit and receive signals directly to and from the BS <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">However, some MSs, such as MSs <b>321</b>, <b>323</b>, <b>331</b> and <b>333</b> near the boundary of the cell <b>300</b>, are subject to a low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of direct links between the BS <b>310</b> and the MSs <b>321</b>, <b>323</b>, <b>331</b> and <b>333</b>. The RSs <b>320</b> and <b>330</b> can increase the effective transfer rate of the MSs and increase the system capacity by providing high-speed data transmission paths to the MSs <b>321</b>, <b>323</b>, <b>331</b> and <b>333</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the multihop relay broadband wireless communication system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the RSs <b>220</b>, <b>260</b>, <b>320</b> and <b>330</b> can be infrastructure RSs installed by a service provider and managed by the BSs <b>210</b>, <b>250</b> and <b>310</b> which are aware of the existence of the RSs in advance, or client RSs which serve as SSs (or MSs) or RSs in some cases. The RSs <b>220</b>, <b>260</b>, <b>320</b>, and <b>330</b> can be stationary, nomadic (e.g., notebook computer), or mobile like the MS.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The BS in the multihop relay system can schedule the communications with its managing RS and the communications between the RS and the MS. When the BS schedules both the relay link between the BS and the RS as well as the access link between the RS and the MS, the scheduling is referred to as centralized scheduling. In contrast, when the RS directly schedules its MSs without intervention of the BS, the scheduling is referred to as a distributed scheduling.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the distributed scheduling, the RS may want to communicate with an MS using a dedicated resource. For instance, if a channel between the RS and the MS suffers significant interference from a neighbor node, the RS may want to communicate using a dedicated resource. In this situation, the BS needs to schedule the dedicated resource. More specifically, the RS needs to request a dedicated region from the BS for its own private use, and the BS needs to determine a region corresponding to the RS's request and inform the RS of the determined region. That is, even in the distributed scheduling, the BS needs to schedule an access link (or an access zone) through which the RS and the MS may communicate. Accordingly, there is needed a signaling method for the BS to allocate a Relay (R)-access region to the RS.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The following description with reference to the accompanying drawings is provided to assist in a comprehensive understanding of exemplary embodiments of the present invention as defined by the claims and their equivalents. It includes various specific details to assist in that understanding but these are to be regarded as merely exemplary. Accordingly, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that various changes and modifications of the embodiments described herein can be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. Also, descriptions of well-known functions and constructions are omitted for clarity and conciseness.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide a signaling method for allocating a dedicated resource to an access zone (or an access link) between a Relay Station (RS) and a Mobile Station (MS) when distributed scheduling is performed in a multihop relay broadband wireless communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to an exemplary implementation, the RS transmits to a Base Station (BS) bandwidth information required for dedicated communications with an MS in an access DownLink (DL) or UpLink (UL). The BS determines a dedicated zone to be used by the RS based on the bandwidth information and transmits the determined dedicated zone information to the RS and a neighbor RS. The RS provides a relay service to the MS by scheduling the dedicated zone, and the neighbor RS excludes the dedicated zone from its scheduling.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The multihop relay broadband wireless communication system is, for example, an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)/Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) communication system. Using the OFDM/OFDMA scheme, the multihop relay broadband wireless communication system can realize a high-speed data transmission by transmitting a physical-channel signal using a plurality of subcarriers and support mobility of the MS by means of a multi-cell structure.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">While a Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) communication system is illustrated by way of example, the present invention is applicable to any cellular communication systems using a multihop relay scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates operations of a BS in a multihop relay wireless communication system according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in step <b>401</b>, the BS transmits and receives data to and from an MS using a relay service of an RS. Using information received during communication with the MS using the relay service, the BS determines whether a dedicated access zone request message is received from the RS in step <b>403</b>. The RS sends the dedicated access zone request message in order to communicate with the MS using a dedicated resource. An example of a dedicated access zone request message is shown in Table 1.</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The resource information of the dedicated access zone in the dedicated access zone allocation message of Table 4 and Table 5 can be represented using the start point of the access zone (OFDMA symbol offset) and the duration information of the allocated access zone, using the symbol start point (OFDMA symbol offset) of the access zone and the number of OFDMA symbols (No. OFDMA symbols), or using the OFDMA symbol start point of the access zone (OFDMA symbol offset), the subchannel start point (subchannel offset), the number of OFDMA symbols (No. OFDMA symbols), and the number of subchannels (No. subchannels).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The dedicated access zone allocation messages of Table 4 and Table 5 can further include time information which activates the use of the allocated dedicated zone. The BS can allocate the dedicated zone assigned through the dedicated access zone allocation message to the RS throughout a certain time period. In this case, the dedicated access zone allocation message can further include allocation duration information. The allocation duration information can signify how many frames the dedicated zone is allocated for by the frame. Alternatively, to allocate the dedicated access zone for a certain region, the BS can include an indicator indicative of allocation or deallocation into the dedicated access zone allocation message. In other words, after the dedicated access zone is assigned to the RS, the dedicated access zone can be deallocated by sending an allocation message including the deallocation indicator.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The dedicated access zone allocation messages of Table 4 and Table 5 can be transmitted in the form of a Relay zone (R)-Mobile Application Part (MAP) message sent from the BS to the RS, an RS-Channel Descriptor (CD) message sent to the RS, a broadcast message, or a multicast message.</p>

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in step <b>501</b>, the RS relays communications between the BS and the MS. While providing the relay service to the MS, the RS determines whether a dedicated access zone is necessary to provide the relay service to the MS in step <b>503</b>. For instance, when interference from a neighbor RS exceeds a threshold and adversely affects the communications between the RS and the MS, the RS may determine the necessity of the dedicated zone. The interference threshold can be managed by the BS or the RS. The BS or the RS determines the degree of the interference by comparing a signal measurement value reported from the MS (e.g., Carrier to Interference and Noise Ratio (CINR), Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR), Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI), interference level, etc.) with the threshold. When the interference exceeds a certain level, the dedicated access zone can be allocated.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">If the RS determines that a dedicated access zone is necessary, the RS generates and transmits a dedicated access zone request message to the BS in step <b>505</b>. The RS can send the message of Table 1, Table 2, or Table 3.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In step <b>507</b>, the RS receives a dedicated access zone allocation message from the BS. The dedicated access zone allocation message can be constituted as shown in Table 4 or Table 5. Upon receiving the dedicated access zone allocation message, the RS analyzes the dedicated access zone allocation message and determines whether the allocation information of the received message designates itself in step <b>509</b>. That is, the RS determines whether the RS CID set in the allocation message is its own CID.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">When the RS CID of the allocation message is its own CID, the RS schedules resources for the dedicated access zone indicated by the allocation message and communicates with the MS over the dedicated access zone in step <b>511</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In contrast, when the RS CID of the allocation messages is not its own CID, the RS recognizes that the dedicated access zone indicated by the allocation message is allocated to another RS, and excludes the dedicated access zone from the scheduling in step <b>513</b>. In doing so, the RS can broadcast a zone switch message (IE) informing of a new zone so that the MS can recognize the corresponding dedicated access zone.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In this exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the RS sends the dedicated access zone request message to the BS and the BS allocates the dedicated access zone by sending the dedicated access zone allocation message to the RS. However, even without the request of the RS, the BS can determine whether to allocate a dedicated access zone. In this case, when it is necessary to allocate a dedicated access zone, the BS can constitute and transmit the message of Table 4 or Table 5 to the RS. The necessity of the dedicated access zone allocation can be determined, for example, by using the interference on the MS in the communications with the RS. Otherwise, the dedicated access zone can be allocated for a user who pays an appropriate fee. Accordingly, the basis of the dedicated access zone allocation can vary.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">So far, an exemplary scenario for allocating a dedicated access zone to an RS which requested the dedicated access zone allocation has been described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. Now, explanations provide a scenario for sending a dedicated access zone non-allocation message when it is impossible to allocate the dedicated access zone to the RS which requested the dedicated zone allocation by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates operations of a BS in a multihop relay wireless communication system according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In step <b>601</b>, the BS transmits and receives data to and from an MS through the relay service of the RS. Using information received during communication with the MS using the relay service, the BS determines whether a dedicated access zone request message is received from the RS in step <b>603</b>. The dedicated access zone request message can be constituted as shown in Table 1, Table 2, or Table 3.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">When receiving the dedicated access zone request message from the RS, the BS determines whether to allocate the dedicated access zone to the RS based on the bandwidth information of the received message in step <b>605</b>. If the BS determines to allocate the dedicated access zone to the RS, the BS determines a dedicated access zone to be assigned to the RS in step <b>607</b> and sends a message including the allocation information of the determined dedicated access zone to the RS in step <b>609</b>. The dedicated access zone allocation message can be broadcast so that neighbor RSs can also receive the message. The dedicated access zone allocation message can be constituted as shown in Table 4 or Table 5, and includes an indicator indicative of the dedicated access zone allocation and information relating to the zone allocated to the RS.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In contrast, if the BS determines not to allocate the dedicated access zone to the RS in step <b>605</b>, the BS sends a message informing of non-allocation of the dedicated access zone to the RS in step <b>611</b>. The dedicated access zone non-allocation message can utilize a separate message indicative of the non-allocation of the dedicated zone, or the format of Table 4 or Table 5 including an indicator indicative of the dedicated zone non-allocation. Herein, the indicator indicative of the dedicated zone non-allocation can be realized by setting the indicator of the dedicated access zone deallocation and the corresponding fields indicative of the dedicated access zone to &#x2018;0&#x2019; in Table 4 or Table 5.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates operations of an RS in a multihop relay wireless communication system according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In step <b>701</b>, the RS relays communications between the BS and the MS. In the relay service to the MS, the RS determines whether a dedicated access zone for the relay service to the MS is necessary in step <b>703</b>. For example, when interference from a neighbor RS exceeds a threshold and adversely affects the communications between the RS and the MS, the RS may determine the necessity of the dedicated zone.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">If the RS determines that a dedicated access zone is necessary, the RS generates and transmits a dedicated access zone request message to the BS in step <b>705</b>. The RS can send the message of Table 1, Table 2, or Table 3.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In step <b>707</b>, the RS receives a message from the BS in response to the dedicated access zone request message. In step <b>709</b>, the RS analyzes the received message and determines whether the received message is a dedicated access zone allocation message. Herein, the dedicated access zone allocation message is constituted as shown in Table 4 or Table 5, and includes an indicator for the dedicated access zone allocation as well as the information of the allocated dedicated access zone. When receiving the dedicated access zone allocation message, the RS schedules resources for the dedicated access zone designated by the dedicated access zone allocation message and communicates with the MS over the dedicated access zone in step <b>711</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In contrast, when receiving a dedicated access zone non-allocation message, the RS communicates with the MS over a general access zone in step <b>713</b>.

<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a block diagram of a BS (or an RS) according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Herein, since the BS and the RS each include substantially the same interface module (communication module) and have substantially the identical block structure, the operations of both the BS and the RS are described by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. While a Time Division Duplex (TDD)-OFDMA system is assumed, the present invention is also applicable to a Frequency Division Duplex (FDD)-OFDMA system, a hybrid system using both of the TDD and the FDD, cellular systems using other resource division schemes and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The BS (or the RS) includes a Radio Frequency (RF) receiver <b>801</b>, an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) <b>803</b>, an OFDM demodulator <b>805</b>, a decoder <b>807</b>, a message processor <b>809</b>, a controller <b>811</b>, a message generator <b>813</b>, an encoder <b>815</b>, an OFDM modulator <b>817</b>, a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) <b>819</b>, an RF transmitter <b>821</b>, and a duplexer <b>823</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The duplexer <b>823</b> transmits a transmit signal output from the RF transmitter <b>821</b> via an antenna and provides a signal received on the antenna to the RF receiver <b>801</b> according to a duplexing scheme. For example, according to the TDD scheme, the duplexer <b>823</b> transmits a signal output from the RF transmitter <b>821</b> via the antenna in a transmission interval and forwards a signal received on the antenna to the RF receiver <b>801</b> in a reception interval.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The RF receiver <b>801</b> converts the RF signal received on the antenna into a baseband analog signal and outputs the converted signal to the ADC <b>803</b>. The ADC <b>803</b> converts the analog signal output from the RF receiver <b>801</b> into sample data and outputs the sample data to the OFDM demodulator <b>805</b>. The OFDM demodulator <b>805</b> converts the sample data output from the ADC <b>803</b> into frequency-domain data through a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) process, and selects and outputs data of subcarriers to be actually received from the frequency-domain data.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The decoder <b>807</b> demodulates and decodes the data output from the OFDM demodulator <b>805</b> at a preset modulation (Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS)) level.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The message processor <b>809</b> decomposes a control message fed from the decoder <b>807</b> and provides the result to the controller <b>811</b>. The controller <b>811</b> performs a corresponding process on information output from the message processor <b>809</b>, and generates and provides information to transmit to the message generator <b>813</b>. In an exemplary implementation, the controller <b>811</b> schedules resources. The message generator <b>813</b> composes a message with the various information provided from the controller <b>811</b> and outputs the message to the encoder <b>815</b> of the physical layer.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The encoder <b>815</b> encodes and modulates the data output from the message generator <b>813</b> at the preset modulation (MCS) level. The OFDM modulator <b>817</b> outputs sample data (OFDM symbols) by applying Inverse FFT (IFFT) to the data output from the encoder <b>815</b>. The DAC <b>819</b> converts the sample data into an analog signal. The RF transmitter <b>821</b> converts the analog signal output from the DAC <b>819</b> into an RF signal and transmits the RF signal over the antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The controller <b>811</b>, as a protocol controller, controls the message processor <b>809</b> and the message generator <b>813</b>. That is, although they are separately provided to distinguish their respective functions, the controller <b>811</b> can also function as the message processor <b>809</b> and the message generator <b>813</b>. In the actual implementation, the controller <b>811</b> can process all or part of the message processor <b>809</b> and the message generator <b>813</b> functions.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The controller <b>811</b> receives necessary information from a corresponding component of the physical layer, or issues a control signal to a corresponding component of the physical layer in the course of the protocol processing.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Now, the operations of the BS and the RS are explained based on the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The following descriptions focus on the signaling processing in the MAC layer.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">First, the operations of the BS are illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The message processor <b>809</b> analyzes the dedicated access zone request message received from the RS and provides various information extracted from the dedicated access zone request message to the controller <b>811</b>. Herein, the dedicated access zone request message can be, for example, the message of Table 1, Table 2, or Table 3.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The controller <b>811</b> determines whether it is possible to allocate a dedicated access zone to the RS using the information of the dedicated access zone request message provided from the message processor <b>809</b>. When the dedicated access zone can be allocated to the RS, the BS determines a dedicated access zone to be assigned to the RS and provides information relating to the determined dedicated access zone to the message generator <b>813</b>. In contrast, when it is infeasible to allocate the dedicated access zone, the controller <b>811</b> directs the message generator <b>813</b> to generate a dedicated access zone non-allocation message.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">As such, the BS can allocate the dedicated access zone to the RS as requested by the RS. Alternatively, the BS can allocate the dedicated access zone to the RS according to its determination without the request of the RS. Furthermore, the BS can determine whether to allocate the dedicated access zone using the signal measurement value (e.g., CINR, SINR, RSSI, interference level, etc.) reported from the MS.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The message generator <b>813</b> generates the dedicate access zone allocation message or the dedicated access zone non-allocation message using the information provided from the controller <b>811</b> and forwards the generated message to the physical layer. Herein, the dedicated access zone allocation message can be, for example, the message of Table 4 or Table 5, and includes the indicator of the dedicated access zone allocation and the information of the allocated dedicated access zone. The dedicated access zone non-allocation message can be a separate message indicative of the non-allocation, or the message of Table 4 or Table 5 including the non-allocation indicator.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The message generated at the message generator <b>813</b> is processed into a transmittable form in the physical layer and then transmitted to the RS. In doing so, the dedicated access zone allocation message can be transmitted in the form of the R-MAP message, the RS-CD message, a broadcast message, or a multicast message.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Now, the operations of the RS are described.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The controller <b>811</b> determines whether the dedicated access zone is necessary for the relay service to the MS. For example, the controller <b>811</b> can determine the necessity of the dedicated access zone by evaluating the signal measurement value (e.g., CINR, SINR, RSSI, interference level, etc.) reported from the MS, or the user grade of the MS. Determining the necessity of the dedicated access zone, the controller <b>811</b> provides the information necessary for the generation of the dedicated access zone request message to the message generator <b>813</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The message generator <b>813</b> composes the dedicated access zone request message with the information provided from the controller <b>811</b> and forwards the message to the physical layer. Herein, the dedicated access zone request message can be, for example, the message of Table 1, Table 2, or Table 3. The message generated at the message generator <b>813</b> is processed into a transmittable form and then sent to the BS.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In response to the dedicated access zone request message, the dedicated access zone allocation message or the dedicated access zone non-allocation message can be received from the BS. According to the determination of the BS itself, the dedicated access zone allocation message may be received.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Upon receiving the dedicated access zone allocation message from the BS, the message processor <b>809</b> decomposes the dedicated access zone allocation message and provides various information extracted from the dedicated access zone allocation message to the controller <b>811</b>. Herein, it is assumed that the dedicated access zone allocation message is a broadcast message or a multicast message which can be received at a plurality of RSs.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The controller <b>811</b> determines whether the dedicated access zone is allocated to the RS by analyzing the information fed from the message processor <b>809</b>. When the dedicated access zone is assigned to the RS, the controller <b>811</b> schedules resources for the allocated dedicated access zone and provides the relay service to the corresponding MS over the dedicated access zone. In contrast, when the zone designated by the allocation message is assigned to another RS, the controller <b>811</b> excludes the dedicated access zone allocated to the other RS from its scheduling.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Meanwhile, upon receiving the dedicated access zone non-allocation message from the BS, the controller <b>811</b> schedules resources for an access zone other than the dedicated access zone and provides the relay service to the MS according to the result of the scheduling.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">As set forth above, the dedicated access resource can be allocated to the RS which performs distributed scheduling, so as to communicate with the MS. Since the RS can communicate with the MS through the dedicated resource without the intervention of other nodes, the communication quality in relation with the MS can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
