<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Priority to Korean patent application number 10-2010-0108149 filed on Nov. 2, 2010, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein, is claimed.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Exemplary embodiments relate to a semiconductor memory device and, more particularly, to a semiconductor memory device having a multi-plane structure.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A semiconductor memory device may perform a copyback program operation. The copyback program operation is an operation for reading data of a specific page included in a plane and programming the read data in another page of the specific plane or in another plane. In other words, data of a specific page is copied and stored.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a conventional semiconductor memory device, data is not transferred between a group of planes forming a memory block when an operation, such as copyback, is performed. Instead, the data must be transferred through an external controller to store the data in another plane. If data is transferred through an external controller, the controller includes cache memory for storing the data read from a memory cell. Also, the time taken to perform the copyback operation through an external controller is longer than if the method was performed within a chip.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to exemplary embodiments, data can be transferred between planes within a memory chip by changing a data I/O path.</p>

<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Hereinafter, some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. The figures are provided to allow those having ordinary skill in the art to understand the scope of the embodiments of the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a circuit diagram illustrating the construction of a semiconductor memory device according to an exemplary embodiment of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The semiconductor memory device according to the exemplary embodiment of this disclosure includes first plane and second planes <b>110</b> and <b>115</b>, first and second page buffer groups <b>150</b> and <b>155</b>, and a data transfer circuit <b>170</b>. A voltage generator <b>130</b>, a row decoder <b>140</b>, a column selector <b>160</b>, an I/O circuit <b>180</b>, and a pass/fail (P/F) check circuit <b>190</b> may be further included as an operation circuit group.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Each of the first and the second planes <b>110</b> and <b>115</b> includes a plurality of memory blocks MB<b>1</b> to MBn.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Each of the memory blocks includes a plurality of strings. Each string includes a source select transistor having a source coupled to a common source line, a plurality of memory cells, and a drain select transistor having a drain coupled to a bit line. The gate of the source select transistor is coupled to a source select line, the gates of the memory cells are coupled to respective word lines, and the gate of the drain select transistor is coupled to a drain select line. The strings are coupled to respective bit lines and are coupled to the common source line.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The first page buffer group <b>150</b> and the second page buffer group <b>155</b> drive the first plane <b>110</b> and the second plane <b>115</b>, respectively. Accordingly, the first plane <b>110</b> and the second plane <b>115</b> can perform a program operation, an erase operation, a read operation, etc. by means of the first and the second page buffer groups <b>150</b> and <b>155</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Each of the first and the second page buffer groups <b>150</b> and <b>155</b> includes page buffers (not shown) coupled to the respective bit lines. Each of the first and second page buffer groups <b>150</b> and <b>155</b> also supplies voltage useful to store data in memory cells in the bit lines in response to control signals PB SIGNALS generated by a control circuit <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">More specifically, each of the first and the second page buffer groups <b>150</b> and <b>155</b> precharges the bit lines when a program operation, an erase operation, or a read operation for memory cells is performed. Otherwise, each of the first and the second page buffer groups <b>150</b> and <b>155</b> latches data corresponding to the threshold voltage of relevant memory cells that are detected according to a change in the voltages of the bit lines. In other words, each of the first and the second page buffer groups <b>150</b> and <b>155</b> controls the voltages of the bit lines according to data stored in the memory cells and detects data stored in the memory cells.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The data transfer circuit <b>170</b> transmits data outputted to an external circuit from the first and the second page buffer groups <b>150</b> and <b>155</b> and transmits data from an external circuit to the first and the second page buffer groups <b>150</b> and <b>155</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">More particularly, the data transfer circuit <b>170</b> transfers data from an external circuit, which is received from the I/O circuit <b>180</b>, to the column selector <b>160</b> under the control of the control circuit <b>120</b> to input the data from an external circuit to the first and the second page buffer groups <b>150</b> and <b>155</b> when a program operation is performed. When the column selector <b>160</b> sequentially transfers the received data to the page buffers of the first and the second page buffer groups <b>150</b> and <b>155</b>, the page buffers store the received data in their latches. Furthermore, when a read operation is performed, the data transfer circuit <b>170</b> transfers data, which is received from the page buffers of the first and the second page buffer groups <b>150</b> and <b>155</b> via the column selector <b>160</b>, to the I/O circuit <b>180</b> to output the data to an external circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The control circuit <b>120</b> internally generates a program operation signal PGM, a read operation signal READ, or an erase operation signal ERASE in response to a command signal CMD. The control circuit <b>120</b> also generates the control signals PS SIGNALS that control the page buffers of the first and the second page buffer groups <b>150</b> and <b>155</b> according to which type of the operation is being performed by semiconductor memory device.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Furthermore, the control circuit <b>120</b> internally generates a row address signal RADD and a column address signal CADD in response to an address signal ADD. Furthermore, the control circuit <b>120</b> checks whether the threshold voltages of selected memory cells have risen to a minimum threshold voltage based on a check signal CS that is generated by the P/F check circuit <b>180</b> during a program verification operation, and the control circuit <b>120</b> determines whether to perform a program operation again or to finish the program operation based on a result of the check signal CS.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The operation circuit group supplies an operation voltage to the first and the second planes <b>110</b> and <b>115</b> so that the program data of the first and the second page buffer groups <b>150</b> and <b>155</b> may be stored in the memory cells of the first and the second planes <b>110</b> and <b>115</b>, or data stored in the memory cells of the first and the second planes <b>110</b> and <b>115</b> may be outputted to the first and the second page buffer groups <b>150</b> and <b>155</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The voltage supply circuit includes the voltage generator <b>130</b> and the row decoder <b>140</b>. The voltage supply circuit (<b>130</b> and <b>140</b>) supplies operation voltages for the program operation, the erase operation, or the read operation of the memory cells.

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A process of transferring data between the first plane <b>110</b> and the second plane <b>115</b> through the data transfer circuit <b>170</b> constructed as above is described below. More specifically, the method described below will describe a copyback operation.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, first, data stored in the memory cells of the first plane <b>110</b> is read into the first page buffer group <b>150</b>, while increasing the page column address of the first plane <b>110</b>, in response to a read command at steps <b>310</b> and <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">To read the stored data in the memory cells into the first page buffer group <b>150</b>, the data stored in the memory cells of the first plane <b>110</b> is read into the first page buffer group <b>150</b> by performing a read operation for the memory cells of the first plane <b>110</b> in response to the read command.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Second, data stored in the first page buffer group <b>150</b> is outputted to the global data line GDL in response to a data output signal generated using a read enable clock signal at steps <b>320</b> and <b>420</b>.

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">To output the data stored in the first page buffer group <b>150</b> to the first data transfer unit <b>172</b> of the data transfer circuit <b>170</b>, the read enable clock signal RE is toggled to generate a data output pulse signal. Subsequently, data is outputted by, for example, 1 byte while a first column address counter <b>162</b> of the column selector <b>160</b> increases the column address. When the data is outputted, the first NMOS transistor N<b>172</b> of the first data transfer unit <b>172</b> is turned on when the first data transfer signal DTRN<b>1</b>, which is generated by the control circuit <b>120</b>, is applied at a high logic level.

The transferred data is inputted and stored in the second page buffer group <b>155</b> while increasing the page column address of the second plane <b>115</b> at step <b>440</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">To this end, the third NMOS transistor N<b>176</b> of the third data transfer unit <b>176</b> remains in an off state because the data transferred to the global data line GDL should not be outputted to an external circuit.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As described above, the global data line GDL is used to output the first data from the first page buffer group <b>150</b> and to input the first data to the second page buffer group <b>155</b>. Accordingly, data can be transferred from the first plane <b>110</b> to the second plane <b>115</b> by blocking the connection to an external circuit by turning off the third NMOS transistor N<b>176</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the exemplary embodiment of this disclosure, an example where the first data of the first plane is transferred to the second plane has been described.
