<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a liquid crystal display (LCD) apparatus, a color filter substrate, and a method of manufacturing the same thereof and particularly relates to a multi-view LCD apparatus, a color filter substrate, and a method of manufacturing the same thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Owing to the characteristics of power saving, small volume, etc., an LCD is applied to the displays in automobiles and the global positioning system (GPS) assembled in automobiles for displaying the programs and the maps. Nevertheless, if the driver uses the GPS, the passengers are incapable of watching the programs. To resolve the problem, a dual-view LCD is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of a conventional dual-view LCD panel. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the dual-view LCD panel <b>100</b> includes a color filter substrate <b>110</b>, an active device array substrate <b>120</b>, and a liquid crystal layer <b>130</b>. The liquid crystal layer <b>130</b> is disposed between the color filter substrate <b>110</b> and the active device array substrate <b>120</b>. By forming an electric field between the color filter substrate <b>110</b> and the active device array substrate <b>120</b>, the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules in the liquid crystal layer <b>130</b> is controlled to determine a light passing through the LCD panel <b>100</b> or not.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Particularly, the design of the color filter substrate <b>110</b> makes the dual-view liquid crystal panel <b>100</b> display different images in different viewing-angle. The color filter substrate <b>110</b> includes a glass substrate <b>110</b><i>a</i>, a light-shielding layer <b>110</b><i>b</i>, an overcoat layer <b>110</b><i>c</i>, a black matrix <b>110</b><i>d</i>, a color filter layer <b>110</b><i>e</i>, and a common electrode <b>110</b><i>f</i>, wherein the black matrix <b>110</b><i>d </i>defines first pixel areas <b>110</b><i>a </i>and second pixel areas <b>112</b><i>b </i>which respectively emit a first light L<b>1</b> and a second light L<b>2</b> with different image information.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">By the disposition of the light-shielding layer <b>110</b><i>b</i>, the first light L<b>1</b> and the second light L<b>2</b> with different image information are transmitted in different direction so as to display different images in different directions. That is to say, a first viewer V<b>1</b> and a second viewer V<b>2</b> would see different images. However, the light L<b>3</b> and the light L<b>4</b> emitted from the second pixel area <b>112</b><i>b </i>may interfere with the light L<b>1</b> emitted from the first pixel area <b>112</b><i>a </i>so that the display quality is negatively influenced, vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a schematic optical simulation of the conventional dual-view LCD panel. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, if the image displayed in the first pixel area <b>112</b><i>a </i>is watched from a position of the first viewer V<b>1</b>, a portion of the light emitted from second pixel area <b>112</b><i>b </i>is transmitted in the direction of the larger angle (e.g. below &#x2212;60 degree) to the corresponding position. Similarly, if the image displayed in the second pixel area <b>112</b><i>b </i>is watched from a position of the second viewer V<b>2</b>, a portion of the light emitted from first pixel area <b>112</b><i>a </i>is transmitted in the direction of the larger angle (e.g. above 60 degree) to the position. It is because that the light L<b>3</b> and the light L<b>4</b> emitted from the second pixel area <b>112</b><i>b </i>can be transmitted in the direction of the larger angle to the position of the first viewer V<b>1</b> through the adjacent opening of the light-shielding layer <b>110</b><i>b </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. Accordingly, the first viewer V<b>1</b> receives the image information displayed in the second pixel area <b>112</b><i>b</i>. The image light of different pixel areas is interfered with each other if the image is watched in the direction of large angle so as to reduce the display quality. In addition, the overcoat layer <b>110</b><i>c </i>must have an extreme thickness to accomplish the dual-view display effect, thereby the thickness of the dual-view LCD panel <b>100</b> can not be reduced to meet the thin volume requirement of the market. Moreover, because the thermal expansion coefficient of the overcoat layer <b>110</b><i>c </i>and that of the glass substrate <b>110</b><i>a </i>are significantly varied, the glass substrate <b>110</b><i>a </i>may be bent and deformed when the overcoat layer <b>110</b><i>c </i>is thermal-cured so that the manufacturing process of the black matrix <b>110</b><i>d</i>, the color filter film <b>110</b><i>e</i>, and the common electrode <b>110</b><i>f </i>are negatively influenced.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref> illustrate steps of manufacturing a color filter substrate according to an embodiment of the invention. First, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a substrate <b>200</b> is provided. The substrate <b>200</b> has a first surface <b>202</b> and a second surface <b>204</b> opposite to each other. A plurality of concaves <b>206</b> are formed on the first surface <b>202</b> of the substrate <b>200</b>. In the present embodiment, the substrate <b>200</b> may be, for example, a glass substrate, a plastic substrate, or other suitable substrates for manufacturing a color filter substrate. The method of forming the concaves <b>206</b> includes, for example, performing an etching process. Specifically, the etching process includes an anisotropic etching process or an isotropic etching process.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the current step, the conditions of the manufacturing process can be adjusted so as to control the shape, the size, and the depth of the concaves <b>206</b>. For example, the concaves <b>206</b> are formed by an anisotropic etching process so as to have arc-like sidewalls as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. In other embodiment, if the concaves <b>206</b> are formed by an isotropic etching process, the concaves <b>206</b> may have substantially vertical sidewalls. On the other hand, the shapes of the concaves <b>206</b> can be a bowl-like shape or a band-like shape if the substrate <b>200</b> is viewed from the upper side of the first surface <b>202</b>. It is noted that the distribution of the concaves <b>206</b> can be delta distribution, i.e. two neighboring columns (or rows) of the concaves <b>206</b> are interlaced.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a light-shielding layer <b>210</b> is formed on the first surface <b>202</b> of the substrate <b>200</b>, and the light shielding layer <b>210</b> defines a plurality of light-transparent openings <b>212</b>. The method of forming light-shielding layer <b>210</b> includes forming a non-transparent material on the first surface <b>202</b> of the substrate <b>200</b> by performing a coating process. Thereafter, a photolithographic process is performed to define the patterns of the light-transparent openings <b>212</b>, and an etching process is performed on the non-transparent material coated on the first surface <b>202</b> to form the plurality of the light-transparent openings <b>212</b> so that the light-shielding layer <b>210</b> is fabricated. The size and the disposition location of the light-transparent openings <b>212</b> are changed through the adjustment of the photolithographic process. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, each light-transparent opening <b>212</b> is substantially located at the right center of the bottom of one concave <b>206</b>. In other embodiments, each light-transparent opening <b>212</b> can be located at the location beside the right center of the bottom of one concave <b>206</b>, the location between two concaves <b>206</b>, or other locations. If each light-transparent opening <b>212</b> is located at the location beside the right center of the bottom of one concave <b>206</b>, the viewers located at different sides of the multi-view LCD apparatus having the color filter substrate can view at different viewing-angle for the best displayed images so that the color filter substrate can be applied in an automobile display apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Then, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2C and 2D</figref>, a planar layer <b>220</b> can be formed on the first surface <b>202</b> of the substrate <b>200</b> for rendering the first surface <b>202</b> of the substrate <b>200</b> flat in the present embodiment. The method of forming the planar layer <b>220</b> includes forming a planar material layer <b>220</b>A and performing a planarization process, wherein the planar material layer <b>220</b>A completely fills the concaves <b>206</b> and covers the light shielding layer <b>210</b>. In the process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the condition of coating the planar material layer <b>220</b>A on the first surface <b>202</b> is difficultly controlled so that the surface of the planar material layer <b>220</b>A is not exactly flat. Therefore, the planarization process such as a polishing process or a reflow process is required to forming the planar layer <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In other embodiments, the method of forming the planar layer <b>220</b> can include forming a first planar material layer on the substrate <b>200</b> and subsequently forming a second planar material layer on the first planar material layer, wherein the first planar material layer completely fills the concaves <b>206</b> and covers the light-shielding layer <b>210</b>. The second planar material layer formed on the first planar material layer with poor surface planarity can have better surface uniformity. Substantially, a material of the planar layer <b>220</b> can be transparent material, and the refraction index of the planar layer <b>220</b> can be similar or equivalent to that of the substrate <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, a color filter layer <b>230</b> is formed on the substrate <b>200</b> to complete the color filter substrate <b>240</b>. In the present embodiment, the light-transparent openings <b>212</b> are located at the bottoms of concaves <b>206</b>, and the color filter layer <b>230</b> is formed on the first surface <b>202</b> of the substrate <b>200</b>. The method of forming the color filter layer <b>230</b> includes forming a black matrix <b>232</b> on the first surface <b>202</b> of the substrate <b>200</b> and subsequently forming a plurality of color filter films <b>234</b> in at least one first sub-pixel area <b>234</b><i>a </i>and at least one second sub-pixel area <b>234</b><i>b </i>defined by the black matrix <b>232</b>. It is noted that the formation sequence of the black matrix <b>232</b> and the color filter films <b>234</b> is not restricted by the aforesaid description, and the formation sequence of the black matrix <b>232</b> and the color filter films <b>234</b> can be varied and are not listed herein. In an embodiment, the color filter films <b>234</b> include red filter films, green filter films or blue filter films.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The color filter substrate <b>240</b> includes the substrate <b>200</b>, the light-shielding layer <b>210</b>, and the color filter layer <b>230</b>. The substrate <b>200</b> has the first surface <b>202</b>, the second surface <b>204</b>, and the concaves <b>206</b>, wherein the first surface <b>202</b> is opposite to the second surface <b>204</b>, and the concaves <b>206</b> are located at the first surface <b>202</b>. The light-shielding layer <b>210</b> disposed on the first surface <b>202</b> of the substrate <b>200</b> defines a plurality of light-transparent openings <b>212</b>. The light-transparent openings <b>212</b> are located at the bottoms of the concaves <b>206</b> and the color filter layer <b>230</b> is disposed on the first surface <b>202</b> of the substrate <b>200</b>. Furthermore, the planar layer <b>220</b> can be further disposed between the substrate <b>200</b> and the color filter layer <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">By the light-shielding effect of the light-shielding layer <b>210</b>, the first light L<b>1</b> and the second light L<b>2</b> carry different image information after passing through the first sub-pixel area <b>234</b><i>a </i>and the second sub-pixel area <b>234</b><i>b</i>, respectively. In addition, the first light L<b>1</b> and the second light L<b>2</b> pass through the light-transparent openings <b>212</b> in different directions to display two different displayed images. That is to say, a first viewer V<b>1</b> and a second viewer V<b>2</b> located at different sides of the color filter substrate <b>240</b> would see different images. Furthermore, the light-shielding layer <b>210</b> of the present embodiment is conducive to prevent the first viewer V<b>1</b> or the viewer watching the image in a larger angle from seeing the light L<b>3</b> emitted from other sub-pixel area such as the sub-pixel area <b>234</b><i>c</i>. Therefore, the color filter substrate <b>240</b> applied in a multi-view display apparatus is helpful to enhance the display quality thereof. Particularly, the light-transparent openings <b>212</b> of the light-shielding layer <b>210</b> are formed at the bottoms of the concaves <b>206</b> to keep a distance from the color filter layer <b>230</b> in the color filter substrate <b>240</b> of the present embodiment, so that the planar layer <b>202</b> does not necessarily have extreme thickness to accomplish the multi-view function. Accordingly, the bending and the deformation of the substrate <b>200</b> causing by the variation between the thermal expansion coefficients of the substrate <b>200</b> and the planar layer <b>220</b> is prevented so that the subsequent process is not affected and the process yield of the color filter substrate <b>240</b> is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">For example, when a distance d<b>1</b> between the centers of two adjacent sub-pixel areas such as sub-pixel areas <b>234</b><i>a </i>and <b>234</b><i>b</i>, or sub-pixel areas <b>234</b><i>b </i>and <b>234</b><i>c </i>is P, a width w of each light-transparent opening <b>212</b> is substantially smaller than or equal to P, e.g. the width w can be from 2 P/5 to 2 P/3. Moreover, the depth t of the concave <b>206</b> covered by the light-shielding layer <b>210</b> can be smaller than or equal to P. Owing that the concaves <b>206</b> covered by the light-shielding layer <b>210</b> is located inside the substrate <b>200</b>, the increase of the depth t of the concave <b>206</b> covered by the light-shielding layer <b>210</b> would not increase the thickness of the color filter substrate <b>240</b>. That is to say, the thickness of the color filter substrate <b>240</b> is not increased in order to achieve the multi-view function, which facilitates the thickness miniaturization of the display apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Specifically, the width w of each light-transparent openings <b>212</b> and the partial depth t of the concaves <b>206</b> covered by the light-shielding layer <b>210</b> can be larger or smaller based on different design requirements. If the color filter layer <b>230</b> is disposed on the first surface <b>202</b> as shown in the present embodiment, the distance d<b>2</b> between the color filter layer <b>230</b> and the substrate <b>200</b> can be from 5 &#x3bc;m to 10 &#x3bc;m. In particular, the opening of each concave <b>206</b> in the color filter substrate <b>240</b> illustrated in the cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref> is corresponding to two sub-pixel areas <b>234</b><i>a </i>and <b>234</b><i>b </i>so that the color filter substrate <b>240</b> can be used in the dual-view display apparatus. Nevertheless, in other embodiments, the opening of each concave <b>206</b> can be located corresponding to more than two sub-pixel areas <b>234</b><i>a</i>, <b>234</b><i>b</i>, <b>234</b><i>c </i>. . . so that the color filter substrate <b>240</b> can be used in multi-view display apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a color filter substrate according to another embodiment of the invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the color filter substrate <b>300</b> is similar to the aforesaid color filter substrate <b>240</b>, so that most of the components of the color filter <b>300</b> are substantially the same as those of the color filter substrate <b>240</b>. Specifically, the difference between the color filter substrate <b>240</b> and the color filter substrate <b>300</b> is the disposition location of the color filter layer <b>230</b>. In the color filter substrate <b>300</b>, the light-transparent openings <b>212</b> are located between the concaves <b>206</b>, and the color filter layer <b>230</b> is disposed on the second surface <b>204</b> of the substrate <b>200</b>. In other words, the concaves <b>206</b> and the color filter layer <b>230</b> are located at two different surfaces of the substrate <b>200</b>. The color filter substrate <b>300</b> can be applied in the dual-view display apparatus, and the color filter substrate <b>300</b> having the light-shielding layer <b>210</b> is helpful to improve the display quality of the multi-view display apparatus and the process yield thereof, and is further apt to reduce the thickness of the multi-view display apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to the color filter substrates <b>240</b> and <b>300</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2E and 3</figref>, the first light L<b>1</b> and the second light L<b>2</b> are simultaneously transmitted to the first viewer V<b>1</b> and the second viewer V<b>2</b>. The first light L<b>1</b> is transmitted to the first viewer V<b>1</b> by passing through one of the light-transparent openings <b>212</b> and one of the first sub-pixel areas <b>234</b><i>a</i>. Meanwhile, the second light L<b>2</b> is transmitted to the second viewer V<b>2</b> by passing through the same one of the light-transparent openings <b>212</b> and one of the second sub-pixel areas <b>234</b><i>b</i>. Accordingly, the color filter substrates <b>240</b> and <b>300</b> can have multi-view display effect.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a schematic cross-sectional view of an LCD apparatus according to another embodiment of the invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an LCD apparatus <b>400</b> includes a color filter substrate <b>410</b>, an opposite substrate <b>420</b>, and a liquid crystal layer <b>430</b>. The liquid crystal layer <b>430</b> is disposed between the color filter substrate <b>410</b> and the opposite substrate <b>420</b>. The color filter substrate <b>410</b> can be selected from one of the color filter substrates <b>240</b> and <b>300</b> depicted in the foregoing descriptions, and can also be other color filter substrates designed in a manner consistent with the scope of the invention. The opposite substrate <b>420</b> can be an active device array substrate. In other embodiments, the color filter substrate <b>420</b> may further include an active device array structure. If the LCD apparatus <b>400</b> is a transmissive LCD or a transflective LCD, a backlight module <b>440</b> can be further included in the LCD apparatus <b>400</b>, and the color filter substrate <b>410</b>, the opposite substrate <b>420</b>, and the liquid crystal layer <b>430</b> are disposed above the backlight module <b>440</b>. The color filter substrate <b>410</b> can be any of the color filter substrates described in the aforesaid embodiments, so that the LCD apparatus <b>400</b> is a multi-view display apparatus having desirable display quality and high process yield.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A multi-layer substrate can be used during manufacturing the color filter substrate to improve the yield of the color filter substrate. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a schematic cross-sectional view of a color filter substrate according to further another embodiment of the invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the color filter substrate <b>540</b> has similar structure to the color filter substrate <b>240</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>. Nevertheless, the substrate <b>500</b> can be consisted of the first substrate <b>500</b><i>a </i>and the second substrate <b>500</b><i>b</i>. The first substrate <b>500</b><i>a </i>can be a glass substrate or a plastic substrate and can be fabricated through the foregoing process. The second substrate <b>500</b><i>b </i>can be the other glass substrate or the other plastic substrate for supporting the first substrate <b>500</b><i>a</i>. Other embodiments can be shown as those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a schematic cross-sectional view of a color filter substrate according to further another embodiment of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a schematic cross-sectional view of an LCD apparatus according to another embodiment of the invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the color filter substrate <b>600</b> is similar to the color filter substrate <b>300</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, but the substrate <b>610</b> of the color filter substrate <b>600</b> is consisted of a first substrate <b>610</b><i>a </i>and a second substrate <b>610</b><i>b</i>. In addition, the method of manufacturing the first substrate <b>610</b><i>a </i>can be referred to the method of manufacturing the substrate <b>200</b> mentioned above, and the second substrate <b>610</b><i>b </i>is used to support the first substrate <b>610</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an LCD apparatus <b>700</b> is approximately identical to the LCD apparatus <b>400</b>. Nevertheless, the substrate <b>720</b> of the color filter substrate <b>710</b> in the LCD apparatus <b>700</b> includes a first substrate <b>720</b><i>a </i>and a second substrate <b>720</b><i>b</i>. The method of manufacturing the first substrate <b>720</b><i>a </i>can be referred to the method of manufacturing the substrate <b>200</b> mentioned above. In addition, the second substrate <b>720</b><i>b </i>is also used for carrying and supporting the first substrate <b>720</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In view of the above, the color filter substrate of the invention accomplish the multi-view display effect by forming the shielding layer having the plurality of light-transparent openings on the substrate having the concaves. Accordingly, the light-shielding layer efficiently separates the light to-be transmitted to different fields of view and prevents the light to-be transmitted to different fields of view from interfering with each other so that the light-shielding layer is apt to improve the display quality of the multi-view LCD apparatus of the invention. When the light-shielding layer is formed on the substrate having the concaves, the light-transparent openings of the light-shielding layer keep a distance from the color filter layer by the substrate. Therefore, the planar layer does not require having extreme thickness to facilitate the multi-view display effect, which is conducive to reduce the thickness of the color filter substrate and enhance the process yield of the color filter substrate. Consequently, the color filter substrate and the LCD apparatus of the invention have desirable display quality and high process yield, and further comply with the thinner volume requirement of the market.</p>
