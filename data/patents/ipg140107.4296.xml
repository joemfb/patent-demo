<p id="p-0002" num="0001">A claim of priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 is made to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2010-0128120, filed on Dec. 15, 2010, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments relate to a negative high voltage generator, and more particularly to a negative high voltage generator that is small in size, and a non-volatile memory device including the negative high voltage generator.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Generally, magnitude of a negative supply voltage is amplified using pumping stages, each of which includes an N-type metal oxide semiconductor (NMOS) transistor formed on a P+ type silicon substrate to generate a negative high voltage. Each of the NMOS transistors included in the pumping stages amplifies a magnitude of a negative voltage received from a previous pumping stage and provides the amplified negative voltage to a next pumping stage.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Usually, when a negative high voltage is applied to an NMOS transistor, leakage current flows from a drain region of the NMOS transistor to a P+ type silicon substrate, so that the NMOS transistor cannot sufficiently amplify the magnitude of the negative high voltage. To prevent the leakage current, a P+ type well surrounding a source region and a drain region of the NMOS transistor, and an N+ type well surrounding the P+ type well is formed in the P+ type silicon substrate in a conventional negative high voltage generator, an example of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>

The second clock signal may be an inverted version of the first clock signal, where the first clock signal and the second clock signal toggle between the ground voltage and the supply voltage. A last NMOS transistor, connected at a last stage among the NMOS transistors, may output the positive charges at a rising edge and a falling edge of the first clock signal and the second clock signal, respectively.</p>

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">During a second operation period <b>2</b>ndOP after the first transition period <b>1</b>stTP, the first switch unit <b>210</b> and the third switch unit <b>230</b> are turned off and the second switch unit <b>220</b> is turned on since the first control signal CON<b>1</b> and the second control signal CON<b>2</b> are in a logic high level and the third control signal CON<b>3</b> is in a logic low level during the second operation period <b>2</b>ndOP. Therefore, the second node N<b>2</b> is floated and the first node N<b>1</b> is connected to the ground voltage GND, so that the positive charges PC stored at the first electrode of the coupling capacitor <b>240</b> are discharged to the ground voltage GND. As a result, the voltage VN<b>1</b> of the first node N<b>1</b> decreases from the positive high voltage VPOS to the ground voltage GND and the voltage VN<b>2</b> of the second node N<b>2</b> decreases from the ground voltage GND to the negative high voltage VNEG. The magnitude of the negative high voltage VNEG may be substantially the same as the magnitude of the positive high voltage VPOS. Therefore, the voltage conversion unit <b>200</b><i>a </i>may provide the negative high voltage VNEG at the second electrode of the coupling capacitor <b>240</b> during the second operation period <b>2</b>ndOP.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As described above, the first control signal CON<b>1</b> is in a logic high level during the second operation period <b>2</b>ndOP, so that the first switch unit <b>210</b> connected to the charge providing unit <b>100</b> is turned off.

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">During a second transition period <b>2</b>ndTP after the second operation period <b>2</b>ndOP, the second control signal CON<b>2</b> changes to a logic low level, so that the second switch unit <b>220</b> is turned off. After that, the third control signal CON<b>3</b> changes to a logic high level, so that the third switch unit <b>230</b> is turned on. Therefore, the voltage VN<b>2</b> of the second node N<b>2</b> is clamped to the ground voltage GND. At the end of the second transition period <b>2</b>ndTP, the first control signal CON<b>1</b> changes to a logic low level, so that the first switch unit <b>210</b> is turned on.</p>

Therefore, a detail description of the first switch unit <b>210</b>, the second switch unit <b>220</b>, the third switch unit <b>230</b> and the coupling capacitor Cc <b>240</b> will not be repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">A cathode of the diode <b>250</b> is connected to the second electrode of the coupling capacitor <b>240</b> at the second node N<b>2</b>, an anode of the diode <b>250</b> is connected to an external device, for example.

<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, during the first operation period <b>1</b>stOP, the voltage VN<b>2</b> of the second node N<b>2</b> is clamped to the ground voltage GND, causing the diode <b>250</b> to turn off.

<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The conventional negative high voltage generator amplifies a negative supply voltage using pumping stages, each of which includes an NMOS transistor formed on a P+ type silicon substrate to generate a negative high voltage. Each of the NMOS transistors included in the pumping stages amplifies a magnitude of a negative voltage received from a previous pumping stage and provides the amplified negative voltage to a next pumping stage. When a negative high voltage is applied to an NMOS transistor, a leakage current typically flows from a drain region of the NMOS transistor to the P+ type silicon substrate, so that the NMOS transistor cannot sufficiently amplify the magnitude of the negative high voltage. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, to prevent the leakage current in the conventional negative high voltage generator, a P+ type well surrounds a source region and a drain region of the NMOS transistor and an N+ type well surrounds the P+ type well, formed in the P+ type silicon substrate. However, when the NMOS transistor has the structure as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, latch-up may occur and the size of the NMOS transistor may increase.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In contrast, the negative high voltage generator <b>1000</b> according to various embodiments generates the positive high voltage VPOS using the positive supply voltage VDD and then inverts the polarity of the positive high voltage VPOS using the coupling capacitor <b>240</b> to generate the negative high voltage VNEG, so that a negative voltage is not applied to the NMOS transistors M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>, M<b>3</b>, M<b>4</b> and M<b>5</b> included in the charge providing unit <b>100</b>. Therefore, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the plurality of the NMOS transistors M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>, M<b>3</b>, M<b>4</b> and M<b>5</b> included in the charge providing unit <b>100</b> may include an N+ type source and an N+ type drain that are directly formed in a P+ type substrate, i.e., without the P+ type well and the N+ type well of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. As a result, the negative high voltage generator <b>1000</b> according to various embodiments has a relatively small size and is able to avoid latch-up.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a flow chart showing a method of generating a negative high voltage, according to illustrative embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a second electrode of a coupling capacitor is connected to a ground voltage and positive charges provided from a supply voltage are periodically stored at a first electrode of the coupling capacitor (step S<b>100</b>). A voltage of the first electrode of the coupling capacitor increases as the positive charges are stored at the first electrode of the coupling capacitor. When the positive charges are fully stored at the first electrode of the coupling capacitor, the voltage of the first electrode of the coupling capacitor may be a positive high voltage having a magnitude larger than a magnitude of the supply voltage. The second electrode of the coupling capacitor is then disconnected from the ground voltage and the first electrode of the coupling capacitor is connected to the ground voltage (step S<b>200</b>). The voltage of the first electrode of the coupling capacitor decreases from the positive high voltage to the ground voltage and the voltage of the second electrode of the coupling capacitor decreases from the ground voltage to a negative high voltage. A magnitude of the negative high voltage may be substantially the same as the magnitude of the positive high voltage. Thus, the negative high voltage, the magnitude of which is larger than the magnitude of the supply voltage, is output at the second electrode of the coupling capacitor (step S<b>300</b>).</p>
