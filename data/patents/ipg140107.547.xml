<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">An apparatus and method of using a gripping assembly for gripping a sheet of material and attaching the sheet of material to an object is provided. The gripping assembly has a continuous ring-like member having an opening defined by an interior tapered engagement surface, a disk-like member positionable within the opening. The disk-like member has an exterior tapered engagement surface which cooperates with the tapered surface of the ring-like member. A sheet of material, threaded between the engagement surfaces is gripped by the surfaces. The disk-like member has an attachment means with at least one passageway there through. A flexible tie member extends through at least one passageway of the attachment means and is for attaching the gripping assembly to an object.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring now to the drawings, and initially <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-10</figref>, a gripping assembly <b>1</b> is presented in accordance with the present invention for gripping a sheet of material <b>31</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the gripping assembly has a disk-like member <b>11</b>, a ring-like member <b>2</b>, a flexible tie member <b>23</b>, an attachment means <b>19</b>, and a tie-member lock <b>25</b>. The function of the gripping assembly is for gripping a sheet of material <b>31</b>, thereby allowing the sheet of material <b>31</b> to be secured to an object. The material can be secured to any object, such as a bed post, a pole, a tent stake, a bed of a truck, a mattress, to further gripping assemblies, or any desired other object.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-C</figref> are perspective views of the assembly, with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> showing the top of the assembly with a sheet of material threaded through the assembly and held in place between the ring-like and disk-like members. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a similar view showing the bottom of the assembly with a sheet of material anchored in place. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> shows a sheet of material being threaded through the assembly parts and not yet ready for clamping between the ring-like and disk-like members.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The ring-like member <b>2</b> includes a top surface <b>7</b>, a bottom surface <b>9</b>, an opening <b>3</b>, and an interior tapered engagement surface <b>5</b>. The interior tapered engagement surface <b>5</b> is preferably textured to improve the gripping of material. The texturing can be grooves, scratches, or any other rough surface. The ring-like member <b>2</b> is a continuous ring and not a split ring, thereby eliminating the short-comings of split rings, which require adjustable fasteners, such as a screw extending through flanges on the ring. The tapered engagement surface <b>5</b> tapers from a maximum diameter <b>4</b>, at or near the top surface <b>7</b> of the ring-like member, to a minimum diameter <b>6</b>, at or near the bottom surface <b>9</b> of the ring-like member. As will be understood by those of skill in the art, the tapered engagement surface <b>13</b> of the disk-like member <b>11</b> cooperates with the tapered engagement surface <b>5</b> of the ring-like member, wedging into the internal tapered surface <b>5</b>, to grippingly engage or clamp a sheet of material threaded between the disk-like and ring-like members.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The disk-like member includes a top surface <b>15</b>, a bottom surface <b>17</b>, and an attachment means <b>19</b> having at least one passageway <b>21</b> extending therethrough, and an exterior tapered engagement surface <b>13</b>. Preferably, a raised rim <b>14</b> extends along the circumference of the top surface <b>15</b>. The tapered engagement surface <b>13</b> is preferably textured to improve the gripping of the sheet of material. The tapered engagement surface <b>13</b> cooperates with the tapered engagement surface <b>5</b> of the ring-like member. The disk-like member <b>11</b> is sized to be positionable within the opening <b>3</b> of the ring-like member <b>2</b>. The tapered engagement surface <b>13</b> of the disk-like member <b>11</b> has a maximum diameter <b>16</b> at or near the top surface <b>15</b> and a minimum diameter <b>18</b> at or near the bottom surface <b>17</b> of the disk-like member. In a preferred embodiment, the maximum diameter <b>16</b> of the tapered engagement surface <b>13</b> of the disk-like member <b>11</b> is greater than the minimum diameter of the tapered engagement surface <b>5</b> of the ring-like member <b>2</b>. In such an embodiment, the disk-like member will not fit through the opening of the ring-like member. In an alternate embodiment, the diameters are selected such that the disk-like member <b>11</b> will not fit through the ring-like member <b>2</b> opening <b>3</b> when a sheet of material <b>31</b> is positioned between the engagement surfaces <b>5</b>, <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further, the cooperation of the tapered surfaces and relative diameters can be selected based on the thickness and type of sheet of material to be used. For example, where a relatively thicker sheet of material is to be used, such as a tarp, the difference between the respective diameters of the tapered surfaces may be greater, allowing the members to cooperate when the thicker material is in position between the tapered surfaces. Where a thinner material is used, such as a sheet, the difference between the relative diameters is preferably smaller. Similarly, the sizes of the disk-like and ring-like members may be larger where a less flexible material is to be used, thereby allowing the sheet of material to be threaded more easily between the tapered surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The ring-like member <b>2</b> and disk-like member <b>11</b> are preferably made of plastic, nylon, rubber, or metal. As will be apparent to those of skill in the art, the material of the disk-like and ring-like members can be any material allowing for a friction fit between the members when a sheet of material is interposed between them.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The attachment means <b>19</b> is for attaching a flexible tie member <b>23</b> to the gripping assembly. The attachment means <b>19</b> defines at least one passageway <b>21</b> through which a flexible tie member <b>23</b> can be threaded. The attachment means <b>19</b> may be an integral part of the disk-like member <b>11</b>, such as the passageways <b>21</b> through the disk-like member <b>11</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>. Alternately, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the passageway <b>21</b> may extend through a separately identifiable part of the disk-like member <b>11</b>, such as a shank <b>22</b>. For example, the attachment means <b>19</b> may have one or more passageways <b>21</b> extending completely through the disk-like member <b>11</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>6</b> and <b>9</b>, or a shank extending from the bottom surface <b>17</b> of the disk-like member <b>11</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the passageways <b>21</b> extend on either side of a post or rod <b>33</b> spanning the opening <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The flexible tie member <b>23</b> is preferably a cord, strap, string, rope, band, or belt. The flexible tie member <b>23</b> can be made of various materials, including natural or synthetic materials, such as nylon straps or cords or natural-fiber ropes or strings. The tie member <b>23</b> is threaded through at least one of the passageways <b>21</b> of the attachment means <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The flexible tie member <b>23</b> may be attached to the disk-like member <b>11</b> such that it has two free ends <b>27</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Alternately, the tie member <b>23</b> may be attached to the disk-like member <b>11</b> such that it has only one free end, as, for example, where the tie member is threaded through the at least one passageway <b>21</b> and then tied, stitched or fused to itself at the free end. For example, a nylon strap may be threaded through the passageways <b>21</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, with one end then stitched to the free end of the nylon strap. Note that the passageways <b>21</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> are sized and shaped to accept a strap.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A tie member lock <b>25</b> is preferably used. The tie member lock <b>25</b> can be a cord lock, spring-loaded lock (as shown), clamp, buckle, clasp, locking slide, cam buckle, strap adjuster, snap hook, bolt snap, double ring, or ratchet. Other locks will be apparent to those of skill in the art. The tie member lock <b>25</b> can be releasably attached to the tie member, such as the spring-loaded cord lock shown, which can be slid off the tie member. Further, the tie member lock can selectively allow and prevent relative movement between the free ends (or other portions) of the tie member. Alternately, the tie member lock can be permanently attached to the tie member, such as with a buckle. The tie member lock can slidably engage the tie member, such as on the cord lock shown. The cord lock shown accommodates two free ends <b>27</b> of the flexible tie member <b>23</b> for adjusting and tightening the fit of the gripping assembly <b>1</b> and for securing the flexible tie member <b>23</b> in place and thereafter to an object. The tie lock is used to move the gripping assembly, and sheet of material gripped thereby, relative to the object to which it is attached. For example, the tie lock can be used to &#x201c;cinch&#x201d; the assembly closer to the object.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The sheet of material <b>31</b> is gripped by the disk-like member and the ring-like member. The sheet of material can be anchored to a post, truck bed, etc. by the gripping assembly <b>1</b>. The sheet of material can be any flexible sheet of material including a tarp, a bed sheet, a canvas material, etc. The flexible sheet of material can be a tent, an awning, a cover, a top sheet, a plastic tarp, etc. The sheet of material is of such a thickness that the disk-like member cannot be pulled completely through the ring-like member when the sheet of material is fitted and engaged in the gripping assembly. When the interior tapered engagement surface <b>5</b> of the ring-like member <b>2</b> and the exterior tapered engagement surface <b>13</b> of the disk-like member <b>11</b> are fully cooperating, the sheet of material <b>31</b> is secured to the gripping assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The tie member <b>23</b> is used to attach the gripping assembly <b>1</b> securely to a desired object. The object can be a bed post, a tent stake, a bed of a truck, or any other object to which the gripping assembly can be secured. The flexible tie member <b>23</b> can also connect multiple gripping assemblies <b>1</b> to one another, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. In such an arrangement, the gripping assemblies <b>1</b> are connected by the flexible tie member <b>23</b> and can be cinched together by pulling one or both of the free ends <b>27</b> of the tie member <b>23</b>. The tie member lock <b>25</b> can be used to selectively allow or prevent relative movement of the free ends. In such a way, the sheet of material <b>31</b> can be secured over a bed <b>35</b>, such as securing a tarp over a loaded truck bed or tightly securing a bed sheet to a mattress.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring now to the method of use of the gripping assembly, a sheet of material <b>31</b>, is threaded between the interior tapered engagement surface <b>5</b> of the ring-like member <b>2</b> and the exterior tapered engagement surface <b>13</b> of the disk-like member <b>11</b> and covers the top surface <b>15</b> of the disk-like member. The disk-like member <b>11</b> is positioned in the opening <b>3</b> of the ring-like member <b>2</b>. A friction fit is created between the tapered engagement surfaces <b>5</b>, <b>13</b> with the sheet of material <b>31</b> gripped securely there between. The method includes moving the disk-like member <b>11</b> and ring-like member <b>2</b> relative to one another to allow for a secure grip of the sheet of material <b>31</b>. The flexible tie member <b>23</b> is connected to the attachment means <b>19</b> of the disk-like member <b>11</b>. The relative movement can be accomplished by pulling the flexible tie member <b>23</b>, pulling the sheet of material <b>31</b>, or by pushing down on the top surface of the disk-like member and thereby creating a friction fit.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The gripping assembly <b>1</b> is attached by the tie member <b>23</b> to a desired object, such as a post, pole, stake, truck bed, etc. The tie member <b>23</b> is then adjusted to move the gripping assembly, and the sheet of material, with respect to the object. For example, the gripping assembly is pulled in closer proximity to a tent post to tighten or erect a tent, or a tarp is pulled tightly over a bed of a truck.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The flexible tie member <b>23</b> is preferably attached to a tie member lock <b>25</b>. The tie member lock can be moved relative to one or both free ends of the tie member, or relative to portions of the tie member. The lock preferably selectively allows or prevents relative movement of portions of the tie member. The flexible tie member <b>23</b> is pulled or otherwise moved in relation to the lock, allowing for an adjusted tight and secure fit of the gripping assembly <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The gripping assembly, in accordance with the present invention, may be used in combination with multiple gripping assemblies to secure a tarp to the bed of a truck at all corners, tightly fit a sheet to a mattress at all corners, etc. as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Although this invention has been described with a certain degree of particularity, it is to be understood that the present disclosure has been made by way of example only and that numerous changes in the detailed construction and the combination and arrangement of parts may be resorted to without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as hereinafter claimed.</p>
