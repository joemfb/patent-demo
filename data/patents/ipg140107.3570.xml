Nos. 13/609,377 filed on Sep. 11, 2012 and 13/609,524 filed on Sep. 11, 2012, each hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention generally relates to a sensor circuit module, especially to a multi-stage sensor circuit module.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A sample and hold a circuit for a traditional touch panel may be saturated due to large instantaneous noise. The instantaneous noise may come from a power supply, a conductive substance touching the panel, a human body approaching the panel or the like, causing a difference between a sensing value of a sensor in the touch panel and a value sampled and held by the S/H circuit. In other words, the S/H circuit must discard the value sampled and held this time, and then perform the S/H operation on the sensing value of the sensor in the touch panel again. As such, not only is the operation time for the S/H circuit is increased, and it may not be possible to measure the original sensing value of the sensor in the touch panel in the next S/H operation. (For example, assuming in the previous S/H operation the S/H circuit has obtained 40% of the sensing value of the sensor in the touch panel, but this value is discarded due to saturation caused by the instantaneous noise, then the S/H circuit may only obtain the remaining 60% of the sensing value of the sensor in the current S/H operation).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Moreover, the S/H circuits for traditional touch panels typically operate only in the positive or negative pulses, so 50% of the clock cycles are wasted. Alternatively, some S/H circuits employ inverters so that they can operate in both the positive and negative pulses (e.g. negative pulses are converted into positive pulses via the inverter, and a S/H circuit operating in the positive pulses can now operate in what originally were the negative pulses). However, transmission time delays in the inverters may result in pulse overlap in high-speed S/H circuits. For example, assuming that after a negative pulse is converted into a positive pulse via an inverter, a 5% transmission time delay is introduced to the pulse, then the pulse time of the last 5% of the waveform of this positive pulse will overlap the pulse time of the first 5% of the waveform of the next positive pulse. This pulse overlap problem is more noticeable and severe particularly in high-frequency S/H circuits or inverters with large transmission time delays, which may even result in an S/H circuit disorder. Alternatively, some S/H circuits employ inverters to directly perform phase conversion on the results sampled and held by the S/H circuits before using them. However, control clocks of the inverters and the transmission time delays are still problems that are yet to be solved.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of these shortcomings, the present invention thus provides a multi-stage S/H circuit for positive and negative pulse cycles that alleviates the saturation issue caused by the instantaneous noise in the traditional S/H circuits and addresses the pulse overlap problem in the traditional S/H circuits for positive and negative pulse cycles, while achieving S/H operations for positive and negative pulse cycles.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Among traditional ADC, SAR-ADC is a common ADC. In the design of SAR-ADC, a binary tree structure is formed by a capacitor array. Utilizing a comparator and a control logic, the SAR-ADC can deliver an output bits which has nth order of 2. As mentioned above, an ordinary S/H circuit also comprises a capacitor used to integrate the input analog signal.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Since the capacitor occupies a quite large die area, if capacitors can be shared by S/H circuit and the attached SAR-ADC, some die area could be spared, thus decreasing manufacture cost.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention provides a circuit for concurrent integration of multiple differential signals. The circuit comprises a plurality of Stage 1 integration circuits arranged in array and a plurality of Stage 2 integration circuits arrange in array. Each of the Stage 1 integration circuits is configured to concurrently integrate an input signal to send out a Stage 1 positive signal and a Stage 1 negative signal that is reverse to the Stage 1 positive signal. Each of the Stage 2 integration circuits is configured to integrate a differential signal from a Stage 1 positive signal sent from a corresponding Stage 1 integration circuit and a Stage 1 negative signal sent from another Stage 1 integration circuit next to the corresponding Stage 1 integration circuit to output a Stage 2 signal.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment of the present invention, a sensor circuit module is provided. The sensor circuit module comprises a first Stage 1 sample and hold (S/H) circuit, a second Stage 1 S/H circuit, and a first Stage 2 S/H circuit. The first Stage 1 sample and hold (S/H) circuit is configured to integrate a first input signal and to send out a first positive signal and a first negative signal. The first positive signal is reverse to the first negative signal. The second Stage 1 S/H circuit is configured to integrate a second input signal and to send out a second positive signal and a second negative signal. The second positive signal is reverse to the second negative signal. The first Stage 2 S/H circuit is configured to receive and combine the first positive signal and the second negative signal into a first Stage 2 input signal to be integrated by the first Stage 2 S/H circuit.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Some embodiments of the present invention are described in details below. However, in addition to the descriptions given below, the present invention can be applicable to other embodiments, and the scope of the present invention is not limited by such, rather by the scope of the claims. Moreover, for better understanding and clarity of the description, some components in the drawings may not necessary be drawn to scale, in which some may be exaggerated relative to others, and irrelevant parts are omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a block diagram illustrating a preferred embodiment <b>10</b> of the present invention is shown. A first sample and hold (S/H) circuit <b>110</b> samples a sensing signal of a sensor in multiple stages and accumulates them into a first sampled signal, and outputs this first sampled signal at a first determined time. A second S/H circuit <b>120</b> receives a plurality of the first sampled signals outputted by the first S/H circuit <b>110</b> and sums them into a second sampled signal, and outputs this second sampled signal at a second determined time. In this embodiment, the first S/H circuit <b>110</b> first samples the sensing signal of the sensor in multiple short durations, and then accumulates them and stores it, and then outputs it to the second S/H circuit <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The second S/H circuit <b>120</b> receives a plurality of outputs from the first S/H circuit <b>110</b> and sums them and stores it, and finally outputs the total sensing signal of the sampled sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the operations of the first S/H circuit <b>110</b> and the second S/H circuit <b>120</b>, although the first S/H circuit <b>110</b> may be saturated due to the instantaneous noise being too large, this only affects a small portion of the multi-sampled results of the first S/H circuit <b>110</b>, and the sampled results of the second S/H circuit <b>120</b> will not be significantly influenced, thus eliminating the saturation issue of the traditional S/H circuits as a result of the instantaneous noise being too large. For example, assuming the first S/H circuit <b>110</b> samples and accumulates the sensing signal in three short durations (e.g. 3 times/0.5 pulse) before outputting it to the second S/H circuit <b>120</b>; and the second S/H circuit <b>120</b> receives and sums <b>20</b> outputs of the first S/H circuit <b>110</b> before outputting the total sensing signal sampled, then even if the first S/H circuit <b>110</b> is saturated one or a few times due to the instantaneous noise, it would be more difficult to saturate the second S/H circuit <b>120</b> during the sampling process, thereby increasing the tolerance to noise of the S/H circuit. Furthermore, for the total sampled sensing signal, even if one or some saturated result(s) of the first S/H circuit <b>110</b> is discarded, the effect on the total sampled sensing signal is relatively smaller than that in the prior art. For example, assuming two sampled results of the first S/H circuit <b>110</b> have become saturated due to the instantaneous noise being too large, but these two is only 1/10 of the total 20.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a block diagram illustrating a preferred embodiment <b>15</b> of the present invention is shown. Functions and corresponding relationships of two first S/H circuits <b>160</b>A and <b>160</b>B and two second S/H circuits <b>170</b>A and <b>170</b>B are similar to those of the first S/H circuit <b>110</b> and the second S/H circuit <b>120</b> described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. The difference is in that the two first S/H circuits <b>160</b>A and <b>160</b>B further provide sampled results with polarities opposite to those of the original to specific second S/H circuits. In this embodiment, for example, the first S/H circuit <b>160</b>B further outputs sampled results with inverted polarities to the second S/H circuit <b>170</b>A, thereby eliminating the noise in the sensing signals. The following will be described using this embodiment, and one with ordinary skill in the art can make various modifications based on the descriptions of this embodiment without departing from the scope of the present invention, and thus these modifications will not be described in the application.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the first S/H circuits <b>160</b>A and <b>160</b>B each sample a respective sensing signal of two sensors A and B in multiple short durations and accumulate them into two first sampled signals, and then output the two positive and negative first sampled signals in a first determined time. In this embodiment, the first S/H circuits <b>160</b>A and <b>160</b>B each output the positive first sampled signal to the respective second S/H circuits <b>170</b>A and <b>170</b>B; meanwhile, the first S/H circuit <b>160</b>A also outputs the negative first sampled signal to another second S/H circuit; the first S/H circuit <b>160</b>B also outputs the negative first sampled signal to the second S/H circuit <b>170</b>A; and the second S/H circuit <b>170</b>B also receives the negative first sampled signal of another first S/H circuit at the same time. According to the above operations, the second S/H circuits <b>170</b>A and <b>170</b>B each receive the difference of the first sampled signals. Taking the second S/H circuit <b>170</b>A as an example, it receives both the positive first sampled signal from the first S/H circuit <b>160</b>A and the negative first sampled signal from the first S/H circuit <b>160</b>B, when the adjacent sensors A and B both experience similar noise, the noise in the positive and negative first sampled signals will cancel each other out, that is, this difference is a sampled sensing value with low noise. Since during the actual sensing of a typical touch panel, adjacent or nearby sensors often have the same amount of sensing noise, so a large portion of such sensing noise can be eliminated through the above processing mechanism in this embodiment. Thus, in this embodiment, the sensors A and B can be two adjacent or nearby sensors in a touch panel.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The above description illustrates the operations of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>; in positive pulse cycles, the operations in negative pulse cycles are described as follows. The first S/H circuits <b>160</b>A and <b>160</b>B each still sample the respective sensing signal of the two sensors A and B in multiple short durations and accumulate them into two first sampled signals, and then output the two positive and negative first sampled signals in a first determined time. The difference is in that, in here, the first S/H circuits <b>160</b>A and <b>160</b>B each output the negative first sampled signal to the respective second S/H circuits <b>170</b>A and <b>170</b>B; meanwhile, the first S/H circuit <b>160</b>A also outputs the negative first sampled signal to another second S/H circuit; the first S/H circuit <b>160</b>B also outputs the positive first sampled signal to the second S/H circuit <b>170</b>A; and the second S/H circuit <b>170</b>B also receives the positive first sampled signal of another first S/H circuit at the same time. According to these operations, each of the second S/H circuits <b>170</b>A and <b>170</b>B also receives the difference of the first sampled signals. Again, take the second S/H circuit <b>170</b>A as an example: it receives both the negative first sampled signal from the first S/H circuit <b>160</b>A and the positive first sampled signal from the first S/H circuit <b>160</b>B, and when the adjacent sensors A and B both experience similar noise, the noise in the positive and negative first sampled signals will cancel each other out, that is, this difference is still a sampled sensing value with low noise. Based on the processes and descriptions above, the present embodiment can operate in both the negative and positive pulse cycles, and the concept of difference is used for eliminating noise. In an example of the present invention, the second S/H circuits provide outputs of the positive pulse cycles and outputs of the negative pulse cycles separately. In another example of the present invention, the second S/H circuits provide outputs of an accumulation of a positive and a negative pulse cycle. In yet another example of the present invention, the second S/H circuits provide outputs of an accumulation of multiple positive and negative pulse cycles.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a circuit diagram illustrating a preferred circuit <b>20</b> combining the embodiments described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> of the present invention is shown. A plurality of first S/H circuits <b>210</b> sample a corresponding plurality of sensing signals in multiple stages via a plurality of paths (e.g. paths 0, 1, . . . 46 and 47), and then accumulates them into a plurality of first sampled signals, and outputs the first sampled signals in a first determined time. A plurality of second S/H circuits <b>230</b> correspondingly receives the first sampled signals outputted multiple times by the first S/H circuits <b>210</b>, and sums them into a plurality of second sampled signals, and outputs the second sampled signals at a second determined time. In this embodiment, according to the operation principle of the embodiment <b>10</b> described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, even if one (or some) of the first S/H circuits <b>210</b> is (are) saturated due to the instantaneous noise being too large, this only affects a small portion of the multi-stage sampled results of this (these) first S/H circuit(s) <b>210</b>, and the sampled results of its (or their) corresponding second S/H circuit(s) <b>230</b> will not be greatly influenced, thus lessening the saturation issue of the traditional S/H circuits as a result of the instantaneous noise being too large. In addition, in this embodiment, according to the operation principle of the embodiment <b>15</b> described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, each first S/H circuit <b>210</b> samples the sensing signal of a corresponding sensor in multiple short durations via the corresponding path, and each second S/H circuit <b>230</b> receives both the positive first sampled signal (or the negative first sampled signal) output from its corresponding first S/H circuit <b>210</b> and the negative first sampled signal (or the positive first sampled signal) output from an adjacent first S/H circuit <b>210</b> at the same time. Thus, this embodiment not only operates in positive and negative pulse cycles, but also uses differences to eliminate the noise.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a plurality of (in this embodiment two) analog-to-digital (AD) converters <b>250</b> each receives the second sampled signals outputted by a corresponding portion of the second S/H circuits <b>230</b>, and converts the received second sampled signals from analog to digital form using timing control. A plurality of (in this embodiment two) multiplexers <b>260</b> each receives the second sampled signals outputted by a corresponding portion of the second S/H circuits <b>230</b>, and selects one of them. A plurality of (in this embodiment two) buffer amplifier <b>270</b> each receives a corresponding output of the multiplexers <b>260</b> and performs amplification, wherein the buffer amplifier <b>270</b> have a plurality of amplifying ratios to choose from.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, a detailed circuit diagram and a timing diagram illustrating some portions of the first S/H circuits, the second S/H circuit and AD converters in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are shown, respectively. Each first S/H circuit includes an operational amplifier (e.g. a first operational amplifier <b>310</b>A or <b>310</b>B), two capacitors (e.g. a first capacitor C<b>1</b>A or C<b>1</b>B and a second capacitor C<b>2</b>A or C<b>2</b>B) and a plurality of switches (e.g. <b>311</b>A, <b>312</b>A, <b>313</b>A, <b>314</b>A, <b>315</b>A, <b>316</b>A, <b>317</b>A, <b>318</b>A, <b>319</b>A, <b>320</b>A and <b>321</b>A or <b>311</b>B, <b>312</b>B, <b>313</b>B, <b>314</b>B, <b>315</b>B, <b>316</b>B, <b>317</b>B, <b>318</b>B, <b>319</b>B, <b>320</b>B and <b>321</b>B), wherein the two capacitors are connected in parallel and forming a first integration circuit with the operational amplifier. The plurality of switches are connected to the charge/discharge paths of the two capacitors, thereby controlling time and polarity of charge/discharge of the two capacitors. Each second S/H circuit also includes an operational amplifier (e.g. a second operational amplifier <b>330</b>A or <b>330</b>B), a capacitor (e.g. a third capacitor C<b>0</b> or C<b>1</b>) and a plurality of switches (e.g. <b>331</b>A, <b>332</b>A, <b>333</b>A, <b>334</b>A, <b>335</b>A, <b>336</b>A, <b>337</b>A and <b>338</b>A or <b>331</b>B, <b>332</b>B, <b>333</b>B, <b>334</b>B, <b>335</b>B, <b>336</b>B, <b>337</b>B and <b>338</b>B), wherein the capacitor and the operational amplifier form a second integration circuit, and the plurality of switches are connected to signal input selecting paths and the charge/discharge paths of the capacitor, thereby selecting an input signal and controlling charge/discharge times of the capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, when a timing signal k1 for controlling a plurality of first charge switches (e.g. first switches <b>311</b>A and <b>311</b>B, second switches <b>312</b>A and <b>312</b>B, third switches <b>313</b>A and <b>313</b>B and fourth switches <b>314</b>A and <b>314</b>B) is a positive pulse, sensing signals on the path 0 and path 1 charge the first capacitors CIA and C<b>1</b>B and the second capacitors C<b>2</b>A and the C<b>2</b>B (as indicated by solid-line paths), that is, the two first S/H circuits perform sampling on the sensing signals of the two corresponding sensors via the paths 0 and 1, respectively. When a timing signal k2 for controlling a plurality of first discharge switches (e.g. fifth switches <b>315</b>A and <b>315</b>B, sixth switches <b>316</b>A and <b>316</b>B, seventh switches <b>317</b>A and <b>317</b>B and eighth switches <b>318</b>A and <b>318</b>B) is a positive pulse, the first capacitors CIA and C<b>1</b>B and the second capacitors C<b>2</b>A and C<b>2</b>B discharge to the second S/H circuits (as indicated by dotted-line paths), that is, the two first S/H circuits output sampled and held results. In this embodiment, three k1 positive pulses are followed by one k2 positive pulse, in other words, the first S/H circuits in this embodiment performs three samplings in short durations, accumulates them and then outputs the result to the second S/H circuits. The number of short-duration samplings for accumulation performed by the first S/H circuits can be adjusted according to actual needs, and the present invention is not limited to this. In addition, based on the discharge paths of the first capacitors C<b>1</b>A and C<b>1</b>B and the second capacitors C<b>2</b>A and C<b>2</b>B, the first S/H circuits in this embodiment output both positive and negative sampled results to the second S/H circuit. For example, the first capacitor C<b>1</b>A outputs a positive sampled result to the first selecting switch <b>331</b>A via the sixth switch <b>316</b>A using Vdd/2 as a reference potential; and the second capacitor C<b>2</b>A outputs a negative sampled result to the third selecting switch <b>333</b>A via the seventh switch <b>317</b>A using Vdd/2 as a reference potential. Similarly, the first capacitor C<b>1</b>B outputs a positive sampled result to the first selecting switch <b>331</b>B via the sixth switch <b>316</b>B using Vdd/2 as a reference potential; and the second capacitor C<b>2</b>B outputs a negative sampled result to the third selecting switch <b>333</b>B via the seventh switch <b>317</b>B using Vdd/2 as a reference potential, and the first capacitor C<b>1</b>B further outputs the positive sampled result to the second selecting switch <b>333</b>A and the negative sampled result to the fourth selecting switch <b>334</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, when a timing signal k0b for controlling a plurality of clear switches (e.g. ninth switches <b>319</b>A and <b>319</b>B and tenth switches <b>320</b>A and <b>320</b>B) is a positive pulse, the first capacitors C<b>1</b>A and C<b>1</b>B and the second capacitors C<b>2</b>A and C<b>2</b>B are discharged and cleared. In this embodiment, a k0b positive pulse appears before every three k1 positive pulses and after every k2 positive pulse. This means that before the first S/H circuits perform the multi-stage samplings and accumulations, and after the first sampled signals are outputted, the first capacitors C<b>1</b>A and C<b>1</b>B and the second capacitors C<b>2</b>A and C<b>2</b>B are cleared to ensure no residual charge will affect the next sampled results. Sample control switches <b>321</b>A and <b>321</b>B are controlled with the inversion of the timing signal k1, so that when the sample control switches <b>321</b>A and <b>321</b>B are conducting, the first S/H circuits will be unable to perform samplings and accumulations.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, when timing signals k0w0 and k0w1 for controlling second charge switches (e.g. eleventh switches <b>335</b>A and <b>335</b>B and twelfth switches <b>336</b>A and <b>336</b>B) and a timing signal p1 for controlling the first selecting switches <b>331</b>A and <b>331</b>B and the fourth selecting switches <b>334</b>A and <b>334</b>B are positive pulses, then the positive sampled result from the first capacitor C<b>1</b>A and the negative sampled result from the adjacent second capacitor C<b>2</b>B will simultaneously charge the third capacitor C<b>0</b>. Similarly, the positive sampled result from the first capacitor C<b>1</b>B and the negative sampled result from another adjacent second capacitor will simultaneously charge the third capacitor C<b>1</b>. In other words, the two second S/H circuits each simultaneously receives a positive first sampled signal outputted from its corresponding first S/H circuit and a negative first sampled signal outputted from its adjacent first S/H circuit. Adjacent or nearby sensors in the touch panels often have similar sensing noise, so through the above process of obtaining the differences, the sensing noise in the positive and negative first sampled signals will cancel out each other; that is, the two second S/H circuits will receive sampled sensing values with low noise.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, when the timing signals k0w0 and k0w1 for controlling second charge switches (e.g. eleventh switches <b>335</b>A and <b>335</b>B and twelfth switches <b>336</b>A and <b>336</b>B) and a timing signal p2 for controlling the second selecting switches <b>332</b>A and <b>332</b>B and the third selecting switches <b>333</b>A and <b>333</b>B are positive pulses, then the negative sampled result from the second capacitor C<b>2</b>A and the positive sampled result from the adjacent first capacitor C<b>1</b>B will simultaneously charge the third capacitor C<b>0</b>. Similarly, the negative sampled result from the second capacitor C<b>2</b>B and the positive sampled result from another adjacent first capacitor will simultaneously charge the third capacitor C<b>1</b>. In other words, the two second S/H circuits each simultaneously receives a negative first sampled signal outputted from its corresponding first S/H circuit and a positive first sampled signal outputted from its adjacent first S/H circuit. Through this process of obtaining the differences, the sensing noise in the positive and negative first sampled signals will cancel out each other; that is, the two second S/H circuits will receive sampled sensing values with low noise.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In this embodiment, the timing signal p1 and the timing signal p2 are signals with the same frequency but 180 degrees out of phase. If the timing signal p1 is regarded as the operating timing signal, then the present embodiment can operate in both the positive and negative pulses of the timing signal p1. Furthermore, in this embodiment, after 10 &#x3bc;l cycles (20 half cycles), the timing signals k0w0 and k0w1 for controlling the second charge switches (e.g. eleventh switches <b>335</b>A and <b>335</b>B and twelfth switches <b>336</b>A and <b>336</b>B) sequentially change from positive to a low voltage potential, and timing signals k0c0 and k0c1 for controlling second discharge switches (e.g. thirteenth switches <b>335</b>A and <b>335</b>B and fourteenth switches <b>336</b>A and <b>336</b>B) sequentially change from a low voltage potential to positive, the third capacitors C<b>0</b> and C<b>1</b> sequentially discharge to the AD converter <b>250</b> via the fourteenth switches <b>336</b>A and <b>336</b>B using Vdd/2 as the reference potential, that is, the two second S/H circuit finishes sampling and sequentially output S/D results to the AD converter <b>250</b> for conversion.</p>

Basically, the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> simplifies some functions and elements of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. The difference between the two is in that each first S/H circuit of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> uses only one capacitor and the relevant charge/discharge switches. That is, each first S/H circuit contains one operational amplifier (e.g. first operational amplifier <b>310</b>A and <b>310</b>B), a capacitor (e.g. a first capacitor C<b>1</b>A or C<b>1</b>B) and a plurality of switches (e.g. <b>311</b>A, <b>312</b>A, <b>315</b>A, <b>316</b>A, <b>319</b>A and <b>321</b>A or <b>311</b>B, <b>312</b>B, <b>315</b>B, <b>316</b>B, <b>319</b>B and <b>321</b>B), wherein the capacitor and the operational amplifier form a first integration circuit, and the plurality of switches correspond to the charge/discharge paths connected with the capacitor, thereby controlling the charge/discharge times of the capacitor. Also, each second S/H circuit does not contain the selecting switches (e.g. <b>331</b>A, <b>332</b>A, <b>333</b>A and <b>334</b>A or <b>331</b>B, <b>332</b>B, <b>333</b>B and <b>334</b>B) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, but instead is directly coupled to the output of the corresponding first S/H circuit.

The two embodiments are different in that the first S/H circuits of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref> does not output first sampled signals with always the same polarity, but rather provides for first sampled signals with opposite polarities. Take the paths 0 and 1 as an example, the first S/H circuit includes an operational amplifier (e.g. a first operational amplifier <b>310</b>A or <b>310</b>B), a capacitor (e.g. a first capacitor CIA or a second capacitor C<b>2</b>B) and a plurality of switches (e.g. <b>311</b>A, <b>312</b>A, <b>315</b>A, <b>316</b>A, <b>319</b>A, and <b>313</b>B, <b>314</b>B, <b>317</b>B, <b>318</b>B, <b>319</b>B and <b>321</b>B), wherein the capacitor and the operational amplifier form a first integration circuit and the plurality of switches corresponding to charge/discharge paths connected with the capacitor, thereby controlling the charge/discharge times of the capacitor.

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3E and 3D</figref>, when a timing signal k1 for controlling a plurality of first charge switches (e.g. a first switch <b>311</b>A, a second switch <b>312</b>A, a third switch <b>313</b>A and a fourth switch <b>314</b>A) is a positive pulse, sensing signals on the path 0 and path 1 charge the first capacitor C<b>1</b>A and the second capacitor C<b>2</b>B, respectively. That is, the two first S/H circuits perform sampling on the sensing signals of the two corresponding sensors via the paths 0 and 1, respectively. When a timing signal k2 for controlling a plurality of first discharge switches (e.g. a fifth switch <b>315</b>A, a sixth switch <b>316</b>A, a seventh switch <b>317</b>B and an eighth switch <b>318</b>B) is a positive pulse, the first capacitor C<b>1</b>A and the second capacitor C<b>2</b>B discharge to the second S/H circuits, that is, the two first S/H circuits output sampled and held results.

Similarly, the negative sampled result from the second capacitor C<b>2</b>B and a positive sampled result from a first capacitor on another adjacent path will simultaneously charge the third capacitor C<b>10</b>. In other words, the two second S/H circuits each receives a positive (a negative) first sampled signal outputted from its corresponding first S/H circuit and also a negative (a positive) first sampled signal outputted from the first S/H circuit on the adjacent path. Since adjacent or nearby sensors in the touch panels often have similar sensing noise, so through the above process of obtaining the differences, the sensing noise in the positive and negative first sampled signals will cancel out each other, that is, the two second S/H circuits will receive sampled sensing values with low noise. Based on the above, this embodiment not only eliminates the sensing noise by the method of differences, but also reduces saturation resulting from the instantaneous noise being too large.

It should be noted that in this embodiment the first sampled signals are provided with opposite polarities, although this can eliminate noise by obtaining the differences, but the result output by the second S/H circuits will also exhibit opposite polarities.

The two embodiments are different in that the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> further adds another capacitor array and the relevant control signals. That is, an operational amplifier <b>510</b> and two capacitor array <b>520</b>A and <b>520</b>B form a third integration circuit at different times, and a voltage VCM is used as the reference voltage. The different times are controlled by controlling signals and control switches, so that the operational amplifier <b>510</b> forms the third integration circuit with only one of the capacitor arrays <b>520</b>A and <b>520</b>B at any one time.

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Finally, it should be noted that the present invention provides circuits for holding positive and negative sampled signals are provided using a combination of two capacitors and an operational amplifier, and the above circuits are combined to sample and hold a plurality of differences of a plurality of paths (a plurality of sensors or conductive strips in a touch panel) (e.g. sampled values of path 2 minus sampled values of path 1, sampled values of path 3 minus sampled values of path 2, . . . , sampled values of path m minus sampled values of path m&#x2212;1; or, sampled values of path 1 minus sampled values of path 2, sampled values of path 2 minus sampled values of path 3, . . . , sampled values of path m&#x2212;1 minus sampled values of path m). This architecture is used for mutual capacitive detection, that is, sensors in one of the horizontal and vertical directions are driven (sequentially driven), and at the same time, signals from all the sensors in the other of the horizontal and vertical directions are received (all at the same time or in several stages). When each sensor is driven, sensors in the other direction are then sampled. The S/H circuits proposed by the present invention are used for latching all the signals, so that common mode noise with fixed frequencies coming from the display can then be removed by obtaining the differences of the signals.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In addition, the timing for performing S/H by the first S/H circuits can fall on the times when the display emits no or very low noise. The selection of the clock frequency can be made by testing with several predetermined frequencies, or combinations of different frequencies and timings, so that an appropriate combination of the frequency and the timing can be determined. The determination of whether frequency should be selected or changed can be made once at the beginning or regularly during the operation.</p>
