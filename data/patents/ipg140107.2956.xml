<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Many different species of fungi live harmlessly on the skin and inside the body of all animals including humans. However under certain circumstances, often as a result of a weakened or suppressed immune system, individuals will succumb to opportunistic fungal infections. The infections may be superficial or systemic. Superficial infections such as athletes' foot, ringworm and thrush are generally caused by pathogenic fungi. They are slow to develop, often remaining asymptomatic for many years, and are generally well tolerated or treated. Systemic infections are caused by primary and opportunistic fungi. They develop rapidly in susceptible hosts and hence require rapid treatment, often before diagnosis and tend to be associated with a poor prognosis. These usually occur in hospitalized patients.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The incidence of life-threatening fungal infections has increased dramatically as the population of immunocompromised individuals (including cancer, organ transplant and AIDS patients) has increased. As a result it is the cause of an increasing financial and logistic burden on the medical care system and its providers.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To date a number of different targets and metabolic pathways have been exploited clinically to kill fungi or inhibit their growth. The most recent approach to emerge targets the organisms' need to synthesise glucan. Glucan, in particular &#x3b2;-1,3-D-glucan, is essential to the integrity of the cell wall of a wide range of fungi, in particular the <i>Candida </i>and <i>Aspergillus </i>species. The main enzyme activity responsible for glucan synthesis within fungi is 1,3-&#x3b2;-D-glucan synthase. Inhibitors of this activity prevent the synthesis of glucan and thereby compromise the integrity of the cell wall, leading to destruction of the cell.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A class of compounds called echinocandins are known to act as glucan synthase inhibitors and include caspofungin acetate, micafungin and anidulafungin. The chemical structure of caspofungin acetate is shown below. The other echinocandin compounds have very similar structures.</p>

</chemistry>
</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Although the echinocandins have met some success in their antifungal action, it would be desirable to provide compounds that provide comparable glucan synthase inhibition and which have improved pharmacokinetic properties and which are relatively small organic molecules which are easier to manufacture.</p>

A (2000) and B (2001), Plenum Press, New York. Unless otherwise indicated, conventional methods of mass spectroscopy, NMR, HPLC, IR and UVN is spectroscopy and pharmacology, within the skill of the art are employed. Unless specific definitions are provided, the nomenclature employed in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those known in the art. Standard techniques can be used for chemical syntheses, chemical analyses, pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery, and treatment of patients. Reactions and purification techniques can be performed e.g., using kits of manufacturer's specifications or as commonly accomplished in the art or as described herein. The foregoing techniques and procedures can be generally performed of conventional methods well known in the art and as described in various general and more specific references that are cited and discussed throughout the present specification. Throughout the specification, groups and substituents thereof can be chosen by one skilled in the field to provide stable moieties and compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0082">Where substituent groups are specified by their conventional chemical formulas, written from left to right, they equally encompass the chemically identical substituents that would result from writing the structure from right to left. As a non-limiting example, &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>O&#x2014; is equivalent to &#x2014;OCH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;.</p>

For example, &#x201c;alkyl,&#x201d; as used herein, includes optionally substituted alkyl.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0084">The terms &#x201c;moiety&#x201d;, &#x201c;chemical moiety&#x201d;, &#x201c;group&#x201d; and &#x201c;chemical group&#x201d;, as used herein refer to a specific segment or functional group of a molecule. Chemical moieties are often recognized chemical entities embedded in or appended to a molecule.</p>

For example, &#x201c;optionally substituted alkyl&#x201d; means either &#x201c;alkyl&#x201d; or &#x201c;substituted alkyl&#x201d; as defined below. Further, an optionally substituted group may be un-substituted (e.g., &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>), fully substituted (e.g., &#x2014;CF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>3</sub>), mono-substituted (e.g., &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>F) or substituted at a level anywhere in-between fully substituted and mono-substituted (e.g., &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>CHF<sub>2</sub>, &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>3</sub>, &#x2014;CF<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>, &#x2014;CFHCHF<sub>2</sub>, etc).

Use of Protecting Groups
</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0248">During the synthesis of the compounds of Formula I, labile functional groups in the intermediate compounds may be protected. For example, it may be necessary to protect reactive functional groups, for example hydroxy, amino, imino, thio or carboxy groups, where these are desired in the final product, to avoid their unwanted participation in the reactions. The protecting groups may be removed at any stage in the synthesis of the compounds of Formula I or may be present on the final compound of Formula I. A comprehensive discussion of the ways in which various labile functional groups may be protected and methods for cleaving the resulting protected derivatives is given in for example <i>Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry</i>, T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts (Wiley-Interscience, New York, 2<sup>nd </sup>edition, 1991).</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0249">Protecting groups are used to block some or all reactive moieties and prevent such groups from participating in chemical reactions until the protective group is removed. Protected derivatives are useful in the preparation of the compounds described herein or in themselves may be active as inhibitors. It is preferred that each protective group be removable by a different means. Protective groups that are cleaved under totally disparate reaction conditions fulfill the requirement of differential removal. Protective groups can be removed by acid, base, and hydrogenolysis. Groups such as trityl, dimethoxytrityl, acetal and t-butyldimethylsilyl are acid labile and may be used to protect carboxy and hydroxy reactive moieties in the presence of amino groups protected with Cbz groups, which are removable by hydrogenolysis, and Fmoc groups, which are base labile. Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties may be blocked with base labile groups such as, but not limited to, methyl, ethyl, and acetyl in the presence of amines blocked with acid labile groups such as t-butyl carbamate or with carbamates that are both acid and base stable but hydrolytically removable.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0250">Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties may also be blocked with hydrolytically removable protective groups such as the benzyl group, while amine groups capable of hydrogen bonding with acids may be blocked with base labile groups such as Fmoc. Carboxylic acid reactive moieties may be protected by conversion to simple ester compounds as exemplified herein, or they may be blocked with oxidatively-removable protective groups such as 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl, while co-existing amino groups may be blocked with fluoride labile silyl carbamates.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0251">Allyl blocking groups are useful in then presence of acid- and base-protecting groups since the former are stable and can be subsequently removed by metal or pi-acid catalysts. For example, an allyl-blocked carboxylic acid can be deprotected with a Pd-catalyzed reaction in the presence of acid labile t-butyl carbamate or base-labile acetate amine protecting groups. Yet another form of protecting group is a resin to which a compound or intermediate may be attached. As long as the residue is attached to the resin, that functional group is blocked and cannot react. Once released from the resin, the functional group is available to react.</p>

<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Further Forms of the Compounds</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Isomers</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0255">The compounds of Formula I (including without limitation any of the compounds specifically or generically described herein, including the compounds presented in the tables) may exist in the form of optical isomers, e.g. diastereoisomers and mixtures of isomers in all ratios, e.g. racemic mixtures. This includes in particular the isomeric forms (R or S). The different isomeric forms may be separated or resolved one from the other by conventional methods, or any given isomer may be obtained by conventional synthetic methods or by stereospecific or asymmetric synthesis. Where a compound contains an alkene moiety, the alkene can be presented as a cis or trans isomer or a mixture thereof. When an isomeric form of a compound described herein is provided substantially free of other isomers, it will preferably contain less than 5% w/w, more preferably less than 2% w/w and especially less than 1% w/w of the other isomers.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0256">The compounds of Formula I (including without limitation any of the compounds specifically or generically described herein, including the compounds presented in the tables) may exist as geometric isomers. The compounds described herein may possess one or more double bonds. The compounds presented herein include all cis, trans, syn, anti, entgegen (E), and zusammen (Z) isomers as well as the corresponding mixtures thereof. In some situations, compounds may exist as tautomers. The compounds described herein include all possible tautomers within the formulas described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0257">The compounds of Formula I (including without limitation any of the compounds specifically or generically described herein, including the compounds presented in the tables) may possess one or more chiral centers and each center may exist in the R or S configuration. The compounds described herein include all diastereomeric, enantiomeric, and epimeric forms as well as the corresponding mixtures thereof. In additional embodiments of the compounds and methods provided herein, mixtures of enantiomers and/or diastereoisomers, resulting from a single preparative step, combination, or interconversion may also be useful for the applications described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0258">In some embodiments, the compounds of Formula I (including without limitation any of the compounds specifically or generically described herein, including the compounds presented in the tables) can be prepared as their individual stereoisomers by reacting a racemic mixture of the compound with an optically active resolving agent to form a pair of diastereoisomeric compounds, separating the diastereomers and recovering the optically pure enantiomers. While resolution of enantiomers can be carried out using covalent diastereomeric derivatives of the compounds described herein, dissociable complexes are preferred (e.g., crystalline diastereomeric salts). Diastereomers have distinct physical properties (e.g., melting points, boiling points, solubilities, reactivity, etc.) and can be readily separated by taking advantage of these dissimilarities. The diastereomers can be separated by chiral chromatography, or preferably, by separation/resolution techniques based upon differences in solubility. The optically pure enantiomer is then recovered, along with the resolving agent, by any practical means that would not result in racemization. A more detailed description of the techniques applicable to the resolution of stereoisomers of compounds from their racemic mixture can be found in Jean Jacques, Andre Collet, Samuel H. Wilen, &#x201c;Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions,&#x201d; John Wiley And Sons, Inc., 1981, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Labeled Compounds</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0259">It should be understood that the compounds of Formula I (including without limitation any of the compounds specifically or generically described herein, including the compounds presented in the tables) include their isotopically-labeled equivalents, including their use for treating disorders. For example, provided herein are methods of treating diseases, by administering isotopically-labeled compounds of Formula I. The isotopically-labeled compounds described herein can be administered as pharmaceutical compositions. Thus, the compounds described herein also include their isotopically-labeled isomers, which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds described herein include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, sulfur, fluorine and chloride, such as <sup>2</sup>H, <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>11</sup>C, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>14</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>18</sup>O, <sup>17</sup>O, <sup>31</sup>P, <sup>32</sup>P, <sup>35</sup>S, <sup>18</sup>F, and <sup>36</sup>Cl, respectively. Compounds described herein, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, prodrugs, solvate, hydrates or derivatives thereof which contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms are included herein. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as <sup>3</sup>H and <sup>14</sup>C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated, i.e., <sup>3</sup>H and carbon-14, i.e., <sup>14</sup>C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., <sup>2</sup>H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labeled compounds, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, prodrugs, solvates, hydrates or derivatives thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out procedures described herein, by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.</p>

<p id="h-0015" num="0000">Pharmaceutically Acceptable Salts</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0261">The compounds of Formula I (including without limitation any of the compounds specifically or generically described herein, including the compounds presented in the tables) may also exist as their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, which may also be useful for treating disorders. For example, described are methods of treating diseases, by administering pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds described herein. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be administered as pharmaceutical compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0262">Thus, the compounds of Formula I (including without limitation any of the compounds specifically or generically described herein, including the compounds presented in the tables) can be prepared as pharmaceutically acceptable salts formed when an acidic proton present in the parent compound either is replaced by a metal ion, for example an alkali metal ion, an alkaline earth ion, or an aluminum ion; or coordinates with an organic base.

Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of these compounds include those derived from organic acids such as acetic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, lactic acid, oxalic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, phenylacetic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulphonic acid, benzenesulphonic acid and p-toluenesulphonic acid, mineral acids such as hydrochloric and sulphuric acid and the like, giving methanesulphonate, benzenesulphonate, p-toluenesulphonate, hydrochloride and sulphate, and the like, respectively or those derived from bases such as organic and inorganic bases. Examples of suitable inorganic bases for the formation of salts of compounds described herein include the hydroxides, carbonates, and bicarbonates of ammonia, lithium, sodium, calcium, potassium, aluminium, iron, magnesium, zinc and the like. Salts can also be formed with suitable organic bases. Such bases suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts with compounds described herein include organic bases, which are nontoxic and strong enough to form salts. Such organic bases are already well known in the art and may include amino acids such as arginine and lysine, mono-, di-, or trihydroxyalkylamines such as mono-, di-, and triethanolamine, choline, mono-, di-, and trialkylamines, such as methylamine, dimethylamine, and trimethylamine, guanidine; N-methylglucosamine; N-methylpiperazine; morpholine; ethylenediamine; N-benzylphenethylamine; tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane; and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0265">Salts may be prepared in a conventional manner using methods well known in the art. Acid addition salts of said basic compounds may be prepared by dissolving the free base compounds according to the first aspect described herein in aqueous or aqueous alcohol solution or other suitable solvents containing the required acid. Where a compound described herein contains an acidic function, a base salt of said compound may be prepared by reacting said compound with a suitable base. The acid or base salt may separate directly or can be obtained by concentrating the solution e.g. by evaporation.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Solvates</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0266">The compounds of Formula I (including without limitation any of the compounds specifically or generically described herein, including the compounds presented in the tables) may also exist in various solvated forms, which may also be useful for treating disorders. For example, described are methods of treating diseases, by administering solvates of the compounds described herein. The solvates can be administered as pharmaceutical compositions. Preferably the solvates are pharmaceutically acceptable solvates.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0267">Solvates contain either stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts of a solvent, and may be formed during the process of crystallization with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. Hydrates are formed when the solvent is water, or alcoholates are formed when the solvent is alcohol. Solvates of the compounds described herein can be conveniently prepared or formed during the processes described herein. By way of example only, hydrates of the compounds described herein can be conveniently prepared by recrystallization from an aqueous/organic solvent mixture, using organic solvents including, but not limited to, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran or methanol. In addition, the compounds provided herein can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms. In general, the solvated forms are considered equivalent to the unsolvated forms for the purposes of the compounds and methods provided herein.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Polymorphs</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0268">The compounds of Formula I (including without limitation any of the compounds specifically or generically described herein, including the compounds presented in the tables) may also exist in various polymorphic states, all of which are herein contemplated, and which may also be useful for treating disorders. For example, described are methods of treating diseases, by administering polymorphs of the compounds described herein. The various polymorphs can be administered as pharmaceutical compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0269">Thus, the compounds of Formula I (including without limitation any of the compounds specifically or generically described herein, including the compounds presented in the tables) include all their crystalline forms, known as polymorphs. Polymorphs include the different crystal packing arrangements of the same elemental composition of a compound. Polymorphs may have different X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectra, melting points, density, hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability, solvates and solubility. Various factors such as the recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization, and storage temperature may cause a single crystal form to dominate.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">Prodrugs</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0270">The compounds of Formula I (including without limitation any of the compounds specifically or generically described herein, including the compounds presented in the tables) may also exist in prodrug form, which may also be useful for treating disorders. For example, described are methods of treating diseases, by administering prodrugs of the compounds described herein. The prodrugs can be administered as pharmaceutical compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0271">Prodrugs are generally drug precursors that, following administration to a subject and subsequent absorption, are converted to an active, or a more active species via some process, such as conversion by a metabolic pathway. Some prodrugs have a chemical group present on the prodrug that renders it less active and/or confers solubility or some other property to the drug. Once the chemical group has been cleaved and/or modified from the prodrug the active drug is generated. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent drug. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be a compound as described herein which is administered as an ester (the &#x201c;prodrug&#x201d;) to facilitate transmittal across a cell membrane where water solubility is detrimental to mobility but which then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity, once inside the cell where water-solubility is beneficial. A further example of a prodrug might be a short peptide (polyamino acid) bonded to an acid group where the peptide is metabolized to reveal the active moiety.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0272">Prodrugs may be designed as reversible drug derivatives, for use as modifiers to enhance drug transport to site-specific tissues. The design of prodrugs to date has been to increase the effective water solubility of the therapeutic compound for targeting to regions where water is the principal solvent.

<p id="p-0192" num="0273">Pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs of the compounds of Formula I (including without limitation any of the compounds specifically or generically described herein, including the compounds presented in the tables) include, but are not limited to, esters, carbonates, thiocarbonates, N-acyl derivatives, N-acyloxyalkyl derivatives, quaternary derivatives of tertiary amines, N-Mannich bases, Schiff bases, amino acid conjugates, phosphate esters, metal salts and sulfonate esters. Various forms of prodrugs are well known in the art. See for example <i>Design of Prodrugs</i>, Bundgaard, A. Ed., Elseview, 1985 and <i>Method in Enzymology</i>, Widder, K. et al., Ed.; Academic, 1985, vol. 42, p. 309-396; Bundgaard, H. &#x201c;Design and Application of Prodrugs&#x201d; in <i>A Textbook of Drug Design and Development</i>, Krosgaard-Larsen and H.

<p id="p-0224" num="0305">Pharmaceutical preparations may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in powder form or in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, saline or sterile pyrogen-free water, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0306">Formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous (oily) sterile injection solutions of the active compounds which may contain antioxidants, buffers, biocide, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. Examples of suitable isotonic vehicles for use in such formulations include Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Solution, or Lactated Ringer's Injection. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes or other microparticulate systems may be used to target the compound to blood components or one or more organs. The concentration of the active ingredient in the solution may vary widely. Typically, the concentration of the active ingredient in the solution is from about 1 ng/ml to about 10 &#x3bc;g/ml, for example from about 10 ng/ml to about 1 &#x3bc;g/ml. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0307">Pharmaceutical preparations may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0308">For buccal or sublingual administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets, lozenges, pastilles, or gels formulated in conventional manner. Such compositions may comprise the active ingredient in a flavored basis such as sucrose and acacia or tragacanth.</p>

<p id="p-0233" num="0314">Pharmaceutical preparations for administration by inhalation are conveniently delivered from an insufflator, nebulizer pressurized packs or other convenient means of delivering an aerosol spray. Pressurized packs may comprise a suitable propellant such as dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Alternatively, for administration by inhalation or insufflation, pharmaceutical preparations may take the form of a dry powder composition, for example a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. The powder composition may be presented in unit dosage form, in for example, capsules, cartridges, gelatin or blister packs from which the powder may be administered with the aid of an inhalator or insufflator.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0315">It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the compounds and compositions described herein may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration may include flavoring agents.</p>
<p id="h-0022" num="0000">Formulations</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0316">The compounds or compositions described herein can be delivered in a vesicle, e.g., a liposome (see, for example, Langer, <i>Science </i>1990, 249, 1527-1533; Treat et al., <i>Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer</i>, Lopez-Bernstein and Fidler, Ed., Liss, N.Y., pp. 353-365, 1989). The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions described herein can also be delivered in a controlled release system. In one embodiment, a pump may be used (see, Sefton, 1987, CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201; Buchwald et al. <i>Surgery, </i>1980 88, 507; Saudek et al. <i>N. Engl. J. Med. </i>1989, 321, (574). Additionally, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the therapeutic target. (See, Goodson, <i>Medical Applications of Controlled Release, </i>1984, Vol. 2, pp. 115-138). The pharmaceutical compositions described herein can also contain the active ingredient in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions, and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be, for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, such as microcrystalline cellulose, sodium crosscarmellose, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be un-coated or coated by known techniques to mask the taste of the drug or delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a water soluble taste masking material such as hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose or hydroxypropylcellulose, or a time delay material such as ethyl cellulose, or cellulose acetate butyrate may be employed as appropriate. Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water soluble carrier such as polyethyleneglycol or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0317">Aqueous suspensions contain the active material in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethylene-oxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose, saccharin or aspartame.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0318">Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as butylated hydroxyanisol or alpha-tocopherol.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0319">Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0320">Pharmaceutical compositions may also be in the form of an oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening agents, flavoring agents, preservatives and antioxidants.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0321">Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative, flavoring and coloring agents and antioxidant.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0322">Pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous solution. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable oil-in-water microemulsion where the active ingredient is dissolved in the oily phase. For example, the active ingredient may be first dissolved in a mixture of soybean oil and lecithin. The oil solution then introduced into a water and glycerol mixture and processed to form a microemulsion. The injectable solutions or microemulsions may be introduced into a patient's blood-stream by local bolus injection. Alternatively, it may be advantageous to administer the solution or microemulsion in such a way as to maintain a constant circulating concentration of the instant compound. In order to maintain such a constant concentration, a continuous intravenous delivery device may be utilized. An example of such a device is the Deltec CADD-PLUS&#x2122; model 5400 intravenous pump. The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension for intramuscular and subcutaneous administration. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butane diol. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0323">Pharmaceutical compositions may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the inhibitors with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials include cocoa butter, glycerinated gelatin, hydrogenated vegetable oils, mixtures of polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights and fatty acid esters of polyethylene glycol.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0324">For topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing a compound or composition described herein can be used. As used herein, topical application can include mouth washes and gargles.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0325">Pharmaceutical compositions may be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles and delivery devices, or via transdermal routes, using those forms of transdermal skin patches well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.</p>

Amounts effective for this use will depend on the severity and course of the disease or condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status, weight, and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician. It is considered well within the skill of the art for one to determine such therapeutically effective amounts by routine experimentation (including, but not limited to, a dose escalation clinical trial).</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0327">In prophylactic applications, compositions containing the compounds described herein are administered to a patient susceptible to or otherwise at risk of a particular disease, disorder or condition. Such an amount is defined to be a &#x201c;prophylactically effective amount or dose.&#x201d; In this use, the precise amounts also depend on the patient's state of health, weight, and the like. It is considered well within the skill of the art for one to determine such prophylactically effective amounts by routine experimentation (e.g., a dose escalation clinical trial). When used in a patient, effective amounts for this use will depend on the severity and course of the disease, disorder or condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0328">In the case wherein the patient's condition does not improve, upon the doctor's discretion the administration of the compounds may be administered chronically, that is, for an extended period of time, including throughout the duration of the patient's life in order to ameliorate or otherwise control or limit the symptoms of the patient's disease or condition.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0329">In the case wherein the patient's status does improve, upon the doctor's discretion the administration of the compounds may be given continuously; alternatively, the dose of drug being administered may be temporarily reduced or temporarily suspended for a certain length of time (i.e., a &#x201c;drug holiday&#x201d;). The length of the drug holiday can vary between 2 days and 1 year, including by way of example only, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7 days, 10 days, 12 days, 15 days, 20 days, 28 days, 35 days, 50 days, 70 days, 100 days, 120 days, 150 days, 180 days, 200 days, 250 days, 280 days, 300 days, 320 days, 350 days, and 365 days. The dose reduction during a drug holiday may be from 10%-100%, including by way of example only 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, and 100%.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0330">Once improvement of the patient's conditions has occurred, a maintenance dose is administered if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or the frequency of administration, or both, can be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved disease, disorder or condition is retained. Patients can, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of symptoms.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0331">The amount of a given agent that will correspond to such an amount will vary depending upon factors such as the particular compound, disease condition and its severity, the identity (e.g., weight) of the subject or host in need of treatment, but can nevertheless be routinely determined in a manner known in the art according to the particular circumstances surrounding the case, including, e.g., the specific agent being administered, the route of administration, the condition being treated, and the subject or host being treated. In general, however, doses employed for adult human treatment will typically be in the range of 0.02-5000 mg per day, preferably 1-1500 mg per day. The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered simultaneously (or over a short period of time) or at appropriate intervals, for example as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0332">The pharmaceutical composition described herein may be in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages. In unit dosage form, the formulation is divided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of one or more compound. The unit dosage may be in the form of a package containing discrete quantities of the formulation. Non-limiting examples are packaged tablets or capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Aqueous suspension compositions can be packaged in single-dose non-reclosable containers. Alternatively, multiple-dose reclosable containers can be used, in which case it is typical to include a preservative in the composition. By way of example only, formulations for parenteral injection may be presented in unit dosage form, which include, but are not limited to ampoules, or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0333">The daily dosages appropriate for the compounds of Formula (G), Formula (G-I), and Formula (G-II), described herein are from about 0.01 to 2.5 mg/kg per body weight. An indicated daily dosage in the larger mammal, including, but not limited to, humans, is in the range from about 0.5 mg to about 100 mg, conveniently administered in divided doses, including, but not limited to, up to four times a day or in extended release form. Suitable unit dosage forms for oral administration comprise from about 1 to 50 mg active ingredient. The foregoing ranges are merely suggestive, as the number of variables in regard to an individual treatment regime is large, and considerable excursions from these recommended values are not uncommon. Such dosages may be altered depending on a number of variables, not limited to the activity of the compound used, the disease or condition to be treated, the mode of administration, the requirements of the individual subject, the severity of the disease or condition being treated, and the judgment of the practitioner.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0334">Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such therapeutic regimens can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, including, but not limited to, the determination of the LD<sub>50 </sub>(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED<sub>50 </sub>(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between the toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio between LD<sub>50 </sub>and ED<sub>50</sub>. Compounds exhibiting high therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED<sub>50 </sub>with minimal toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized.</p>
<p id="h-0024" num="0000">Dosage Forms</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0335">The pharmaceutical composition may, for example, be in a form suitable for oral administration as a tablet, capsule, cachet, pill, lozenge, powder or granule, sustained release formulations, solution, liquid, suspension, for parenteral injection as a sterile solution, suspension or emulsion, for topical administration as an ointment, cream, lotions, sprays, foams, gel or paste, or for rectal or vaginal administration as a suppository or pessary. The pharmaceutical composition may be in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages. The pharmaceutical composition will include a conventional pharmaceutical carrier or excipient and a compound according to the invention as an active ingredient. In addition, it may include other medicinal or pharmaceutical agents, carriers, adjuvants, etc. Methods of preparing various pharmaceutical compositions with a specific amount of active compound are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art. For examples, see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Ester, Pa., 18th Edition (1990).</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0336">Pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or diluent may include any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutical active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active ingredient, use thereof in the therapeutic compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0337">Dosage unit form refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the mammalian subjects to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. The specification for the novel dosage unit forms described herein are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the active material and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such as active material for the treatment of disease in living subjects having a diseased condition in which bodily health is impaired.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0338">The principal active ingredients are compounded for convenient and effective administration in effective amounts with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in dosage unit form. In the case of compositions containing supplementary active ingredients, the dosages are determined by reference to the usual dose and manner of administration of the said ingredients.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0339">Exemplary parenteral administration forms include solutions or suspensions of active compounds in sterile aqueous solutions, for example, aqueous propylene glycol or dextrose-solutions. Such dosage forms can be suitably buffered, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0340">Suitable pharmaceutical carriers include inert diluents or fillers, water and various organic solvents. The pharmaceutical compositions may, if desired, contain additional ingredients such as flavorings, binders, excipients and the like. Thus for oral administration, tablets containing various excipients, such as citric acid may be employed together with various disintegrants such as starch or other cellulosic material, alginic acid and certain complex silicates and with binding agents such as sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often useful for tableting purposes. Other reagents such as an inhibitor, surfactant or solubilizer, plasticizer, stabilizer, viscosity increasing agent, or film forming agent may also be added. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed in soft and hard filled gelatin capsules. Preferred materials, therefore, include lactose or milk sugar and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions or elixirs are desired for oral administration the active compound therein may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matters or dyes and, if desired, emulsifying agents or suspending agents, together with diluents such as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin, or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0341">Advantageously, agents such as local anaesthetic, preservative and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle. To enhance the stability, the composition can be frozen after filling into the vial and the water removed under vacuum. The dry lyophilized powder is then sealed in the vial and an accompanying vial of water for injection may be supplied to reconstitute the liquid prior to use. Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner except that the active ingredient is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved and sterilisation cannot be accomplished by filtration. The active ingredient can be sterilised by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspending in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the active ingredient.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0342">In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention are preferably adapted for oral administration.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0343">It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the compositions may also include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration may include flavoring agents. They may also contain therapeutically active agents in addition to the compounds of the present invention. Such carriers may be present as from about 1% up to about 98% of the formulation. More usually they will form up to about 80% of the formulation.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0344">The compositions may contain from 0.1% by weight, preferably from 10-60% by weight, of the active material, depending on the method of administration.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0345">Pharmaceutical compositions may be presented in unit dose forms containing a predetermined amount of active ingredient per dose. Such a unit may contain for example 0.1 mg/kg to 750 mg/kg, more preferably 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg depending on the condition being treated, the route of administration and the age, weight and condition of the patient. Preferred unit dosage compositions are those containing a daily dose or sub-dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of an active ingredient.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0346">It will be recognized by one of skill in the art that the optimal quantity and spacing of individual dosages of compounds in the first and second aspects described herein will be determined by the nature and extent of the condition being treated the form, route and site of administration, and the particular subject being treated, and that such optimums can be determined by conventional techniques. It will also be appreciated by one of skill in the art that the optimal course of treatment, i.e., the number of doses of the aforementioned compounds given per day for a defined number of days, can be ascertained by those skilled in the art using conventional course of treatment determination tests.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0347">Depending on the route of administration, the chemical compound or composition may be required to be coated in a material to protect it from the action of enzymes, acids and other natural conditions which may inactivate it.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0348">In order to administer the chemical compound or composition by other than parenteral administration, it may be coated by, or administered with, a material to prevent its inactivation. For example, it may be administered in an adjuvant, co-administered with enzyme inhibitors or in liposomes. Adjuvant is used in its broadest sense and includes any immune stimulating compound such as interferon. Adjuvants contemplated herein include resorcinols, non-ionic surfactants such as polyoxyethylene oleyl ether and n-hexadecyl polyethylene ether.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0349">Liposomes include water-in-oil-in-water CGF emulsions as well as conventional liposomes.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0350">The active chemical compound or composition may also be administered parenterally or intraperitoneally. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0351">The pharmaceutical compositions or formulations suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. In all cases the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyetheylene glycol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of superfactants.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0352">Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminium monostearate and gelatin.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0353">Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active chemical compound or composition in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilisation. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the sterilised active ingredient into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and the freeze-drying technique which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0354">When the chemical compound or composition is suitably protected as described above, it may be orally administered, for example, with an inert diluent or with an assimilable edible carrier, or it may be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsules, or it may be compressed into tablets, or it may be incorporated directly with the food of the diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the active compound may be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that a suitable dosage will be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0355">The tablets, troches, pills, capsules and the like may also contain the following: a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin may be added or a flavouring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring. When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0356">Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Of course, any material used in preparing any dosage unit form should be pharmaceutically pure and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the active compound may be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and formulations.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0357">The methods described herein include inhibiting 1,3-&#x3b2;-D-glucan synthesis in a fungus by contacting the fungus with a composition containing an amount of a selective 1,3-&#x3b2;-D-glucan synthase (BGS) inhibitor compound effective for inhibiting synthesis of 1,3-&#x3b2;-D-glucan. A fungus may be contacted with the composition ex vivo or in vivo, e.g., to treat a subject suffering from a pathological fungal infection (e.g., an invasive fungal infection). As used herein, &#x201c;treating&#x201d; or &#x201c;treat&#x201d; is intended to include preventing, ameliorating, curing, reducing fungal growth or reducing associated symptoms, or preventing any increase in fungal'growth or associated symptoms.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0358">A subject in need of treatment with any of the compositions or methods described herein include, but are not limited to, a subject having a fungal infection, or a subject at risk of developing a fungal infection. The subject may have been diagnosed as having such a fungal infection as described herein or using standard medical techniques known to those of skill in the art. For example, the plasma levels of (1&#x2192;3)-&#x3b2;-D-glucan in serum can be assayed, where a serum level of (1&#x2192;3)-&#x3b2;-D-glucan above about 40, 50, 60, or 80 pg/ml indicates a likely infection by <i>Candida </i>and <i>Aspergillus</i>. Alternatively, highly sensitive &#x201c;pan-fungal&#x201d; nucleic acid-based diagnostic assays can be used. See, e.g., Van Bunk et al. (1998), <i>J. of Clin. Microbiol, </i>36(5): 1169-1175; and Lau et al. (2007), <i>J. of Clin. Microbiol. </i>45(2):380-385. In addition, such assays can be used to monitor the efficacy of treatment for a fungal infection. See, e.g., Kondori et al. (2004), <i>Clinical and Diagnostic Laboratory Immunology, </i>11(2):344-350. Alternatively a subject may exhibit one or more symptoms of fungal infection.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0359">A subject at risk of developing a fungal infection is a subject who has been exposed to a fungus, or is susceptible to exposure to a fungus. For instance a subject that is susceptible to exposure to a fungus includes those subjects who work with fungal material or in areas of high fungal content, subjects who travel to areas with high fungal infectivity rates or are otherwise likely to be exposed to a fungal infection as well as those subjects having particular susceptibility to fungal infection resulting from medical conditions or therapies.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0360">Examples of subjects having particular susceptibility to fungal infections arising from medical conditions or therapies include but are not limited to subjects who are immunocompromised. An immunocompromised subject is a subject that is incapable of inducing a normal effective immune response or a subject that has not yet developed an immune system (e.g. preterm neonate). For example, the subject may be immunocompromised due to AIDS (or AIDS treatment), cancer (or cancer treatment), severe combined immunodeficiency, ongoing treatment with an immunosuppressive agent, e.g., for suppression of organ transplant immune rejection, or for treatment of an autoimmune, heteroimmune, or inflammatory condition.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0361">In some cases, a subject in need of treatment for a fungal infection may be suffering from tuberculosis, diabetes, severe burns, or intravenous drug abuse. In other cases, the subject in need is undergoing prolonged use of an intravenous or urinary catheter or is being subjected to chronic antibiotic exposure or chronic corticosteroid exposure.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0362">Fungi whose growth can be inhibited by the compositions and methods described herein include, but are not limited to, moulds, e.g., <i>Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, A. niger, A. terreus, A. flavus, A. nidulans, A. sydowi, Paecilomyces lilcinus, Fusarium solani</i>, or, <i>F. oxysporum</i>, or <i>Histoplasma capsulatum</i>; and yeast, e.g., <i>Candida aaseri, C. acidothermophilum, C. acutus, C. albicans, C. anatomiae, C. apis, C. apis </i>var. <i>galacta, C. atlantica, C. atmospherica, C. auringiensis, C. bertae, C. berthtae </i>var. <i>chiloensis, C. berthetii, C. blankii, C. boidinii, C. boleticola, C. bombi, C. bombicola, C. buinensis, C. butyri, C. cacaoi, C. cantarellii, C. cariosilignicola, C. castellii, C. castrensis, C. catenulata, C. chilensis, C. chiropterorum, C. coipomensis, C. dendronema, C. deserticola, C. diddensiae, C. diversa, C. entomaea, C. entomophila, C. ergatensis, C. ernobii, C. ethanolica, C. ethanothermophilum, C. famata, C. fluviotilis, C. fragariorum, C. fragicola, C. friedrichii, C. fructus, C. geochares, C. glabrata, C. glaebosa, C. gropengiesseri, C. guilliermondii, C. guilliermondii </i>var. <i>galactosa, C. guilliermondii </i>var. <i>soya, C. haemulonii, C. halophila/C. versatilis, C. holmii, C. humilis, C. hydrocarbofumarica, C. inconspicua, C. insectalens, C. insectamans, C. intermedia, C. javanica, C. kefyr, C. krissii, C. krusei, C. krusoides, C. lambica, C. lusitaniae, C. magnoliae, C. maltosa, C. mamillae, C. maris, C. maritima, C. melibiosica, C. melinii, C. methylica, C. milleri, C. mogii, C. molischiana, C. montana, C. multis</i>-<i>gemmis, C. musae, C. naeodendra, C. nemodendra, C. nitratophila, C. norvegensis, C. norvegica, C. oleophila, C. oregonensis, C. osornensis, C. paludigena, C. parapsilosis, C. pararugosa, C. periphelosum, C. petrohuensis, C. petrophilum, C. philyla, C. pignaliae, C. pintolopesii </i>var. <i>pintolopesii, C. pintolopesii </i>var. <i>slooffiae, C. pinus, C. polymorpha, C. populi, C. pseudointermedia, C. quercitrasa, C. railenensis, C. rhagii, C. rugopelliculosa, C. rugosa, C. sake, C. salmanticensis, C. savonica, C. sequanensis, C. shehatae, C. silvae, C. silvicultrix, C. solani, C. sonorensis, C. sorbophila, C. spandovensis, C. sphaerica, C. stellata, C. succiphila, C. tenuis, C. terebra, C. tropicalis, C. utilis, C. valida, C. vanderwaltii, C. vartiovaarai, C. veronae, C. vini, C. wickerhamii, C. xestobii, C. zeylanoides, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kluyveromyces lactis</i>, or <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe. </i></p>

<p id="h-0025" num="0000">Combination Therapies</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0364">The compounds described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug, solvate, polymorph, tautomer or isomer thereof may be administered as a sole therapy. The compounds described herein their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, prodrug, solvates, polymorphs, tautomers or isomers may also be administered in combination with another therapy or therapies. Combination treatments may occur sequentially or concurrently and the combination therapies may be neoadjuvant therapies or adjuvant therapies.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0365">In some embodiments, the compounds described herein can be administered with an additional therapeutic agent. In these embodiments, the compound described herein can be in a fixed combination with the additional therapeutic agent or a non-fixed combination with the additional therapeutic agent.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0366">By way of example only, if one of the side effects experienced by a patient upon receiving one of the compounds described herein is hypertension, then it may be appropriate to administer an anti-hypertensive agent in combination with the compound. Or, by way of example only, the therapeutic effectiveness of one of the compounds described herein may be enhanced by administration of another therapeutic agent, the overall therapeutic benefit to the patient is enhanced. Or, by way of example only, the benefit experienced by a patient may be increased by administering one of the compounds described herein with another therapeutic agent (which also includes a therapeutic regimen) that also has therapeutic benefit. In any case, regardless of the disease, disorder or condition being treated, the overall benefit experienced by the patient may simply be additive of the two therapeutic agents or the patient may experience a synergistic benefit.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0367">Other therapies include, but are not limited to administration of other therapeutic agents, radiation therapy or both. In the instances where the compounds described herein are administered with other therapeutic agents, the compounds described herein need not be administered in the same pharmaceutical composition as other therapeutic agents, and may, because of different physical and chemical characteristics, be administered by a different route. For example, the compounds/compositions may be administered orally to generate and maintain good blood levels thereof, while the other therapeutic agent may be administered intravenously. The determination of the mode of administration and the advisability of administration, where possible, in the same pharmaceutical composition, is within the knowledge of the skilled clinician with the teachings described herein. The initial administration can be made according to established protocols known in the art, and then, based upon the observed effects, the dosage, modes of administration and times of administration can be modified by the skilled clinician. The particular choice of compound (and where appropriate, other therapeutic agent and/or radiation) will depend upon the diagnosis of the attending physicians and their judgment of the condition of the patient and the appropriate treatment protocol.</p>
<p id="h-0026" num="0000">Antifungal Compounds</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0368">Where a subject is in need of treatment for a fungal infection, any of the selective BGS inhibitor compounds described herein can be used in combination with a supplemental antifungal compound including, but not limited to other echinocandin antifungal compounds (e.g., anidulafungin, caspofungin, or micafungin); polyene antifungal compounds (e.g., natamycin, rimocidin, nystatin, or amphotericin B); imidazole antifungal compounds (e.g., miconazole, ketoconazole, clotrimazole, econazole, bifonazole, butoconazole, fenticonazole, isoconazole, oxiconazole, sertaconazole, sulconazole, or tioconazole); triazole antifungal compounds (e.g., fluconazole, itraconazole, isavuconazole ravuconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, or terconazole); allylamines (e.g., terbinafine, amorolfine, naftifine, or butenafine); and other antifungal compounds such as ciclopirox olamine, 5-fluorocytosine, gentian violet, haloprogin, tolnaftate, or undecylenic acid.</p>

The fatty acids are extracted into solvent, and the glucan is released by treatment with &#x3b2;-glucanase preparations.</p>
<p id="p-0405" num="0486">A 10 ml culture of <i>Candida </i>was grown in YPD media overnight at 30&#xb0; C. The culture was diluted to 10<sup>7 </sup>cells/ml in 1 ml aliquots and continued to grow for a further 2 hours prior to the addition of test compound (Caspofungin&#x2014;20 ng/ml, Cerulenin&#x2014;10 &#x3bc;g/ml). After 30 min 1 &#x3bc;Ci of each of <sup>14</sup>C-glucose, <sup>14</sup>C-acetate and <sup>3</sup>H-N-acetyl-glucosamine were added. After a further 30 min, 500 &#x3bc;l of unlabelled &#x2018;carrier cells&#x2019; from the overnight culture were added and the cells spun down and transferred to ice. Following 3 washes in ice-cold PBS, 250 &#x3bc;l of glass beads were added and the cells broken by 1 min shaking in a bead-beater.</p>
<p id="p-0406" num="0487">For acetate labelling, the homogenate was extracted for 1 hour with an equal volume of choroform:methanol (1:1). The organic layer was washed with water and 50 &#x3bc;l was removed to 2 ml scintillant for counting.</p>
<p id="p-0407" num="0488">For glucose labelling, the cell-wall pellet was washed (spun at 16000 g for 2 min) 3 times in 5% NaCl, and 3 times in 1 mM EDTA.

<p id="p-0409" num="0490">Six-week-old, specific pathogen-free female Swiss ICR (CD1) mice are housed in groups of five per cage and allowed free access to food and water to acclimate 7 days before the initiation of experiments. At the time of the study, the animals weigh 23-27 g.</p>
<p id="p-0410" num="0491">In order to mimic the immunocompromised state common to many subjects at high risk of a fungal infection, a profound state of granulocytopenia is produced in animals to maximize the growth of <i>Candida </i>in the mice. This immuno-compromised state is achieved by administration of cyclophosphamide to the mice prior to infection. Cyclophosphamide is administered via intraperitoneal injection four days (150 mg/kg) and one day (100 mg/kg) before the day of infection. The degree and duration of neutropenia is confirmed by monitoring neutrophil counts of peripheral blood smears with a hemocytometer daily throughout the duration of the study.</p>
<p id="p-0411" num="0492">In order to initiate the <i>Candida </i>infection, neutropenic mice are placed head first into a mouse restraint device with the tail extending freely hanging through the other end. The tail is immersed in warm (50&#xb0; C.) water bath for 5-10 s to dilate the veins. Using a (1 mL) tuberculin syringe with either a 26- or 27-gauge needle the inoculum (0.1 mL of a suspension of 10<sup>5-7 </sup>CFU/mL <i>Candida </i>blastospores) is injected via the lateral tail vein. The animals are monitored at least every six hours after infection for the remainder of the study period.</p>

<p id="p-0412" num="0493">Three groups of six animals (corresponding to three dose regimens) are administered a compound of Formula I by oral gavage at a dose of 0.1, 0.5, or 3 mg/kg. Afterwards, blood is sampled at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 hours post-administration. Blood from groups of three mice is sampled at each sampling time point. At the next time point the second group of three mice is sampled. Thus, any one mouse is sampled only three or four times to minimize the impact of blood loss on drug concentrations. Before sampling, the animals are anesthetized with a few drops of halothane on a bell jar. Blood (50 &#x3bc;L per time point) is collected in heparinized capillary tubes (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, Pa.) from the orbital venous plexus. The volume of blood collected form any individual animal is less then 5% of the total blood volume.</p>
<p id="p-0413" num="0494">The tubes are immediately centrifuged in a capillary centrifuge at 10,000&#xd7;g for 4-5 minutes, the serum is removed with a micropipet, placed in the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate and frozen at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. until the assay for OGT 4154 is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0414" num="0495">Levels of the compound in each sample are then evaluated by HPLC. An assay of six to eight standards of drug-spiked serum (twofold escalating concentrations) to create a standard curve is similarly assayed. The lower limit of detection for the assay is defined, and the intra- and interday variation calculated. Pharmacokinetic constants for each drug dose level are calculated using the drug concentrations from the individual mouse samples. The elimination half-life in the postdistributive phase is calculated using a noncompartment model and an unweighted least linear squares method. The AUC is calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule up to the final measured concentration and then extrapolated to infinity.</p>
<p id="h-0104" num="0000">Analysis of Binding to Serum Protein</p>
<p id="p-0415" num="0496">Since serum protein binding of anti-infective drugs can reduce antimicrobial activity, restrict tissue distribution, and delay drug elimination, protein-binding studies of a compound of Formula I are performed on the serum of neutropenic mice using an ultrafiltration method. After the mouse serum samples are spiked with a series of drug concentrations, one mL aliquots is filtered by centrifugation through Millipore YM10 filter device (10,000 MW exclusion) (Millipore Corp. Bedford, Mass. using a fixed angle rotor at 5000&#xd7;g for five minutes. The concentration of OGT 4154 in serum and in ultrafiltrate to determine the degree of protein binding at each of the drug concentrations, where the percentage of protein bound drug is calculated as:

Evaluation of Therapeutic Efficacy in Neutropenic Mice
</p>
<p id="p-0416" num="0497">A compound of Formula I at escalating doses (10-100 mg/kg) or vehicle are administered to neutropenic mice by oral gavage two hours after infection with <i>Candida </i>as described above. This delay after infection allows the cells to enter the early log phase of growth in the mouse kidneys. Antifungal efficacy is assessed by comparison to the microbiological clearance of <i>Candida </i>from kidneys in treated vs untreated control mice. At the end of therapy, animals are euthanized by CO<sub>2 </sub>asphyxiation. Both kidneys are aseptically removed and placed in 3.4 ml of sterile cold 0.9% NaCl (an initial 1-10 dilution based on weight of kidneys). The kidney tissue is then homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer for 20 seconds. After homogenization of each tube, the grinder bit is washed with 70% ethanol followed by fresh tap water. This method prevents significant organism carryover from sample to sample.</p>
<p id="p-0417" num="0498">Each tissue homogenate is then serially diluted 10-fold from 1/10 to 1/10<sup>6 </sup>in sterile 0.9% NaCl. The dilutions are plated in duplicated on SD agar plates for determination of viable fungal colony counts after incubation at 37&#xb0; C. for 24 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0418" num="0499">Colony counts are expressed as the mean&#xb1;standard deviation log<sub>10 </sub>CFU/kidney. Previous studies with this series of dilutions have demonstrated that the method is sensitive to detection of 100 CFU/kidneys.</p>

<heading id="h-0106" level="1">Human Clinical Trial of Safety</heading>
<p id="p-0419" num="0500">Objective: To determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of orally administered a compound of Formula I.</p>
<p id="p-0420" num="0501">Clinical Trial Participants:</p>
<p id="p-0421" num="0502">Thirty healthy volunteers ranging between 20-40 years of age and weighing between 60-90 kg are enrolled in the study. The subjects will have no clinically significant abnormal laboratory values for hematology or serum chemistry, and a negative urine toxicology screen, HIV screen, and hepatitis B surface antigen screen. They should not have any evidence of the following: hypertension; a history of any primary hematologic disease; history of significant hepatic, renal, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, metabolic, neurologic disease; habitual and heavy consumption of beverages containing caffeine; participation in any other clinical trial or had blood transfused or donated within 30 days of study entry; or have significant abnormalities on the pre-study physical examination or the clinical laboratory evaluations within 14 days of study entry. All subjects are evaluated for safety and all blood collections of pharmacokinetic analysis are collected as scheduled. All studies are performed with institutional ethics committee approval and patient consent.</p>
<p id="p-0422" num="0503">Study Design This is a Phase I, single center, open label, randomized study in healthy male volunteers. Thirty subjects are randomly assigned to one of three dosing groups (0.2, 0.5, or 1.5 mg/kg). A compound of Formula I is administered orally. Additional dosing, dosing frequency, or other parameter may be added to the study as desired by including additional groups of subjects. Subjects are confined to the study center for at least 12 hours prior to and 72 hours following dosing for the study period.</p>
<p id="p-0423" num="0504">Blood Sampling Serial blood is drawn by direct vein puncture before and after administration of a compound of Formula I. Venous blood samples (5 mL) for determination of serum concentrations of the compound of Formula I are obtained at about 20 minutes prior to dosing (baseline sample) and at 1, 2, 5, 8, 12, 15, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hours after dosing. Each serum sample is divided into two aliquots. All serum samples are stored at &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. Serum samples are shipped on dry ice. Fasting clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinanalysis) are performed immediately prior to dosing, the morning of day 4 following dosing, and the morning of day 7 following dosing.</p>
<p id="p-0424" num="0505">Bioanalytical Methods An HPLC assay is used to determine serum concentrations of a compound of Formula I.</p>
<p id="p-0425" num="0506">Safety Determinations Vital signs are recorded immediately prior to dosing, and at 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours after each dosing. Safety determinations are based on the incidence and type of adverse events and the changes in clinical laboratory tests from baseline. In addition, changes from pre-study vital sign measurements, including blood pressure, and physical examination results are evaluated.</p>
<p id="p-0426" num="0507">Data Analysis Pharmacokinetic parameters are calculated by model independent methods using the latest version of the BIOAVL software. The following pharmacokinetic parameters are determined: peak serum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>); time to peak serum concentration (t<sub>max</sub>); area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to the last blood sampling time (AUC<sub>0-72</sub>) calculated with the use of the linear trapezoidal rule; estimated by linear regression of consecutive data points in the terminal linear region of the log-linear concentration-time plot. The mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) of the pharmacokinetic parameters are calculated for each treatment.</p>
