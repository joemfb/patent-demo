<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from Korean Patent Application No. 10-2010-0001898, filed on Jan. 8, 2010, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>

<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With the development of acoustic technologies, various techniques for outputting an audio signal have been proposed. One of the techniques is a method of converting a single audio signal into a plurality of audio signals and then outputting the plurality of audio signals through a plurality of audio output units corresponding thereto. According to this method, however, when only some specific audio output units of the plurality of audio output units continue to output audio signals for certain duration, there are performance differences between the specific audio output units continuing to output the audio signals and the other audio output units which do not operate to output audio signals. That is, the frequent use of specific audio output units leads to a problem in that the performances of the specific audio output units continuously outputting audio signals are further degraded in comparison with the performances of the other audio output units which do not operate to output audio signals.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To overcome such a problem, a method of randomly changing audio signal output units at a predetermined period using a dynamic element matching (DEM) algorithm has been proposed to prevent only specific audio output units from continuing to output audio signals. However, such a conventional method causes computation amount to be increased due to the application of the complex algorithm.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Exemplary embodiments will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an apparatus for outputting an audio signal according to an exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the apparatus for outputting an audio signal according to an exemplary embodiment includes a receiving unit <b>110</b>, a carrier wave generation unit <b>120</b>, a modulation signal generation unit <b>130</b>, an amplification unit <b>140</b>, and an output unit <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The receiving unit <b>110</b> receives an audio signal.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The carrier wave generation unit <b>120</b> generates a plurality of carrier waves having different phases using the audio signal received through the receiving unit <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">For example, the carrier wave generation unit <b>120</b> may generate an initial carrier wave, and then generate phase-shifted carrier waves the respective phases of which are shifted from a phase of the initial carrier wave by predetermined phases, respectively. Here, the carrier wave generation unit <b>120</b> generates carrier waves such that the initial carrier wave and the phase-shifted carrier waves all have different phases from one another. As an exemplary embodiment, the carrier wave generation unit <b>120</b> generates an initial carrier wave, and may then generate a first phase-shifted carrier wave a phase of which is shifted from the phase of the initial carrier wave by 90 degrees, and a second phase-shifted carrier wave a phase of which is shifted from the phase of the initial carrier wave by 180 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The carrier wave generation unit <b>120</b> may determine a number of carrier waves based on a voltage magnitude of the received audio signal, and generate carrier waves according to the determined number. For example, if the voltage level of the audio signal that is currently inputted through the receiving unit <b>110</b> corresponds to volume level <b>3</b> of volume levels <b>1</b> to <b>10</b>, the carrier wave generation unit <b>120</b> may generate three carrier waves based on the volume level <b>3</b>. Here, phases of the three carrier waves differ from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The method of determining the number of the carrier waves is not limited to the example above. For instance, the carrier wave generation unit <b>120</b> may generate the carrier waves the number of which equals the number of output units (not shown) included in the output unit <b>150</b>. The range of volume levels is not limited to one of 1 to 10 as described above, and may be subdivided in increments greater or less than the numerical values of 1 to 10 in another exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The modulation signal generation unit <b>130</b> receives the audio signal, and compares the respective carrier waves generated from the carrier wave generation unit <b>120</b> with the received audio signal to thereby generate a plurality of modulation signals.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Detailed operation of the modulation signal generation unit <b>130</b> will be described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B and <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> illustrate a method of generating one modulation signal according to an exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates a carrier wave <b>210</b> and an audio signal <b>220</b> which are inputted to the modulation signal generation unit <b>130</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates a modulation signal <b>230</b> that the modulation signal generation unit <b>130</b> generates by comparing the carrier wave <b>210</b> with the audio signal <b>220</b>. For convenience in describing the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, it is assumed that the audio signal <b>220</b> is a sinusoidal wave.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the modulation signal <b>230</b> according to an exemplary embodiment has a high level when a voltage magnitude of the carrier wave <b>210</b> is equal to or smaller than that of the audio signal <b>220</b>, and has a low level when the carrier wave <b>210</b> is greater in voltage magnitude than the audio signal <b>220</b>. The modulation signal <b>230</b> having a low level means that the voltage magnitude of the modulation signal is smaller than a predetermined threshold value, whereas the modulation signal <b>230</b> having a high level means that the voltage magnitude of the modulation signal is equal to or greater than the predetermined threshold value. However, the modulation signal <b>230</b> is not limited to the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. Therefore, a modulation signal according to another embodiment may have a low level when the carrier wave <b>210</b> is smaller in voltage magnitude than the audio signal <b>220</b>, and may have a high level when the carrier wave <b>210</b> is greater in magnitude than the audio signal <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In particular, the modulation signal <b>230</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a pulse width modulation (PWM) signal. The modulation signal generation unit <b>130</b> of an exemplary embodiment may generate a PWM signal as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, or may generate a modulation signal having different waveforms.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the method of generating one modulation signal has been described. Hereinafter, description will be given of a method of generating a plurality of modulation signals with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a method of generating a plurality of modulation signals according to an exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the modulation signal generation unit <b>130</b> according to an exemplary embodiment includes N number of modulation units <b>132</b>, <b>134</b>, . . . , and <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The first modulation unit <b>132</b> receives an audio signal and a first carrier wave to generate a first modulation signal <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The second modulation unit <b>134</b> receives the audio signal and a second carrier wave to generate a second modulation signal <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The Nth modulation unit <b>136</b> receives the audio signal and an Nth carrier wave to generate an Nth modulation signal <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Here, the first to Nth carrier waves <b>310</b> to <b>330</b> differ in phase from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Also, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, high-level periods of some of the first to Nth carrier waves <b>310</b> to <b>330</b> partly overlap each other.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As such, the modulation signal generation unit <b>130</b> according to an exemplary embodiment generates modulation signals such that high-level periods of the respective modulation signals partly overlap each other in a time domain.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The amplification unit <b>140</b> amplifies the plurality of modulation signals.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">More specifically, the amplification unit <b>140</b> amplifies amplitudes of voltages or currents of the plurality of modulation signals.</p>
