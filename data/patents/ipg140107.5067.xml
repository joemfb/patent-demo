<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In a wireless system, the wireless terminal has a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM), which contains the identity of the subscriber. One of the primary functions of the wireless terminal with its SIM in conjunction with the wireless network system is to authenticate the validity of the wireless terminal (for example, a cell phone) and the wireless terminal's subscription to the network. The SIM is typically a microchip that is located on a plastic card, a SIM card, which is approximately 1 cm square. The SIM card is then placed in a slot of the wireless terminal to establish the unique identity of the subscriber to the network. In some cases, the wireless terminal itself contains the subscriber identification and authentication functionality so that a separate SIM and/or SIM card is not utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the SIM (or within the wireless terminal) an authentication key and a subscriber identification pair are stored. An example of such a pair would be the authentication key Ki as used in GSM networks and the associated subscriber identification IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity). Another example would be the authentication key A-Key and subscriber identification MIN (Mobile Identification Number) as used in CDMA and TDMA networks. In either case, a corresponding identical set of an authentication key and a subscriber identification are stored in the network. In the SIM (or in the wireless terminal) and within the network, the authentication functionality is run using the local authentication key and some authentication data which is exchanged between the SIM and the network. If the outcomes of running the authentication functionality in the SIM and in the network leads to the same result, then the SIM/wireless terminal are considered to be authenticated for the wireless network.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In existing wireless systems, a SIM (or wireless terminal) has an authentication key associated with only one subscriber identification and this subscriber identity is typically tied to a local region or network. When a SIM (or wireless terminal) authenticates in a region that is not local or with a network that is not local, then usually the SIM (or wireless terminal) needs to pay additional roaming service charges to connect with the wireless network. It would be beneficial if the SIM (or wireless terminal) were not tied to a local region or network. For example, equipment vendors would then be able to sell the same equipment in multiple regions and for multiple networks. Additionally, end users may avoid roaming service charges or at least more favorable subscription terms may be available.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Provisioning of Subscriber Identifications to Wireless Terminals in Wireless Networks</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A system and method for provisioning a subscriber identification to a wireless terminal in a wireless network is disclosed. A control center receives transmission from a wireless network. The transmission indicates that a wireless terminal is roaming. The control center provisions a subscriber identification to the wireless terminal, where the subscriber identification is selected based at least in part on the identification of the wireless network in which the wireless terminal is roaming. Using the newly-provisioned subscriber identification, the wireless terminal acquires wireless service from the wireless network as a local wireless terminal. The wireless terminal can operate as a local wireless terminal for that network, or for a network with which the local network has a preferred relationship. The wireless terminal can acquire telecommunications service as a local terminal by using a stored set of authentication key-subscriber identification that is specific to the network it is operating in. In various embodiments, the wireless terminal can operate as a local terminal by receiving or downloading a specific set of authentication key-subscriber identification, or by receiving or downloading a subscriber identification to pair with an existing authentication key.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a wireless system. In the example shown, the wireless system includes a plurality of wireless terminals, represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> by wireless terminal <b>100</b>, a plurality of wireless network base stations, represented by wireless network base stations <b>104</b>, wireless network center <b>106</b>, Home Location Register/Authentication Center (HLR/AuC) <b>108</b>, and provisioning server <b>110</b> capable of provisioning the wireless terminals. Although only one wireless network center <b>106</b> is shown, it is understood that the wireless system can include multiple wireless network centers <b>106</b>. Each wireless network center <b>106</b> includes, or is associated with, a HLR, a Mobile Switching Center/Visitor Location Register (MSC/VLR) and a Serving GPRS Service Node (SGSN), or Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN). In one embodiment, the multiple wireless centers <b>106</b> may be operated by different network carriers, while HLR/AuC <b>108</b> and provisioning server <b>110</b> are operated by a global platform provider. Wireless terminal <b>100</b> includes a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) which is either an attachable hardware card with a memory and a processor or a software object embedded in the wireless terminal. Wireless terminal <b>100</b> communicates with wireless network base stations <b>104</b> using wireless signal <b>102</b>. As a wireless terminal moves around it communicates with different wireless base stations. Wireless network base stations <b>104</b> communicate with wireless network center <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Communications from a wireless terminal are passed to another wireless terminal over the same wireless network using a local wireless network base station to the other wireless terminal or the communications are carried by a wired network or other wireless network to the destination terminal. Wireless network center <b>106</b> communicates with its associated HLR, where sets of authentication key-subscriber identification are stored, to help in authenticating a wireless terminal that is acquiring wireless network service. One example of a subscriber identification is an international mobile subscriber identifier (IMSI). Wireless network center <b>106</b> and its associated HLR communicate with provisioning server <b>110</b> to enable a wireless terminal to acquire a new subscriber identification that is paired with an existing authentication key and/or a new set of authentication key-subscriber identification. In some embodiments the transmission of the authentication key or the authentication key-subscriber identification is encrypted. In various embodiments, the authentication key or the authentication key-subscriber identification is/are decrypted at the wireless terminal and/or in the SIM card. The old authentication key-new subscriber identification pair and/or the new set of authentication key-subscriber identification are added in the appropriate manner to the HLR/AuC <b>108</b> databases or the HLR databases associated with wireless network centers <b>106</b> so that the wireless terminal can be authenticated and can acquire wireless network service using the new subscriber identification and/or authentication key set. In various embodiments, the wireless network system is a cellular system, a GSM/GPRS wireless system, a CDMA or WCDMA wireless system, or a TDMA wireless system, or any other type of wireless network system.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates an example of authentication data structures in one embodiment. In some embodiments, the authentication data structure for a wireless terminal is located in the SIM, and for the network in the HLR/AuC such as HLR/Auc <b>108</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or the HLR associated with wireless network centers <b>106</b>. An authentication data structure (ADS) for a wireless terminal includes an authentication key (AK) and one or more subscriber identifications (SI) and is used to help authenticate a wireless terminal for a wireless network. In the example shown, the ADS for wireless terminal <b>1</b> includes one authentication key and one subscriber identification. The ADS for wireless terminal <b>2</b> includes one authentication key and three subscriber identifications. The ADS for wireless terminal N includes one authentication key and two subscriber identifications. The ADS for network includes the authentication key-subscriber identification entries for each of the wireless terminals. Entries for wireless terminal <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, and N are shown. In some embodiments, there are more than one authentication keys where each authentication key has multiple subscriber identifications.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates an example of authentication data structures in another embodiment. Authentication data structure (ADS) for a wireless terminal includes a Ki and one or more IMSI's. In the example shown, the ADS for wireless terminal <b>1</b> includes one Ki and one IMSI. The ADS for wireless terminal <b>2</b> includes one Ki and three IMSI's. The ADS for wireless terminal N includes one Ki and two IMSI's. The ADS for HLR/AuC includes the Ki-IMSI entries for each of the wireless terminals. Entries for wireless terminal <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, and N are shown.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating an embodiment of a process for acquiring wireless service from a wireless network. In some embodiments, the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is implemented on a wireless terminal such as wireless terminal <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In the example shown, in <b>300</b> a wireless signal is received from a wireless network. A wireless terminal receives wireless signals from a nearby network base station. In <b>302</b>, a network identification is decoded from the wireless signal. The wireless signal includes a mobile network identification. For example, the wireless terminal scans for the existing wireless system signals. When it finds a network system broadcast control channel (e.g. BCCH in GSM Systems), it decodes the broadcasted information to decode the Location Area Identifier (LAI). The LAI is composed of a mobile country code, a mobile network code and a location area code. From the LAI, the wireless terminal can determine the country in which it is operating. In <b>304</b>, a subscriber identification is selected based on the decoded network identification. For example, LAI information can be matched with the subscriber identification of the wireless terminal, which includes a mobile country code, a mobile network code, and a mobile subscriber identification number. In various embodiments, the LAI mobile country code and subscriber identification mobile country code are matched or the LAI mobile network code and the subscriber identification mobile network code are matched. In various embodiments, the selection of a subscriber identification is based at least in part on the pricing of different wireless networks, the billed account for that connection, a billed account for the wireless service, the application that will use the connection, an application using the wireless service (for example, one subscriber identification for data communication and a different subscriber identification for voice communication) or any other appropriate criteria for selecting a subscriber identification. In <b>306</b>, wireless service is acquired from the wireless network.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a process for provisioning subscriber identification to a wireless terminal in a network system. Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in the example shown, wireless terminal <b>100</b> receives information from and transmits information to wireless network center <b>106</b> (and its associated HLR), HLR/AuC <b>108</b>, and provisioning server <b>110</b> using wireless signals <b>102</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, wireless network center <b>106</b> (and its associated HLR), HLR/AuC <b>108</b>, and provisioning server <b>110</b> are collectively identified by numeral <b>402</b>. In <b>404</b>, wireless terminal <b>100</b> listens to wireless signals <b>102</b> transmitted from network base stations <b>104</b> and decodes the mobile network identification from the transmitted information. For example, the wireless terminal scans for the existing wireless system signals. When it finds a network system broadcast control channel (e.g. BCCH in GSM Systems), it decodes the broadcasted information to decode the Location Area Identifier (LAI). The LAI is composed of a mobile country code, a mobile network code and a location area code. From the LAI, the wireless terminal can determine the country in which it is operating. The wireless terminal receives a set of Subscriber Identification from network center, HLR/AuC, and provisioning server <b>402</b> and stores in its ADS. In <b>406</b>, the wireless terminal chooses a Subscriber Identification with the same country code from its ADS. For example, the Subscriber Identification is composed of a mobile country code, a mobile network code, and mobile subscriber identification number. The codes in the Subscriber Identification can be used to match a Subscriber Identification to the local network and/or country. The rest of the Subscriber Identifications stored in the wireless terminal's ADS may be made inactive for the duration of the session.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In <b>408</b>, the wireless terminal performs a location update with the visited wireless network using the new Subscriber Identification. In <b>410</b>, the network center, HLR/AuC, and provisioning server <b>402</b> searches for the Subscriber Identification in its ADS and retrieves the corresponding Authentication Key. In <b>412</b>, a challenge is generated (RAND) and with the Authentication Key is used to calculate a Response (SRES) using an authentication algorithm (A3). In <b>414</b>, the RAND is sent to the wireless terminal and a response is requested. In <b>416</b>, the wireless terminal uses the RAND with the Authentication Key from its ADS to independently calculate a SRES using encryption algorithm (A3) stored in its SIM. In <b>418</b>, the SRES is sent to the network center and/or HLR/AuC and/or provisioning server <b>402</b>. In <b>420</b>, authentication is passed if the received SRES matches the locally computed SRES, otherwise the authentication fails.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates another embodiment of a process for provisioning subscriber identification to a wireless terminal in a network system. In some cases, the wireless terminal will not contain an IMSI that matches the country code of the local network system. The wireless terminal can connect to the network using an IMSI with another country code and then receiving or downloading a local IMSI (i.e. with a matching country code). In the example shown, wireless terminal <b>400</b>B receives information from and transmits information to the network center, HLR/AuC, and provisioning server <b>402</b>B using cellular signals. In <b>404</b>B, wireless terminal <b>400</b>B listens to cellular signals transmitted from network towers and decodes the country code from the transmitted information. In <b>406</b>B, wireless terminal <b>400</b>B communicates, after being authenticated, with the provisioning server transmitting information including a country code and a terminal producer. In <b>408</b>B, the provisioning server chooses a new IMSI with a local country code. In <b>410</b>B, the new IMSI is added to the ADS of the HLR/AuC (or the HLR associated with the network system) corresponding to the wireless terminal (i.e. paired with the wireless terminal's Ki). In <b>412</b>B, the provisioning server sends the new IMSI to wireless terminal <b>400</b>B. In <b>414</b>B, wireless terminal <b>400</b>B adds the new IMSI to its ADS. In <b>416</b>B, wireless terminal <b>400</b> reestablishes its connection with the network system with the new IMSI as the active IMSI. In some embodiments, depending on the information transmitted (i.e. IMSI range or type of wireless terminal), communication may be established between the wireless terminal and a specific application server (i.e., a global platform provider's provisioning server or another server). In some embodiments, this communication with a specific application server is encrypted.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a process for provisioning subscriber identification to a wireless terminal in a network system. In some embodiments, the wireless terminal will not contain a Subscriber Identification that matches the network code and/or country code of the local network system. The wireless terminal can connect to the network using a Subscriber Identification with another network/country code and then receiving downloading a local Subscriber Identification (i.e. with a matching country code). Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4A</figref>, in the example shown, wireless terminal <b>100</b> receives information from and transmits information to network center <b>106</b> (and its associated HLR), HLR/AuC <b>108</b>, and provisioning server <b>110</b> using wireless signals <b>102</b>. In <b>504</b>, wireless terminal <b>100</b> listens to wireless signals transmitted from network base stations <b>104</b> and decodes the mobile network identification from the transmitted information similar to <b>404</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. In <b>506</b>, wireless terminal <b>100</b> communicates, after being authenticating using a process similar to <b>408</b>-<b>420</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, with the provisioning server <b>110</b> transmitting information including a country code and a terminal producer. In <b>508</b>, the provisioning server <b>110</b> chooses a new Subscriber Identification with a local country code and/or network code. In <b>510</b>, the new Subscriber Identification is added to the ADS of the HLR/AuC <b>108</b> or the HLR associated with the visited network corresponding to the wireless terminal (i.e. paired with the wireless terminal's Authentication Key). In <b>512</b>, the provisioning server <b>110</b> sends the new Subscriber Identification to wireless terminal <b>500</b>. In <b>515</b>, wireless terminal <b>100</b> adds the new Subscriber Identification to its ADS. In <b>516</b>, wireless terminal <b>100</b> reestablishes its connection with the network system with the new Subscriber Identification as the active Subscriber Identification. In some embodiments, depending on the information transmitted (e.g., subscriber identification range or type of wireless terminal), communication may be established between the wireless terminal and a specific application server (e.g., a global platform provider's provisioning server or another server).

In various embodiments, the identifier can be an International Circuit Card Identifier (ICCID), an international mobile subscriber identifier (IMSI), a customer identifier, a user identifier, or a device identifier. In various embodiments, the one or more identifiers comprises an identifier associated with a user, a customer, a company, an organization, etc. or a group of identifiers associated with a user, a customer, a company, an organization, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, one or more states are based on the lifecycle of the service of a wireless communication device.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A test ready state can be used to allow a manufacturer to test a SIM, or a device with a SIM, and its network communication infrastructure before delivering the SIM, or device with a SIM, to an end user, a retail location, or a distributor. A test ready state can be a default state for a SIM that allows authentication and authorization with a global platform provider's HLR and AAA server, but does not have any billing associated with it. A SIM in a test ready state is able to conditionally transact data, voice, and/or Short Message Service (SMS) communications&#x2014;for example, some limits may be placed on the communications while in this state such as: communication may occur up to a maximum data transmitted/received amount or up to a maximum number of days since the initial data communication. A test ready state may have no prerequisite state, have no limitation to a next state (e.g., all states allowed as next state), have no exclusivity rule, be a required state, and be allowed to have automatic and/or manual transitions.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">An inventory state can be used to allow a SIM to be placed in a device and associated with an identifier of the device (e.g., a terminal identifier or a point of sale terminal identifier). An inventory state cannot coexist with an activation ready state. An inventory state cannot connect with the network and requires a manual change in order to change state. An inventory state may have a test ready state as a prerequisite, have no limitation to a next state (e.g., all states allowed as next state), have an exclusivity rule in that it cannot coexist with an activation ready state, not is a required state, and be allowed only to have manual transitions.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">An activation ready state can be used to allow a SIM to be ready to be activated. An activation ready state will authenticate and authorize with the HLR and AAA server of the provider system, but no billing will occur. After the first data communication (e.g., first packet data protocol (PDP) context communication), the SIM state will automatically change to an activated state. An activation ready state may have a test ready state or inventory state as a prerequisite, have no limitation to a next state (e.g., all states allowed as next state), have an exclusivity rule in that it cannot coexist with an inventory state, not be a required state, and be allowed to have an automatic transition to an activated state or a manual transition to other states.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">An activated state can be used to allow a SIM, or a device with a SIM, to be used by a user. In an activated state the SIM will authenticate and authorize on the HLR and AAA server of the provider system. Billing commences immediately on changing to this state. The provider system may check to make sure that the proper information is contained on the provider system's HLR and AAA server databases as well as the billing databases. In some cases, the checks will include checking the identifiers stored in the SIM (e.g., international mobile subscriber identifier (IMSI), customer identifier, device identifier, etc.). An activated state may have a test ready state, inventory, or activation ready state as a prerequisite, have possible next states of deactivated, purged, or retired, have no exclusivity rule, not be a required state, and be only allowed to have a manual transition to a next state.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A deactivated state can be used to allow a SIM, or a device with a SIM, to be deactivated by the user. In a deactivated state the SIM will not be allowed to authenticate and will not be billed. The AAA server of the provider system and the gateway GPRS support node (GGSN) of carrier networks will be sent a notification (e.g., a packet) informing them that the SIM has been deactivated. An deactivated state may have an activated state as a prerequisite, have possible next states of activated, purged, or retired, have no exclusivity rule, not be a required state, and be only allowed to have a manual transition to a next state.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A retired state can be used to allow a SIM, or a device with a SIM, to be retired by the provider or the user. In a retired state the SIM will not be allowed to authenticate and billing ends. A retired state may have any state as a prerequisite except purged, have any possible next states (i.e., all states possible), have no exclusivity rule, not be a required state, and be only allowed to have a manual transition to a next state.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A purged state can be used to allow a SIM, or a device with a SIM, to be purged by the provider. In a purged state the SIM will not be allowed to authenticate and the subscriber identification is removed from the system (e.g., IMSI permanently removed from the HLR of the provider system). A purged state may have any state as a prerequisite, have no possible next states, have no exclusivity rule, not be a required state, and be not allowed to have any transitions to a next state.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, a state is defined by a customer. In some embodiments, the state is defined using an Internet-based service.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, a state definition does not support communication sessions and a transition to that state will terminate existing open communication sessions.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, a first wireless communication provisioning state allows a communication device to pass traffic without incurring any billing charges, and an associated state transition rule allows an automated transition to a second provisioning state where the second provisioning state incurs billing charges. In some embodiments, a first wireless communication provisioning state allows a communication device to pass traffic without incurring any billing charges, and an associated state transition rule allows an automated transition to the second provisioning state, where the second provisioning state does not allow the communication device to pass traffic.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In <b>802</b>, state transition rule(s) between two states is/are defined. A transition from one state to another may occur automatically on a predetermined condition or manually. If the transition is based on a condition is met (e.g., upon first data communication&#x2014;packet data protocol context established), the state will automatically change from one to another (e.g., activation ready state to activated state). In various embodiments, the transition condition is based on one or more of the following: a predetermined amount of elapsed time since a prior state transition, an amount of service usage above a predetermined amount of service usage, one or more service signalings, or any other appropriate condition. In various embodiments, the condition is based on an exclusivity rule, a state rule, a communication data transfer, or any other appropriate condition. A manual change from one state to another requires an intervention directly from the provider system&#x2014;for example, an action through a manager portal, by uploading a file to the SIM or device with the SIM, or an application programming interface (API) call.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In various embodiments, a state transition rule can be defined for an individual device or a group of devices, or different rules can be defined for different individual devices or different groups of devices, or any other appropriate combination as appropriate for meeting the needs of a supplier of devices.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, a group of states are defined and a group of transition rules are defined, and then a selection of states and transition rules are associated with one or more identifiers.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, a customer selects a state transition rule. In some embodiments, a customer defines a state transition rule. In various embodiments, the state transition rule is selected and/or defined using an Internet-based service, using a local program interface, or any other appropriate manner of selecting and defining a state transition rule.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some embodiments, a state transition rule when activated terminates existing communication sessions.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an embodiment of a state definition. In some embodiments, a state is associated with an identifier&#x2014;for example, a SIM, a device identifier (e.g., an international mobile equipment identifier), a vendor identifier, or any other appropriate identifier. In the example shown, a state definition includes state name, state description, required state flag, prerequisite state, allowed next state(s), exclusivity rule, and transition mode(s) available that describe conditions allowing transitions between states. For example, a test ready state has: a) a state name of test ready; b) a state description of SIM is able to tested in its operation with the network by a manufacturer in a limited manner without being billed; c) a required state flag indicating that the test ready state is required; d) there is no prerequisite state for the test ready state; e) allowed next states from test ready are inventory, activation ready, activated, retired, or purged; f) there is no exclusivity rule for the test ready state; and g) the transition modes available are automatic to either an inventory state or an activation ready state based on an exclusivity rule or manual change.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a state transition rule definition. In various embodiments, a state transition rule definition is associated with a state associated with an identifier or an identifier. In the example shown, a state transition rule definition includes current state, transition condition, state transitioned to, and transition description. For example, a SIM can be manually changed from an inventory state to an activation ready state when the device that the SIM is in is deployed by selling the unit to a retail customer, by having a service provider place the unit in the field, or by any other appropriate manner. For another example, a SIM can be automatically changed from an activation ready state to an active state when a PDP context is established and data is communicated to and from the SIM, or device with the SIM in it.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating an embodiment of states of a channel sale model for provisioning and the transitions between the states. In some embodiments, the starting default state of a SIM is the test ready state. In the example shown, in test ready state <b>1100</b> a device is ready for testing. The SIM is shipped in the test ready state to an original equipment manufacturer (OEM)&#x2014;for example, a customer wanting to use the connectivity services provided by the provider which enables a user's device to have data communication to the customer via one or more carrier networks. In test ready state <b>1100</b>, the SIM is allowed to provision and establish a PDP session (e.g., it can connect to GGSN of a carrier network, connect to internet, and connect to the customer's application server). When the SIM is in the test ready state, no billing to the OEM occurs. This connectivity is allowed for until the transition <b>1101</b>. Transition <b>1101</b> from the test ready state is either a manually triggered transition or an automatically triggered based on a condition where the condition is the when the SIM has reached: 1) a maximum number of PDP sessions has occurred&#x2014;for example, 10; 2) a maximum amount of data has been transmitted/received to and from the SIM/device via the carrier network&#x2014;for example, 100 Kbytes; or 3) a maximum amount of time has elapsed since the first PDP context in this test ready state&#x2014;for example, 90 days. When the transition is triggered, then the SIM switches to inventory state <b>1102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In inventory state <b>1102</b>, a device is waiting to be transferred to a user. In this state, no connectivity is enabled, and no billing occurs. The state is maintained until transition <b>1103</b>. Transition <b>1103</b> occurs when the OEM or the customer or its channel service providers manually triggers a state change. When the state change is triggered, the SIM is changed to activated state <b>1104</b>. In activated state <b>1104</b>, a device is being used by user. In activated state <b>1104</b>, the SIM is able to establish a PDP session and connect and transfer data to a customer application server via a carrier network. The user is billed for the service provided by the provider. Billing information is provided to the customer by gathering the relevant data from the network carriers and the provider's data bases. The SIM remains in the active state until triggered to transition. Transition <b>1105</b> may be triggered manually or automatically. In various embodiments, transition <b>1105</b> is triggered automatically by a maximum number of connections allowed, a maximum amount of data transferred, a maximum amount of time since the start of PDP sessions, or any other appropriate automatic trigger condition. In some embodiments, the user or the customer can also manually trigger transition <b>1105</b> to a deactivated state <b>1106</b>.</p>
