<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a continuation of prior U.S. application Ser. No. 11/541,168, filed Sep. 28, 2006 now abandoned, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an apparatus, method and system for providing an electronic marketplace to join a trade for credit default swaps (CDS) and other financial interests, and to Deal-By-Volume (DBV) for the interests.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Connectivity between broker and trader is believed to be an emerging area in credit derivatives trading. While not every credit derivative product in the market may be ready for fully interactive trading, it may be desirable to have a flexible platform available as the market matures.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In particular, it may be desirable to have a trading platform that can adapt to the developing market practices. Additionally, it may be desirable to continuously attract traders&#x2014;not only through liquidity and the hybrid model&#x2014;but also by integrating into the clients' trading environment and providing services through electronic connectivity.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Other systems may be limited in their ability to capture all market data. In particular, other systems may not capture every market movement (order) and may be limited in their ability to make enhancements or to delve further into client processing, such as, for example, sales orders or trading partners lists. Moreover, other systems may lack flexibility to add new trading products, including, for example, the ability to add certain attributes or criteria. In particular, options and spreads may not be available in such systems due to additional requirements and trading complexities they may impose. Other systems may also be limited in their ability to report and print information, including, for example, intra-day bids/offers, user-generated events, credit information, user-related information, and user permissions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Additionally, other prior systems may not promote cross-product services, and order management for these systems may be non-flexible in that they do not support &#x201c;one-cancels-other&#x201d;, an electronic trade confirmation, or a request for quote.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An exemplary method and system of the present invention is for providing electronic-based credit trading that integrates pre-trade, trading, and post-trade activities and enables brokers, for example, to enter and display quotes, manage their traders' order portfolios, investigate market depth, and execute transactions for any available entity or interest using, for example, feeds to/from analytic calculators, trader spreadsheets, electronic confirmations, and other accounting platforms.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In this regard, the exemplary method and/or system is providing good accessibility and deployment, high-availability, strong transaction security, and good response time, as well as permissions matrices, and administration.

<p id="p-0161" num="0160">A mapping to favorite client codes may be provided, for example, as function keys within a visual screen display, to facilitate data entry.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">In regards to order management with the system, users may define new interests and simultaneously enter one or two-way prices for those interests. Users may also create, modify and cancel one and two-way orders for existing interests, create a basket of orders for multiple interests simultaneously, and cancel interests as well as any attached orders. All bids and offers may be submitted as limit price orders. Optional conditions may be attached to orders if the product line definition allows for it.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Users may also investigate prices by viewing the price details via the depth and tool tips. Users may also change the status of one or more orders and transfer orders from one trader to another trader within the same institution without losing priority. Certain users, such as, for example, brokers, may maintain lists of favorite customers and control the posting (broadcasting) of firm prices to customers and to market data feeds.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">An interest entry screen may be provided to define new interests and simultaneously enter a bid and/or an offer for the interest. According to an exemplary embodiment, order maintenance may be limited to certain types of credit default swap structures, including, for example, a single name default swap (default), calendar spreads, and credit switches.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Also, a price entry screen may be provided to enter a new bid and/or offer on an existing interest. A basket entry screen may be provided to create separate orders for multiple interests simultaneously. An update function may be provided to modify a single order. A post/un-post toggle function may be provided so that certain users may broadcast an un-posted price, which may be viewed by other users, or withdraw a previously posted price from the external market. A hold function may be provided to hold a single order and a hold all function may be provided to hold multiple orders selected, for example, by product line, entity, interest, trader id, and/or side (bids vs. offers). A hold interest function may be provided to cancel an interest as well as any orders attached to it. A highlight toggle function may be provided so that brokers may turn interest/price highlights on or off. A clear/lock toggle function may be provided to lock the market on the selected interest for clearing to a counter bid or offer. Still further, a depth toggle function may be provided to open or close a floating window (popup), which displays the market depth for the currently selected interest. In addition, the user may also view the depth for an interest in-line within the price sheet using separate expand/collapse controls. Also, attributes and defaults may be derived from the definition of the product line and entity. Confirmation may be required when updating, deleting or changing the status of an order. In this regard, it is believed that anything that may affect order priority should require an additional click.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">Double-click shortcuts may be provided in market and depth windows, as well as the order book, to enable quick action against a selected price. The type of user and price may determine the default behavior. If the user is a broker or another user who is authorized to trade, the system may assume an intent to trade against the selected price, and may present the broker with an appropriate execution screen, such as, for example, &#x201c;Hit&#x201d; if the selected price is a firm bid and &#x201c;Lift&#x201d; if the selected price is a firm offer. For customer-site users who are authorized to trade and who select one of his/her own prices, it may be assumed that he/she wishes to modify the order, so the price entry maintenance screen may be presented. If the user has selected a price from a trader within the same institution and the user is authorized to act on behalf of the selected trader, the system may assume that the user wishes to modify the order, and present the price entry screen. Otherwise, if the user is not authorized to act on behalf of the selected trader, the system may ignore the user's action. If the selected price is from outside of the user's institution, the system may assume that the user wants to trade against that price, and may therefore present an appropriate execution screen, such as, for example, a &#x201c;Hit&#x201d; if the selected price is a bid or a &#x201c;Lift&#x201d; if the selected price is an offer.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Still further, a quick history popup screen may be provided to show pricing statistics for the selected interest. A trader's eye feature may be provided so that brokers, managers and other authorized users may view the market from the perspective of a specific trader. A client list function may allow certain users to maintain a list of the clients that they prefer to work with. An end-of-day roll function may assist with orders left active at the end of the trading day, and may be used to clear out previously held orders.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">In regards to execution and post-trade processing with the system, users may execute orders against existing prices and interests and optionally hold (cancel) the aggressor's standing orders on the opposite side. In the event of a partial execution, users may specify whether the balance of the order should remain open or be held (canceled). User may also view an execution history, amend transaction details for previously entered executions, record off-screen executions, approve trades by completing the necessary details, and print/send confirmations for completed and approved trades.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">With the system users may execute their orders by performing a hit or lift for a particular market price for the entire bid/offer size, or a smaller quantity. In particular, a &#x201c;Hit&#x201d; may be used to sell an interest at a selected price and a &#x201c;Lift&#x201d; may be used to buy an interest at the selected price. Authorized users may access trade maintenance functions, including, for example, the ability to input executions performed outside the trading platform and to amend and delete previously executed trades. Certain users may also record off-screen executions outside the trading platform (e.g., voice-brokered) as trades by certain brokers and clerks, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">Execution confirmation may be required as a separate step only for executions in product lines whose definition calls for it, otherwise the user may be able to execute against the selected price with a minimum of two keystrokes. Execution disabled for ineligible prices&#x2014;command buttons, menu options and keystroke equivalents may be disabled for prices that are non-tradable due to being part of the same institution, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Execution notification messages may also be provided to affected users (brokers and traders on both sides) as well as other interested parties based on their entitlements. Trade confirmations may also be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">According to an exemplary embodiment, each user may have only one execution screen of any type open at any given moment in time. Company site or trader fields may not be displayed or require entry for traders. Only brokers may see or enter the site name. Non-traders (brokers and other client-site users) authorized to act on behalf of traders may see or enter the trade. The interest identification may be determined from the cell at which navigation originates for execution and the relevant interest description may be displayed in the title bar of all dialog boxes. For spreads and switches, the description of the first leg may be followed by the description of the second leg with a &#x2018;/&#x2019; as the separator. Attributes and defaults may be derived from the definition of the product line and Entity. Optional conditions acceptance may be required only when applicable, i.e., when the bid/offer being hit/lifted has at least one condition associated with it.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Reports may be provided that include, for example, information related to trade or broker details by customer or currency, a brokerage summary by date or transaction identifier or customer ID, and a trade or customer blotter by trade date. Access to reports may be controlled by user permissions. For example, reports may be limited to users of brokerage institutions and each report may have a parameter to limit the output to transactions for a particular brokerage site.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Orders may be validated according to certain rules when they are created. For example, according to an exemplary order validation rule, choice markets may be permitted so that a user may submit a bid equal to his/her own offer, or that of another user within his own institution, and vice versa. In this regard, a non-tradable price may be specified for all traders within that institution.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Orders may be processed or controlled according to certain rules. For example, according to an exemplary order processing rule, a user may not have more than one order generation screen open at the same time. As a further example, the user may not be allowed to create a standard limit order via the Bid/Offer screen and, at the same time, have the Specials or the Run screen open at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Trades may be executed according to certain rules. For example, a user may not have more than execution generation screen open at the same time. In particular, he may not be allowed to hit a bid via a Hit box while the Lift screen is open at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">An important part of the system is the Trade Management Service (TMS) and an associated Application Programming Interface (API), which may support the role of service provider and compliance layer. In particular, TMS may include, for example, support for trade storage, trade querying, and trade event notification and publication.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">The TMS API may provide a standard API as well as a compliance layer. Clients that are only interested in invoking TMS services may use the API as a &#x201c;hook&#x201d; into the TMS. External systems may integrate into the TMS and support the services via TMS connectors that support the same set of APIs.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">The TMS API may define component classes that specify core classes and their function. The TMS API may support data management including, for example, creating, updating, deleting, and querying trades. The TMS API may also define trade states. The TMS API may also support event callbacks so that clients may publish changes to other consumers of the TMS and register for notifications of trade changes.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">The TMS API may define core classes, which may be classified into service-related classes and trade data objects. Service related classes form the services part of the TMS API and trade data objects may be used to transport data from and to the TMS API.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">The TMS API may support data management of trades. In this regard, data management may include the processes by which trades are created, updated and queried in the TMS system.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">The TMS API may allow clients to publish trade changes to the TMS and register against the TMS to receive callbacks when trade data or trade state changes. In particular, clients may publish trade data and state changes, and register for callbacks, including, for example, trade data and state changes.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">System Information</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">An asset class refers to the general market category for a group of financial products. It is the highest level of product classification. Asset classes may include, for example, equity, debt, currency (FX), money market, metals, energy, weather, and freight. Credit derivatives, for example, may be classified under debt.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">A sub-asset class refers to the secondary grouping level in the product classification hierarchy. For example, the equity asset class may include the single stocks, indices, and sectors sub-asset classes, the debt asset class may include the fixed income, credit, and loans sub-asset classes, the currency (FX) asset class may include a currencies sub-asset class, the money market asset class may include an interest rates sub-asset class, the metal asset class may include gold, silver, and palladium sub-asset classes, the energy asset class may include electricity, natural gas, coal, and oil sub-asset classes, the weather asset class may include average temperature, heating degree days, cooling degree days, rainfall, snowfall, wind speed, sunshine/cloud cover, wave height &#x26; swell, and storm geography sub-asset classes, and the freight asset class may include wet and dry sub-asset classes.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">The instrument type describes the type of tradable instrument represented by each product. The instrument type determines the characteristics (attributes) and processing applicable to the product. Each product may be defined, for example, as a stock, bond, note, link note, bill, commercial paper, future, option, forward, forward agreement, non-deliverable forward, swap, basis swap, default swap, asset swap, total rate of return swap, repurchase agreement, spot, collateralized debt obligation, collateralized loan or mortgage obligation, or certificate of deposit instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">A product line differentiates products within a sub-asset class by instrument type. The credit sub-asset class, for example, may include the product lines such as credit default swaps, asset swaps and total return swaps, which may then be considered credit derivatives.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">A credit default swap (CDS) is a product line that requires the buyer of a &#x201c;swap&#x201d; to pay a fee to the seller of the swap in exchange for protection against an adverse &#x201c;credit event&#x201d; occurring to the reference entity. A CDS may be thought of as a form of default insurance. The value of a CDS is derived from the market's perception of an entity's creditworthiness.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">In the context of financial instruments an entity or product name refers to the name of an issuer of securities within the selected product line. With respect to commodities, this may be the name of a specific product&#x2014;the brand, variety, provider or location. For example, an entity for credit derivatives may be a corporation, government agency, local government or sovereign nation, whose credit is the underlying basis for the derivative. On the other hand, the electricity sub-asset class may refer to the name of the power grid through which the electricity is delivered.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">An interest represents an instance of a tradable product with specific parameters such as the structure (where applicable), term or maturity/expiration date, coupon/interest rate, volatility, etc. For example, an interest for the product EUR/USD FX Options might be a 3-month (term) 25 delta (volatility) Risk Reversal (structure). An interest may include one or more primitives (a.k.a., legs), and may be quoted and traded as a single unit. An interest for credit default swaps may be a single CDS or multiple CDS, which may be linked together by a structure.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">A structure is a defined relationship between the primitives or legs in an interest. Some of the structures employed in credit default swaps may include a single name default swap, a calendar name, a credit switch, and a package. The single name default swap is a primitive for the credit default swaps product line. The calendar spread involves simultaneous buying and selling of two interests on the same entity but having different terms and potentially different amounts. Credit switches involve simultaneous buying and selling of two interests on different entities, usually (but not always) with the same terms. A package involves simultaneous buying or selling of multiple interests on different entities, usually for the same terms and may be quoted and traded as a single deal.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">A term, period, maturity, or expiration refers to the duration or life of a financial instrument, such as, for example, the term to maturity or the actual maturity date for a bond, the duration or expiration for an option, the term until delivery for a future or a forward, and so on. Most financial products other than stocks have a term or maturity/expiration date associated with them. In some instances, the term may be defined as a relative length of time&#x2014;e.g., a 5 year CDS, or a 3-month FX Option. In other instances, the term may refer to a specific date or period&#x2014;CAL 03 RWE Peakload for German Electricity, or a Treasury bond that matures on Jun. 30, 2010.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">A calendar is a grouping of periods, terms or dates. Each product line that uses standard periods or terms may be associated with a calendar. When interests are defined within product lines that use calendars, the user may pick a date from a drop-down list of pre-defined terms or dates.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">A market is a grouping of products from one or more product lines, which may be filtered or combined on the basis of one or more parameters such as a region, country, instrument category, etc. For example, the credit derivatives market may include product lines such as credit default swaps, asset swaps and total return swaps (the German electricity market, for example, may include all electricity forwards and options on power produced via all the grids located in Germany).</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">Supplementary data sets may be used to support key features of order management, including, for example, information related to countries of operation, geographic or economic regions, assignment of countries to regions, currencies, association of currencies with countries, industry sectors, credit ratings, and grade ratings. The information related to credit ratings may include an assigned character code, a description of the rating, a sort key, a sub-classification or grouping within the rating scheme, and an agency name of the source organization of the rating system. The information related to the grade ratings may include an assigned character code (e.g., IG to indicate investment grade, NI to indicate non-investment grade, and NR to indicate not rated) and a description.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">References to internal users may be interpreted herein as brokerage institutions, i.e., companies with a brokerage role. External users may be deemed to be traders or others who are employees of non-brokerage institutions. Distinguishing between brokerage vs. non-brokerage users may make it easy to accommodate a new brokerage operation in the event that a different company becomes part of the brokerage institution group, and there is a need to separate certain users and information from that of another brokerage operation. Internal users may have access to all company sites whereas external users may have access only to sites for their company. For internal users, the defined client list may appear first in the site list in the defined order of appearance followed by the remaining site names sorted in alphabetical order. For external users, or for internal users without a defined client list, the site names may appear sorted alphabetically.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">Internal users may have access to all traders whereas external users may have access only to traders with their company. Both internal and external users may have access to all brokers.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">User entitlements may be defined and administered using permission sets that entitle certain users to perform specific functions for particular groups of products or product views, and to define the scope of these entitlements. A user may have, for example, multiple sets of permissions. External user administrators may be limited to working with users and groups associated with their own company. User entitlements may include, for example, the id of the company to which the user belongs, a name applicable to the user for the selected company, an assigned global role, and a set of permissions. The set of permissions may include, for example, a product view, an appropriate role, and scope of the role, such as, for example, defined levels for a user's product, company, group, and user view.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">System Details</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows an exemplary system <b>150</b> for providing integrated credit derivative brokerage services, which may be implemented using an appropriate computer or processing system (including, for example, the Internet or other suitable data network). The exemplary system <b>150</b> may include a Credit Default Swaps (CDS) entity <b>151</b> (or other trading entity) to perform trading, trade capture, confirmations, maintenance of reference data, and reporting. The CDS <b>151</b> may include an associated CDS database <b>152</b>, referred to as the CDS DB.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">The exemplary system <b>150</b> may include a Credit Portal <b>153</b> to provide a customer facing front end for real-time credit market data, which may serve as a historical reporting and search facility for brokers and traders.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">The exemplary system <b>150</b> may include a Credit Mart <b>154</b> to provide a data mart structured specifically for data dissemination needs within the credit vertical. In this regard, the Credit Mart <b>154</b> may serve as a data source for the Credit Portal <b>153</b>, or other market data feeds, such as, for example, Fenics Curves (Hull&#x26; White) and Reuters. In particular, the exemplary system may include the apparatus, method or system of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/366,500 filed on Feb. 14, 2003, entitled &#x201c;AN APPARATUS, METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR DETERMINING CREDIT DERIVATIVE INDICES AND ESTIMATING CREDIT DERIVATIVE CREDIT CURVES, AND A CREDIT CALCULATOR FOR VALUING CREDIT DERIVATIVES BASED ON THE CREDIT CURVES&#x201d;, which is incorporated in its entirety by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">The exemplary system <b>150</b> may include a Credit Editor <b>155</b> to provide a data-cleansing interface to the Credit Mart <b>154</b> accessed via the Credit Portal <b>153</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">The exemplary system <b>150</b> may include a Credit Trading System (CTS) <b>156</b> to provide order management. In this regard, the CTS <b>156</b> may serve as an authoritative source for real-time, electronic orders for Credit Default Swaps (CDS) <b>151</b>. The CTS <b>156</b> may also serve as a Price Broadcast (PBS) compliant service provider. The CTS <b>156</b> may include an associated back-end database <b>157</b>, referred to as the CTS DB.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">The exemplary system <b>150</b> may include a Credit Trade Capture (CTC) system <b>158</b> to provide a middle-office trade capture and/or confirmation system, and provide Straight Through Processing (STP) to clients. In this regard, the CTC <b>158</b> may serve as an authoritative source of record for Credit Default Swaps (CDS) <b>151</b>. The CTC <b>158</b> may also serve as a Trade Management Service (TMS) provider. The CTC <b>158</b> may include an associated back-end database <b>159</b>, referred to as the CTC DB.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">The exemplary system <b>150</b> may include a Data Depot (DD) <b>160</b> to provide a central store for all reference data and/or other market data. The exemplary system <b>150</b> may include a Data Depot Front End (DDFE) <b>161</b> to provide an administrative interface into the Data Depot <b>160</b>, and a Data Buffet (DB) <b>162</b> to provide an administrative front end to the Data Depot <b>160</b> for manipulating reference data. The exemplary system <b>150</b> may include Data Depot (DD) Universal views <b>163</b> for Data Depot tables that may serve as the basis for a simple interface into Data Depot reference data for downstream systems, such as, for example, the Credit Trading System (CTS) <b>156</b> or the Credit Trade Capture (CTC) system <b>158</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">The exemplary system <b>150</b> may include a Market Data Processor (MDP) <b>164</b> to provide a data collector, transformer, and/or formatter for market data. In this regard, the MDP <b>164</b> may serve as both a Trade Management Service (TMS) client and a Price Broadcast Service (PBS) client.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">The exemplary system <b>150</b> may include a Price Broadcast Service (PBS) <b>165</b><i>a</i>, <b>165</b><i>b</i>, to provide one or more standard Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for broadcasting orders. In particular, the PBS may include two sub-APIs, such as, for example, a PBS Event to allow clients to listen to price notifications and/or events in real time, or a PBS Query to allow clients to query service providers for a recent price history. The exemplary system <b>150</b> may include a PBS Provider, such as, for example, the Credit Trading System (CTS) <b>156</b>, to implement a PBS API for broadcasting prices. The exemplary system <b>150</b> may include a PBS Client to provide a consumer of PBS data that may use the standard API's of PBS to interface with PBS compliant service providers.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">The exemplary system <b>150</b> may include a Trade Management Service (TMS) <b>166</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>to provide one or more Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for managing and interrogating trades, including, for example, during an entire trade lifecycle. The TMS may include sub-APIs, such as, for example, a TMS Event to allow clients to listen to trade notifications and/or events in real time, a TMS Store to allow clients to record new trades or enact changing on existing trades, and a TMS Query to allow clients to query service providers for recent trade event history.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">The exemplary system <b>150</b> may include a TMS provider, such as, the Credit Trade Capture (CTC) system <b>158</b>, which implements TMS API(s). The exemplary system <b>150</b> may include a TMS Client that uses the TMS APIs to communicate with a TMS provider. For example, the TMS Client may invoke a trade management function or inquire about trade lifecycle information in real-time or batch mode.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">According to an exemplary embodiment, the Credit Trade System (CTS) <b>156</b> may create new trades in the Credit Trade Capture (CTC) system <b>158</b> via a Trade Management Service (TMS) Store API. Since the TMS Store process is orthogonal to normal market update processes in the CTS <b>156</b>, a slow down in the market should not occur. If connectivity between the CTS <b>156</b> and the CTC <b>158</b> is interrupted, the CTS <b>156</b> may queue-up trades until connectivity is restored.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">The Market Data Processor (MDP) <b>164</b> may use the TMS Query and TMS Event APIs to receive data. In particular, data may be received in real-time via the TMS Event, and if an intermittent disconnect occurs, data may be recovered and reconciled in a request-response exchange via the TMS Query. The MDP <b>164</b> may also use the Price Broadcast Service (PBs) Query and PBS Event APIs to receive data. In particular, data may be received in real-time via the PBS Event and, if an intermittent disconnect occurs, data may be recovered and reconciled in a request-response exchange via the PBS Query. The MDP <b>164</b> may also use stored procedures of the Credit Mart <b>154</b> to populate the Credit Mart <b>154</b> based on input from the TMS and PBS input handlers. The Credit Editor <b>155</b> may have direct access to the Credit Mart <b>154</b> to make in-place updates should there be a data quality issue.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">The Credit Trade System (CTS) <b>156</b>, Credit Trade Capture (CTC) system <b>158</b>, and Market Data Processor (MDP) <b>164</b> may interact with the Data Depot (DD) <b>160</b> in real-time or in batch mode, for example, via a set of views <b>163</b> from the Data Depot (DD) <b>160</b> that are available to the downstream systems via a Data Buffet (DB) link. The downstream system may periodically query the Data Depot views <b>163</b> to check for updates. Based on the query, the downstream system may refresh local copies of the reference data as per the Data Depot <b>160</b>. The Data Depot <b>160</b> may be updated in real-time via the Data Buffet <b>162</b>. The Data Depot <b>160</b> may also provide reference data to the Credit Mart <b>154</b> via universal views.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">The Credit Default Swap (CDS) <b>151</b> may include a custom feed that updates the Credit Mart <b>154</b> periodically, such as, for example, every five minutes. A refresh on demand may also be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">As further regards the Trade Management Service (TMS), <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref> shows an exemplary embodiment <b>1600</b> for a TMS factory class, referred to as the TMS Factory, that may be bound into, for example, a Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) by the provider (such as, for example, a BOSS group) and may include information necessary to create trade specific management classes.

<p id="p-0219" num="0218"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> shows an exemplary TMS Listener class <b>2000</b>, referred to as the TMSListener and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> shows an exemplary TMS Exception class <b>2100</b>, referred to as the TMSException, in which a single exception class extends a java.lang.Exception object. The exemplary TMS Exception class <b>2100</b> may be expanded to support a wider set of error conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> shows an exemplary State class, referred to as the State, which encapsulates trade state information.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> shows an exemplary message sequence diagram <b>2300</b> to create a new trade. The Client sends a lookup factory message to the JNDI to lookup the TMSFactory, and sends a getTMSManager message to the TMSFactory to get the TMSManager. The TMSFactory instantiates the TMSManager and returns the TMSManager to the Client. The Client sends a saveTrade message to the TMSManager passing it the trade data. The TMSManager sends a trade creation message to the TMS System. In this regard, the TMS System may appear as a black box to external clients. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> shows exemplary pseudo code <b>2400</b> to create a trade.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> shows exemplary pseudo code <b>2500</b> to update a trade. Updating a trade may follow a message sequence similar to the exemplary message sequence diagram <b>2300</b> as trade creation. Therefore, Clients may similarly invoke the TMS API and the TMS may determine whether an update or create is applicable.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">According to an exemplary embodiment, there is no trade deletion function. The TMS may support the cancellation of trades as a state change but may not delete trades from the system. Clients may simulate a logical delete by treating cancelled states as deleted.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> shows an exemplary message sequence diagram <b>2600</b> to query for individual trades or a collection of trades. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> shows a client querying for pending trades but the exemplary method may be applied to any of the query functions of the QueryManager interface. The Client sends a lookup factory message to the JNDI to lookup the TMSFactory, and sends a getTMSManager message to the TMSFactory, which instantiates the TMSManager. The Client sends a getQueryManager message to the TMSManager, which instantiates the QueryManager. The Client sends a getTrades(pending) message or other desired query to the QueryManager, which invokes the TMS System. The TMS System processes the request, executes the query, and returns results to the client. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> shows exemplary pseudo code <b>2700</b> to query a trade.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> shows exemplary trade states and statuses for TMS trades. In particular, a trade's state may be Pending, Validated, Cleared, Settled, Affirmed, Confirmed, Cancel, or Rejected. A trade's status may be valid or invalid. Having both a trade state and trade status may provide greater flexibility to represent the business process around trades.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">States represent the workflow that trade may go through. There may be no inherent rules governing the order of the states so that trades may move from any state to another depending on the trading platform.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> shows an exemplary state transition or workflow <b>2900</b>, in which a trade's state may progress from Pending to Validated to Confirmed to Affirmed to Settled.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">According to an exemplary scenario, Client A creates ten new trades in the system through the TMS API. The trades are set to states of pending and statuses of valid by the TMS. A trade-check application lists all the pending trades to be validated. Broker B examines the trades to be validated and only validates half of them. The remainder of the trades may be incomplete or lack certain data. Consequently, trades 1 to 5 may have a validated state and a valid status, whereas, trades 6 to 10 may have a pending state and an invalid status.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">Because the TMS system may support statuses along with trades, the trade-check application may now identify which trades have been examined and rejected by the broker. Hence, the trade check application may automatically notify other systems about these rejected trades without the broker having to manual do it.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">The TMSManager class may provide functions for clients to execute business processes against the trades. Clients may not directly modify states or statuses but instead may send requests to approve or cancel trades to the TMS. The TMS may then decide based upon internal rules whether or not to perform the action requested by the client.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">A trade's state or statuses may be inspected by the client via the returning data object. Action processes, such as, for example, validation, affirmation, and cancellation, may be identical.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30A</figref> shows an exemplary message sequence diagram <b>3000</b> to validate a trade. The Client sends a lookup factory message to the JNDI, and sends a getTMSManager message to the TMSFactory, which instantiates the TMSManager. The Client sends an updateState message to the TMSManager supplying a trade id and state. The TMS manager sends a trade validation message to the TMS System, which returns a trade object including state and status data. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30B</figref> shows another exemplary message sequence diagram <b>3001</b> to validate a trade, with reduced messaging. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> shows exemplary pseudo code <b>3100</b> to validate a trade.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> shows an exemplary message sequence diagram <b>3200</b> to publish a data change. The Client sends a lookup factory message to the JNDI, and a getEventManager message to the TMSFactory, which instantiates the EventManager. The Client sends a publishDataChange message to the EventManager, which forwards it to the TMS System, which handles the messaging details to other consumers. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> shows exemplary pseudo code <b>3300</b> to publish a data change.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> shows an exemplary message sequence diagram <b>3400</b> to register a trade change. A Client sends a lookup factory message to the JNDI, and a getEventManager message to the TMSFactory, which instantiates the EventManager. The Client sends a registerForAll message to the EventManager to register a supplied listener. The EventManager sends a registerListener message to the TMS System, which performs callbacks to the listener, via an on Message procedure of the TMSListener interface. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> shows exemplary pseudo code to register a listener and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 to 48</figref> show exemplary TMS data objects.</p>

<p id="p-0242" num="0241">According to an exemplary embodiment, not all of above-described menu items and sub-menu items may be provided for each exemplary application. For example, the administration functions to maintain reference data may only be accessible within the Data Buffet (DB) application. In this regard, there may be no link between the DB and the CTS or CTC. Hence, reference data within the CTS and CTC may be refreshed using a special option, which may replicate the relevant reference data within each application's database.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an exemplary CTS main page/window <b>200</b>. The exemplary.

<p id="p-0244" num="0243">The main menu bar <b>202</b> may appear below the title bar <b>201</b>, and provide access to functions and/or objects within the exemplary application, in this instance, the CTS application.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">The command buttons <b>203</b> may appear below the main menu bar <b>202</b>, and provide convenient access to frequently used trading commands, including, for example, commands to create a new interest, add a bid and/or offer for an existing interest, update an existing bid or offer, hit a selected bid, lift a selected offer, hold an order, post/unpost a price, and display the structure, market depth, or pricing statistics for a selected interest.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">Icons <b>204</b> may appear adjacent to the command buttons <b>203</b> and include, for example, an order book icon represented as a black book with a &#x201c;+&#x201d; or &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; sigh to access open and held bids and offers, a trade book icon represented as a green book with a &#x201c;thumbs up&#x201d; symbol to execute trades, and a hold all icon represented as a red octagon with an outstretched palm symbol to hold all orders for a selected trader.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">Workspace tabs <b>205</b> provide access to workspaces, which are work areas within which a user may logically organize the markets and products that they want to work with. For example, a user may want to create a workspace for a particular sector, across credit products or different structures. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, for example, the workspace tabs <b>205</b> provide access to a Banks workspace, an Insurance workspace, a Sovs workspace, and an Autos workspace. Workspaces are further discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">Price sheet <b>206</b> displays bank interests and association market information parameters in a matrix format.

<p id="p-0251" num="0250">Edits applicable to entry fields within dialog boxes and query screens may be checked after a user submits the entry or changes. An appropriate error message may be displayed within the dialog box so that the user is unable to proceed until the error is corrected. System status and error messages other than those related to fields may be displayed with popup screens that require acknowledgement from the user.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">An exemplary system may save (&#x201c;persist&#x201d;) a user's desktop settings by login. That is, each user's desktop settings may be saved when s/he logs out, so that when s/he logs in the next time, their desktop configuration may be recalled as it existed during their previous session. The saved settings may include the physical dimensions (height and width) and the position of screens such as workspaces/price sheets, dialog boxes, logs, pop-ups and query pages. The saved settings may also include preferences for the selection and display order of workspaces and filter selections of logs, order book and trade book. According to an exemplary embodiment, a &#x2018;Save Desktop Settings&#x2019; option from the Preferences submenu may be used to save desktop settings during the user's session. This may be advisable in instances where the user has made significant changes in their desktop settings and wants to safeguard against losing them in the event of an abnormal session termination.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">A drop-down indicator, such as, for example, a downwardly pointing arrow, may be displayed if the user selects a field with a drop-down menu. Type-ahead may be provided.

The mapped function keys may be rendered as buttons in a row below the command buttons, and may be labeled with the relevant client shortnames.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">Workspaces are work areas within which a user may logically organize the markets and products that they want to work with. For example, a user may want to create a workspace for a particular sector, across credit products or different structures. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, for example, the workspace tabs <b>205</b> provide access to a Banks workspace, an Insurance workspace, a Sovs workspace, and an Autos workspace. Workspaces may include one or more price sheets, which may be used to group related products together. Workspaces may be default or custom.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">Default workspaces are pre-defined layouts created and maintained by business administrators based on common/standard market configurations. Only administrators with the appropriate permissions may create and maintain default workspaces. Administrators may assign an appropriate unique title to each default workspace. Default workspace names may be displayed with an asterisk to the left of the assigned name. The administrator may also indicate whether or not a default workspace viewable by external users via a checkbox entitled &#x2018;Enable for External View.&#x2019; The administrator may also designate the users authorized to access each workspace, which may be one specific user, a list of users or all users in the system. Users may be allowed to access and utilize default workspace definitions related to the product lines and product views that they are entitled to work with. For example, a default workspace that includes CDS and asset swaps products may not be made available to users who are authorized for only one of those two product lines. Administrators may be provided with checkboxes to control the release of new/modified default workspaces, and to determine whether a new or modified default workspace should be auto-refreshed/selected on the desktops of users who are authorized to access that workspace.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">When a default workspace is created intra-day, the administrator may elect to have it automatically added to the eligible users' desktops so that the affected users may see a tab for that auto-selected workspace the next time they log in. Users may deselect the workspace if they do not wish to see it, and the system, if required, may retain this setting from that point forward. When a default workspace is deleted intra-day, it may be de-selected from the desktop of every affected user the next time they log in to the system.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">It is understood that administrators may be unlikely to change or delete released workspaces during trading hours. According to one exemplary embodiment, only one workspace may be provided, which may be administered, for example, by a development team directly through the back-end. It is expected that such a workspace may remain relatively static. However, real-time updates related to additions/changes/deletions of default workspaces may be provided, although it may be required to allow the user to log off and log back in to obtain the updates.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">Custom workspaces are market layouts created and maintained by users who wish to customize their desktop. Users may access only their own custom workspaces in addition to the default workspaces provided, for example, by business administration. By default, the system may assign titles, such as, for example, &#x2018;WS1,&#x2019; &#x2018;WS2,&#x2019; and so on, to each custom workspace created. However, the user may change these titles and assign their own names.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">A user may configure their desktop with multiple workspaces, if desired, using any combination of default and/or custom workspaces that may be available to them. Within the user's desktop, the selected workspaces may appear in a tabbed format, as with a commercial work sheet program. The user may also specify the display order of the selected workspaces.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">Workspaces may be added, updated and deleted via an interactive help utility called the Workspace Definition wizard that guides the user through the process. The layout and content of a workspace may be configured via the Workspace Configuration wizard. The Workspace Definition and Configuration wizards may be implemented as part of a suite of four interactive screens that facilitate the administration of default workspaces and price sheets.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an exemplary default workspace definition wizard user interface <b>400</b> to add, modify, rename and delete default workspaces. Authorized users may access this wizard by selecting the Default Workspaces &#x26; Price Sheets option from the Administration sub-menu and then selecting the first tab <b>401</b> entitled &#x2018;Workspace.&#x2019; This wizard may be configured to be the first page/screen accessed via the workspace tab.

<p id="p-0267" num="0266">The exemplary default workspace configuration wizard user interface <b>400</b> includes a screen <b>501</b> with a left panel <b>502</b> to define the physical layout of the workspace and right panel <b>503</b> to list all the available price sheets that may be included in the workspace. Action buttons <b>504</b> and navigation buttons <b>505</b> may be provided, as well as checkboxes <b>506</b> to control the release of the workspace to users.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">According to an exemplary embodiment, a workspace may contain only one price sheet so that options related to the configuration of the physical layout via sub-division of the workspace may be disabled for future upgrade and/or release.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">A Reset action button <b>504</b> may be provided at the top to clear the current workspace layout and start over. Workspace layout configuration commands may be provided via a right-click mouse menu within the layout panel.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">The default workspace layout may be a single price sheet container. According to an exemplary embodiment, the default layout may always apply, and therefore may not be changeable. Each price sheet container may be split horizontally and/or vertically into two containers, each of which may then be further sub-divided, and may in turn include one or more price sheets tiled either horizontally (by default) or vertically (via a configuration command). The price sheet(s) to be included in each container may be selected from a list <b>507</b> of available price sheets, and may be dragged and dropped into the appropriate container when designing the physical layout.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">The bottom of the workspace configuration screen <b>501</b> may include three checkbox configuration options <b>506</b> to control when and how to release the workspace to users, to indicate whether or not the workspace is available for external viewing by certain users, and to control whether or not a newly released workspace is automatically added to the eligible users' desktops.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271">Custom workspaces may be configured to include custom price sheets only. The user may make copies of default price sheets and save those under a different name as their own custom price sheets.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">The Previous navigation button may be used to access the Workspace Definition page, which is the first/previous page/screen under this tab. The Next navigation button may be disabled on this first screen <b>501</b>, as there is no next page.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0273"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an exemplary price sheet(s) display <b>600</b>, which is a market display that groups products and shows the market (bids/offers/trades) for specific interests within those products. Each price sheet may include of one or more interests with similar characteristics and defaults. Price sheets may be presented in a matrix format, which displays individual interests in rows, and specific interest and price parameters in columns. Price sheet columns may be determined by product line, therefore the list of available ones is hard-coded, but an exemplary system may allow for the customization of the content and layout. According to an exemplary embodiment, only one completely hard-coded price sheet may be available.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0274">Price sheets may be default or custom. Default price sheets are common or standard product groupings that may be created and maintained, for example, by business administration. Default price sheets may be made available to all users based on their market and product entitlements at the company and group levels. For example, a user who is not entitled to work with asset swaps may not have access to default price sheets that contain asset swap interests. Default price sheets layouts may be created, modified or deleted only by authorized users, such as, for example, an authorized administrator. The administrator may be required to assign a unique name to each default price sheet. Modifications may become effective the next time each user of the affected price sheet/s logs in to the system. When a default price sheet is deleted intra-day, it may be removed from the affected default workspaces and from the desktop of every affected user. In the event that a price sheet within an active workspace is deleted by system administration, it may not be removed until the affected user has moved away from the workspace. It is understood that administrator may be unlikely to change or delete default price sheets within released default workspaces during trading hours. Accordingly, only one price sheet may be administered by the development team directly through the back-end. However, real-time updates related to additions/changes/deletions of default price sheets may be supported, although the user may be required to log off and log back in to get the updates.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275">Custom price sheets are product layouts created and maintained by users who wish to customize their desktop. Users may maintain only their own custom price sheets. Copies of default price sheets may be provided, for example, by business administration, which may be saved as private copies for custom price sheets. By default the system may assign titles like &#x2018;PS1,&#x2019; &#x2018;PS2,&#x2019; and so on, to each custom price sheet created. However the user may change these titles and assign their own names.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">Price sheets may be added, updated and deleted via the Price Sheet Definition wizard, and the layout and content of a price sheet may be provided via the Price Sheet Configuration wizard as described below, which are part of a suite of four screens provided for the administration of default workspaces and price sheets. A user's entitlements may limit the product views and default price sheets that are made available to them.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">The Price Sheet Definition wizard may enable administrators to add, modify, rename and delete default price sheets. Authorized users may access this wizard by selecting the Default Workspaces &#x26; Price Sheets option from the Administration sub-menu and then selecting the second tab <b>601</b> entitled &#x2018;Price Sheet.&#x2019; According to an exemplary embodiment, the Price Sheet Definition wizard may be the first page/screen accessed via the price sheet tab.

<p id="p-0286" num="0285">For example, a CDS price sheet may include one or more of the following columns: a Structure column to display a short code for the structure of the interest (may be preceded by a subscript &#x201c;u&#x201d; for interests with an up-front premium payment), an Entity column to display the designated market name (short name) for the interest or interest leg, a Debt class column to display the short code for the debt class of the interest or interest leg, a Maturity column to display the actual maturity date for the interest or interest leg, a Bid Customer/Rank column to display the site id of the trader responsible for the bid or the rank of the bid in the depth/queue, a Bid Size column to the bid size, including the unit, a Bid Price Column to display the bid price, an Offer Price column to display the offer price, an Offer Size column to display the offer size, including the unit, an Offer Customer/Rank column to display the site id of the trader responsible for the Offer or the rank of the Offer in the depth/queue, a Term column to display the relative term in years and months for the interest or interest leg when the interest is non-specific, i.e., has relative maturity date(s), a Restructuring column to display the restructuring type for the interest or interest leg, a Convertibility column to display the convertibility of the underlying debt instrument for the interest or interest leg, an FX column to display the denomination currency for the interest, a Bid Trader Column to display the trader id responsible for the bid, a Bid Broker column to display the broker id responsible for the bid, an Offer Trader column to display the trader id responsible for the Offer, an Offer Broker column to display the broker id responsible for the Offer, an FX Unit column to display the denomination currency unit, a Last Trade column to display the price and direction of the last trade for the interest, with the timestamp in a tool tip, a Rating 1 Column to display the rating for the entity under the selected rating 1 type, a Rating 2 column to display the rating for the entity under the selected rating 2 type, a Sector 1 column to display the sector for the Entity on the interest or interest leg for the designated industry classification scheme, a Sector 2 column to display the sector for the Entity on the interest or interest leg for the designated industry classification scheme, a Region column to display the region of the Entity's country of domicile, a Country column to display the Entity's country of domicile, a Parent column to display the Entity's parent institution, a Product Attribute column(s) to display the attribute(s) of an interest per the product line definition, an Interest Description column to display interest parameters as a concatenated space-separated string in a single column, a Last Quote column to display the timestamp and the best bid and ask prices from the latest quote for the interest, a Bid Descriptor column(s) to display additional information related to the bid based on the enabled product line definition, an Offer Descriptor column(s) to display additional information related to the offer based on the enabled product line. The options area <b>707</b> may specify the sorting method for interests within the price sheet. In particular, interests may be sorted by entity shortname (with preceding premium designation subscript when applicable)+debt class+term+restructuring+convertibility. The interests may also be sorted by customer, term, or sector.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">The options area <b>707</b> may also specify whether or not orders at a given price level are to be aggregated in the display, or whether the display of interests without orders is to be suppressed for all users other than the one who initially created the interest or whether the display of insignificant decimal digits is to be suppressed in price columns.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287">A price sheet's configuration determines the basic layout and content of the market data that will be displayed within it. However, other features and display rules may govern the price sheet's content and functionality as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">Exemplary Display Rules</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">According to exemplary general display rules for interests, each interest may be displayed in one or more rows within the price sheet, and may be sorted per the designated sort order. The number of rows that appear for each interest may depend on the structure type. In general, if a price sheet is configured to suppress unquoted interests, users other than the creator of an unquoted interest may not see that interest displayed in price sheets. A default reference obligation tool tip may be provided at the entity level. &#x201c;Hovering&#x201d; over the Entity column on any price sheet row may activate a popup showing the default reference obligation for the entity, including the description, CUSIP and/or ISIN, maturity date and coupon rate of the bond issue. A structure or details view may be activated via a mouse menu option to view the details for each leg of the currently selected interest.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290">According to exemplary display rules for key interest parameters, interest parameters may be displayed in an interest-level perspective or a leg-level perspective. Interest-level parameters may be displayed via a single value for all interest legs, regardless of the structure type. These may include, for example, a code or icon in the Structure column to indicate the structure of the interest, a &#x201c;u&#x201d; subscript appearing to the left of the structure code to designate an up-front premium, a currency code in the FX column to indicate the currency denomination for the interest, a units symbol, such as, for example, &#x201c;MM&#x201d; for millions or &#x201c;B&#x201d; for billions, to indicate the denomination currency unit, a concatenated space-separated string of interest descriptions in a single column.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">Leg-level parameters may include content that varies by leg for multi-legged interests, depending on the structure. For example, depending on the structure the Entity column may display a single short name or multiple short names, the Debt column may display a single debt class or multiple debt classes, the Term column may display a single term or multiple terms, the Maturity column may display a single maturity date or multiple maturity dates, the Restructure column may display a single restructure class or multiple restructure classes, the Convertible column may display a single convertible class or multiple convertible classes.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">According to exemplary rules for optional entity/interest displays, certain interest-level columns may be optionally included based on the price sheet configuration. These include a Last Trade column to display the price, size and direction of the last trade subject. In particular, if the last trade was executed via a &#x2018;Lift&#x2019; command, then the direction of the trade is indicated as an up arrow &#x2018;&#x2191;&#x2019; If the last trade was executed via a &#x2018;Hit&#x2019; command, then the direction of the trade is indicated as a down arrow &#x2018;&#x2193;&#x2019; The size and price of the trade is shown separated by a &#x2018;/&#x2019; For example, &#x2018;&#x2191;5MM/35&#x2019; indicates that the last trade was done by lifting and offer for a size of 5 million at a price of 35. When applicable, an exemplary system may always show the very last trade for a displayed interest, even when there are no active prices currently in the market for that interest. When this column is refreshed with information on a new trade, the new information may be shown in bold font with a red background for a duration of nn seconds immediately following the execution. Thereafter it may revert to normal font and background. The date and time of the last trade may be provided via a tool tip instead of being displayed within the column. Certain users may not see information related to un-posted trades in this column.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">Also, the Last Quote may be optional and may display the timestamp and the best bid and ask prices from the latest quote for the interest. In this regard, the qualifying time frame or cutoff date for the last trade and last quote may be stipulated at the product line level. For example, credit default swaps may use a one-year cutoff so that if no trade occurred on the interest within the past year, nothing is displayed in the last trade column.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">Also, an interest may be further defined by additional optional attributes so that the price sheet may have a row for each unique combination of interest definition plus optional product attribute values provided that there are released (broadcast) prices for that particular combination. Each optional attribute column may be sorted in ascending or descending order based on its definition within the product line administration. Moreover, the price sheet may further include one or more industry sectors, credit rating classifications, a domicile country, a region within the domicile country, and a short name for the parent institution.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">According to exemplary general display rules for orders, price sheets may only show bids and offers with firm prices, held (canceled) orders may be seen in the Order Book only, certain users may post (broadcast) orders only, the minimum and maximum number of decimals to be displayed for both size and price may be based on the product line definition, and an order details tool tip may be attached to the size and price of an order within the price sheet and depth. Hovering over either the bid or offer price or size may activate a popup showing details of that order, including the interest, site (company) name, trader name, broker name, the full actual size, size conditions, the price, price conditions, posting status, timestamp and duration of the order. Certain users may not see the company or trader name and the posting status in this popup.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">According to exemplary general rules for the display of bid and offer price and size conditions, to maximize efficient space utilization, the display of order conditions may be limited to two indicators each in the price and size columns, columnar indicators for order conditions may appear to the left of the bid/offer size or price and may be shown as super or subscripts, in a smaller font than that used for the size and price, columnar indicators may be used to communicate general or key conditional information only, additional details on specific order conditions may be provided via symbols or text within the order details tool tip so that when orders are aggregated, the tool tip may provide details on conditions that apply to the first order at that price level only, the user may be required to use the tool tip in the depth to view the details on conditions applicable to an order that is not the first one within an aggregated quote, all the applicable conditions may be shown in the tool tip for unaggregated quotes, and where two or more conditions apply, they may appear in the order in which they are described under price and size details below, separated by semicolons.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0297">According to exemplary display rules for key order parameters, in particular, customer and broker related columns and the Cust/Rank column may show blanks if there are no orders on that side for the selected interest. If there are one or more standing orders on that side, then the information displayed varies by user type. Based on permissions, a Broker or other authorized user may see the site id (company) for the trader associated with the first order in the queue at that price; when in-line depth is enabled, then the relevant site for each bid/offer may be displayed on each row. A user who is not authorized to view the identity of traders may see blanks. A client-site user sees blanks if his organization has no live orders at that price level. A trader with a live order sees the rank and size of his own best order. A client-site user with no live orders of his own may see the rank of his company's best order. The Trader column displays the name of the trader responsible for the price and the column displays the name of the broker responsible for the price.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0298">According to exemplary rules for key order parameters, in particular, the bid and offer size columns, the decimals may be suppressed when the size is a whole number and sizes may be right justified with the decimal points (when applicable) aligned to ensure that the numbers within each column are properly lined up. If the orders are unaggregated at each price level, then users see the size of the best (first) available order&#x2014;for customer-site users. This may be the first (best) order that they are allowed to trade against, so any preceding ineligible orders may be bypassed. For certain users, the size displayed on aggregated orders may be the sum of the sizes of all orders at the best price, regardless of their eligibility so that posted and unposted orders at the best price may be aggregated. An indicator may inform the broker that the available size is composed of a mix of posted and unposted orders. For certain users, the size displayed on aggregated orders may be the sum of all posted orders at the best price. In regards to conditional indicators, &#x201c;+&#x201d; is shown as a superscript for an aggregated quote that represents more than one bid or offer of the same type (posted or un-posted), a &#x201c;m&#x201d; is shown as a superscript on an aggregated quote that includes posted as well as unposted orders, and a &#x201c;c&#x201d; is shown as a subscript on a quote that represents one or more orders with optional conditions attached&#x2014;the detail of these may be viewed via the order details tool tip on the quote or in the depth. Also, if an order has one or more optional size conditions associated with it, based on the product line definition, then the order details tool tip may display a label &#x201c;Size conditions:&#x201d; followed by the symbols or codes for those conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299">According to exemplary display rules for key order parameters, in particular, the bid and offer price columns. In regards to conditional indicators, an asterisk is shown as a superscript on a quote that is locked for clearing, &#x201c;&#x394;&#x201d; is shown as a superscript on a quote that represents one or more orders that involve a delta hedge, a &#x201c;u&#x201d; is shown as a subscript on a quote that involves an up-front premium payment, a &#x201c;c&#x201d; may be shown as a subscript on a quote that represents one or more orders with optional price conditions attached&#x2014;the detail of these may be viewed via the order details tool tip on the quote or in the depth. Also, if an order has one or more optional price conditions associated with it based on the product line definition, then the order details tool tip will display a label &#x201c;Price conditions:&#x201d; followed by the symbols or codes for those conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">According to exemplary display rules for key order parameters, in particular order-related columns, bid and offer descriptor fields may be provided to stipulate alternate labels in the price sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301">According to exemplary in-line depth display rules, the market depth for each interest may be viewed in-line, i.e., within the price sheet and hotkey commands may be provided to expand/contract the depth for the currently selected interest. For example, a &#x201c;=&#x201d; key may be provided to expand the depth view and a &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; key may be provided to contract the depth view. When expanded, the depth display may be displayed in &#x2018;inverted ladder format&#x2019; as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0302">Log Messages</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0303">A log of trades executed during the user's session may appear in a resizable window at the bottom left of the main application window. By default the trade log display <b>207</b> may be limited to trades related to the interests within the workspaces that the user has selected.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0304">The execution messages of the trade log <b>207</b> may appear in reverse chronological order with the most recent one at the top.

On initial presentation, the cursor within the screen may be focused on the Buyer company field. The user may adjust the size up or down to buy a quantity greater than or less than that being offered. When the order is partially executed, the balance of that order may remain open unless the user indicates that it should be held. The user may also adjust the price on the execution up or down. In this instance, the original order price may be updated before the execution is processed. The user may bypass the best offer and execute against a worse offer in the depth provided that the product line allows for this. According to an exemplary embodiment, broker entry fields may not be provided or displayed within the execution entry screens. However, the names of the primary brokers who service the traders on either side of the trade may be picked up automatically and saved on the execution record. According to another exemplary embodiment, a broker entry field may be provided for the aggressing side, and may default to the primary broker specified on the user profile for the trader on that side. If there is no primary broker specified for the aggressing trader, the broker may default to the name of the user inputting the price. The execution will be assigned a pending status.</p>
<p id="p-0371" num="0370">The exemplary lift entry displays <b>1200</b><i>a </i>and <b>1200</b><i>b </i>may include an interest structure code <b>1201</b>, in which a &#x201c;u&#x201d; (for up-front premium) may appear as a subscript to the left of the structure code when applicable. The exemplary lift entry displays <b>1200</b><i>a </i>and <b>1200</b><i>b </i>may also include one or more rows of interest description fields <b>1202</b>, which describe each leg of the selected interest. The number of rows displayed may be determined by the structure. For example, a single name default swap may be shown as a single row or calendar spreads and credit switches may each have two rows.

In this instance, certain data fields may be hidden from the external user's view.</p>
<p id="p-0375" num="0374">The exemplary trade maintenance display <b>1300</b> may not reside in the trading system, but may be seamlessly accessible from there. The user may not be allowed to have more than one Hit, Lift or Trade Maintenance box open at the same time so that only a single execution screen may be open at any point in time. The user may also be required to define both the interest and record its execution. According to an exemplary embodiment, users may be limited to adding and editing transactions for single CDSs only, therefore for spreads and switches, each leg (transaction) may be required to be entered/edited separately. If the user accesses the exemplary trade maintenance display <b>1300</b> via the Add option on the trade book, the interest details on the trade maintenance screen may be pre-populated from the interest on the selected trade book row. The user may then either use that pre-defined interest, or use it as a template to create a new one by overriding one or more of the details. When the user creates a new interest in the exemplary trade maintenance display <b>1300</b>, the system may need to check if the newly defined interest already exists in the database, and if so, then the existing definition may be required to be used without giving any error or warning message to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0376" num="0375">In addition to the basic execution information, authorized users may also fill in the additional trade details such as brokerage, reference obligations, etc. that are required for trade approval and confirmation. When the exemplary trade maintenance display <b>1300</b> is invoked from a non-blank row in the trade book, it may be assumed that the user wants to maintain the transaction displayed on that row, therefore the screen may be pre-populated with that transaction. In other instances, a blank screen may be displayed. According to an exemplary embodiment, changing the counterparties on a confirmed trade may not be permitted so that the user may need to delete the existing transaction and create a new one with the correct counterparties. According to another exemplary embodiment, counterparties on confirmed trades may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0377" num="0376">A new trade may also be entered by selecting a row, which becomes a template for the new trade to be entered. The details of the old trade may be displayed, and a new trade may be entered with the same details or with changed details. For example, if the price is different from the template, but the other details are the same as the template trade, then the user may just change the price appropriately and the new trade is saved.</p>
<p id="p-0378" num="0377">When a trade is selected for deletion the user may be asked to confirm his/her intention via a popup (see delete action below). When this screen is accessed via the Delete mouse menu option of the trade book, the selected trade may be displayed along with the confirmation popup. When the user selects the exemplary trade maintenance display <b>1300</b> from a non-blank row in a price sheet, the screen may be pre-populated with the definition of the interest on the selected price sheet row. The user may then alter any of the structure details to create a new interest, which may be desired when the new interest is similar to the selected one, or when the user wishes to record an off-screen voice brokered trade for the existing interest. If the entity for the new interest doesn't already exist, a new entity may be set up with minimal data by an authorized user.</p>

<p id="p-0402" num="0401">Order Validation and Processing Rules</p>
<p id="p-0403" num="0402">Orders may be validated according to certain rules when they are created. For example, according to an exemplary order validation rule, choice markets may be permitted so that a user may submit a bid equal to his/her own offer, or that of another user within his own institution, and vice versa. In this regard, a non-tradable price may be specified for all traders within that institution.</p>
<p id="p-0404" num="0403">According to another exemplary order validation rule, a user may not submit a bid higher than his/her own offer, or conversely submit an offer lower than his/her own bid (creates a cross-market or inverse market situation) unless the Product line allows inverted markets. If the exemplary rule is violated, an error message, such as, for example, &#x201c;Inverse Market&#x201d; may be generated.</p>
<p id="p-0405" num="0404">According to another exemplary order validation rule, unless the Product line allows inverted markets, a trader's market entry may not be higher than the quote, i.e., a bid may not be higher than the best offer, and an offer may not be lower than the best bid (cross-market). Technically, they should just go ahead and hit or take the existing bid or offer. The only exception to this exemplary rule is when the trader submitting the order is unable to execute against the existing bid or offer as a result of a credit restriction or some other special condition. The comparison/test should exclude held prices. If this exemplary rule is violated, an error message, such as, for example, &#x201c;Illegal Execution&#x201d; may be generated.</p>
<p id="p-0406" num="0405">According to another exemplary order validation rule, a user may not submit a price that is not a multiple of the price tick size stipulated in the product definition. If the exemplary rule is violated, then an error message, such as, for example, &#x201c;Price must specified in ticks of xx.xx&#x201d; may be generated, where xx.xx is the Price Tick for the product line.</p>
<p id="p-0407" num="0406">According to another exemplary order validation rule, a user may not submit a price with more decimals than the product line allows. If the exemplary rule is violated, then an error message, such as, &#x201c;This product line does not allow for prices with more than x decimals&#x201d; may be generated, where x is the Maximum Price Decimals for the product line.</p>
<p id="p-0408" num="0407">According to another exemplary order validation rule, a user may not submit a size that is not a multiple of the size tick size stipulated in the product definition. If the exemplary rule is violated, then an error message, such as, for example, &#x201c;Price must specified in ticks of xx.xx&#x2032; may be generated, where xx.xx is the Size Tick for the product line.</p>
<p id="p-0409" num="0408">According to another exemplary order validation rule, a user may not submit a size with more decimals than the product line allows. If the exemplary rule is violated, then &#x201c;This product line does not allow for sizes with more than x decimals&#x201d; may be generated where x is the Maximum Size Decimals for the product line.</p>
<p id="p-0410" num="0409">According to another exemplary order validation rule, if the user submits a price that varies from the last price for the selected interest by more than the higher or lower price limit set at the entity or product line level, the user may receive a popup warning within an popup, such as, for example, &#x201c;Warning: Price is xxx.xx % higher(lower) than the last price [CONTINUE]/[CANCEL]&#x201d;, where xxx.xx is the variance percentage between the entered price, and the last price for the interest being quoted or traded; the warning will read &#x2018;higher than the last price&#x2019; if the higher price limit is breached; and the warning will read &#x2018;lower than the last price&#x2019; if the lower price limit is breached; [CONTINUE] and [CANCEL] are action buttons that enable the user to override the warning and continue on, or cancel the entry. If the user cancels the entry, the price may not be submitted, and the focus will return to the price field to allow the user to adjust the price.</p>
<p id="p-0411" num="0410">According to an exemplary order validation rule, a user may not enter firm bids/offers during hours outside of the trading day for his site&#x2014;i.e., at a time that is earlier than the start of the trading day or later than the end of the trading day. (A user may enter held prices.) If the exemplary rule is violated, then an error message, such as, for example, &#x201c;Trading closed at &#x3c;time&#x3e; for &#x3c;date&#x3e; and will re-open &#x3c;date and time site opens&#x3e;&#x201d; may be generated. Bids/Offers may be entered as &#x2018;Indicative&#x2019; and made &#x2018;Firm&#x2019; when the market opens.'</p>
<p id="p-0412" num="0411">The processing of orders may be controlled according to certain order processing rules. For example, according to an exemplary order processing rule, a user may not have more than one order generation screen open at the same time. For example, the user may not be allowed to create a standard limit order via the Bid/Offer screen and also have the Specials or the Run screen open at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0413" num="0412">According to another exemplary order processing rule, when a user enters a new order with a price that matches an existing order on the other side for a product he/she will be given the option to execute or cancel. This exemplary rule may not apply to all product lines. If the exemplary rule is violated, then an error message, such as, for example, &#x201c;Full or partial execution is possible. Submit your order? Execute/Cancel Order&#x201d; may be generated.</p>
<p id="p-0414" num="0413">According to another exemplary order processing rule, a user may have multiple open bids and/or offers in the market for any set of products and interests.</p>
<p id="p-0415" num="0414">According to another exemplary order processing rule, orders may be displayed (in the Depth) and processed in terms of price-time priority. For example, orders may be processed according to the best price first, where the best bid is the one with the highest price, and the best offer is the one with the lowest price, or the orders may be processed according to time, where orders within the same price level are ranked in time order, with the earliest one at the top. A new bid or offer may be appended to the end of the queue for that status group and price level and on interests with up-front premiums, the running points may be used to break ties when the base price between two prices is the same.</p>
<p id="p-0416" num="0415">According to another exemplary order processing rule, when the price on an existing order is changed via the Update function, the system may delete the existing order and submit the changed order as a new one. In this instance, the order may lose its queue ranking. A link should exist between original and current price.</p>
<p id="p-0417" num="0416">According to another exemplary order processing rule, if the Product Line has the &#x2018;Allow Work-ups&#x2019; box checked, then an increase to the size of an existing order without a change to the price, may retain its prior queue position even if there are other standing orders behind the changed order at the same price level. If work-ups are not allowed for the product line, increasing the size of a standing order may result in the order being re-ranked. A decrease in the size of the order may retain the order's original ranking regardless of the product line flag setting.</p>
<p id="p-0418" num="0417">Trading Execution Rules</p>
<p id="p-0419" num="0418">Trades may be executed according to certain rules. For example, a user may not have more than one execution generation screen open at the same time. In particular, s/he may not be allowed to hit a bid via a Hit box while the Lift screen is open at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0420" num="0419">According to another exemplary execution rule, when a user submits his entry via a Hit or Lift command, it may be assumed that the aggressor accepts the normal conditions associated with the passive bid or offer that is being hit or lifted. On a Hit or Lift command, the aggressor may be required to explicitly accept any optional conditions that are associated with the passive bid or offer that is being hit or lifted. The order processing engine (OPE) may process executions by generating a new aggressing bid or offer that inherits the conditions associated with the selected passive order. When the OPE attempts to match existing orders after a change to one side, it may be required to pay attention to all conditions associated with each order. In this regard, the exemplary execution rules may not apply to all products.</p>
<p id="p-0421" num="0420">According to an exemplary execution rule, for executions in Product lines that have the &#x2018;Confirm Executions&#x2019; flag set, the aggressor may be required to separately acknowledge their intention to execute. A checkbox may be presented for this purpose. The user may not be able to submit the execution without checking the box.</p>
<p id="p-0422" num="0421">According to another exemplary execution rule, executions on product lines that do not have &#x2018;Bypass Best Price&#x2019; flag checked, may be required to be filled at the best average price according to the price-time priority as long as the conditions match. In other words, the system may be required to force execution at the best price and ranking unless conditions prohibit it. If the exemplary rule is violated, an error message, such as, for example, &#x201c;Execution against non-best price is not allowed&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0423" num="0422">According to another exemplary execution rule, a trader may not hit a bid, or lift an offer submitted by another trader within the same company/institution. Execution functions may be disabled for these ineligible or restricted prices. IF the exemplary rule is violated, then an error message, such as, for example, &#x201c;Illegal Execution&#x2014;You cannot trade with yourself!&#x201d; may be generated.</p>
<p id="p-0424" num="0423">According to another exemplary execution rule, if the user is unable to execute as a result of timing, i.e., if another user got in before him/her and hit the bid or lifted the offer, or if the order was changed/held/deleted, then there a message may be provided to the user, such as, for example, &#x201c;Price is no longer active&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0425" num="0424">According to another exemplary execution rule, when the &#x2018;Hold standing orders&#x2019; option is checked on for an execution, it should result in the holding of opposite side standing orders only within the interest that was traded.</p>
<p id="p-0426" num="0425">According to another exemplary execution rule, if the price of the selected order is amended at execution time, then the price change should be processed as follows before any accompanying size changes and before the actual execution. In particular, a price change on the execution of an order in a product line that has enabled both the &#x2018;Bypass best price,&#x2019; and &#x2018;Allow inverted market,&#x2019; may be processed and the execution may then proceed regardless of the order's queue ranking after the update. If a price change results in a lower queue ranking than another eligible standing order on the same side, and the product line does not have &#x2018;Bypass best price&#x2019; enabled, then execution may not be processed and the user may be notified with a message, such as, for example, &#x201c;Execution against non-best price is not allowed.&#x201d; If a price change results in an inverse market, an the product line does not have &#x2018;Allow inverted market&#x2019; box checked, then execution may not be processed and the user may be notified with a message, such as, for example, &#x201c;Inverse Market&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0427" num="0426">According to another exemplary execution rule, if the size of the order is amended at execution time, then the size change may be processed after any accompanying price changes, but before the actual execution. In particular, in the event that the size of the execution is less than that of the order and the hold remaining balance box is not checked, the remaining size of the order should remain open in its current queue ranking&#x2014;there is no update prior to execution in this case. If the product line allows work-ups, and the size of the execution is greater than that of the first selected order, then that order's size should be updated to equal the execution size, and the order should maintain its current queue position. If the product line does not allow work-ups, and the size of the execution is greater than that of the first selected order, the execution should be filled from the standing orders at that price level. If the size of the execution is greater than the total of all standing orders at that price level, a new order should be created on the opposite side for the aggressor.</p>

<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Adding and Updating Conditions to Prices</p>
<p id="p-0432" num="0431">According to the exemplary embodiment, a condition may be added to a price. In this regard, the condition may be, for example, free-format text with a maximum field length of 30 characters, and may be entered via a price entry dialog box.</p>
<p id="p-0433" num="0432"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref> shows an exemplary price dialog box <b>5000</b> with conditions. When updating a price, the conditions may be edited in a similar fashion, as shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref> discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0434" num="0433"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref> shows an exemplary update dialog box <b>5000</b> with conditions. When a price has conditions attached, the conditions may be shown as a subscript &#x201c;c&#x201d; to the right of the bid and offer price, so as not to conflict with Delta and Upfront indicators. The conditions may also be shown in a tooltip after a label titled Condition.</p>
<p id="p-0435" num="0434">The exemplary update dialog box <b>5200</b> includes two columns to indicate Bid and Offer conditions, which are entitled &#x201c;B/Cond&#x201d; and &#x201c;O/Cond&#x201d;, and which may be added or removed in the price sheet definition like other columns. Text may be entered in the column. If the text is too wide for the column, it may be clipped to the left and right due to centering.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Workspace and Multiple Price Sheets</p>
<p id="p-0436" num="0435">According to an exemplary embodiment, multiple price sheets may be displayed within a workspace, which may provide an improved display and customized market data content.</p>
<p id="p-0437" num="0436"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref> shows an exemplary workspace <b>5300</b> with multiple price sheets. The exemplary workspace <b>5300</b> may have between one and five columns, and each workspace column may contain between one and five price sheets. The maximum number of columns allowed per workspace may be limited to five, and the maximum number of price sheets allowed per column may be limited to twenty-five. Price sheets included within a column and/or workspace may be individually configured so they need not have the same layout or format. For example, a workspace with a CDS price sheet may be configured next to a Cash Bonds price sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0438" num="0437">Within each column, in the workspace definition screen, the user may drag and drop the price sheets to be stacked vertically one on top of the other within that column. The user may specify the order of the price sheets, and the width of each workspace column may be set to default width of the widest price sheet included in that column. Price sheets may have a label row that identifies the entities grouped into the price sheet, which defaults to the price sheet name, with the option to override it with a custom/different heading. A custom label may be defined, for example, by double clicking the label to change it. The label background and foreground colors may be the same as header row, and the label font may be bold. An option to turn the column scroll bars on or off at the workspace level may be provided. In this regard, the price sheet level may be configured to suit certain requirements. For example, when scroll bars are turned on, there may be a vertical scroll bar for each workspace column (with one or more price sheets each), and only the horizontal scroll bar for the entire workspace. An option may be provided to turn the price sheet header rows in a workspace on or off at work workspace level unless the workspace contains only one price sheet. Hence, suppression of column headers may be effective only for workspaces consisting of two or more price sheets. When headers are displayed, the individual data columns may be resizable. An option may be provided to turn the display of labels on or off at workspace level.</p>
<p id="p-0439" num="0438">At the price sheet level, there may be an option to sort interests in the price sheet either alphabetically (sorted by entity name, term) or by interest entry date/time (e.g., the most recent at the top). A workspace level option may be provided to enable depth for traders. When this option is checked on, both interactive and view-only traders may be able to view the depth on any interest displayed within the workspace.</p>
<p id="p-0440" num="0439">On both the workspace and price sheet configuration pages, a Save button may be provided to save changes without closing the dialog box. Pressing the Done button on any page may save any as yet unsaved settings and close the dialog box and exit. The Cancel button may be configured to close the dialog box without saving the settings.</p>
<p id="p-0441" num="0440">Each price sheet may show all of the interests defined within it, that is, the display may be automatically adjusted. Within a workspace that includes multiple price sheets, the user may not resize individual price sheets or columns within any price sheet. Within such workspaces, the width of each column may be set to that of the widest price sheet within it. The Tab key may be used to navigate from one price sheet to another within a workspace. The movement may be top-down within the current workspace column and left-right from column to column. The Shift-Tab key combination may allow the user to move in the reverse direction and the arrow keys may be configured so that only movement within a price sheet between relevant columns may be enabled. Hence, the other columns may be skipped over.</p>
<p id="p-0442" num="0441">Within price sheets that have the Aggregate orders per price level option checked, all traders may be shown aggregated posted quotes. In this regard, display rules may apply relating to the depth display for traders. In particular, if the trader's currently selected workspace has the Enable depth for traders option checked, the depth button and mouse-menu option may be enabled. If the Enable depth for traders option is unchecked, then the button and mouse-menu option may be disabled for all traders only, and may have no impact on broker functionality. When depth is enabled, traders may see individual posted orders within the depth as brokers do, however, they may not view the customer codes or unposted orders. In the depth view, traders may see only the bid size, bid, offer and offer size for posted bids and offers. When depth is enabled, traders may view both the floating as well as inline depth.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Quick History</p>
<p id="p-0443" num="0442"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref> shows an exemplary illustration of the Quick History dialog box <b>5400</b>, which may be invoked, for example, by double clicking the Entity field in the workspace, selecting a new Quick interest icon in the toolbar, selecting a right click menu item labeled Quick History, or pressing the new &#x2018;Q&#x2019; keyboard shortcut.</p>
<p id="p-0444" num="0443">The exemplary Quick History dialog box <b>5400</b> includes a filter area that allow users to select an entity to be pre-populated with the currently selected entity (if there is one) when the user opens the dialog box. If there is no pre-selected entity when this dialog is opened, the user may select an entity from a drop-down list and submit the query. The filter area also allows users to select a number of records to return for trades and prices.</p>
<p id="p-0445" num="0444">The filter area further allows users to select all terms or limit the search to a specific fixed term. The default is 5 years and may be set when the window is opened. Changes to the default term may not be saved when the window is opened and closed. Selecting a checkbox may deselect the other terms. Hence, it may not be required to select multiple terms. In this regard, a radio button may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0446" num="0445">The exemplary Quick History dialog box <b>5400</b> includes a statistics area which displays statistics for the 5Y CDS for the selected entity, irrespective of the term chosen. In particular, the statistics area displays the last trade, the last bid, and the last offer, as well as the 52-week high and low. In this regard, the statistic area may be configured according to the type of user, that is, for example, whether the user is a broker or an external user. More specifically, in terms of the last trade, brokers may see a concatenated string with [date] [buyerclient] &#x2018;buys from&#x2019; [sellerclient] &#x2018;&#x2212;&#x2019; [size] [term] [debttype] [restruct] [maturity] [FX] and external users may see concatenated string with [date] &#x2018;&#x2212;&#x2019; [size] [term] [debttype] [restruct] [maturity] [FX]. In terms of last bid, brokers may see concatenated string with [date] [bidclient] &#x2018;&#x2212;&#x2019; [size] [term] [debttype] [restruct] [maturity] [FX]. In terms of the last offer, brokers may see a concatenated string with [date] [offerclient] &#x2018;&#x2212;&#x2019; [size] [term] [debttype] [restruct] [maturity] [FX], and external users may see a concatenated string with [date] &#x2018;&#x2212;&#x2019; [size] [size] [term] [debttype] [restruct] [maturity] [FX].</p>
<p id="p-0447" num="0446">The exemplary Quick History dialog box <b>5400</b> includes a History area which displays traders to the left and prices to the right, and may be configured according to the type of user, that is, for example, whether the user is broker or an external user. In particular, in terms of traders, brokers may see the format [buyclient] &#x2018;buys from&#x2019; [sellclient] &#x2018;&#x2212;&#x2019;[size] [term] [debttype] [restruct] [maturity] [FX], and external users may see the format of [size] [term] [debttype] [restruct] [maturity] [FX]. Likewise, for prices, brokers may see the format of [bidclient] [bid] or [offer] [offerclient] and concatenated [size] [term] [debttype] [restruct] [maturity] [FX].</p>
<p id="p-0448" num="0447">The History area may also include horizontal and vertical scrollbars that are displayed only if the grid is larger than the display size allowed by the window size. The other parts of the window may not have scrollbars. The History area may not update automatically, but rather may only update when the Lookup button is pressed or when the window first opens. When the user submits a new query, an hourglass icon may be shown until the records are returned. The configurable logo may be positioned in the top right of the window, and cut and paste from the Quick History screen may be restricted. When a user presses the Lookup button for an entity, the name of the entity may be shown in the 3 title areas of statistics, trades and prices.</p>
<p id="p-0449" num="0448">The Quick History dialog box <b>5400</b> may be resizable, maximisable, minimisable and/or non-modal. If there is not enough data to display, e.g., there are only 3 trades in the database and 20 rows were selected for display, then the rows may simply be empty. The window may be kept open. Having multiple Quick History windows open may be prohibited and unposted prices may not be shown in Quick History dialog box <b>5400</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Hot Keys for the in-Line and Floating Depth Displays</p>
<p id="p-0450" num="0449">A &#x3c;ctr&#x3e; key combination may be used as a toggle command to open and close the floating depth instead of the current d hotkey, which may alternatively be used for the in-line depth. The &#x3c;Esc&#x3e; key may also close the window.</p>
<p id="p-0451" num="0450">The d hotkey may be used as a toggle to open and close the in-line depth instead of the current +/&#x2212; hotkeys, which may alternatively be used for opening the update dialog box. In this regard, the above-discussed may be functional for traders only within workspaces that have enabled depth for traders.</p>
<p id="p-0452" num="0451">The +/&#x2212; hotkeys may enable users to quickly adjust the selected price up or down by a tick. The &#x2018;+&#x2019; key may result in the opening of the update dialog with the selected price adjusted up by a single tick while the &#x2018;&#x2212;&#x2019; key may perform the same and may automatically adjust the selected price down by a single tick. The user may submit the change by pressing enter or clicking the Submit button. In addition, both + and &#x2212; on the main keyboard, as well as on the numeric keypad, may also have this behavior.</p>
<p id="p-0453" num="0452">According to an exemplary embodiment, standing orders may be automatically held and/or cancelled when a better price is submitted by a rival trader, or when an execution takes place against another order for that interest. In this regard, checkbox options may be provided at the entity level so that when the bid/offer is bested by another bid/offer, it is automatically held or when another bid/offer is executed, the order is automatically held. In regards to the price entry dialog, checkbox options may also be provided, however, when checked on a bid, the order may be cancelled if a higher firm bid is submitted or when checked on an offer, the order be cancelled if a lower firm offer is submitted.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Permanent Interests</p>
<p id="p-0454" num="0453">According to an exemplary embodiment, a checkbox labeled &#x201c;Permanent Interest&#x201d; may be provided, for example, in an interest creation dialog box in the CTS. In this regard, permanent interests may not be removed during the overnight end of day process. However, the prices for permanent interests may be held.</p>
<p id="p-0455" num="0454">According to an exemplary embodiment, the price entry dialog may include a hit/lift button. When pressed, the bid/offer are entered into the market, and the Hit/Lift Dialog opens with a buyer and seller pre-selected from the values entered in the Bid/Offer dialog of the Price entry dialog box.</p>
<p id="p-0456" num="0455"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref> shows an exemplary 1-step trading price entry dialog box <b>5500</b>, which simplifies the user interface, and defines an aggressor without the need to add checkboxes, etc. In this manner, an interest may be created and traded in a succession of, for example, 3 dialog boxes. When Hit or Lift are clicked from the exemplary price dialog box <b>5500</b>, a Hit or Lift dialog pops up pre-populated with a bid price, bid size, seller info, buy info, etc. Delta hedge settings and post setting may be used from the price dialog box. No other bid or offer may be posted at this time. In the Hit/Lift dialog box the user may select and deselect other trade related options, change the underlying price or size if required. When Hit or Lift is clicked in the subsequent Hit/Lift dialog box then a bid and offer is posted to the portal. The same bid and offer may be shown in the activity log and the trade may be registered in CTC and CTS (last trade, trade log, etc.)</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">End-of-Day Process</p>
<p id="p-0457" num="0456">The End-of-Day process may run by site for a reference transaction date, which may be set to the current business day. The timing for running this process may be configurable in the database for each site. The trading day start and end times may be stored in a site table so that at least the end time may be used for the End-of-Day process. In this regard, the trading start/end times may be set in GMT. The process may run twice daily&#x2014;once for Asia (e.g., Sydney+Hong Kong), and the second time for New York and London, for example. Users need not be required to log out when this process runs. Instead the following warning may be given in the status bar for relevant site(s): &#x201c;End-of-day&#x201d; process in progress, which may disappear when the process is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0458" num="0457">During run time, the End-of-Day process may hold all active prices posted by the selected site (e.g., broker's site) with a transaction date equal to or earlier than the date for which the process is being run. The process may also hold all non-permanent interests without active prices and permanently delete held prices with transaction dates that are earlier than the preceding business day. All held prices from the current business day may be retained in the order book in a held state so that the next morning brokers may see what they were working on the preceding day. The desktops of logged-in users may be refreshed with any updates to the workspace/price sheet configurations. Pop ups may be provided, which include the following message pup up for all logged in users: &#x2018;As part of the EOD process, your desktop will be refreshed with latest workspace/price sheet updates. Please press &#x3c;ENTER&#x3e; or press [OK] to continue or [SKIP] to wait until the next business day or your next login.&#x2019; The popup may present the user with two response buttons [OK] and [SKIP]. If there is no response from the user within 10 seconds, for example, OK is assumed and the updates are propagated to the client machine. If the user selects [SKIP] the changes are not propagated. The changes may then either go through at the user's next login or the next time the End-Of-Day progress runs.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">Interactive Order Management</p>
<p id="p-0459" num="0458">Selected traders may interactively manage their own orders via the CTS user interference. In this regard, interactive order management may be enabled primarily for the CDS indices. In particular, a setting &#x201c;The Entity Access Level&#x201d; may be configured with Entity-Product Line defaults, so that certain types of trading may be permitted by entity name, including, for example, &#x201c;Voice Only&#x201d;, &#x201c;View Only&#x201d;, &#x201c;Semi-Interactive&#x201d;, and &#x201c;Interactive&#x201d;. For Voice Only trading, prices and executions related to this entity may not be displayed/published for traders. However, traders may view the details of trades for their own institution in the trade book. For View Only trading, traders may view prices and executions for this entity, but may not interactively maintain their orders or execute trades in this name. Only brokers may have the ability to add, change, remove or execute on the prices. For Semi-Interactive trading, traders may maintain their own orders/prices for interests in this name. However, they may execute trades interactively. For Interactive trading traders may both maintain their own orders/prices for interests in this name, and select bids/offers for execution. In addition to the entity access level, an Interactive Trader role may be created for users, which allows them to interactively manage their orders. Only users with this role may interactively manage orders for entities with either a Semi-Interactive or Interactive Access Level.</p>
<p id="p-0460" num="0459">Trader functionality may be enabled or disabled in accordance with the trader role and the Entity Access Level. In particular, for entities with a Voice Only access level, the display of interests, prices and trades may be disabled everywhere except in the trade book. Hence, traders may not see any information on these entities within price sheets, the trade and activity logs and the order book. For entities with a View Only access level, interests, prices and trades may be displayed everywhere. The interest, price, update, hit, lift, hold, post, and depth functions may be disabled for traders. For entities with Semi-Interactive or Interactive access levels, interests, prices and trades may be displayed everywhere, and the certain functions, such as, for example, &#x201c;price&#x201d;, &#x201c;bid&#x201d;, &#x201c;offer&#x201d;, &#x201c;hold&#x201d;, &#x201c;update&#x201d;, &#x201c;+&#x201d; and &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d;, may be enabled only for Interactive Traders (that is, users with an Interactive Trader role).</p>
<p id="p-0461" num="0460">In this regard, for non-interactive traders, entities with Semi-Interactive or Interactive access levels may be treated the same as those with a View Only access level. In the price entry dialog, the bid &#x26; offer company may default to the trader's own site, and the selection list may be limited to sites for the trader's own institution only. Multi-legged interests may follow the most conservative display route and take the lowest functional common denominator. For example, if in a switch, one entity is Voice Only and the other is Interactive, then the structure may inherit the most restrictive level of access, which in this instance may be Voice Only. No activity should show up in the Activity Log for Voice Only entities, and no activity should show up in the Trade Log for Voice Only Trades. Within the trade book, traders may view the details of all their trades, even those involving Voice Only entities.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Inverted Markets</p>
<p id="p-0462" num="0461">To prevent the user from entering an inverted market, the system may check whether a price entered or updated by a trader results in an inverted posted market. The check may occur after the trader submits the price but before the price is displayed on screen. In this regard, if a new posted bid is higher than the highest posted offer, then a warning may appear. The warning message may read, for example, &#x201c;your action will create an inverted market. Do you wish to continue and display an inverted market? [Yes] [No]&#x201d;, where selecting [yes] may submit or post the price, and selecting [no] ignores the action.</p>
<p id="p-0463" num="0462">When a price is firmed from the orderbook resulting in an inverted market, orderbook may the price is not finned in the order book and a warning is displayed. If multiple prices are being firmed from the orderbook, those prices that would have generated an inverted market are not firmed in the order book. The other prices may be firmed. A warning may appear once if there are one or more prices that are not re-submitted due to the inverted market conditions being triggered. The warning message for inverted firms from the orderbook may be &#x201c;some price updates you have submitted would have created an inverted market and have been ignored for your protection. Please check the orderbook for un-submitted prices. [OK]&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0464" num="0463">Traders may receive an inverted market warning only when a firm posted price creates an inverted market when compared with the best firm posted price on the opposite side. Brokers may receive an inverted market warning whenever any firm price (posted or unposted) creates an inverted market when compared with the best firm price (posted or unposted) on the opposite side.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">New MyPrices Area in PriceSheets</p>
<p id="p-0465" num="0464">A set of optional pricesheet columns and toolbar controls collectively referred to as the MyPrices area, may enable users to see and maintain within a single pricesheet view, a particular trader's quotes next to the market on the listed interests within that pricesheet. The other existing pricesheet columns may be referred to as the MarketPrices area</p>
<p id="p-0466" num="0465">The MyPrices area may provide users the ability to view the market prices side by side with the selected trader's prices on the same interests, and the ability to see the price and/or size of the selected trader's quotes (best bid and best offer) for the interests listed within the pricesheet, including held and unposted orders, when applicable, and the ability to carry out basic order management tasks for the selected trader very quickly, without having to use dialog boxes (e.g., by typing in the order prices and sizes directly into the pricesheet cells). Brokers may be provided with the ability to distinguish between prices entered or last updated by a broker versus a trader.</p>
<p id="p-0467" num="0466"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref> shows an exemplary broker view of price information for the My Prices area. Here, the broker may see in one place where the market is pricing the listed interests, and where the selected trader is providing prices on those interests, as well as a consolidated place to manage standard orders for that trader very quickly without having to use the dialog box.</p>
<p id="p-0468" num="0467"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref> shows an exemplary trader view of price information for the My Prices area. Here, the trader may see in one place where the market is pricing the listed interests, where he/she is providing prices on those interests, as well as a consolidated place to manage standard orders very quickly without having to use the dialog box.</p>
<p id="p-0469" num="0468">The broker and/or trader view of the My Prices columns may display the size and/or price of the trader's best bid or offer, and may include dropdown controls to select, for example, a particular trader, site, or order size that is to be displayed and maintained in the My Prices area.</p>
<p id="p-0470" num="0469">According to an exemplary embodiment, the Hold button holds just the single price in focus and may be actionable by clicking the &#x3c;Delete&#x3e; key. When a held price is selected within the My Prices columns, the label of the Hold button may change to [Firm]. Clicking on this button may firm just the single price in focus. [Firm] may also be actionable by clicking the &#x3c;insert&#x3e; key. The Hold/Firm button label may change depending on whether the price selected is firm or held.</p>
<p id="p-0471" num="0470">According to an exemplary embodiment, the brokers view of the My Prices area may only show the trader's best price in each interest, which may be either posted, unposted or held. If the trader has at least one firm price on an interest, then the best firm price may be displayed even if it is unposted. If the trader has no firm prices, but at least one held price on an interest, then the best held price may be displayed. The price and size of each firm order (posted or unposted) that was either entered or last updated by a broker may appear in bold black font. The prize and size of each held order will appear in normal (non-bold) grey font.</p>
<p id="p-0472" num="0471">According to an exemplary embodiment, the broker and trader views of the My Prices area and orders where the price has a condition may be displayed with an &#x201c;*&#x201d; sign as a superscript on the left side of the price. Instead of the subscript u for up-front prices, and the superscript &#x394; for delta hedge, the information may be included in a tool tip function. In this regard, an order details tool tip may appear when the user hovers over the size or price of any bid or offer.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">Manual Flash Toggle</p>
<p id="p-0473" num="0472">According to an exemplary embodiment, the broker may quickly indicate a trade on a price to the external users without waiting for the time it would take to fill in the necessary counterparty and other details on the execution. This may be done, for example, by flashing the affected price immediately so that traders may know that the price is no longer available. A toggle function may be provided for brokers to manually turn flashing on or off on a selected price. In this regard, the manual flash toggle may be accessible via a Lightbulb icon or an F hotkey, and when invoked, the bid/offer size and price columns of the currently selected interest may start (or stop) flashing. To turn flashing on (or off) for the bid side only, the focus may be required to be on either the price or size of the bid. The same may be required for the offer. The toggle function may be disabled when the focus is not on the price or size of a bid or an offer, and the flashing may appear like that of an execution in the Last Trade column. Once turned on, the flashing may continue indefinitely until it is toggled off via the icon or hotkey. The removal of the flashing price(s) from the market as a result of cancellation or execution may also stop the flashing.</p>
<p id="p-0474" num="0473">According to an exemplary embodiment, to improve readability of sizes and prices in price sheets, the size and price of each firm order may be displayed in a darker or bolder font within price sheet columns. For more efficient space utilization, the blank spaces on either side of the &#x2018;+&#x2019; sign may be removed when displaying up-front prices with running points. When the unit of size is millions, a &#x201c;MM&#x201d; may not be displayed in the size columns after the actual size. When the unit is anything other than &#x201c;MM&#x201d;, it may be displayed after the size as it is currently.</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">Timed Orders</p>
<p id="p-0475" num="0474">According to an exemplary embodiment, users may be able to credit timed orders that will time out or expire automatically after the specified period. In this regard, users may be given the ability to create timed orders that will &#x2018;time out&#x2019; or expire after a specified period of time so the system may automatically hold these orders when their time runs out. In this regard, the timeout value may be specified in terms of minutes and may be added to all bids and offers, and a setting of zero indicates no timeout, that is, an order with a zero timeout value will be a GTC (Good-Till-Canceled) order. Default timeout preference setting may be provided which may be set to zero for all users on implementation, but may be set to a non-zero value by the user and this value may then be saved along with the user's other desktop settings. All posted orders created by the user may have their timeout set to the value specified as the Default Timeout. This includes all orders created in the MyPrices area. Non-posted orders may default to a zero timeout regardless of the Default Timeout setting, and brokers may need to type in the desired timeout on non-posted orders. The user may override the default or existing timeout value when creating or updating orders via the Price dialog. When an existing order is updated, it's timeout may be reset to the default value, which may also apply to orders updated in the MyPrices area. For example, if the size of an order with a default 10-minute timeout is changed when there are 3 minutes remaining before it's expiration, the order may be updated with the new size and a new timeout of 10 minute. The user may change the reset timeout as desired before submitting the order via the Price dialog. When a posted order is unposted via the Unpost option, it's timeout may be set to zero by default, but again the user may override it via the Update dialog as desired. However, if an order is unposted via the update dialog box, it's timeout may be reset to the default as for all other updates. An Extend option may be provided via the right-click mouse menu and the E hotkey so the user may reset the timeout on an existing posted order to the default without using the Price dialog or in the MyPrices area. For example, if the user wants to reset the timeout on an order with 3 minutes until it expires to the default value of 10 minutes, s/he may focus on that order and click on the Extend menu option or use the E hotkey to do it without having to update it via the Price dialog. In this regard, the Extend option may not apply to held or unposted orders.</p>
<p id="p-0476" num="0475">When a held order is firmed, it's timeout may be set to the default value and the user may be required to override the default in the price dialog. Changing the timeout on an existing order may not affect the order's ranking in the queue</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">Order Management in and with the MyPrices Area</p>
<p id="p-0477" num="0476">According to an exemplary embodiment, the MyPrices area in pricesheets may allow the viewing, input, editing, holding, and firming of prices without the use of dialog boxes, that is, users may carry out basic order management tasks by typing in key order details directly into the relevant price sheet cells. Brokers and traders may add, update and delete orders directly within the relevant price sheet cells based on the rules. For example, direct cell editing may be enabled only within the MyPrices area, that is, only within these four price sheet columns of My Bid Size, My Bid, My Offer, and My Offer Size. Therefore, direct cell editing may not be permitted in pricesheets that do not include any of the above columns. Since the user may be required to select the trader and site when working in the MyPrices area, direct cell editing may only be enabled for the orders of one trader at a time. Editing may be limited to just the price and size of any order, so that the user may only add basic standard posted orders without special conditions and updates may be limited to just those two fields. When editing an existing order via direct cell input, any data other than the price, size, status (firm/held) or posting status, may remain unaffected by an update&#x2014;e.g., conditions, hedge flag.</p>
<p id="p-0478" num="0477">Navigation and parsing rules for in-cell editing may be like those that apply in Excel. For example, the user may use the certain keys to navigate from cell to cell, in which &#x3c;Enter&#x3e; may enable vertical movement downwards, &#x3c;Shift&#x3e;&#x3c;Enter&#x3e; may enable vertical movement upwards, &#x3c;Tab&#x3e; may enable movement to the next pricesheet, and &#x3c;Shift&#x3e;&#x3c;Tab&#x3e; may enable movement to the previous pricesheet. The four arrow keys may enable movement in the direction of each arrow. If a cursor is at the top, bottom, rightmost or leftmost column in a pricesheet, no further movement in the direction of the arrow may be permitted.</p>
<p id="p-0479" num="0478">The editable cells may accept only the certain key values to represent the order size and price, including, for example, the numeric characters: 0 through 9, and one period or decimal point. In addition, to allow for the input/maintenance of up-front prices, the My Bid and My Offer cells may accept a &#x2018;+&#x2019; sign only when it is preceded by at least one numeric character. Certain special keys may be supported for in-cell editing of price and size data. For example, the space bar to clear the contents of a cell, &#x3c;Backspace&#x3e; to make corrections or blank out entered data while the user is in the midst of inputting data in a cell, + to tick up the existing price by one basis point or percent (only when it is used before typing any other valid character into the cell), &#x2212; to tick down the existing price by one basis point or percent (only when it is used before typing any other valid character into the cell).</p>
<p id="p-0480" num="0479">Certain special keys may be used for managing order status. For example, the &#x3c;Delete&#x3e; key may hold the selected firm order, and the &#x3c;Insert&#x3e; key may firm the selected held order. A &#x2018;+&#x2019; typed in as the first character within a populated price cell may be interpreted as the increment command and may tick the existing price up. A &#x2018;+&#x2019; typed in as the first character within an un-populated price cell may be ignored as an invalid entry. A &#x2018;+&#x2019; typed in after a number within a price cell, may be interpreted as part of the price. In this regard, if the interest is an up-front interest, the number preceding the &#x2018;+&#x2019; may be taken as the upfront price in %, and any number entered after the &#x2018;+&#x2019; may become the running points. If there is no number following the &#x2018;+&#x2019;, the running points will be set to zero. If the interest is not an up-front interest, the number preceding the &#x2018;+&#x2019; may be taken as the price in basis points, and the &#x2018;+&#x2019; as well as any characters following the &#x2018;+&#x2019; may be ignored. In-cell editing mode may be enabled when the user places his/her focus on an editable cell, and may be invoked as soon as the user types in a valid character as outlined above, provided that there is no related dialog box open at the time. If the user types in an invalid character (alpha or other special characters, including hotkeys) once in-cell editing mode has been invoked, a beep may sound and the invalid character may be ignored. A newly typed-in value may replace the previous content of the cell upon its submission when the user exits the edited cell. When an existing held and/or unposted order is updated via in-cell editing, it may be replaced by a firm posted order. To submit the value entered in a cell, the user may use one of the navigation keys or key combinations above to exit the cell and move to a different cell, or shift the focus elsewhere using a mouse. When editing a cell, if the focus is lost as a result of the user clicking on a button or a menu option, whatever the user has typed into the cell may be submitted as the new value. To cancel editing mode once it has been invoked within a cell, the user may be required to press the &#x3c;Esc&#x3e; key to restore the cell's previous contents. Hence, clicking on the &#x3c;Esc&#x3e; key may be the only way to invalidate a value input into the cell while the focus is still on the cell. On a new order, if the user types in a price without typing in a size, the size may default to the value selected in the Size dropdown within the MyPrices menubar. Blanking out the price or size may be treated the same as the &#x3c;Delete&#x3e; key, that is, it will result in holding the order.</p>
<p id="p-0481" num="0480">According to an exemplary embodiment, orders that are either created or updated via direct cell input may not be sent to the server until the entry or change is submitted as described above (i.e., after exiting the cell or changing focus). When a value entered into a cell is submitted, the server may validate and process as if the value were entered in the Price dialog and all of the validation rules would apply, including checks for inverted markets, price variation, etc. After the order has been validated, it may be published to all clients and appear in both the MarketPrices and MyPrices (where applicable) areas as a normal order created/updated via the Price dialog. When creating a new order via direct cell input, the order may be created only after a price has been submitted. That is, if the user has entered a size and not yet entered a price, nothing will be sent to the server until a price has been entered. However, a price may be entered without specifying a size, in which case the size may be assumed to be the default value selected in the MyPrices Size dropdown control. When the size of an existing order is updated via direct cell input, the server may process the entry by updating the size on the existing order without changing the position of that order in the queue. When the price of an existing order is updated via direct cell input, the server may process the entry by holding the previous order and replacing it with a new one, so the order's previous queue position may not remain the same. When a change to either the price or size of an existing held order is submitted via direct cell input, the server may process the entry as a firm order. That is, the order may automatically be firmed with the updated details. When a change to either the price or size of an existing unposted order is submitted via direct cell input, the server may process the entry as a posted order. That is, the order may automatically be posted with the updated details.</p>
<p id="h-0021" num="0000">Firm Toggle for Hold Function</p>
<p id="p-0482" num="0481">According to an exemplary embodiment, the [HOLD] button and mouse-menu option may serve a dual purpose. For example, the user may either hold a firm price or firm a held price, or may toggle between hold and firm depending on the current focus. In this regard, when the focus is on a firm price, the button/option label may read [HOLD] and clicking on it may result in firming the selected held price. When the focus is on an empty cell, the button/option may be displayed.</p>
<p id="h-0022" num="0000">Hold All Function</p>
<p id="p-0483" num="0482">According to an exemplary embodiment, a Hold All button may operate to hold multiple firm prices. In this regard, the Hold All button may be invoked via the &#x3c;ctr&#x3e;&#x3c;delete&#x3e; key option and may remain red with white letters: Accordingly, all the firm prices may be held for the selected trader (via the Trader filter) in the current workspace, which includes prices in the depth.</p>
<p id="h-0023" num="0000">Firm All Function</p>
<p id="p-0484" num="0483">A Firm All button may be provided to firm up multiple held prices from the Order Book, which may be invoked via the &#x3c;Ctrl&#x3e;&#x3c;Insert&#x3e; key combination and displayed green with white letters. When invoked, the command may run a canned query in the Order Book to show all of the held orders for the selected trader (via the desktop Trader filter) that were originally submitted on the current business day. The displayed held prices may have their status set to FIRM by default in preparation for the user to submit the update. The user may have the opportunity to make any desired changes before submitting the update to FIRM some, all or none of the displayed prices. All of the edits and validations that apply to newly submitted prices may also apply to prices firmed via this command. That is, the price variance and inverted market checks, etc.</p>
<p id="h-0024" num="0000">Extent Option for Timed Orders</p>
<p id="p-0485" num="0484">According to an exemplary embodiment, users may reset the timeout period on posted orders to the Default Timeout via an Extend Option, which is accessible via the right-click menu and the E hotkey in both the MarketPrices and MyPrices area. In this regard, the user may reset the timeout on an existing posted order to the default without using the Price dialog on the MyPrices area. The Extend option may not apply to held or unposted orders. That is, the option may be disabled when the focus is on a held or unposted price.</p>
<p id="h-0025" num="0000">Encryption of Data</p>
<p id="p-0486" num="0485">According to an exemplary embodiment, all data transmitted between the CTS server and client workstations may be encrypted for security and to protect client confidentiality.</p>
<p id="h-0026" num="0000">Interactive Trader Role</p>
<p id="p-0487" num="0486">Full interactivity may be provided via the Interactive Trader role, which grants traders the right to execute trades only for reference entities with an interactive access level. In this regard, access may be provided not only to a subset of interactive reference entities, but to all entities with an interactive access level, across all sectors and external workspaces.</p>
<p id="h-0027" num="0000">One-Cancels-Others Orders</p>
<p id="p-0488" num="0487">According to an exemplary embodiment, brokers and traders may apply One-Cancels-Others (OCO) conditions to orders, which allow traders to link two or more of their orders so that when one is executed, the other(s) are automatically held. In this regard, there may be only one OCO group for each trader, that is, on the execution of an OCO order for a particular trader, all of that trader's other firm OCO orders may be held (canceled). A preference checkbox for OCO may be provided so that the user may indicate whether OCO is to be checked on or off by default on all new prices created by the user. The OCO checkbox may be provided in the price dialog between the Unit and delta hedge checkbox for both the bid and the offer. New orders created via direct cell input may inherit the default OCO setting for the user. Modification of an OCO condition on an existing order may be enabled only via the Price dialog box or the order book, so that orders updated via the price dialog or direct cell input may retain their original OCO setting regardless of the current default setting. Accordingly, the user may need to explicitly change the OCO setting when updating an order. Held orders may retain their original OCO setting. Brokers may be able to create and update OCO orders on behalf of a trader with certain limitations. Traders may see a superscript of 0 on the right side of their own OCO prices in both the MyPrices as well as the Market Prices areas. Brokers may see the 0 superscript on the right side of their currently selected trader's OCO prices in the MyPrices area only. All of a trader's firm OCO orders may be viewed together on the Order Book via a Show OCO mouse-menu option, which may open up the Order Book and automatically run a pre-defined query for the selected trader.</p>
<p id="h-0028" num="0000">Order Book</p>
<p id="p-0489" num="0488">According to an exemplary embodiment, for more effective management of multiple orders (especially held and OCO prices), the Order Book may include certain features described below.</p>
<p id="p-0490" num="0489">A workspace filter may be provided, which includes a Today Only checkbox that limits the query to orders originally submitted on the current date only, and a OCO Only checkbox that limits the query to OCO orders only.</p>
<p id="p-0491" num="0490">A Firm All button may be provided to open up the Order Book and automatically run a query showing all of the selected trader's held orders for the current workspace, that were originally submitted on the current system date only (prior days' held orders will be excluded), and a Show OCO mouse menu option may be provided to open up the Order Book, which automatically runs a query showing all of the selected trader's OCO orders (by definition these may be firm orders only).</p>
<p id="p-0492" num="0491">The canned Firm All order book query may be invoked from the workspace &#x3c;Ctrl&#x3e;&#x3c;Insert&#x3e; key combination to open up the order book and display all held orders from the current business day for the currently selected trader and workspace. When invoked by a trader, it may run for the trader himself/herself, and when invoked by a broker, it may run for the trader selected in the trade dropdown. The canned Show OCO order book query may be invoked from the workspace currently in focus via the new Show OCO mouse-menu option or the &#x3c;Ctrl&#x3e;S key combination to open up the order book and display all firm OCO orders for the currently selected trader and workspace. When invoked by a trader, it may run for the trader himself/herself, and when invoked by a broker, it may run for the trader selected in the trader dropdown.</p>
<p id="h-0029" num="0000">Order Size Edit for Interactive Traders</p>
<p id="p-0493" num="0492">According to an exemplary embodiment, the size of any order created or updated by a trader may be required to be a multiple of the default order size for the reference entity. If the trader attempts to create or update an order for a size that does not meet this condition, s/he may be given the following error message: &#x2018;Size should be a multiple of nn MM&#x2019; where nn is the default order size. With direct cell entry, if the selected default size is not a multiple of the entity default size, then the user may receive this error, and may either be required to change the default setting, or use the price dialog in order to create the order.</p>
<p id="h-0030" num="0000">Trade Execution</p>
<p id="p-0494" num="0493">According to an exemplary embodiment, an Interactive Trader may execute a trade by hitting a standing bid, or lifting a standing offer on an entity with an Interactive access level only. Executions in entities with Voice Only, View Only or Semi-Interactive access levels may not be permitted, and the trader may not change the price of the selected bid or offer when submitting the trade</p>
<p id="p-0495" num="0494">The size of the trade may not be a multiple of the default order size for the reference entity (e.g., 25M for an Iboxx IG index, 10M for an Iboxx HY index, 5M for a Corporate name, etc.), provided that it is not greater than the size of the selected bid or offer. If the trader attempts to execute a size that does not meet this condition, s/he may be given the following error message: &#x2018;Size should be a multiple of nn MM&#x2019; where nn is the default order size</p>
<p id="p-0496" num="0495">Whenever an execution is submitted either by a broker or an interactive trader, the broker and/or the two traders involved in the deal may be notified about the success or failure of the trade. In particular, if the execution failed as a result of the price being removed from the market because it was either cancelled or executed by a rival broker/trader, the user submitting the execution may receive the following message: &#x2018;Sorry! Your execution failed&#x2014;the selected price is no longer available&#x2019; If the execution succeeded, only the traders involved on both sides of the deal (even if the execution was submitted by a broker) may be given the trade and counterparty details via a modal trade details popup which may require that it be viewed and acknowledged by the trader within 90 seconds of the execution. As soon as a trade is successfully executed by a broker or a trader, the trade icon may start flashing and counting down from 90 seconds only on the clients for the two traders involved in the deal.</p>
<p id="p-0497" num="0496">The flashing icon alerts the traders when they have traded and flashes the remaining time available for them to click on the icon in order to view the details of the trade, so as not to interrupt the traders' current actions, and provide the trader the opportunity to finish up any in-progress activity before they have to view and acknowledge the trade details. If a trader does not click on the flashing icon within 90 seconds after the execution, the system may pop-up the trade details automatically when the time runs out. To close the pop-up the user may be required to acknowledge the trade either by clicking on the [Ok] button or by pressing &#x3c;Enter&#x3e;. When there is more than one trade for a trader to view, the popups may be stacked one behind the other, and the timer may be set based on the earliest one. After the trader has viewed and acknowledged the first trade, s/he may be presented with the next one, and so on until each stacked trade has been viewed and acknowledge. A non-resizable modal trade details popup may be provided, which includes a system logo that appears on the top left area of the box. A &#x201c;CreditMatch Trade Details heading may appear centered at the top of the box) and certain text may appear below the system logo. For example, for a single CDS: &#x201c;You are party to the following CDS transaction&#x201d;, for a CDS Calendar Spread: &#x201c;You are party to the following CDS Calendar Spread transactions&#x201d;, and for a CDS Switch: &#x201c;You are party to the following CDS Switch transactions&#x201d;.</p>

A button label may read Hide Size when the size columns are visible in the Market prices area, and may read Show Size when the size columns are hidden in the Market prices area. Pressing [Hide Size] may result in the Bid and Offer size columns being removed from the display in every price sheet on the user's desktop that contains those columns. When the size columns are hidden, any columns/price sheets to the right of the hidden size columns may be shifted over to the left so that they cover the space formerly occupied by the size columns. Conversely, when [Show Size] is pressed to redisplay hidden size columns, they may appear in their configured positions within each price sheet on the user's desktop than includes those columns. In this instance, as some columns and/or price sheets may be shifted to the right, the size of each affected price sheet may expand horizontally to make room for the size columns. The Size toggle may not apply to the size columns in the MyPrices area.</p>
<p id="h-0033" num="0000">Toggle for Blotter Columns</p>
<p id="p-0502" num="0501">According to an exemplary embodiment, a toggle function may be provided so that users may show/hide the blotter (a.k.a., the MyPrices area) in all their price sheets. In this regard, the toggle function may be accessible via a button at the top of the main applet window. The button label may read Hide Blotter when the blotter columns are visible in price sheets that include a MyPrices area, and may read Show Blotter when the blotter columns are hidden in price sheets that include a MyPrices area. Pressing [Hide Blotter] may result in the blotter columns being removed from the display in every price sheet on the user's desktop that contains a MyPrices area. When the blotter columns are hidden, any columns and/or pricesheets to the right of the hidden blotter columns may be shifted over to the left so that they cover the space formerly occupied by the blotter columns. Conversely, when [Show Blotter] is pressed to redisplay hidden blotter columns, they may appear in their configured positions within each price sheet on the user's desktop that includes a MyPrices area. In this instance, as some columns and/or price sheets may be shifted to the right, the size of each affected price sheet may expand horizontally to make room for the blotter columns.</p>
<p id="h-0034" num="0000">Content for Trader Trade Log</p>
<p id="p-0503" num="0502">According to an exemplary embodiment, for traders, the trade log may now include messages for trades that were executed interactively, as well as trades involving other traders from their own company. More specifically, in addition to their own trades, each trader may also see messages for trades that involve any site from their own institution, plus trades executed interactively by any trader if they relate to interests within the trader's selected workspace/s. However, counterparty names may not be shown in the messages for interactive trades that do not involve a trader's own institution. Trade messages that do not involve the trader himself may appear in black font, whereas those involving the trader himself may appear in green font.</p>
<p id="h-0035" num="0000">Market Display of Work-Ups</p>
<p id="p-0504" num="0503">According to an exemplary embodiment, during a work-up, the executed bid/offer may be highlighted, but not removed from the market, although it may no longer be available for execution by another user. In this regard, for the duration of a work-up, the price and size cells of the executed bid/offer may be flashed with a pale red background, like the one used to flash the last trade column. The flashing may indicate to all users that the highlighted price was executed, and that the trade is potentially being worked up interactively. The executed price may not be removed from the market until the work-up is terminated, however, it will no longer be available for execution by another user. No other user may hit or lift on the interest for the duration of the work-up. Users may enter and update prices on the interest during the work-up. Upon termination of the work-up, the quote may be updated to reflect the best bid and offer in the market for the interest at that point.</p>
<p id="h-0036" num="0000">Unfilled Work-Up in Broker</p>
<p id="p-0505" num="0504">According to an exemplary embodiment, for brokers, the trade log may include a message that may inform of any left over unfilled size from a trader's specified work-up. In this regard, during a work-up, when one counterparty submits an increased size that is in excess of that specified by the other counterparty, an unfilled work-up message may appear at the end of the work-up, within the trade log of every broker who has subscribed to a workspace that includes that interest. The message may include the time when the work-up was terminated will be displayed in hh:mm:ss format. The short name of the site of the trader with the excess size will be shown after the timestamp, and the name of the trader with the excess size will appear after the site short name. If the trader with the excess size was the buyer, then the term BUYS MORE may appear after the trader's name. If the trader with the excess size was the seller, then the term SELLS MORE will appear after the trader's name. In this regard, the market name of the entity on the interest may appear after the work-up direction, and the code for the interest's debt class may appear after the market name of the entity. Moreover, the interest term may appear after the debt class, the unfilled excess size may appear after the interest term, and the execution price preceded by an @ may appear after the unfilled size.</p>
<p id="h-0037" num="0000">Trader-Level Timeout</p>
<p id="p-0506" num="0505">According to an exemplary embodiment, the current timed order functionality may be provided with a single timeout setting per trader. Hence, instead of having a separate timeout setting per order, each trader may optionally set a global timeout applicable to all of his/her firm posted orders. In this regard, the timeout setting may be specified and displayed via a single editable field, which may appear at the top of the main applet window between the default size drop-down, and the icon bar. When the user's focus is in this field, it may be enabled for editing, allowing the user to modify the current setting. When the focus is away from this field, it may display a countdown of the timeout setting. In this regard, the user may also specify the desired timeout value by placing his/her focus in the timeout field, which may switch it to edit mode. Pressing any key may clear the current contents of the field. The left and right arrow keys may enable navigation within the fields. The user may specify the new/changed timeout value either in terms of hours and minutes in the format hh:mm, or in terms of minutes only, since seconds may not be allowed in edit mode. Only the certain characters may be accepted as input, such as, for example, space, the numeric digits 0-9 and a single &#x201c;:&#x201d;. A blank value may indicate that there is no timeout set. When not blank, the first character entered may be required to be a numeric digit. A single &#x201c;:&#x201d; may be specified when preceded by 1 or 2 numeric characters. The maximum number of hours accepted may be 12. When preceded by hours and a &#x201c;:&#x201d;, the maximum number of minutes accepted may be 59. When not preceded by hours, the maximum number of minutes accepted may be 720. The timeout setting may take effect when the user tabs out of the field or changes focus using the mouse, which will switch the field from edit mode to display mode.</p>
<p id="p-0507" num="0506">In display mode, a timeout display field may show a real-time countdown of the current timeout to the nearest second (format hh:mm:ss). This countdown may commence as soon as the field switches from edit to display mode. The timeout setting may be applicable to traders only, the timeout setting may apply to all firm posted prices across all workspaces that are owned by the trader, including those entered or last updated by a broker on behalf of the trader. Unposted prices may not be subject to the timeout, as they may not be maintained by the trader himself. When the timeout setting countdown reaches zero, all the of trader's firm prices in the system may be automatically held&#x2014;in essence it may be akin to the trader doing a Hold All for all workspaces. The end-of-day process may hold all the relevant prices regardless of any timeout settings at that point in time. Hence, the timeout setting may be ignored at that point.</p>
<p id="h-0038" num="0000">Multiple OCO Groups Per Trade</p>
<p id="p-0508" num="0507">According to an exemplary embodiment, each trader may be assigned up to 10 different OCO groups so that the user may create multiple sets of linked OCO orders. In this regard, instead of a single set of OCO prices for each trader, multiple OCO order groups per trader may be provided by assigning a specific OCO group id to each OCO order. An OCO drop-down may be provided in the main applet window for the selection of a default OCO group, which may appear to the right of the Default Size at the top of the main applet window. The OCO selection list may include a blank setting for no OCO default, as well as the letters a through j, which may represent the OCO groups assigned to each trader. The user may use type-ahead functionality to specify the OCO group instead of selecting it from the list. All new prices created by the user may inherit the currently selected default OCO group. The OCO group ids on existing orders may not be affected by changes to the OCO default setting, even when updating or holding those orders.</p>
<p id="p-0509" num="0508">Within the price dialog, an OCO drop-down may be provided, which includes a blank setting for no OCO default, as well as the letters a through j, to represent the ten OCO groups. The user may use type-ahead functionality to specify the OCO group instead of selecting it from the list. When adding new orders, the OCO group on both the bid and offer may be preset to the default OCO group.</p>
<p id="p-0510" num="0509">Within the Order Book, drop-downs may also be provided, including a &#x201c;OCO Filter drop-down&#x201d; to display certain OCO orders, and an OCO Column drop-down to display the current OCO group for each displayed order. A pre-defined Show OCO Order Book query may be provided to run for an OCO filter setting of ALL to show all firm OCO orders in the system for the selected trader. However, the OCO filter may be enabled for the selection of a specific OCO group should the user wish to limit the query to all firm orders linked to just one of the selected trader's OCO groups. In this regard, the display of OCO orders in price sheets, traders may see their own OCO orders displayed with a superscript denoting the OCO group id to the right of the price, in both the MyPrices as well as the Market Prices areas. Brokers may see their currently selected trader's OCO orders displayed with a superscript denoting the OCO group id to the right of the price, in the MyPrices area only. For example, a bid of 20 that is linked to OCO group d, will appear as 20<sup>d</sup>.</p>
<p id="h-0039" num="0000">Price Variance Check Levels</p>
<p id="p-0511" num="0510">According to an exemplary embodiment, the levels for the high and low price variance checks on the CDS produce line may be set to 10% on either the low or high side. In this regard, the High Price Limit and the Low Price Limit may both be set to 10% for the CDS product line via a database script so that when a user enters a price that varies by 10% or more from last price, the price variance warning will be given.</p>
<p id="h-0040" num="0000">Locked Market for Execution During Work-Ups</p>
<p id="p-0512" num="0511">According to an exemplary embodiment, during a work-up, the market on the affected interest may be locked for subsequent executions. In particular, while a work-up is in progress, no further hits or lifts may be permitted against the interest involved in the work-up. However, users may enter or update bids and offers against that interest during the work-up. The Hit/Lift options may be disabled during a work-up. Upon termination of the work-up, the hit/lift options may be enabled for the appropriate users.</p>
<p id="h-0041" num="0000">2-Way Trade Work-Ups</p>
<p id="p-0513" num="0512">According to an exemplary embodiment, when executing a trade interactively, the initiator as well as the aggressor may be given the option to work-up the size of the trade independently, and then the smaller of the two submitted sizes will be executed, provided that it is equal to or greater than the initial size hit/lifted. In this regard, a new work-up dialog may be presented to both the initiator and aggressor immediately following an interactive execution so the two counterparties may increase the size of the execution subject to certain conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0514" num="0513">In regards to the trade work-up workflow, when a bid/offer is interactively hit/lifted by a trader, both the aggressor and intiator may each immediately receive a timed pop-up displaying the details of the interest, with an option for each counterparty to independently increase the size. The dialog may count down in seconds, the time available for the counterparties to respond&#x2014;the remaining seconds may be displayed prominently in large bold white and red font. The number of seconds available may depend on the work-up duration setting for the entity. Each counterparty may set their preferred total size either by typing it in in the field provided or by ticking it up/down to a multiple of the entity's default size, provided that the selected size is not lower than that originally hit/lifted. An increased size or work-up, may be required to be explicitly submitted by clicking on the [Submit] button or by pressing &#x3c;Enter&#x3e;. If both counterparties respond by submitting a larger size than that initially executed, then the smaller of the two increased sizes may be traded. If one or both counterparties do not respond within the time frame, then the trade may be created for the originally executed size. For the duration of the work-up, the size and price cell of the bid or offer that was executed may flash with a pale red background currently used in the last trade column.</p>
<p id="p-0515" num="0514">During the work-up period, the market on the interest may be locked for execution, but not for order entry, that is, users may be allowed to enter and update orders, but not hit or lift orders in that interest. The work-up may terminate either when both counterparties have responded, or when it times out&#x2014;whichever comes first. The termination of the work-up may finalize the trade, resulting in the removal of the executed bid/offer from the market display, which may unlock the interest for execution. When the trade is finalized, the trade details may be displayed in the trade log, and flashed in the last trade column. Any left over unfilled size from the work-up on either side, may be displayed in broker trade logs via a new message type. For example, if the initiator increased the size from 5MM to 25MM and the aggressor increased it to 15MM, then a total of 15MM may be traded, and brokers may be notified that the initiator desired an additional 10MM. The counterparties may have only one chance to work-up the trade, that is, once the initial work-up times out or is submitted, there may be no further opportunity to work-up that trade.</p>
<p id="p-0516" num="0515">Only interactive traders may receive the work-up pop-up. If the initiator is not an interactive trader, or is not logged on at that time, then only the aggressing trader may receive the pop-up, and the work-up may terminate either when the aggressor responds or when it times out. The work-up dialog may appear as a modal dialog on top of any other type of screen that might be displayed within the designated display area of the work-up.</p>
<p id="p-0517" num="0516">If a counterparty to the trade already has one work-up dialog open, then a subsequent work&#x2014;may not be displayed until the previous one has been dealt with, however the countdown may commence as soon as the original hit/lift is submitted.</p>
<p id="p-0518" num="0517"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 66 and 67</figref> show exemplary illustrations of the work-up dialog. The exemplary Work-Up dialog may include interest description information for each leg of the interest. In particular, the Work-Up dialog may include a label for the leg number (to be displayed only if the interest is a CAL or a SWT), the legal name of the entity on the leg, a code for the debt class of the leg, and a description of the default reference obligation for the entity on the leg will be displayed. The Work-Up dialog may also include the price of the selected bid or offer, and a code for the restructuring type of the leg, the maturity date of the leg, and a countdown present to the interactive work-up duration setting for the entity. For CALs and SWTs, this may be set to the setting of the entity with the shorter duration. The timer may count down the remaining seconds, which may be displayed in large bold font, alternating between white numbers on red background, and red numbers on a white background, from one second to the next to make the flashing more prominent. The Word-Up dialog may also include a total size preset to the size executed via the initial hit/lift action, in which each counterparty may tick this size up in multiples of the entity default size for the selected interest. The user may not be permitted to set the size lower than that of the original hit/lift. [Submit] or &#x3c;Enter&#x3e; or &#x3c;Alt&#x3e;S may submit the work-up for the selected size and close the work-up dialog. &#x3c;Esc&#x3e; or [x] may close the dialog without submitting a work-up.</p>
<p id="p-0519" num="0518">According to an exemplary embodiment, the dialog may be modal, and may take precedence over any other dialog or pop-up that might be open concurrently on the user's desktop. The user may dismiss the dialog either by submitting an increased size for a potential work-up, or by closing the dialog. The dialog may automatically close if the user does not react to it before it times out. There may be only one opportunity for each counterparty to interactively work up a particular trade, that is, the work-up dialog may appear only once for each interactive execution. By default, the dialog may appear in the center of the user's main applet window. If the user re-positions the dialog elsewhere, its changed co-ordinates may be persisted the next time it appears on that user's desktop.</p>
<p id="p-0520" num="0519">Only one work-up dialog may be displayed on a user's desktop at any given point in time, which should correspond to the earliest trade awaiting a work-up response from the user. If the user is counterparty to two or more trades that have triggered concurrent or overlapping work-up processes, the countdown on each may continue even though the user may not be able to view and deal with more than one at a time. In this case, one or more of the subsequent work-ups may expire before the user has had a chance to get to them.</p>
<p id="h-0042" num="0000">Default Reference Obligations on Trade Ticket</p>
<p id="p-0521" num="0520">According to an exemplary embodiment, the trade ticket may show the bond name and ISIN of the default reference obligation/s for the interest. In particular, the bond name and ISIN of the default reference obligation may now appear within the trade ticket for each combination of entity and debt class on the trade as shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</figref>. In this regard, the name of the default reference obligation for the Entity and debt class of each interest leg may be displayed to the right of the label for the Reference Obligation. If there is no default obligation specified for the entity and debt class combination, then the phrase &#x2018;To be agreed. No default ref. ob. available&#x2019; may appear instead. The 12 character ISIN of the default reference obligation may be displayed to the right of the bond name, separated from the bond name by a /. The ISIN may not appear if there is no default reference obligation specified for the entity and debt class combination, or if there is no ISIN for the bond.</p>
<p id="h-0043" num="0000">User Roles By Product Line</p>
<p id="p-0522" num="0521">According to an exemplary embodiment, user reference data maintenance may support the assignment of roles by product line so that user access levels may be set independently for each market. In this regard, user roles may be linked to specific product lines to enable varying levels of user access by market. In particular, user roles may be assigned separately for each product line that the user is entitled to access, and one or more roles for each product line may be selected. The available product lines may be displayed with the list of roles next to each. In particular, the name of the product line may be displayed, along with a list of available roles which may be selected by highlighting the desired roles.</p>
<p id="h-0044" num="0000">Price Sheet Features</p>
<p id="p-0523" num="0522">According to an exemplary embodiment, administrators may configure and organize CDS and IGB price sheets to better address special user needs. In this regard, Default Price Sheet Administration may support the definition and configuration of IGB price sheets, the sorting of interests based on a positional index, and the dynamic horizontal wrapping of price sheets to prevent interest overflow past the bottom of the current application window. Price Sheet Administration may support the creation of price sheets for the IGB product line. A Bond Id column may be provided for IGB as well as CDS. The list of display and default columns may be filtered based on the product line selected.</p>
<p id="p-0524" num="0523">&#x2018;Indexed Price Sheets&#x2019; may be provided so that brokers may control the physical position of each interest, and insert additional label rows in specific positions for grouping and/or organizing those interests. Indexed price sheets, may be enabled via a sort option on the Price Sheet configuration page. An index value may be included that is automatically assigned to each interest, and calculated based on the physical position of each interest. When a new interest is added to an indexed price sheet, the system may insert it below the row that is currently in focus.</p>
<p id="p-0525" num="0524">The interest index may be used for sorting, thus ensuring that interests appear in the desired order based on their original physical placement within the price sheet. If the product view used for the definition of an indexed price sheet includes interests originally added to a non-indexed price sheet, a very high max index value (e.g. 99999) may be assigned to each such index, and as a consequence those interests may appear at the very bottom of the indexed price sheet. Hence, brokers may not control the physical position of any interests appearing within an indexed price sheet that were not originally added to that price sheet. Moreover, brokers may insert and maintain additional label rows to help further group or organize interests within an indexed price sheet. This may be done via a simple dialog. A hotkey combination &#x3c;Ctrl&#x3e;L inserts a new label row below the row currently in focus. A mouse menu may be made available on each such label row to edit label via the same dialog, as well as the deletion of the label row.</p>
<p id="h-0045" num="0000">Wrapped Price Sheets</p>
<p id="p-0526" num="0525">According to an exemplary embodiment, &#x2018;Wrapped Price Sheets&#x2019; may be provided to ensure that interests do not scroll off the bottom of the current application window by horizontally wrapping the interest rows, resulting in two or more price sheet segments stacked side by side. Wrapped Price Sheets may prevent the overflow of interest rows below the lower boundary of the price sheet window. Therefore, a wrapped price sheet by definition may not have any vertical scroll bars. A wrapped price sheet may be set up to optionally display a sequence number at the beginning of each interest row, which may be different from the index used for sorting Indexed Price Sheets. The display of a wrapped price sheet may adjust dynamically to fit the current window size based on the certain rules and limitations. For example, if the number of interests is greater than can fit within the vertical boundaries of the current price sheet window, the price sheet may automatically be split up into two or more segments which are placed side by side horizontally until all of the interests are accommodated within the vertical frame. If the space required to accommodate all of the segments of a wrapped price sheet exceeds the current window width, horizontal scroll bars may be provided so the user may view all of the interests. When row numbers are included, their sequencing may span all of the price sheet segments. For example, if each segment contains 20 interest rows, then the first segment may display row numbers 1-20, segment 2 may display row numbers 21-40, and so on. The wrapping configuration may change each time the user resizes the window. For example, when the window is made shorter, then the number of segments may be increased as necessary. Conversely, when the window is made longer, then the number of segments may be reduced. Wrapped price sheets within multi-price sheet workspaces may have a static physical layout because resizing is disabled in such workspaces. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 69 and 70</figref> show screen shots of one wrapped price sheet automatically adjusted in 2 different configurations based on the window height.</p>
<p id="h-0046" num="0000">Price Sheet Administration</p>
<p id="p-0527" num="0526">According to an exemplary embodiment, the Price Sheet administration user interface may incorporate the IGB product line and some new options. In this regard, the Price Sheet Definition and Configuration pages may be configured to handle one or more new product lines, and may include new options for the creation of wrapped and indexed price sheets. The price sheet definition page may include a product line drop-down to show Investment Grade Bonds as a product line (the list of price sheets displayed in the panel on the left may be filtered to show the existing price sheets for the selected product line), a product view drop-down to show a filtered list of all product views related to the product line selected above, and a list of price sheets available to be used as templates when adding a new price sheet, which is filtered based on the product line selected above. A set of special options may be used to control the behavior of each price sheet, which are mutually exclusive settings enabled via a radio-button type of control. These special options may include, for example, a standard option (default setting), a Free Format Page option, an Enable Dynamic Wrapping option (defines wrapped price sheets without row numbers), and Enable Dynamic Wrapping with row numbers option (defines wrapped price sheets with row numbers). Sorting methods may be provided that sort interests in ascending order solely on the basis of the bond id or market name. Alternatively, bond ids may be sorted alphabetically. The Price Sheet Administration User Interface may be used to create Indexed Price Sheets, which sort interests based on a system-assigned positional index.</p>
<p id="h-0047" num="0000">Workspace Administration</p>
<p id="p-0528" num="0527">According to an exemplary embodiment, Workspace administration may support the creation and configuration of IGB Workspaces, and a customized &#x2018;My Favorites&#x2019; workspace for each user. In this regard, Product Line selection may enable the definition and configuration of IGB workspaces, and a filter may be provided to enable the definition and configuration of &#x2018;My Favorites&#x2019; workspaces. In particular, a product line drop-down may be configured to include Investment Grade Bonds as a product line, and the list of workspaces displayed in the left panel may be filtered to show the existing workspaces for the selected product line.</p>
<p id="p-0529" num="0528">A My Favorites filter may be provided to select a user name from a drop-down list, which may default to blanks, and may have type ahead functionality. When a user name is selected via this filter, the administrator may add, edit, rename or delete the &#x2018;My Favorites&#x2019; workspace for the selected user using the existing functionality on the workspace definition page.</p>
<p id="p-0530" num="0529">Moreover, the list of Available price sheets may be filtered to show only the price sheets for the product line selected on the Workspace Definition page, and all Free Format Pages. When configuring a &#x2018;My Favorites&#x2019; workspace, the list of available price sheets may be limited based on the user's role and access to each product line.</p>
<p id="h-0048" num="0000">IGB Market Display</p>
<p id="p-0531" num="0530">According to an exemplary embodiment, the calculation of the best bid and best offer may depend on how the bond is quoted, and whether or not depth is enabled. In this regard, for a bond that is quoted on a spread basis, if the product line does not have depth enabled (Maintain Depth product line setting is unchecked), then the best bid may be set to the latest bid, and the best offer may be set to the latest offer. Otherwise, if the product line has depth enabled (Maintain Depth product line setting is checked), then the best bid may be set to lowest bid, and the best offer may be set to the highest offer. Likewise, for a bond that is quoted on either a cash or a percent basis, if the product line does not have depth enabled, then the best bid may be set to the latest bid, and the best offer may be set to the latest offer. Otherwise, if the product line has depth enabled, then the best bid will be set to highest bid, and the best offer may be set to the lowest offer.</p>
<p id="p-0532" num="0531">According to an exemplary embodiment, the number of decimals displayed for sizes and prices may depend on the settings for each bond. According to another exemplary embodiment, the display of market depth may depend on the whether or not the product line Maintain Depth setting is checked, and on the quotation method. In particular, if the product line setting for Maintain Depth is unchecked, then the Depth button, mouse-menu option and hotkeys may be disabled as there may always be at most only one bid and one offer in the market for each interest. If the product line setting for Maintain Depth is checked, then the Depth button, mouse-menu option and hotkeys may be enabled when there is depth for the selected interest. The sorting of orders in the depth may depend on how the bond is quoted. For example, for bonds quoted on a spread basis, the lowest bid spread and highest offer spread will appear in the middle, with higher bid spreads in sorted in ascending order below the best bid, and lower offer spreads sorted in descending order above the best offer.</p>
<p id="p-0533" num="0532">According to an exemplary embodiment, quote updates may be flashed for a duration equal to the setting of the Auto Quote Flash Duration for the product line, and trades may be flashed for a duration equal to the setting of the Auto Trade Flash Duration for the product line. In this regard, a duration setting of zero essentially translates into no auto flashing.</p>
<p id="h-0049" num="0000">Workspace Setting Dialog</p>
<p id="p-0534" num="0533">According to an exemplary embodiment, the dialog used for the selection of workspaces may be configured to limit the selection of workspaces made available to users based on their access levels for each product line. In particular, the streamlined workspace settings dialog may be configured so that the user may select multiple options for each available workspace via checkboxes. A workspace may or may not be made available to a user based on that user's access level for each product line represented within the workspace. It may be available to both brokers and traders. In this regard, the user may be entitled to access each product line represented within the workspace via a valid user role, and a workspace that is not enabled for external view may not be made available to non-GFI users.</p>
<p id="p-0535" num="0534"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71</figref> shows an illustration of Workspace Setting Dialog <b>7100</b>, in which the workspace setting dialog box may appear as a tab, and all workspaces available to the user may appear in the row with checkbox options applicable to each workspace. In particular, a Display Tab is provided to indicate whether or not the user wants to view the workspace, a Show Tab in Logs is provided to indicate whether or not the user wants to see messages related to the workspace in the trade and activity logs. Not applicable to IGB workspaces, a Trade alert is provided to indicate whether or not the user wants to see a popup alert every time a trade occurs within the workspace. When this option is checked, a popup containing the details of the trade may be displayed on the user's desktop, and a Counter alert is provided to indicate whether or not the trader wants to see a popup alert when someone posts a price on the opposite side of an interest in that workspace where the trader himself has posted a price, or when someone tops/improves upon that trader's price in an interest within that workspace. A broker may not receive any counter messages, so that when a broker selects this option, no action is taken. When this option is checked by a trader, a popup containing the details of the topping/improved or counter bid/offer will be displayed on the user's desktop. Two up/down arrow icons may appear on the top left of the dialog which allow the user to alter the position/sorting order of the selected workspaces. On initial display, all of the workspaces available to the user may be sorted alphabetically. [Done] or &#x3c;Enter&#x3e; or &#x3c;Alt&#x3e;D may submit the user's workspace settings and close the dialog. [Cancel] or &#x3c;Esc&#x3e; or &#x3c;Alt&#x3e;C or the [X] icon may close the dialog without submitting any changes to the user's current workspace settings.</p>
<p id="p-0536" num="0535">The user may access the Worskspace Settings dialog via an option under the Preferences menu. The current Workspace option may be renamed as Workspace Settings and will open up this new dialog. On display, the focus may be in the first checkbox on the first row. The user may tab across the row and then down to the next and so on, or simply use the arrow keys or the mouse to change focus to a different workspace row. Tabbing across each row all the way down may take the user to the [Done] and [Cancel] buttons after the last workspace row. The desired settings may be submitted by selecting [Done] or pressing &#x3c;Enter&#x3e;, which may close the dialog. The dialog may be closed without making any changes by selecting [Cancel] or pressing &#x3c;Esc&#x3e; or by clicking on the X icon. By default, the dialog may appear in the center of the user's main applet window. If the user re-positions the dialog elsewhere, its changed co-ordinates may be persisted the next time it appears on that user's desktop. The dialog may be sized so that it is not longer than the main applet window frame to ensure that the [Done] button does not appear off screen. Changes to workspace settings may take effect only after the user has submitted them and the dialog is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0537" num="0536">The trade and counter alert popups may have title bars with an exclamation point in a larger bold white font on red (like an icon) followed by the popup title. The alert message formats may be identical to those of the trade and counter messages displayed in the trade and activity logs. The alert popups may be non-modal, and may be dismissed by pressing &#x3c;Enter&#x3e;, [OK], or by clicking on the [X] icon to close the window. If the user receives a new trade or counter alert while another trade or counter alert popup is already open on his desktop, the new message may be added to the existing popup below the previously displayed message/s. Therefore, the display may be similar to that of the logs. However, once the user has closed the popup, it may be cleared, so that the next time it appears, it may only display new messages received after it was last closed.</p>
<p id="h-0050" num="0000">Toggle for Ghost Prices</p>
<p id="p-0538" num="0537">According to an exemplary embodiment, a Ghost Prices toggle function may be provided so that users may show/hide the last valid bid and last valid offer for each currently unquoted interest in the currently selected workspace. The Ghost Prices toggle option may show/hide the latest historical firm bid and the latest historical firm offer for each interest within the selected workspace, which does not currently have a firm price on either the bid or the offer side.</p>
<p id="p-0539" num="0538">The Ghost Prices toggle option may be invoked via a Show/Hide Last Price button., which may be labeled as Show LstPrc when ghost prices are hidden, and as Hide LstPrc when ghost prices are displayed, or via a hotkey G, which may be used to toggle the display of ghost prices on or off. A ghost price may be defined as the last or most recent firm posted bid or offer submitted for a given interest which currently does not have an active firm posted price on the bid and/or the offer side. This may include prices that were subsequently executed as well as those that were cancelled by a user or the EOD process.</p>
<p id="p-0540" num="0539">The display of ghost prices, when turned on, may be subject to certain rules. For instance, a ghost price may appear only when there is no active firm posted price for an interest on a particular side. When there is no active firm bid, the latest firm posted bid for the interest may appear as the best bid, and when there is no active firm offer, the latest firm posted offer for the interest may appear as the best offer. A ghost price may appear where a firm bid or offer would normally appear within the price sheet. The size of ghost price may not be shown, that is, only the price itself may be displayed. In this regard, a ghost price may also appear in light grey font on a white background. Ghost prices may not be subject to the inverted market rule, that is, the last historical bid and offer may form an inverted market even if the product line does not allow for inverted markets. A tool tip for a ghost price may display the time and date when that price was either created or last updated before it was removed from the system. Moreover, a ghost price may be up to 7 calendar days old. An unquoted interest that had no firm prices posted within that time period may not have a ghost price. Furthermore, a ghost price may not be actionable in any way, that is, the user may not update, firm, post/un-post, or Subject a ghost price. When invoked, the ghost price function may affect the display of the currently selected workspace only. Hence, like other Show/Hide toggles, the Ghost Price toggle may be applicable at the workspace level only.</p>
<p id="h-0051" num="0000">Subject All/Unsubject All Options</p>
<p id="p-0541" num="0540">According to an exemplary embodiment, two options may be provided so that brokers may mark all the firm prices in the current workspace as being subject, and vice versa. In this regard, subject is an intermediate state in between Firm and Held, which is subject to confirmation, that is, it must be made &#x2018;unsubject&#x2019; or firmed, before it may be executed. A Subject price may be updated, posted/unposted, held, &#x2018;unsubjected&#x2019;/firmed or deleted.</p>
<p id="p-0542" num="0541">Subject prices may be indicative, and may be treated like held prices. A Subject All option may be provided so that brokers may set the state of all firm prices in the selected workspace to Subject. Conversely, an UnSubject All option may be provided so that brokers may set the state of all Subject prices in the selected workspace back to Firm.</p>
<p id="p-0543" num="0542">The Subject All option may be configured to be available to brokers only, and may be invoked via a [Subject All] button or &#x3c;Ctrl&#x3e;S hotkey combination. When invoked, the Subject All option may change the state of all the existing firm prices within the currently selected workspace to subject. Held and ghost prices may not be affected. Moreover, any firm prices entered subsequently against interests in the same workspace may also not be affected.</p>
<p id="p-0544" num="0543">The UnSubject All option may be configured to be available to brokers only, and may be invoked via an [UnSubject All] button or &#x3c;Ctrl&#x3e;U hotkey combination. When invoked, the UnSubject All option may change the state of all the existing subject prices within the currently selected workspace to firm. Held and ghost prices may not be affected.</p>
<p id="p-0545" num="0544">In regards to the display of Subject Prices, a subject price may appear in red font on a white background, and a subject price may not be hit/lifted. However the user may update, unsubject/firm, hold, delete, or post/un-post a subject price. Subject prices may appear as subject throughout the system, that is, every price sheet that contains the relevant interest.</p>
<p id="h-0052" num="0000">Collapsible/Expandable Price Sheets</p>
<p id="p-0546" num="0545">According to an exemplary embodiment, users may collapse and expand price sheets vertically within a workspace. In particular, users may control the display state of each individual price sheet within his selected workspace tabs via a collapse/expand icon. In particular, Collapsing or Expanding a price sheet may be enabled via an icon on the right hand side of the price sheet label. When collapsed, a single row with the label of the collapsed price sheet may be displayed along with the expand icon.</p>
<p id="p-0547" num="0546">When all the price sheets within a workspace column are collapsed, then the column may be horizontally collapsed as well. Conversely, when one of those collapsed price sheets is expanded, the workspace column will automatically expand horizontally. When there is some pricing or trade activity related to an interest within a collapsed price sheet, the label row of that price sheet may flash with a different background color for 10 seconds. Certain transaction types may trigger flashing of labels for collapsed price sheets, including, for example, a change in quote, that is, a change in best bid and/or best offer, or a hit/lift. When the user logs out or loses his connection, the current display state of each price sheet selected on his desktop may be saved and persisted.</p>
<p id="h-0053" num="0000">My Favorites Workspaces</p>
<p id="p-0548" num="0547">According to an exemplary embodiment, a single customized private workspace may be created for each user, which may be referred to as the &#x2018;My Favorites&#x2019; workspace, which when defined may be unique to each user. The My Favorites workspace may be created and maintained by an administrator via the standard workspace definition and user interface configuration, and may be composed of standard default price sheets for a single product line. One of the product lines available to the user may be selected to filter the available price sheets. If the user has a My Favorites workspace defined, it may be auto-selected as the first tab, otherwise it may not appear. The workspace tab may read &#x2018;My Favorites,&#x2019; and it may be linked to the user's name, so that it may be available to that user only.</p>
<p id="h-0054" num="0000">IGB Price Entry</p>
<p id="p-0549" num="0548">A price entry dialog may be provided for the entry and maintenance of prices for IGB interests. In particular, an IGB price dialog may be provided so that the user may enter a single order or a two-way spread or outright price for the currently selected bond, or may update an existing IGB bid or offer. In this regard, the user may enter either a bid or an offer, or both. A price may be entered as an outright (percent of par) value, or as a spread over a benchmark. The price entry may apply to the currently selected IGB interest, any details of the selected bond will be displayed at the top of the dialog box. The counterparty firm and trader may be required to be selected from drop-down lists that may show the broker's favored clients at the top. On a two-way order, the offer counterparty may be pre-populated with the one selected on the bid side. The price, size, and order comments may be required to be entered next, as well as the posting (for brokers only) and firm/held statuses. Both sides of the order may be required to be priced the same way, that is, either as an outright or spread price. The entered price(s) may be validated per the market rules and the user may receive the appropriate warnings or errors in the event of any exceptions.</p>
<p id="p-0550" num="0549"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref> shows an exemplary illustration of a price entry dialog <b>7200</b>, which includes certain price entry data fields. In particular, a market name of the selected bond may appear at the very top in large bold font, a full long) description of the bond may be shown below the market name, which includes the legal name of the issuer, the coupon rate of the bond as a percentage per annum after the issuer, the maturity date of the bond, and the ISIN number of the bond. Bid/offer data entry fields may be provided as well. In particular, a site field may be provided, which is pre-set to the site of the trader selected in the Trader drop-down, and sorted to show the broker's favored clients alphabetically, followed by the remaining sites also in alphabetical order. A trader field may also be provided, which is pre-set to the name selected in the Trader drop-down. An alternate trader name may be selected from a list of active traders for the selected site, and the trader names may be sorted to show the broker's favored clients alphabetically, followed by the remaining traders at the selected site also in alphabetical order. A price field may be provided which shows an outright (percent basis) or spread price for bond may be entered in this field. The broker may enter an outright or spread price even if the selected bond has a different quotation method set up as the default, and may accept no more than the maximum number of price decimals configured for the bond. A size field may be provided, which is pre-set to the value selected in broker's Default Size drop-down. When the Default Size setting is &#x2018;Std,&#x2019; then the size may be pre-set to the bond's default order size, which may be overridden to a different value. A comment or free-text field may be provided that is used to attach any special conditions or reference information to the order. A post checkbox may be provided to indicate whether or not the bid and/or offer price/s are to be posted externally, that is to non-brokers. A single checkbox may apply to both sides. A held checkbox is provided to indicate whether or not the bid and/or offer prices may be created as a held prices, or updated from &#x2018;Firm&#x2019; to &#x2018;Held&#x2019; status. A single checkbox may apply to both sides. Un-checked by default, indicates that the prices are &#x2018;Firm.&#x2019;&#x3c;Enter&#x3e; or [Submit] or &#x3c;Alt&#x3e;S may submit the order/s and close the dialog, and &#x3c;Esc&#x3e; or [Cancel] or &#x3c;Alt&#x3e;C or the [X] icon&#x2014;may close the dialog without submitting any orders so that any information entered in the dialog may be lost.</p>
<p id="p-0551" num="0550">When the user enters data for the bid, certain bid information may be copied over to the offer side fields, such as, for example, Site, Trader and Size. The user may change these as desired for the offer when creating a two-way order. Offer side information may not be replicated to the bid. In this regard, if the user enters data for the offer first, then the offer information may not be copied over to the bid fields. The same pricing method may be required to be used for all firm orders on an interest&#x2014;although the user may have the flexibility of using a quotation method other than the default for the bond. Once a firm order has been submitted, all subsequent orders for the interest may be required to use the same pricing method to ensure that the depth and inverted market checks work correctly. Specifically, when there is a standing firm order already in the market, then a new order may be required to be submitted with the same pricing method as that of the standing order. When there is only one order in the market, the user may be permitted to update it's pricing method. When submitting a new order for an unquoted interest with a held order, the user may use a pricing method that differs from the one on the held order. When submitting a two-way order with no standing orders, the user may be required to use the same pricing method on both sides.</p>
<p id="h-0055" num="0000">Hold all Orders for Trader on Logout or Disconnect</p>
<p id="p-0552" num="0551">According to an exemplary embodiment, when a user logs out or is disconnected from the system, all of his firm orders may automatically be held. In particular, when a user's session is terminated, any remaining firm orders that the user is responsible for, may automatically be held based on certain conditions. For example, all of the user's remaining firm prices may be held instantly whenever the user logs off, the user's client is disconnected from the server (as per the logic of the disconnect), or the user's session is disconnected from the server. The affected prices may vary based on the type of user. For a trader, all of his/her firm orders, including those entered or last updated by a broker may be held, and for a broker, all firm orders entered or last updated by a him/her, may be held.</p>
<p id="h-0056" num="0000">Held Price Entry</p>
<p id="p-0553" num="0552">According to an exemplary embodiment, a toggle may be provided so that brokers may set their current status to &#x2018;Firm&#x2019; or &#x2018;Held.&#x2019; When the status is set to &#x2018;Held,&#x2019; then all new prices are entered in the system as held prices so that indicative prices may be entered. The new prices may be included in the determination of a &#x2018;ghost&#x2019; price.</p>
<p id="p-0554" num="0553">Brokers entering data onto the trading system at times may wish to do so even if they have prices that are not necessarily &#x2018;live&#x2019; at the time of entry. Examples may include prices they hear away (at other brokers) that they wish to track, prices that they wish to enter for completeness of data capture for downstream data products or simply to record the levels for quick history. These prices may be required to be entered into a live, interactive market, such that brokers may get &#x2018;hit&#x2019; on prices that are not exactly live, which has caused brokers to be more restricted in their data entry reducing the amount of data and losing valuable price info.</p>
<p id="p-0555" num="0554">A button for brokers may be provided to set the State of entry. When in the Held state all prices entered are held. When the toggle is in the live state, all prices are entered as live. The text labels on the buttons may be &#x201c;LIVE&#x201d; and &#x201c;HELD&#x201d; respectively. The button may have a Red Background when in Live state and a GREY background when in Held state. An &#x2018;Enter as held&#x2019; checkbox may be provided to the price dialog boxes that is only visible for brokers, which may affect both the bid and offer of any entered or updated price. When the market is in Held state, this checkbox may be ticked. When the market is in Live state, this checkbox may be unticked. The state of the button should not change when the broker changes tabs, may not have to be saved when logging in or logging out. Entry of a price in Held mode is effectively the same as entering a Live price and immediately holding it. Ghosted levels and quick history may update appropriately. A price entered as held should not be able to be acted upon externally. If there is an active price, then the addition of a held level may not affect best bid/best offer or ghosted levels as it is deemed that the active price has precedence over the held price. The held price, unless also not posted, may feed through to the history, Ghosted best bid/offer, and downstream data files in the same way a live price that was then held would have.</p>
<p id="p-0556" num="0555">According to an exemplary embodiment, a broker sets the state to Held and enters prices into the blotter on behalf of a trader, and the price should never appear in the market. The trader may not Hit/Lift this price. According to another exemplary embodiment, a broker sets the state to Live and enters prices into the blotter on behalf of a trader. The price then appears in the market.</p>
<p id="p-0557" num="0556">According to another exemplary embodiment, the broker sets the state to HELD and presses P to enter a price. The &#x2018;Enter as Held&#x2019; checkbox is ticked as the Button state is HELD. When pressing submit, the price is entered. If there is no active price the last best bid/best offer updates in ghosted prices, the price is visible in quick history, the portal and Reuters. If there is an active price, then last best bid/best offer does not update in ghosted prices, the price may however be visible in quick history, the portal and Reuters.</p>
<p id="p-0558" num="0557">According to another exemplary embodiment, the broker sets the state to Live and presses P to enter a price. The &#x2018;Enter as Held&#x2019; checkbox is unticked as the Button state is Live. The price appears in the market.</p>
<p id="h-0057" num="0000">IGB Execution Entry</p>
<p id="p-0559" num="0558">According to an exemplary embodiment, hit/lift dialogs may be provided to execute and flash trades for IGB interests. In particular, an IGB Hit/Lift dialog may be provided so that brokers may enter or simulate an execution against a standing bid or offer. The word &#x201c;HIT&#x201d; or &#x201c;LIFT&#x201d; may flash in the affected price cell while the dialog is open. In this regard, the broker may open either the hit or lift dialog by selecting the desired bid or offer. Accordingly, the word HIT may start flashing in place of the selected bid or the word OFFER may start flashing in place of the selected offer as soon as the dialog box is opened. For price selection, Price Selection execution entry may apply to the currently selected IGB bid or IGB offer. The details of the selected bond may be displayed at the top of the dialog box. For counterparty selection, the aggressing counterparty site and trader may be required to be selected from drop-down lists that may show the broker's favored clients at the top. Accordingly, the execution size and price and posting status may be required to be entered. The user may then either submit the execution or exit by closing the dialog, which may terminate the flashing mentioned above. It the trade could not be successfully completed due to the cancellation or execution of the selected order by another broker, an appropriate error message may be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0560" num="0559"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref> shows an exemplary illustration of a Hit dialog, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</figref> shows an exemplary lift dialog. Certain details related to the selected bond interest may be displayed at the top of the dialog, including, for example, the market name of the selected bond, and the full description of the bond, which includes the legal name of the issuer, the coupon rate of the bond as a percentage per annum after the issuer, the maturity date of the bond, and the ISIN number of the bond. The Buyer Site and Trader may appear below the bond details. In the hit dialog, the Bid Site and Trader may be displayed and in the Lift dialog, the Buyer and Trader may be pre-set to the site and trader selected in the Trader and Site drop-downs. An alternate Buyer Site and Trader may be selected from lists of sites and traders entitled to the product line. The selection lists may be sorted to show the broker's favored clients alphabetically, followed by the remaining sites and traders also in alphabetical order.</p>
<p id="p-0561" num="0560">The Seller Site and Trader may appear below the Buyer Details. In the Lift dialog, the Offer Site and Trader may be displayed, and in the hit dialog, the Seller Site and Trader may be pre-set to the site and trader selected in the Trader and Company drop-downs. An alternate Seller Site and Trader may be selected from lists of sites and traders entitled to the product line. The selection lists may be sorted to show the broker's favored clients alphabetically, followed by the remaining sites and traders also in alphabetical order.</p>
<p id="p-0562" num="0561">Certain data fields may appear next to the buyer information in the Lift dialog, and next to the seller information in the Hit dialog. In particular, a price set to the value of the price field on the selected bid or offer. The broker may change this price or blank it out and enter a spread price instead. The system may accept no more than the maximum number of price decimals configured for the bond. A size may be provided, which is pre-set to the size of the selected bid or offer. The broker may override the size. However, the system may accept no more than the maximum number of size decimals configured for the bond. A post checkbox may be provided to indicate whether or not the trade is to be posted externally, that is, to non-brokers.</p>
<p id="p-0563" num="0562">To handle standing orders, two checkboxes for &#x2018;Hold Standing Orders,&#x2019; and &#x2018;Hold Remaining Balance&#x2019; may appear below the Seller information, which indicate whether or not other standing orders for the aggressing trader are to be held, and also whether any remaining balance on the executed order (in the case of a partial execution) should be held. &#x3c;Enter&#x3e; or [Submit] or &#x3c;Alt&#x3e;S may submit the execution, close the dialog, and terminate the flashing of HIT or LIFT, and the selected bid/offer may be removed from the market if the trade succeeded, otherwise &#x3c;Esc&#x3e; or [Cancel] or &#x3c;Alt&#x3e;C or the [X] icon may close the dialog without submitting the trade, and terminate the flashing of HIT or LIFT. Any information entered in the dialog may be lost, and the selected bid/offer may remain in the price sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0564" num="0563">Certain processing rules may apply within the Price dialog. In particular, the broker may override the price and size of the selected bid/offer, including the pricing method. The institution on the buy and sell side may not be the same. As soon as the Hit dialog opens, the word HIT may start flashing in the selected bid cell, and may continue to flash until the dialog is closed. As soon as the Lift dialog opens, the word LIFT may start flashing in the selected offer cell, and may continue to flash until the dialog is closed. If the execution was successful, the selected bid or offer may be removed from the market, otherwise it may re-appear when the dialog is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0565" num="0564">Rather than preventing a user from having more than one hit/lift dialog open at a time, brokers may have multiple hit/lift dialogs open simultaneously in order to allow them to flash HIT/LIFT on more than one bond at a time.</p>
<p id="h-0058" num="0000">Locked Market on Broker Hit/Lift</p>
<p id="p-0566" num="0565">According to an exemplary embodiment, the moment a broker selects Hit/Lift, the affected price may be made unavailable to other users, and the market on the related interest may be locked for other executions. In this regard, all users other than the broker who is trying to execute, may be prevented from hitting or lifting any price in that interest until the broker has completed his action. In addition, the price selected by the broker for execution may not be available for maintenance by any other user, including the trader who owns the price.</p>
<p id="p-0567" num="0566">As soon as the broker selects Hit/Lift, the price that was hit/lifted may start flashing with a red background should indicate that an execution is in progress. The Hit/Lift options may be disabled for all other users. No other user may be able to update, hold or delete the price that was selected for execution by the broker&#x2014;this may be done by disabling those options when another user focuses on that price. The locks on the price and interest may be in effect as long as the broker has the hit/lift dialog open, even if s/he may not have actually submitted the trade yet. The locks may be released when the hit/lift dialog is closed by the initiating broker either after submitting the execution or after canceling out of it. If the broker cancelled the execution, the price may become available to other users. If the broker submitted the execution for a size equal to or greater than that of the selected order, the order may be removed from the market display.</p>
<p id="p-0568" num="0567">If the broker submitted the execution for a size less that of the selected order, and the Hold remaining balance option was checked, the order may be removed from the market display. If the broker submitted the execution for a size less that of the selected order, and the Hold remaining balance option was unchecked, the order size may be updated appropriately in the market display.</p>
<p id="h-0059" num="0000">Join the Trade Option</p>
<p id="p-0569" num="0568">According to an exemplary embodiment, when a work-up is in progress, counterparties other than those currently engaged in the work-up may be permitted to &#x201c;Join the Trade&#x201d; by submitting a bid or offer at the executed price. In particular, when an execution is in the course of being &#x201c;worked-up,&#x201d; with the executed price highlighted and the market on the interest locked for further executions, other users may be permitted to join the trade at the executed price by specifying the desired side (bid/offer) and size. Upon termination of the work-up, the system may automatically match up the &#x201c;joining&#x201d; buyers and sellers and generate the necessary executions. In this regard, when an interactive execution is being &#x201c;worked up,&#x201d; that is, while the market on the executed interest is locked for execution, and the traded price cell is flashing, a trader or broker may join the trade by submitting a bid/offer at the same price. The join feature may be invoked, for example, by double-clicking on the flashing price cell, by using the Join mouse-menu option (w/focus on the selected price), or by using the J hotkey (w/focus on the selected price). When a user invokes the option, s/he may be presented with a Join dialog/pop-up that will enable the entry of the trader (if the user is a broker), desired side and size. The trader and size may be set to the user's default settings. The Join dialog may display the work-up countdown so that the user knows how much time is available for him/her to join the trade. The user may be required to submit his/her response within the total time allocated for the work-up (e.g., 15 seconds), otherwise the dialog may automatically close when the work-up timer counts down to zero. Accordingly, the window of opportunity provided for joining a trade may be the full duration allocated for the work-up, even if the two respondents engaged in the work-up react within a shorter period. Hence, even if a work-up ends before its allocated duration, the market may continue to remain locked on the interest, and the price cell flashing may continue to enable other interested parties to join the trade. When the work-up ends after responses from both counterparties, any residual amount left over from either counterparty engaged in the work-up, may become the first &#x201c;joining&#x201d; order eligible for matching with others who want to join the trade on the opposite side. All bids/offers submitted via this option may be ranked according to their time of submission, with the earliest appearing first on either side. However, a residual size may be ranked from a work-up first on the relevant side. Any previously standing orders at the same price level may not participate in the joining process&#x2014;in other words, if there is a standing bid or offer at the same price level that was not submitted via the Join option, it may not be included in the queue of orders available for automatic matching. After the termination of the work-up, the system may automatically match up the joining bids and offers based on certain priority rankings, and generate the relevant executions. Depending on the size submitted, a single joining bid may be matched up with one or more joining offer/s, or vice versa. Any unmatched and left over joined orders may be discarded. All counterparties whose joined orders were auto-matched and executed, may receive the appropriate trade ticket pop-ups to inform them of their trade/s.</p>
<p id="p-0570" num="0569">Certain data fields may appear within the Join dialog, including certain information for each leg of the interest, such as, for example, a label for the leg number (only if the interest is a CAL or a SWT), the legal name of the entity on the leg, the code for the debt class of the leg, the description of the default reference obligation for the entity on the leg, the price of the selected bid or offer, the code for the restructuring type of the leg, and the maturity date of the leg in dd-mmm-yyyy format.</p>
<p id="p-0571" num="0570">A countdown may be synchronized to the timer/countdown for the work-up on the related interest. The timer may count down the remaining seconds, which may be displayed in large bold font, alternating between white numbers on red background, and red numbers on a white background, from one second to the next to make the flashing more prominent.</p>
<p id="p-0572" num="0571">A Bid/Offer field may be provided which is preset to the aggressor's side. The user may enter or select the opposite side if desired, and a Size field may be provided which is preset to the user's default size setting. The user may tick this size up in multiples of the entity default size for the interest. The entry may be subject to all of the edits applicable to the size field in the price dialog. [Submit] or &#x3c;Enter&#x3e; or &#x3c;Alt&#x3e;S may submit the join order for the selected side and size and close the join dialog. &#x3c;Esc&#x3e; or the [x] icon closes the dialog without submitting a join order.</p>
<p id="p-0573" num="0572">According to an exemplary embodiment, the join option may be enabled only when the user has selected a price cell that is flashing during the course of a work-up following an interactive hit/lift. However, it may be disabled for the users already engaged in that work-up. On display, the focus may be in the side field. The user may tab to the size, the [Submit] button and back to the side. The desired side and size may be submitted by selecting [Submit] or pressing &#x3c;Enter&#x3e;, which may dismiss the dialog. The join may be cancelled, by closing the dialog or pressing &#x3c;Esc&#x3e;. The dialog may be modal, and may take precedence over any other dialog or pop-up that might be open concurrently on the user's desktop. The user may dismiss the dialog either by submitting a side and size for a potential join, or by closing the dialog. The dialog may automatically close if the user does not react to it before it times out. By default, the dialog may appear in the center of the user's main applet window.</p>
<p id="p-0574" num="0573">When double clicking on a price cell, if a work-up is in progress against the selected price, and the user is not engaged in that work-up, the Join dialog may be displayed. Otherwise, if the user is engaged in that work-up, nothing may happen. If the price is a bid not owned by the selected trader's institution, and there is no work-up in progress, then the user may be presented with a Hit dialog. If the price is an offer not owned by the selected trader's institution, and there is no work-up in progress, then the user may be presented with a Lift dialog.</p>
<p id="p-0575" num="0574">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, how a trade is joined, and how orders are matched within the joined trade, may be prioritized. In particular, certain trader privileges may be grouped into one or more priority &#x201c;tiers&#x201d; on each side of the trade, where each tier constitutes a &#x201c;priority bucket&#x201d; with certain implications in matching the final buying and selling sizes in the joined trade. Additionally, under certain circumstances brokers may work-up or join a trade on behalf of traders.</p>
<p id="p-0576" num="0575">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, users who wish to join a trade may be prioritized based on the quality (i.e., tightness) of their outstanding bid or offer price with respect to the traded price level in terms of depth or spread. Here, the presence of a quality price in type depth or quality price spread may be defined as a certain multiple of price ticks away from the traded price level. That is, the tight depth or spread range may be calculated from the traded price level. For example, if the traded price level is 12 and the price ticks for the respective interest is 0.5, then the tight depth range is 4&#xd7;0.5=2 bps: (12&#x2212;10) for bids or (12&#x2212;14) for offers. Likewise, if the traded price level is 29 and the price tick for the respective interest is 1, then the tight spread range is 4&#xd7;1=4 bps: (29&#x2212;25) for bids or (29&#x2212;33) for offers. In this regard, the price tick multiple may be a configurable setting, and the calculated depth or spread values may depend on whether a price-quoted interest or spread-quoted interest is involved.</p>
<p id="p-0577" num="0576">According to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, counterparties engaged in a trade may join on the opposite side of the trade, regardless of their original positioning with respect to the traded interest. For example, if a party to the trade was originally a seller, such a party may not be restricted from joining the trade as buyer.</p>
<p id="p-0578" num="0577">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, traders may be classified as either &#x201c;Preferred&#x201d; or &#x201c;Standard&#x201d;, in which the preferred traders receive a higher priority with respect to joining the trade than standard traders. In this regard, the classification of a &#x201c;Preferred&#x201d; or &#x201c;Standard&#x201d; trading status may be accorded to individuals rather than groups.</p>
<p id="p-0579" num="0578">To join in the trade, certain pre-conditions may be required. For example, the user may be required to be an interactive trader of credit default swaps (CDS) or a broker acting on behalf of a trader of credit default swap (CDS). To initiate the trade, another user (e.g., another broker or trader) executes a trade that is eligible for joining in a credit default swap (CDS) interest. Here, the trade to be joined may be a single execution (i.e., a single bid is hit or a single offer is lifted) rather than a Deal-by-Volume (DBV) execution (Deal-By-Volume trading explained below). To participate in the trade, the user may elect to automatically join the trade via a live trade dialog, or may notice the traded price cell is flashing within the workspace and manually invoke the &#x201c;live trades&#x201d; option. In this regard, the trader may have a standing order at the traded price level on the side being traded.</p>
<p id="p-0580" num="0579"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76</figref> is a workflow diagram that presents an exemplary decision process for establishing priority tiers P1 to P6 for matching the orders of participants wishing to join in a single execution trade. Here, each &#x201c;decision point&#x201d; is presented in the form of a question, in which the provided outcomes are both exhaustive and mutually exclusive (i.e., there are no other outcomes), and each &#x201c;branch&#x201d; of the decision tree describes the eligibility and ranking type for each tier.</p>
<p id="p-0581" num="0580">The P1 priority tier may be reserved for working-up the original trade of an Initiator or Aggressor. Here, the Initiator is the passive, aggressed party, whose standing order (e.g., bid or offer) was either hit or lifted by the Aggressor, who is considered to be the active, aggressing party.</p>
<p id="p-0582" num="0581">Traders who join on the same side of the trade with the Initiator are considered to be on the &#x201c;Initiator's side&#x201d;, whereas traders who join on the same side of trade as the Aggressor are considered to be on the &#x201c;Aggressor's side&#x201d;. For example, if a bid is hit, the traders who post a &#x201c;buy&#x201d; order with respect to the traded interest in an attempt to join in the trade are considered to be on the Initiator's side, whereas those traders who post a &#x201c;sell&#x201d; order with respect to the traded interest in an attempt to join in the trade are considered to be on the Aggressor's side. Alternatively, if an offer is lifted, the traders who post a &#x201c;sell&#x201d; order with respect to the traded interest in an attempt to join in the trade are considered to be on the Initiator's side, whereas the traders who post a &#x201c;buy&#x201d; order with respect to the traded interest in an attempt to join in the trade are considered to be on the Aggressor's side.</p>
<p id="p-0583" num="0582">The P2 priority tier may be reserved for matching the orders of traders whose standing orders for the traded interest match the traded price level when the join process started. Here, traders in the P2 priority tier may be ranked based on the time of posting of orders. It is expected that the P2 priority tier on the Aggressor's side may not have many constituents, if any at all, because none of the orders on the Aggressor's side is expected to be at the traded price level (i.e., the spread is not likely to be zero).</p>
<p id="p-0584" num="0583">The P3 priority tier may be reserved for counter-parties of the original trade if they elect to switch sides. Accordingly, the P3 priority tier on the Initiator's side is reserved for the Aggressor should the Aggressor elect to switch sides after hitting the Initiator's original bid or lifting the Initiator's original offer, whereas the P3 priority tier on the Aggressor's side is reserved for the Initiator should the Initiator elect to switch sides after making the original bid or offer.</p>
<p id="p-0585" num="0584">The P4 priority tier may be reserved for matching the orders of certain &#x201c;Preferred&#x201d; traders who wish to join the trade but had no posted price for the traded interest when the opportunity to join the trade started, or whose posted price is not at the traded price level.</p>
<p id="p-0586" num="0585">Traders in the P4 priority tier may be ranked based on how quickly they join the trade (e.g., how quickly they respond to the notification of the opportunity to join in the trade). Accordingly, the orders of traders qualifying at the P4 priority tier level may be handled on a &#x201c;first-in, first-served&#x201d; basis.</p>
<p id="p-0587" num="0586">The P5 priority tier may be reserved for traders who had a quality (i.e., tight) depth or spread price for the traded interest when the opportunity to join in the trade started. In this instance, such traders may be referred to as &#x201c;Tight Depth Contributors&#x201d; if they join on the same side as the Initiator, or &#x201c;Tight Spread Contributors&#x201d; if they join on the same side as the Aggressor. Here, as stated above, the presence of a quality (tight) depth price may be defined as a certain multiple of price ticks (e.g., four) away from the traded price level. Accordingly, traders who had posted prices within the prescribed range may have priority over other traders with respect to the joined trade.</p>
<p id="p-0588" num="0587">The traders in P5 priority tier may be ranked based on the proximity of their tight depth or spread prices to the traded level (i.e., the closer the price to the traded level, the higher the ranking within the tier). For owners of prices at the same depth level on the Initiator's side, or for owners of prices at the same spread level on the Aggressor's side, their ranking may be based on the time of posting of their order, by depth, or spread. Prices posted in depth or in spread more than a default number of price ticks (e.g., four) away from the traded price level may be considered non-quality (i.e., too wide), and therefore may not qualify to receive a P5 priority.</p>
<p id="p-0589" num="0588">The P6 priority tier may be reserved for &#x201c;Standard&#x201d; traders who wish to join in the trade but had no posted price for the traded interest when the opportunity to join the trade started, or whose posted price was more than a default number of ticks (e.g., four) in depth or spread away from the traded level. Traders in the P6 priority tier may be ranked based on how quickly they join the trade (e.g., how quickly they respond to the notification of the opportunity to join in the trade). Accordingly, the orders of traders qualifying at the P6 priority tier level may be handled on a &#x201c;first-in, first-served&#x201d; basis.</p>
<p id="p-0590" num="0589">Traders on the Initiator's side who belong to more than one priority tiers may be provided with only the priority associated with their highest tier. Accordingly, participation by a trader in multiple tiers may not be permitted.</p>
<p id="p-0591" num="0590">Implementation of the priority tiers may take into account certain &#x201c;Privilege Diffusion&#x201d; rules, in which the tier participants lend privileges to their colleagues within the same tier. That is, certain privileges of a user may &#x201c;diffuse&#x201d; to certain other users. Here, for example, certain colleagues and brokers may act as proxies with the same privileges to join a trade as the original price owners. Thus, the privilege diffusion rules may act as a protection mechanism for traders who are temporarily not in direct contact with their screens because they may be away from their desk, have a local desktop problem or are otherwise too busy. In this regard, the preferred status may not apply to price diffusion rules.</p>
<p id="p-0592" num="0591">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a trader with an active price on an interest that is currently worked up may &#x201c;lend&#x201d; his privileges and associated priorities to colleagues from the same site for participation on the same side of the traded interest. For example, a trader from Goldman NY with an existing bid (but no offer) on a traded interest may &#x201c;lend&#x201d; his privileges to other traders from Goldman NY who wish to join the trade as buyers. By contrast, the traders from Goldman NY may not receive special privileges from the NY trader on the selling side for the same interest since the attempted participation is not on the same side of the traded interest. Additionally, traders from Goldman London may not receive special privileges from the NY traders since they do not trade from the same site (i.e., NY).</p>
<p id="p-0593" num="0592">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the privileges of a screen supporter derived from a standing order may be &#x201c;lent&#x201d; to his colleagues only for participation on the traded interest but not others interests. For example, if a trader from SocGen NYK has a standing price on BRITEL 5y, the trader may lend his privileges to his colleagues only for BRITEL 5y JTT participation. Moreover, the privileges of a screen supporter derived from a standing order may be &#x201c;lent&#x201d; to colleagues from the same site only for participation on the same side of the trade (i.e., not on the opposite side of the trade). For example, if a trader from Lehman Ldn has a standing offer, he may lend his privileges to his colleagues only for Lehman Ldn sellers (but not buyers) on that interest.</p>
<p id="p-0594" num="0593">According to an exemplary embodiment, multiple traders from the same institution may wish to trade on the same side of the executed interest. In this instance, if multiple traders from the same institution occupy more than one tier level (for example, by posting prices at traded levels and in depth), all such traders may be treated as though they belong to only the highest ranked tier (i.e., participation in multiple tiers by a single trader may not be permitted).</p>
<p id="p-0595" num="0594">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, running points (i.e., interest for upfront premium payments) may be ignored when calculating the depth quality for an interest trading with upfront payments. In the case of switches, the depth and spread quality for the traded interest may be calculated for the greater of the 2 legs' price ticks. As stated earlier, the presence of a quality depth price may be defined as a certain multiple of price ticks (e.g., four) away from the traded price level. In this regard, such a multiple may be referred to as the &#x201c;Price Tick Multiple&#x201d;, and may be a configurable field.</p>
<p id="p-0596" num="0595">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the classification of traders as either &#x201c;Preferred&#x201d; or &#x201c;Standard&#x201d; may be exhaustive and mutually exclusive so, by definition, the traders who are not classified as &#x201c;Preferred&#x201d;, are treated as &#x201c;Standard&#x201d;. A trader's status of &#x201c;Preferred&#x201d; or &#x201c;Standard&#x201d; may be set, for example, via the Data Buffet (DB), or by any other suitable configurable arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0597" num="0596">According to an exemplary embodiment, desk head brokers in all centers may have the discretion to confer the &#x201c;Preferred&#x201d; status. In this regard, the desk head brokers may convey the information to system support personnel, who may update the Data Buffet (DB) settings periodically. The members of the &#x201c;Preferred&#x201d; and &#x201c;Standard&#x201d; groups may change as a function of revenue generation by the respective trader. Reports and lists of &#x201c;Preferred&#x201d; traders may be generated from Data Buffet (DB), or by another suitable configuration arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0598" num="0597">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, pre-join posted (i.e., standing) firm orders may not be modified in price or in size, but may be held by traders, or brokers acting on their behalf, so as to not interfere with the existing &#x201c;Hold All&#x201d; and &#x201c;One-Cancels-Other&#x201d; (OCO) functions. Other traders or brokers acting on behalf of traders may be prevented from adding new prices on the screen for the traded interest, and orders that were standing at the time of the original trade on the same side of the trade at the traded price level may be automatically joined. Upon expiration of the time allocated to join the trade, certain actions may be taken. For example, the status of standing orders of those who joined but did not trade at all may be preserved. Also, standing orders that are not at the traded level may not be deleted after the trade was joined even if the owners of the orders were matched during the joined trade. Held, subjected or unposted standing orders may not participate in the joined trade.</p>
<p id="p-0599" num="0598"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 77A-E</figref> show exemplary live trade dialogs <b>9100</b><i>a</i>-<i>e</i>, which demonstrate how a trader may receive indications with respect to a work-up or joined trade, and how the trader or broker may respond to these indications. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77A</figref>, the exemplary live trade dialog <b>7700</b><i>a </i>indicates in a join status field <b>7701</b><i>a </i>that the system is &#x201c;Trying to buy 10 MM&#x201d; of the interest displayed in the interest details field <b>7702</b><i>a</i>, and that 18 seconds remain, as indicated in the time remaining field <b>7703</b><i>a</i>, before the opportunity to join in the trade expires. Similarly, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77B</figref>, the exemplary live trade dialog <b>7700</b><i>b </i>indicates in the workup status field <b>7701</b><i>b </i>that the system is &#x201c;Trying to sell 5MM more&#x201d; of the interest displayed in the interest details field <b>7702</b><i>b</i>, and that 21 seconds remain, as indicated in the time remaining filed <b>7703</b><i>b</i>, before the opportunity to work up the trade expires.</p>
<p id="p-0600" num="0599">The exemplary live trade dialogs <b>7700</b><i>a </i>and <b>7700</b><i>b </i>may include a &#x201c;Cancel Order&#x201d; button <b>7704</b><i>a/b </i>to cancel the order and withdraw from the joined trade or work-up opportunity at any time before the allocated time period expires. If the user issues the cancel order but is not processed by the system (e.g., because of a network disconnect or because the user acted too close to the window expiration), then the status of the unprocessed request to cancel the order may need to be resolved by the desks. In this regard, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77C</figref>, the exemplary live trade dialog <b>7700</b><i>c </i>indicates in the join status field <b>7701</b><i>c </i>that the system is &#x201c;Cancelling [the] request&#x201d;. Thereafter, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77D</figref>, the exemplary live trade dialog <b>7700</b><i>d </i>indicates in the join status field <b>7701</b><i>d </i>that the order was &#x201c;Not filled&#x201d;.

<p id="p-0602" num="0601">By default, all executed joint trades may remain unposted for the market. Instead, only certain brokers and the counter-parties involved in joined trades may see such trade information in the trade logs. Whether certain information regarding an executed joint trade is to be posted in the trade logs may be controlled at the entity default level, which may be configurable, for example, via the Data Buffet (DB), or by another configuration arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0603" num="0602">When a trade is joined, the associated interest may be locked and the updating of standing orders disallowed for the interest on either side of the trade. Users may only hold standing orders via an individual hold action or via hold-all. Standing orders may also be held if the trader's timed orders expire or if the &#x201c;One-Cancels-Other&#x201d; (OCO) feature is triggered.</p>
<p id="p-0604" num="0603"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 78</figref> shows an exemplary price update summary dialog display <b>7800</b>, which demonstrates how a broker or trader who attempts to modify a standing order for a locked interest receives a message indicating that the interest is locked. In particular, the exemplary price update summary dialog display <b>7800</b> may list the orders that were not updated, the associated price and reasons for not updating the price.</p>
<p id="p-0605" num="0604"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 79</figref> illustrates in table form exemplary results that may occur if a broker or trader attempts certain actions with respect to a locked interest. Here, for example, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 79</figref>, the system may prevent the broker or trader from updating the price or the size of order by disabling the hotkey and right click menu options while the trade is in progress. Hence, when a trade is joined should a broker or trader attempt to update the price or size of the order via the update dialog, the broker or trader may note that their access to this action is disabled.</p>
<p id="p-0606" num="0605">Certain brokers may have the opportunity to work-up or join a trade on behalf of a trader, which may be helpful in certain situations. For example, brokers may update order sizes for Initiators or Aggressors when the respective trader(s) are &#x201c;off the desk&#x201d; or not able to use their screen. Certain brokers may also join on behalf of a client who had expressed verbally a desire to participate if the interest is to be traded.</p>
<p id="p-0607" num="0606"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 80</figref> shows an exemplary trade dialog <b>8000</b> for inviting a broker to join a live trade. Here, it is noted that the exemplary trade dialog <b>8000</b> for inviting the broker to join the live trade may be similar or identical to the live trade dialog presented to traders, except that the bottom of the panel may display the Site and Trader dropdown menus <b>8001</b>/<b>8002</b>. Likewise, function keys may remain operational in the exemplary trade dialog window <b>8000</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0608" num="0607">To access the exemplary trade dialog <b>8000</b>, brokers may click on the flashing field price that is being traded. In certain instances, brokers may be restricted from clicking and posting prices on behalf of traders on an interest that is trading (e.g., flashing).</p>
<p id="p-0609" num="0608">According to an exemplary embodiment, one or more brokers may work-up or join in the same trade. Thus, the opportunity to join the trade may not be restricted on a per broker desk basis. However, in certain instances only one order per trader may be permitted in a join or a work-up opportunity. For example, if both a trader and a broker acting on behalf of the trader participate on the same trade, only the first order that is received may be processed, whereas the other order may be ignored. In this regard, for the user (i.e., the trader or broker acting on behalf of the trader) who sent the later-received order, a post live trade dialog may provided, which indicate: Duplicate Order &#x201c;Your order request was already submitted&#x201d;. Here, such an indication may be provided immediately after the user attempts to send his order.</p>
<p id="p-0610" num="0609">Users (e.g., brokers or traders) may be allowed only a certain period of time (e.g., 30 seconds) to join the trade before the window of opportunity expires. In this regard, the timeout period may be configurable, for example, for the entity or bond.</p>
<p id="p-0611" num="0610"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 81</figref> shows in table form exemplary scenarios in which an invitation to work-up or join is possible and how it may occur with respect to each priority tier P1 to P6. In particular, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 81</figref>, either a buyer or seller who qualifies to trade at the P1 or P3 priority tier levels may be invited to work-up the trade as a buyer or seller with the option to buy more or sell more of the traded interest in predefined size increments (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 or 40 units). Likewise, a buyer or seller who qualifies to trade at the P2, P4, P5 and P6 priority tier levels may be invited to join the trade as a buyer or seller with the option to buy or sell the traded interest in predefined size increments (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 or 40 units).</p>

<p id="p-0633" num="0632">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, traders having standing orders on the same side of a trade at the traded price level may be automatically joined in the trade. Additionally, once the user is automatically joined in the trade, the user may have the option to change the size of the order, change sides or cancel the join request.</p>
<p id="p-0634" num="0633"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 89</figref> shows an exemplary workflow diagram that presents an exemplary decision process for automatically joining a trade. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 89</figref>, standing orders in depth at the traded price level on the same side of the trade may be automatically joined for the amount of the original standing order. Here, both broker-entered orders and trader-entered orders may be automatically joined. In this regard, orders that are automatically joined may be handled at the P2 priority tier level since such an order is a standing order at the traded price level.</p>
<p id="p-0635" num="0634">A live trade dialog may be provided, which informs the user that his standing order has been automatically joined in the trade and also provides the user with the ability to update the joined order amount and the ability to switch sides (from buy to sell or vice-versa). Users may also have the ability to withdraw from an automatically joined trade via a cancel button.</p>
<p id="p-0636" num="0635">A standing order that is automatically joined may remain on the screen during the regular join process, and once the allocated time period for joining the trade expires, the automatically joined order may be matched if a buyer or seller is available. Automatically joined standing orders that are matched may be held since such orders are considered as traded. However, if automatically joined standing orders are not matched they may remain in the market and may retain their priority rank or move up in rank if higher ranking standing orders have been traded or held. Unposted or subject orders may not be eligible for auto-joining. Likewise, orders with sizes less than the minimum order size, or sizes that are not a multiple of the default lot size for the interest, may also not be eligible for auto-joining.</p>
<p id="p-0637" num="0636"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 90A-E</figref> show exemplary live trade dialogs <b>9000</b><i>a</i>-<i>e</i>, which demonstrate how a trader may receive certain indications with respect to an automatically joined trade, and how a trader may respond to these indications. For example, if the user is automatically joined on the &#x201c;buy&#x201d; side of a trade, a live trade dialog may be presented to the user, which displays the message: &#x201c;Automatically joined in to buy &#x3c;size&#x3e;MM&#x201d;, as shown, for example, in the exemplary live dialog <b>9000</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 90A</figref>. Likewise, if the user is automatically joined on the &#x201c;sell&#x201d; side of a trade, a live trade dialog may be presented to the user, which displays the message: &#x201c;Automatically joined in to sell &#x3c;size&#x3e;MM&#x201d;, as shown, for example, in the exemplary live dialog <b>9000</b><i>b </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 90B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0638" num="0637">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 90A and 90B</figref>, the user is presented with an option to adjust or cancel the automatically joined trade. In particular, as shown in the exemplary live dialog <b>9000</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 90A</figref>, a &#x201c;Buy &#x3c;size&#x3e; More&#x201d; button <b>9001</b><i>a </i>is provided to purchase an amount in addition to the amount automatically joined to buy, a &#x201c;Sell &#x3c;size&#x3e;&#x201d; button <b>9002</b><i>a </i>is provided to sell a certain amount rather than purchase the amount automatically joined to buy, and a &#x201c;Cancel&#x201d; button <b>9003</b><i>a </i>is provided to cancel the automatically joined trade. Likewise, as shown in the exemplary live dialog <b>9000</b><i>b </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 90B</figref>, a &#x201c;Buy &#x3c;size&#x3e;&#x201d; button <b>9001</b><i>b </i>is provided to purchase a certain amount rather than sell the amount automatically joined to sell, a &#x201c;Sell &#x3c;size&#x3e; More&#x201d; button <b>9002</b><i>a/b </i>is provided to sell a certain amount in addition to the amount automatically-joined to sell, and a &#x201c;Cancel&#x201d; button <b>9003</b><i>b </i>is provided to cancel the automatically joined trade.</p>
<p id="p-0639" num="0638">Considering the exemplary live trade dialog <b>9000</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 90A</figref>, for example, by clicking the &#x201c;Buy &#x3c;size&#x3e; More&#x201d; button <b>9001</b> the trader issues a request to buy the indicated amount in addition to the amount already secured by the automatically joined trade. That is, if the amount for the automatically joined trade is originally 5MM, for example, then by clicking the &#x201c;Buy 5 More&#x201d; button the trader issues a request to buy 5MM more units in addition to the 5MM already secured by the automatically joined trade for an overall total of 10MM units. In this regard, assuming the trader has opted to buy the 5MM more units, the system may respond with an indication that the trader is automatically joined in the trade for 5MM but that the system is &#x201c;Trying to buy 10MM&#x201d;, as shown, for example, in the exemplary live dialog <b>9000</b><i>c </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 90C</figref>. Thereafter, if the request is successful, then the system may provide an indication in the join status field <b>9004</b><i>d </i>stating that the order has been &#x201c;Filled!&#x201d;, as shown, for example, in the exemplary live dialog <b>9000</b><i>d </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 90D</figref>. By contrast, should the trader decide to cancel the automatically joined trade by selecting the &#x201c;Cancel&#x201d; or &#x201c;Cancel Order&#x201d; button <b>9003</b><i>a/b/c</i>, may provide an indication in the join status field <b>9004</b><i>e </i>stating that the system is now &#x201c;Cancelling [the] request&#x201d;, as shown, for example, in the exemplary live trade dialog <b>9000</b><i>e </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 90E</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0640" num="0639">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a trader may receive a live trade dialog regarding an automatically joined trade only if the system is properly configured to provide this dialog to the trader. For example, the system may require that the trader have a &#x201c;Popup Live Trades&#x201d; option selected in the workspace preference window in order to receive such dialogs. In this regard, if the system is not configured to provide these dialogs (e.g., the &#x201c;Popup Live Trades&#x201d; option is not enabled for this trader), the trader may not receive such dialogs but may be automatically joined in the trade nonetheless.</p>
<p id="p-0641" num="0640">If the trader's order is filled as part of an automatically joined trade, the trader may receive an indication that the order was filled along with an option to access the trade ticket via the live trade dialog. In the case of a Deal-By-Volume (DBV) execution, any orders in depth that were not part of the Deal-By-Volume (DBV) execution but are eligible for auto-join, may be automatically joined. Orders that were standing at the time of the original trade on the same side of the trade at the traded price level may be automatically joined at the P2 priority tier level. Prior to completion of the automatically joined trade, the trader may adjust the size of his order and/or switch to the opposite side of the trade as desired and submit his request, or withdraw from the trade.</p>
<p id="p-0642" num="0641">The owner of each standing order may be presented with a live trade dialog with an indication as to which side of the joined trade the trader's order is to be joined with. A buy or sell button may be provided, which displays &#x201c;Buy &#x3c;size&#x3e; More&#x201d; or &#x201c;Sell &#x3c;size&#x3e; More&#x201d; depending on the side of the automatically joined trade. The buy or sell button for the opposite side may display &#x201c;Buy &#x3c;size&#x3e;&#x201d; or &#x201c;Sell &#x3c;size&#x3e;&#x201d;. If the user buys or sells more, the amount will be in addition to the joined amount, and the join status may display &#x201c;Trying to Buy/Sell &#x3c;auto-joined amount&#x3e;+&#x3c;amount of the join&#x3e; . . . &#x201d; Accordingly, if trader is automatically joined to buy 5MM and he buys 10MM more, the join status field may display, for example: &#x201c;Trying to buy 15MM . . . &#x201d; In this regard, if the trader requests to adjust the size of his order with respect to the automatically joined trade, he maintains his original ranking with respect to others joined in the trade.</p>
<p id="p-0643" num="0642">Unposted prices, subject prices, prices with sizes that are less then the minimum size of the interest, and prices with sizes that are not a multiple of the default lot size of the entity, may be excluded from the automatically joined trade.</p>
<p id="p-0644" num="0643">If the trader switches the side of his automatically joined request, he may be placed into his respective tier on the offer side of the trade. For example, if a trader with a standing bid and an offer is automatically joined on the bid side, or if the trader switches side on the automatically joined trade, his join on the sell will go into the P4 priority tier if the trader is a preferred trader, or the P5 priority tier if the trader has a standing order on the opposite side, which is considered to be within the tight spread range, or the P6 priority tier if the trader does not have a standing order on the opposite side or if the trader has a standing order on the opposite side that is not within the tight spread range.</p>
<p id="p-0645" num="0644">If the trader switches sides on his automatically joined request, his related standing order may be held. For example, if a trader with a bid of 5M switches to sell after the bid is automatically joined, the bid may be held regardless of whether or not the trader's request to join is matched. Here, by switching sides the trader is declaring a change in direction, and therefore it is assumed that his original order is no longer valid.</p>
<p id="p-0646" num="0645">If the trader withdraws his automatically joined request, the trader's related standing order may be held. However, if the trader makes no changes during the allocated time to work-up or join in the trade, the trader's request may be submitted for the original order side and size when the time expires, and the trader may maintain his original ranking.</p>
<p id="p-0647" num="0646">During the join process, if the standing order is held by a &#x201c;One-Cancels-Other&#x201d; (OCO) action, the timer or manual &#x201c;Hold&#x201d; action (e.g., &#x201c;Hold&#x201d; or &#x201c;Hold All&#x201d;) then the standing order may be held in the market but the join request is not withdrawn. If the standing order is held but the join request is not withdrawn, the trader may lose their priority ranking and be relegated to either the P4 priority tier, if the trader is a preferred trader, or the P6 priority tier, if the trader is a standard trader. The only time an automatically joined trade may be withdrawn is when the trader, or the broker on the trader's behalf, manually cancels the automatically joined trade via the live trade dialog.</p>
<p id="p-0648" num="0647">At the end of the allocated time to work-up or join the trade, all related standing orders that were matched via the join process may be deemed to have been filled, and consequently may be held in the market even when an automatically joined trade is only partially filled. Automatically joined trades that are matched may be un-posted, depending upon the configuarion of the system. If a standing order is matched or held, a &#x201c;Held Price&#x201d; message may be provided to all joined traders from other institutions in a price log. Traders from the automatically joined trader's institution may see the un-posted trade message in the trade log. Brokers may see the un-posted trade message in the trade log if their request to join the trade is matched.</p>
<p id="p-0649" num="0648">At the end of the allocated time to work-up or join the trade, all related standing orders on the same side of an automatically joined trade that were unmatched via the join process, may remain standing in their original state as long as the trader did not switch sides. The standing orders may not reflect size changes made via the live trade dialog on the related automatically joined request. An indication regarding the automatically joined trade may be provided in the broker's trade log as follows:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">

</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0650" num="0650">Upon completion of an automatically joined trade, the standing orders of those who did not join the trade, or those who were automatically joined but did not subsequently trade as part of the automatically joined process, may be preserved. Likewise, standing orders with prices not at the traded price level of the automatically joined trade may be preserved once the automatically joined trade is completed even if the owners of the orders were matched during the automatically joined trade.</p>
<p id="p-0651" num="0651">Held, subjected or un-posted standing orders may not participate in the automatically joined trade.</p>
<p id="p-0652" num="0652"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 91A-E</figref> show exemplary live trade dialogs <b>9100</b><i>a</i>-<i>e</i>, which demonstrate how a broker may receive indications with respect to an automatically joined trade on behalf of a trader, and how the broker may respond to these indications. In this regard, with respect to an automatically joined trade, brokers may receive certain notifications but may not act on behalf of a trader who has been automatically joined in the trade except to cancel the automatically joined trade on behalf of the trader. For example, if the broker selects a trader who has been automatically joined, the broker may be notified that the selected trader is involved in an automatically joined trade. In particular, the broker may be provided with an indication that the selected trader has been &#x201c;Automatically joined&#x201d;, as shown, for example, in the exemplary live dialog <b>9100</b><i>a </i>of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 91A</figref>. However, the broker may only be permitted to cancel the automatically joined trade. Here, the broker may be permitted to cancel the trader's order even if the trader has modified the size of the order, or has switched to the opposite side of the automatically joined trade. In this regard, if the automatically joined trade is canceled by the broker, then a live trade dialog may be presented to the trader, which indicates that the system is &#x201c;Cancelling request&#x201d;, and thereafter that the request was &#x201c;Not Filled. Sorry, could not match&#x201d;, as shown, for example, in the exemplary live dialogs <b>9100</b><i>b </i>and <b>9100</b><i>c </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 91B and 91C</figref>, respectively. Should both the broker and trader submit a cancel request simultaneously, both the broker and trader may see a message indicating that the request is canceled.</p>
<p id="p-0653" num="0653">If the trader loses a network connection or logs out during the join process, and the trader's standing orders are held due to the disconnect, then the automatically joined trade may not be withdrawn.</p>

<p id="h-0061" num="0000">Joining the Trade for Bonds</p>
<p id="p-0655" num="0655">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, trades involving bonds, such as, for example, investment grade bonds (IGBs), may be joined. In particular, certain traders and/or brokers acting on behalf of bond traders may have the ability to work-up or join a trade. Here, such brokers may initiate trades not only on behalf of the traders, but also on behalf of their own site account. In this regard, the brokers may be Aggressors, but not Initiators.</p>
<p id="p-0656" num="0656">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, priority tier levels may be maintained and the workflows preserved in a manner similar to that for credit default swaps (CDS). Certain bond traders may have the option to receive a live trade popup dialog automatically. The eligibility of a trader to join a bond trade may be configured via a &#x201c;WorkUp Time&#x201d; checkbox, in a manner similar to credit default swaps (CDS). The allocated time to work-up or join in a trade for bonds may be restricted to a certain time period (e.g., 30 seconds). The default trading size for joining a trade for bonds may be 1 M, and thereafter configurable, for example, in increments of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15 or 20 M.</p>
<p id="p-0657" num="0657"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 95</figref> is a workflow diagram that presents an exemplary decision process for establishing priorities with respect to joining a trade for bonds. Here, each &#x201c;decision point&#x201d; is presented in the form of a question, in which the outcomes are exhaustive and mutually exclusive (i.e., there are no other outcomes), and each &#x201c;branch&#x201d; of the decision tree describes the eligibility and ranking type for each tier. In this instance, the P1 priority tier is reserved for the Initiator or the Aggressor of the original trade, the P2 priority tier is reserved for traders who had prices at the traded level, the P3 priority tier is reserved for counter-parties of the original trade if they elect to switch sides, the P4 priority tier is reserved for certain &#x201c;Preferred&#x201d; traders, the P5 priority tier reserved for traders who had quality (tight) depth prices when the opportunity to join the trade started (a.k.a., Tight Depth Contributors), and the P6 priority tier is reserved for &#x201c;Standard&#x201d; traders.</p>
<p id="p-0658" num="0658">To join in a bond trade the user may be required to be an interactive trader of bonds or a broker acting on behalf of a trader of bonds. In this regard, the trade may be initiated, for example, by another user (e.g., broker or trader) who executes a bond trade on the system. Here, the trade may be considered eligible for joining if it involved a single price level (i.e., if one or more bids at the same price level were hit, or one or more offers at the same price were lifted), rather than a multi-price Deal-By-Volume (DBV) execution (explained below).</p>
<p id="p-0659" num="0659">A qualified user may either elect to automatically join the trade in the related workspace, or the user may notice that the traded price cell is flashing within the related workspace and manually invoke an option as part of a live trade dialog presented to the user. The window of opportunity to join the trade may be restricted to within a certain period of time (e.g., 30 seconds), and may be configurable.</p>
<p id="p-0660" num="0660">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, certain brokers may only be permitted to work-up or join a trade in progress on behalf of the site account from their respective location. For example, a broker from London may be permitted to work-up or join in a trade on behalf of an associated trader in London, but may not be permitted to work-up or join in a trade on behalf of a trader in Hong Kong.</p>
<p id="p-0661" num="0661">When joining or working-up on behalf of clients, the system may process the broker's order at the priority tier level of the associated trader on whose behalf the broker is acting. More than one broker may be permitted to work-up or join in the same trade. Accordingly, there may be no restrictions on joint participation with respect to multiple brokers from the same site or from multiple sites.</p>
<p id="p-0662" num="0662">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a quality (i.e., tight) depth price presence may be defined as a certain multiple of price ticks (e.g., two) away from the traded level. Here, the multiple may be configured, for example, via the Data Buffet (DB).</p>
<p id="p-0663" num="0663">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, traders of bonds, like traders of credit default swaps (CDS), may be classified as either &#x201c;Preferred&#x201d; or &#x201c;Standard&#x201d;. Here, as with traders of credit default swaps (CDS), the classifications may be exhaustive and mutually exclusive, so that, by definition, bond traders who are not classified as preferred traders, are treated as standard traders. The trader classifications may be conferred on an individual basis, rather than by group. In this regard, the desk head at all GFI brokerage sites may be given discretion to confer the &#x201c;Preferred&#x201d; status, which may be administered and updated periodically.</p>
<p id="p-0664" num="0664">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, original &#x201c;joinable&#x201d; bond trades may be posted, whereas bond trades executed as part of the join process may be un-posted for the market, and only certain brokers and the counter-parties involved in the joined trade may be provided with related trade details in the logs. Whether or not the information regarding trades executed via the join process may be controlled, for example, via a global, configurable field.</p>
<p id="p-0665" num="0665">According to an exemplary embodiment, brokers of bonds may have the ability to work-up or join a trade in progress on behalf of a trader or of their own site account, but may not have the option to automatically join in the trade.</p>
<p id="p-0666" num="0666"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 96</figref> shows an exemplary live trade dialog <b>9600</b> for inviting a broker to work-up a live trade for bonds.

<p id="p-0667" num="0667">The exemplary live trade dialog <b>9600</b> may be presented to a broker if the broker clicks on a flashing field price that is being traded. Multiple brokers may be permitted to work-up or join on the same trade opportunity. Accordingly, restrictions on brokers per desk may not be enforced. However, only one order per trader may be permitted in a join or a work-up opportunity. If both a trader and a broker acting on the trader's behalf participate on the same joint trade, only the first order received is processed, and the other order is ignored. The priority bucket of the order posted by a broker is the one of the trader's on whose behalf he acts; it is not of the broker's when acting on behalf of his own site.</p>
<p id="p-0668" num="0668"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 97</figref> shows in table form exemplary scenarios for each priority tier P1 to P6 in which an invitation to work-up or join a trade for bonds is possible and how it may occur. In particular, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 97</figref>, either a buyer or seller who qualifies to trade at the P1 or P3 priority tier levels may be invited to work-up the trade as a buyer or seller with the option to buy more or sell more of the traded interest in size increments of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15 or 20 M units. Likewise, a buyer or seller who qualifies to trade at the P2, P5 and P6 priority tier levels may be invited to join the trade as a buyer or seller with the option to buy or sell the traded interest in size increments of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15 or 20 M units.</p>

<p id="p-0677" num="0677">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, traders of certain interests, including credit default swaps (CDS), may &#x201c;Deal-By-Volume&#x201d;, that is, such traders may hit or lift multiple standing bids/offers all at once simultaneously. In particular, the traders may simultaneously trade against two or more standing orders, at one or more price levels, based on certain rules and conditions described below.</p>
<p id="p-0678" num="0678">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, credit default swap (CDS) interests may be enabled for a &#x201c;Deal-By-Volume&#x201d; (DBV) trade at the best price level. In addition, an entity-level setting may indicate whether or not traders may be permitted to &#x201c;Deal By Volume&#x201d; (DBV) at multiple price levels. Depending on this entity setting, traders may simultaneously hit or lift multiple bids/offers at either the best price level only, or at multiple price levels within the depth.</p>
<p id="p-0679" num="0679">An exemplary hit or lift dialog for traders may provide a more user-friendly interface for single-order executions, as well as multi-execution Deal-By-Volume (DBV) trades. Here, the desired volume may be made by combining orders at multiple price levels, in which the system computes and displays the execution price as a Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of the selected orders. In this regard, when a &#x201c;Deal-By-Volume&#x201d; (DBV) trade is submitted, the system may generate an execution for each unique combination of buyer, price, and seller.</p>
<p id="p-0680" num="0680">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a default setting entitled &#x201c;Multi-Price Deal-By-Volume&#x201d; (MP-DBV) at the entity level for the credit default swap (CDS) product line may be used to indicate whether or not traders may simultaneously execute orders at multiple price levels for credit default swap (CDS) interests against each entity. The Multi-Price Deal-By-Volume (MP-DBV) setting may appear below the &#x201c;Hold on Execution&#x201d; setting on the credit default swap (CDS) entity defaults page. In this regard, the Multi-Price Deal-By-Volume (MP-DBV) setting may be a Boolean value (e.g., Yes/No), and may be administered via a checkbox, which defaults to unchecked (e.g., No) for new entities, so a data administrator may need to explicitly check this setting when desired.</p>
<p id="p-0681" num="0681">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, when the Multi-Price Deal-By-Volume (MP-DBV) setting is unchecked, traders may simultaneously hit or lift multiple bids/offers provided that the traders all have a price that matches the best available price.

The exemplary Hit/Lift dialog <b>10</b>,<b>000</b> may appear in the center of the trader's main window but may be moved by the trader to a different location, and may persist in this location as with other desktop settings for the trader. The exemplary Hit/Lift dialog <b>10</b>,<b>000</b> may display the particular side of the trade, details of the selected interest, the depth of market including orders and sizes available for execution on that side, a status box, the execution details and conditions, and processing buttons. The exemplary Hit/Lift dialog box <b>10</b>,<b>000</b> may automatically adjust in height to accommodate the orders currently in the depth on the selected side.</p>
<p id="p-0683" num="0683">The exemplary Hit/Lift dialog <b>10</b>,<b>000</b> may provide a color-coded verb in large bold capital letters appearing within a rounded box frame at the top of the exemplary dialog <b>10</b>,<b>000</b> to indicate a trade direction. In particular, the direction &#x2018;BUYING&#x2019; may appear in blue font, and the direction &#x2018;SELLING&#x2019; appear in red font. On multi-legged interests, there may be a separate directional indicator for each leg, preceding the description of that leg.</p>
<p id="p-0684" num="0684">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, if the trader hit a bid for a single credit default swap (CDS), the direction may display &#x201c;SELLING&#x201d;, whereas if the trader lifted an offer for a single credit default swap (CDS), the direction may display &#x201c;BUYING&#x201d;. If the trader hit a bid on a multi-legged credit default swap (CDS), the direction on the first leg may read the direction &#x201c;SELLING&#x201d;, and the direction on the second leg may display &#x201c;BUYING&#x201d;. Conversely, if the trader lifted an offer on a multi-legged credit default swap (CDS), the direction on the first leg may display &#x201c;BUYING&#x201d;, and the direction on the second leg may display &#x201c;SELLING&#x201d;.</p>

The label &#x201c;Ref Ob:&#x201d; may be provided on the second row in small grey font below the main interest details field followed by the name description of the default reference obligation for the entity on the leg. On multi-legged interests, a thin light-grey dividing line may appear between the descriptions of the two legs. Here, for example, the information on each row of the box displaying the trade direction and interest description may be centered.</p>
<p id="p-0686" num="0686">A table displaying the size, price, and an eligibility icon for each executable order in the depth on the selected side and interest, may appear within a separate box frame on the left side of the exemplary Hit/Lift dialog <b>10</b>,<b>000</b>, below the trade direction and interest box. In this regard, the executable depth may be shown for the selected side of the interest with the best bid or offer at the top, and the worst bid or offer at the bottom. According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, for price-quoted interests, on the bid side, the highest bid is the best, and the lowest bid is the worst, whereas on the offer side, the lowest bid is the best, and the highest offer is the worst. By contrast, for spread-quoted interests, on the bid side, the lowest bid is the best, and the highest bid is the worst, whereas on the offer side, the highest offer is the best, and the lowest offer is the worst. In this regard, a credit default swap (CDS) may be quoted, for example, as a price-quoted interest, and a bond may be quoted, for example, as either a price-quoted interest or a spread-quoted interest.</p>
<p id="p-0687" num="0687">Each row may display the size, price, and a hit/lift eligibility icon for each order in the depth. Orders that can be simultaneously hit or lifted by the aggressor may have a &#x201c;&#x221a;&#x201d; icon indicating that they are eligible for inclusion in the Deal-By-Volume (DBV) trade. For non-Multi-Price Deal-By-Volume (MP-DBV)-enabled interests, orders below those at the best available price may not be eligible for simultaneous trading in the Deal-By-Volume (DBV) execution, and may therefore have an &#x201c;x&#x201d; icon. Orders selected for execution may be shaded in a different background color to visually distinguish them from unselected and/or unavailable orders. Aggressing traders may be required to execute the entire size of each selected order, i.e., aggressive traders may not be permitted to perform partial executions against standing orders. Hitting or lifting an order other than the one at the top may automatically select all orders above it to be hit/lifted as well. Accordingly, when the exemplary Hit/Lift dialog <b>10</b>,<b>000</b> is opened, the order selected for execution in the price sheet, as well as all orders that appear above it in the depth, may be auto-checked by default.</p>
<p id="p-0688" num="0688">If a submitted Deal-By-Volume (DBV) trade fails due to changes in the market, the user may be informed via an appropriate message in the status box <b>10</b>,<b>003</b>, along with a refreshed view of the depth with the selection set to the first eligible order only. In particular, the status box <b>10</b>,<b>003</b> may display informational messages when a submitted Deal-By-Volume (DBV) trade fails due to market changes. For example, if an order change or cancellation makes it impossible to fulfill the requested Deal-By-Volume (DBV) size at a Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) that is equal to or better than the specified price, the status box <b>10</b>,<b>003</b> may display the following message: Underlying market changed. Your execution was not successful. Please try again.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0689" num="0689">A separate rounded box frame <b>10</b>,<b>004</b> below the size selection grid on the right side may include certain trade details. In particular, such a box frame <b>10</b>,<b>004</b> may display the total selected trade size, which defaults to the sum of the full sizes of all the bids/offers that have been selected for execution in the depth table. The trader may change the requested size by changing his selections in the depth table. Also displayed is the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) for the desired trade, which defaults to the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of the orders initially selected for execution, and may be dynamically updated to reflect changes to selected orders in the depth table (described below). An &#x201c;All or None&#x201d; (AON) checkbox icon may be provided to indicate whether or not the trader is willing to accept a partial execution of the desired total trade size, which may be unchecked by default. When checked, the system may process the trade only if the system is able to satisfy the trade request for the entire size at the specified Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) price or better. A &#x201c;Hit/Lift&#x201d; button may be provided to submit the trade. A &#x201c;[Cancel]&#x201d; button or &#x201c;[x]&#x201d; may close the exemplary dialog <b>10</b>,<b>000</b> without submitting any trades.</p>
<p id="p-0690" num="0690">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, an interactive trader may log in and select a quoted credit default swap (CDS) interest within one of his workspaces. Thereafter, the trader may hit a bid or lift an offer on the selected interest. In this regard, if the Multi-Price Deal-By-Volume (MP-DBV) setting is enabled for the selected interest, the trader may select any available order for execution. However, if Multi-Price Deal-By-Volume (MP-DBV) is not enabled for the selected interest, the trader may select orders only at the best available price level on either side for execution, and hence, selection of a non-best price from the depth may not be possible. The exemplary Hit/Lift dialog <b>10</b>,<b>000</b> may be presented for the selected interest, which displays the depth with the selected bid/offer, as well as all executable bids/offers above it in the depth, auto-selected for execution.</p>
<p id="p-0691" num="0691">When a trader hits a bid or lifts an offer, if the trader is positioned on a non-executable bid, or offer, the hit or lift may be assumed to be against the first executable bid or offer in the depth. A trader hit/lift dialog may open up with the bid or offer that was hit or lifted as well as all executable bids or offers above it in the depth selected for trading. The total size of the trade may be set to the sum of the full sizes of the orders selected for execution.</p>
<p id="p-0692" num="0692">The Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) (execution price) may be set to the calculated weighted average price of the orders selected for execution. The depth table may display all the prices, sizes and eligibility of all executable orders on the selected side for the interest per the rules (discussed below). At this point, if the trader just submits the trade without making any changes, and the selected orders are still available for execution, the related execution records may be generated. The trader may change the desired size either by checking or unchecking one or more of the orders eligible for Deal-By-Volume (DBV) execution in the depth table. Each time the trade size is altered, the system may dynamically recalculate the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) for execution as more fully described below. The trader may then submit the trade either by pressing &#x201c;&#x3c;Enter&#x3e;&#x201d;, or the &#x201c;Hit/Lift&#x201d; button. At this point, if the selected prices and sizes are still available, the trade may be processed, the related execution record/s may be generated, and the exemplary dialog box <b>10</b>,<b>000</b> may be closed.</p>
<p id="p-0693" num="0693">When a Deal-By-Volume (DBV) is successfully sent and processed, certain related events may occur. For example, the system may generate an execution record for each unique combination of price, buyer and seller, the executed prices may be removed from the market, and the unfilled portion of the requested size from a non-AON Deal-By-Volume (DBV) trade may be ignored. Additionally, a trade log may be provided, which displays a message for each related execution, and the users who have elected to be alerted may receive the related trade alert pop-ups.</p>
<p id="p-0694" num="0694">For any given interest, certain rules may determine whether or not an order is executable by the aggressor, and whether or not the order is eligible for Deal-By-Volume (DBV) execution. In particular, all posted firm orders in the depth that do not belong to the aggressor's institution may be deemed to be executable by him, and the order's eligibility for inclusion in a Deal-By-Volume (DBV) trade may depend on the definition of the reference entity on the selected interest. For example, if the entity on the selected interest is Multi-Price Deal-By-Volume (MP-DBV)-enabled, then all orders may be eligible for inclusion in a Deal-By-Volume (DBV) execution. By contrast, if the entity on the selected interest is not enabled for Multi-Price Deal-By-Volume (MP-DBV), then all orders at the best price level only may be eligible for inclusion in the Deal-By-Volume (DBV) trade.</p>
<p id="p-0695" num="0695">In the exemplary trader hit/lift dialog <b>10</b>,<b>000</b>, the system may determine the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) according to certain rules. For example, when the trade is executed against a single order, the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) may be set to the price of that order. When a Deal-By-Volume (DBV) trade is executed against more than one order at the same price level, the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) may be set to the price of the first eligible order.</p>
<p id="p-0696" num="0696">When a Deal-By-Volume (DBV) trade involves two or more orders at two or more price levels, the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) may be calculated according to certain rules. For example, the cost attributable to each order involved in the trade may be computed by multiplying the size of the order by the price of the order. For up-front interests, the cost calculation may performed, only by multiplying the size of each order by the up-front portion of the price. In this regard, it is assumed that the running points are constant, and therefore there may be no need to include the running points in the calculation of the average price. The individual costs of the orders involved in the trade may then be added together to compute the total trade cost. The total trade cost may then be divided by the total size to compute the Volume-Weighted Average Price, (i.e., the average execution price). For up-front interests, the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) may be set to the calculated average price (of the up-front portions only), plus the running points of the best bid/offer. If the total size is adjusted up or down by selecting or deselecting one or more eligible orders, the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) may be dynamically re-calculated and updated within the dialog.</p>
<p id="p-0697" num="0697">If the underlying market conditions change between the time a trader first opens the hit/lift dialog <b>10</b>,<b>000</b> and the subsequent submission of his Deal-By-Volume (DBV) trade request, the system may handle the situation according to certain rules. For example, on an &#x201c;All or None&#x201d; (AON) trade, the system may attempt to fill the exact requested size from the updated depth at an equivalent or better Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) without generating any partial executions against standing orders. If this is not possible, the trade may be rejected. On a non-AON trade, by contrast, the system may attempt to fill the requested size either partially, or fully, from the updated depth at an equivalent or better Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) without generating partial executions against the standing order(s). If even a partial execution is not possible, the trade may be rejected. On interests against entities that are not enabled for Multi-Price Deal-By-Volume (MPDBV) trades, the Deal-By-Volume (DBV) trade request may be rejected if it cannot be performed at a single price level that is equal to or better than the requested Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP).</p>
<p id="p-0698" num="0698">If a Deal-By-Volume (DBV) trade is rejected as a result of changes in the underlying market, the exemplary hit/lift dialog <b>10</b>,<b>000</b> may remain open, and may be updated with certain information. For example, the status box <b>10</b>,<b>003</b> may display the following message: &#x201c;Underlying market changed. Your execution was not successful. Please try again&#x201d;. Additionally, the depth table may be refreshed with the current market orders, the first eligible order may be auto-selected for execution, the Total Size and Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) fields may be set to display the size and price of the first eligible order, and The &#x201c;All or None&#x201d; (AON) field may be unchecked.</p>
<p id="p-0699" num="0699">Several &#x201c;Concurrent Event&#x201d; (CE) scenarios may affect how the Deal-By-Volume (DBV) feature operates. For example, according to one exemplary concurrent event, an order that is selected for an &#x201c;All or None&#x201d; (AON) Deal-By-Volume (DBV) trade may be held. Here, if the aggressor subsequently submits a Deal-By-Volume (DBV) trade request, the system may then attempt to fill the entire requested size from the remaining depth at an equivalent or better Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) without generating partial executions against the standing order(s). If the system succeeds in filling the trade from the remaining depth the trade request may be processed. Otherwise, if the system fails to satisfy the trade request, the trade may be rejected.</p>
<p id="p-0700" num="0700">In another exemplary concurrent event, an order that is selected for a non-AON Deal-By-Volume (DBV) trade may be held. Here, if the aggressor subsequently submits the Deal-By-Volume (DBV) trade request, the system may then attempt to fill all or part of the requested size from the remaining depth at an equivalent or better Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) without generating any partial executions against standing orders. If the system succeeds in filling all or some of the requested trade size from the remaining depth, the trade request may be processed.

<p id="p-0701" num="0701">In another exemplary concurrent event, a new order may be submitted on the same side with a better price than one or more of the orders selected for an &#x201c;All or None&#x201d; (AON) Deal-By-Volume (DBV) trade. Here, if the aggressor subsequently submits the Deal-By-Volume (DBV) trade request and if the new order is executable by the aggressor and is eligible for Deal-By-Volume (DBV) execution, then the system may perform certain actions. For example, the system may deselect all previously selected orders at the &#x201c;worse&#x201d; price levels in the depth queue and include the new order in the execution, provided that the overall order size when combined with the sizes of all previously selected orders above the new order in the depth queue does not exceed the total requested size. The system may also make up any remaining size deficit by selecting one or more orders at worse price levels to exactly match the total requested size. If the system succeeds in coming up with an order combination including the new order that equals the total size requested, then the trade may be processed at a better than requested Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP). However, if the system fails to satisfy the trade request, the trade may be rejected.</p>

Since this a Deal-By-Volume (DBV) situation, there may be multiple Initiators whose prices were either hit or lifted by the Aggressor (e.g., trader or broker acting on behalf of the trader). The multiple Initiators joined in the trade after the Deal-By-Volume (DBV) execution may be ranked in the P1 priority tier on the Initiator's side of the trade or the P3 priority tier on the Aggressor's side of the trade. The ranking may be based on the time of posting the standing order, that is, the earlier the price was posted, the higher the ranking.</p>
<p id="p-0728" num="0728"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 108</figref> shows in table form exemplary scenarios for each priority tier P1 to P6 in which an invitation to work-up or join a trade for bonds after a Deal-By-Volume (DBV) is possible and how it may occur. In particular, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 108</figref>, either a buyer or seller who qualifies to trade at the P1 or P3 priority tier levels may be invited to work-up the trade as a buyer or seller with the option to buy more or sell more in size increments of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15 or 20 units. Likewise, a buyer or seller who qualifies to trade at the P2, P5 and P6 priority tier levels may be invited to join the trade as a buyer or seller with the option to buy or sell in size increments of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15 or 20 units.</p>
