<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Embodiments of the invention generally relate to controlling a wind turbine comprising blades attached to a rotor hub for rotation in a rotor plane and a control system for individually pitching the blades relative to the hub with the aim of reducing the risk of single or successive extreme loads on the blades, tower or other wind turbine components.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In recent years, there has been an increased focus on reducing emissions of greenhouse gases generated by burning fossil fuels. One solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions is developing renewable sources of energy. Particularly, energy derived from the wind has proven to be an environmentally safe and reliable source of energy, which can reduce dependence on fossil fuels.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Energy in wind can be captured by a wind turbine, which is a rotating machine that converts the kinetic energy of the wind into mechanical energy, and the mechanical energy subsequently into electrical power. Common horizontal-axis wind turbines include a tower, a nacelle located at the apex of the tower, and a rotor that is supported in the nacelle by means of a shaft. The shaft couples the rotor either directly or indirectly with a rotor assembly of a generator housed inside the nacelle. A plurality of wind turbines generators may be arranged together in a wind park or wind power plant to generate sufficient energy to support a grid.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Most modern wind turbines are controlled and regulated continuously most often with the purpose of ensuring maximum power extraction from the wind under the current wind, and weather, while at the same time ensuring that the loads on the different components of the wind turbine are at any time kept within acceptable limits. To accomplish this, a number of parameters are collected and monitored by the controllers in a wind turbine, such as, for instance, the current wind speed and direction, the rotational speed of the rotor, the pitch angle of each blade, the yaw angle, information on the grid system, and measured parameters (e.g. stresses or vibrations) from sensors placed e.g. on the blades, the nacelle, or on the tower.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Based on these and following some control strategy the optimal control parameters of the turbine in order to perform optimally under the given conditions are determined. The current performance, and thereby the power production and the load situation of the wind turbine is primarily controlled by controlling the pitch angles of the blades, but may further include adjusting for instance any different active aerodynamic devices for changing the aerodynamic surfaces of the blades such as flaps or vortex generating means, adjusting the power, and/or adjusting the rotational speed of the rotor.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Wind turbines are traditionally constructed and controlled according to standards and according to wind maps and incorporating the trade-off of maximizing the annual energy production by the wind turbine while on the same time ensuring a certain life time of the turbine i.e. keeping the loads on the different components of the wind turbine within acceptable limits at all times and over time. Wind turbines are therefore typically designed according to a certain (high) turbulence but will most often be operating at a lower turbulence level and may in some conditions be controlled too conservative, while in some conditions not conservative enough resulting in undesired fatigue or extreme loads on the wind turbine components, especially the blades, nacelle and tower.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the invention generally relate to controlling a wind turbine comprising blades attached to a rotor hub for rotation in a rotor plane and a control system for individually pitching the blades relative to the hub with the aim of reducing the risk of single or successive extreme loads on the blades, tower or other wind turbine components.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One embodiment of the invention provides a method for controlling a wind turbine. The method generally comprises determining one or more properties of wind in a first section of a plane in front of a wind turbine rotor plane, and determining expected one or more properties of wind in a second section of the wind turbine rotor plane based on the one or more properties of wind determined in the first section. The method further comprises determining a pitch angle of the second section based on the expected one or more properties of wind in the second section, and adjusting a pitch angle of a wind turbine blade to the pitch angle of the second section as the wind turbine blade passes through the second section.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another embodiment of the invention provides a wind turbine, generally comprising a rotor comprising at least one blade, wherein a rotor plane of the rotor is divided into a plurality of predefined sections, a light detection and ranging (LIDAR) device configured to measure one or more properties of wind in a plurality of predefined sections of a plane in front of the rotor plane, wherein each section of the plane in front of the rotor plane corresponds to a section of the rotor plane, and a controller. The controller is generally configured to receive, from the LIDAR device, one or more properties of wind in a first section of the plurality of predefined sections of the plane in front of the rotor plane, and determine expected one or more properties of wind in a second section of the plurality of predefined sections of the rotor plane, wherein the first section corresponds to the second section. The controller is further configured to determine a pitch angle of the second section based on the expected one or more properties of wind in the second section, and adjust a pitch angle of the at least one blade to the pitch angle of the second section as the blade passes through the second section.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Yet another embodiment of the invention provides a wind turbine controller, generally configured to receive one or more properties of wind in a first section of a plurality of predefined sections of a plane in front of a rotor plane, and determine expected one or more properties of wind in a second section of a plurality of predefined sections of the rotor plane, wherein the first section corresponds to the second section. The controller is further configured to determine a pitch angle of the second section based on the expected one or more properties of wind in the second section, and adjust a pitch angle of a wind turbine blade to the pitch angle of the second section as the wind turbine blade passes through the second section.</p>

In alternative embodiments, the wind turbine <b>100</b> may be an off shore wind turbine located over a water body such as, for example, a lake, an ocean, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The tower <b>110</b> of wind turbine <b>100</b> may be configured to raise the nacelle <b>120</b> and the rotor <b>130</b> to a height where strong, less turbulent, and generally unobstructed flow of air may be received by the rotor <b>130</b>. The height of the tower <b>110</b> may be any reasonable height. The tower <b>110</b> may be made from any type of material, for example, steel, concrete, or the like. In some embodiments the tower <b>110</b> may be made from a monolithic material. However, in alternative embodiments, the tower <b>110</b> may include a plurality of sections, for example, two or more tubular steel sections <b>111</b> and <b>112</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In some embodiments of the invention, the tower <b>110</b> may be a lattice tower. Accordingly, the tower <b>110</b> may include welded steel profiles.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The rotor <b>130</b> may include a rotor hub (hereinafter referred to simply as the &#x201c;hub&#x201d;) <b>131</b> and at least one blade <b>132</b> (three such blades <b>132</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The rotor hub <b>131</b> may be configured to couple the at least one blade <b>132</b> to a shaft (not shown). In one embodiment, the blades <b>132</b> may have an aerodynamic profile such that, at predefined wind speeds, the blades <b>132</b> experience lift, thereby causing the blades to radially rotate around the hub. The nacelle <b>120</b> may include one or more components configured to convert aero-mechanical energy of the blades to rotational energy of the shaft, and the rotational energy of the shaft into electrical energy.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also depicts a wind sensor <b>123</b>. Wind sensor <b>123</b> may be configured to detect a direction of the wind at or near the wind turbine <b>100</b>. By detecting the direction of the wind, the wind sensor <b>123</b> may provide useful data that may determine operations to yaw the wind turbine <b>100</b> into the wind. The wind sensor <b>123</b> may use the speed and/or direction of the wind to control the blade pitch angle. Wind speed data may be used to determine an appropriate pitch angle that allows the blades <b>132</b> to capture a desired amount of energy from the wind or to avoid excessive loads on turbine components. In some embodiments, the wind sensor <b>123</b> may be integrated with a temperature sensor, pressure sensor, and the like, which may provide additional data regarding the environment surrounding the wind turbine. Such data may be used to determine one or more operational parameters of the wind turbine to facilitate capturing of a desired amount of energy by the wind turbine <b>100</b> or to avoid damage to components of the wind turbine.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment of the invention, a light detection and ranging (LIDAR) device <b>180</b> may be provided on or near the wind turbine <b>100</b>. For example, the LIDAR <b>180</b> may be placed on a nacelle, hub, and/or tower of the wind turbine, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In alternative embodiments, the LIDAR <b>180</b> may be placed in one or more blades <b>132</b> of the wind turbine <b>100</b>. In some other embodiments, the LIDAR device may be placed near the wind turbine <b>100</b>, for example, on the ground as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In general, the LIDAR <b>180</b> may be configured to detect wind speed and/or direction at one or more points in front of the wind turbine <b>100</b>. In other words, the LIDAR <b>180</b> may allow the wind turbine to detect wind speed before the wind actually reaches the wind turbine. This may allow wind turbine <b>100</b> to proactively adjust one or more of blade pitch angle, generator torque, yaw position, and like operational parameters to capture greater energy from the wind, reduce loads on turbine components, and the like. In some embodiments, a controller may be configured to combine the data received from a LIDAR device <b>180</b> and the wind sensor <b>123</b> to generate a more accurate measure of wind speed and/or direction.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a diagrammatic view of typical components internal to the nacelle <b>120</b> and tower <b>110</b> of a wind turbine generator <b>100</b>. When the wind <b>200</b> pushes on the blades <b>132</b>, the rotor <b>130</b> spins, thereby rotating a low-speed shaft <b>202</b>. Gears in a gearbox <b>204</b> mechanically convert the low rotational speed of the low-speed shaft <b>202</b> into a relatively high rotational speed of a high-speed shaft <b>208</b> suitable for generating electricity using a generator <b>206</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the gear box may be omitted, and a single shaft, e.g., the shaft <b>202</b> may be directly coupled with the generator <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A controller <b>210</b> may sense the rotational speed of one or both of the shafts <b>202</b>, <b>208</b>. If the controller decides that the shaft(s) are rotating too fast, the controller may signal a braking system <b>212</b> to slow the rotation of the shafts, which slows the rotation of the rotor <b>130</b>, in turn. The braking system <b>212</b> may prevent damage to the components of the wind turbine generator <b>100</b>. The controller <b>210</b> may also receive inputs from an anemometer <b>214</b> (providing wind speed) and/or a wind vane <b>216</b> (providing wind direction). Based on information received, the controller <b>210</b> may send a control signal to one or more of the blades <b>132</b> in an effort to adjust the pitch <b>218</b> of the blades. By adjusting the pitch <b>218</b> of the blades with respect to the wind direction, the rotational speed of the rotor (and therefore, the shafts <b>202</b>, <b>208</b>) may be increased or decreased. Based on the wind direction, for example, the controller <b>210</b> may send a control signal to an assembly comprising a yaw motor <b>220</b> and a yaw drive <b>222</b> to rotate the nacelle <b>120</b> with respect to the tower <b>110</b>, such that the rotor <b>130</b> may be positioned to face more (or, in certain circumstances, less) upwind or downwind (if it is a downwind turbine).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The generator <b>206</b> may be configured to generate a three phase alternating current based on one or more grid requirements. In one embodiment, the generator <b>206</b> may be a synchronous generator. Synchronous generators may be configured to operate at a constant speed, and may be directly connected to the grid. In some embodiments, the generator <b>206</b> may be a permanent magnet generator. In alternative embodiments, the generator <b>206</b> may be an asynchronous generator, also sometimes known as an induction generator. Induction generators may or may not be directly connected to the grid. For example, in some embodiments, the generator <b>206</b> may be coupled to the grid via one or more electrical devices configured to, for example, adjust current, voltage, and other electrical parameters to conform with one or more grid requirements. Exemplary electrical devices include, for example, inverters, converters, resistors, switches, transformers, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Embodiments of the invention are not limited to any particular type of generator or arrangement of the generator and one or more electrical devices associated with the generator in relation to the electrical grid. Any suitable type of generator including (but not limited to) induction generators, permanent magnet generators, synchronous generators, or the like, configured to generate electricity according to grid requirements falls within the purview of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also illustrates an exemplary hub mounted LIDAR <b>180</b> according to an embodiment of the invention. While shown on the hub in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in alternative embodiments, the LIDAR device <b>180</b> may be placed on or near any location of the turbine, e.g., on the ground, in the blades, on the nacelle, on the tower, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Embodiments of the invention generally relate to controlling wind turbine blades attached to a rotor hub for rotation in a rotor plane, and a control system for individually pitching the blades relative to the hub with the aim of increasing energy capture and/or reducing the risk of single or successive extreme loads on the blades, tower or other wind turbine components. As wind turbine rotors continue to increase in size the variation in wind speeds experienced in different parts of the rotor plane has also increased. Accordingly, while one section of the rotor plane may experience a wind gust that may damage components of the wind turbine, other sections of the rotor plane may experience more acceptable wind speeds. Therefore, embodiments of the invention provide methods and systems for individually pitching wind turbine blades depending on the section of the rotor plane in which the blade is passing through. To facilitate such control, the rotor plane may be divided into a plurality of predefined sections.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a method for dividing the rotor plane <b>300</b> of a wind turbine into a number of sectors <b>301</b> according to an embodiment of the invention. In this example, the rotor plane <b>300</b> is divided into 12 equally sized rotor sectors <b>301</b>. The rotor blades <b>302</b> denominated A, B, and C are outlined in a position where the rotor blade A is in the first sector (<b>301</b>,<b>1</b>), the rotor blade B is in sector <b>5</b> (<b>301</b>,<b>2</b>), and the third rotor blade C is in sector number <b>8</b> (<b>301</b>,<b>3</b>). The vertical line <b>305</b> illustrates the tower axis of the wind turbine.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In order to reduce the risk of inducing tilt/yaw moments by the individual pitch control method according to the invention, the number of sectors may advantageously be set according to the following rule thereby ensuring that all blades change sectors synchronously:</p>

That is, for e.g. N<sub>S</sub>=12, sector <b>2</b> is defined for azimuth angles in the interval [30&#xb0;; 60&#xb0;]. Embodiments of the invention are not limited by the specific method of dividing the rotor plane described hereinabove. In alternative embodiments, any method may be used to define any number of rotor plane section, wherein each section may have any size, shape, etc.
</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">By defining one or more rotor sections, a controller (e.g., the controller <b>210</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of the wind turbine may determine a predefined pitch angle for each rotor section based on wind properties that are experienced or expected in that section. For example, rotor sections experiencing wind gusts may have predefined pitch angles that mitigate loads on a blade passing therethrough. In other section, the blade pitch angle may be selected such that maximum energy is captured from the wind. As each wind turbine blade rotates through the rotor plane, passing through multiple predefined rotor sections, the blade pitch angle may be adjusted to the corresponding pitch angle for the section through which it is passing, thereby allowing for maximum energy capture and/or preventing damage to wind turbine components.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, it may be desirable to proactively adjust pitch angles of blades based on expected wind conditions in a given section of the rotor plane. Such proactive adjustments may be more advantageous than reactive adjustments because they may improve the life of wind turbine components by reducing exposure to damaging loads.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment of the invention, a wind sensing device, for example the LIDAR <b>180</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be used to determine wind properties ahead of a rotor plane. Exemplary wind properties may include wind direction, wind speed, turbulence, or the like. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an exemplary wind turbine <b>400</b> having a rotor plane <b>401</b>. The rotor plane <b>401</b> may be divided into a predefined number of sections using, for example, the method described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In one embodiment, a LIDAR unit <b>410</b> may be configured to determine wind properties in a rotor plane <b>402</b> a predefined distance R from the rotor plane <b>401</b>, as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In particular, the LIDAR unit <b>410</b> may be configured to determine wind properties in predefined sections on the rotor plane <b>402</b> (e.g., the sections v<b>1</b>, v<b>2</b>, v<b>3</b> . . . ). In one embodiment, the rotor plane <b>402</b> may be the same size as the rotor plane <b>401</b>. However, in alternative embodiments, the rotor planes <b>401</b> and <b>402</b> may have different sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Each predefined section of the rotor plane <b>402</b> may correspond to a respective predefined section in rotor plane <b>401</b>. Therefore, the measurement of wind properties in a section of rotor plane <b>402</b> may indicate the expected wind properties at a corresponding section of rotor plane <b>401</b> in the future. Therefore, a controller of the wind turbine <b>400</b> may be able to proactively adjust operational parameters, e.g., pitch angle, for the corresponding sector of rotor plane <b>401</b> to, for example, increase energy capture, prevent damage, or the like. In one embodiment, the mapping between the sections of rotor plane <b>401</b> and sections of rotor plane <b>402</b> may be a static mapping that is predefined. However, in alternative embodiments, the mapping between sections of rotor planes <b>401</b> and <b>402</b> may be dynamically determined based on, for example, a model defining transformation of the wind field between the rotor plane <b>402</b> and <b>401</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an exemplary view of components within a LIDAR <b>180</b> according to an embodiment of the invention. As illustrated, LIDAR <b>180</b> may include an emitter <b>510</b>, a detector <b>520</b>, and a processing block <b>530</b>. While a single emitter detector pair <b>510</b>-<b>520</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in alternative embodiments, the LIDAR <b>180</b> may include any number of emitters and/or detectors. For example, different emitter-detector pairs may be configured to measure wind properties in different one or more sections of a rotor plane <b>402</b>. In one embodiment of the invention, an emitter-detector may be capable of performing a scanning operation to measure wind properties at a plurality of points, e.g., in different predefined rotor sections of rotor plane <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The emitter <b>510</b> may be configured to generate a light beam. For example, in one embodiment, LIDAR <b>180</b> may be configured to emit an ultra violet, visible, near infra-red and/or infra-red light beam. The detector <b>520</b> may be configured to detect backscattering of the light beam emitted by the emitter from one or more objects. The processing block <b>530</b> may be configured to determine one or more properties of the backscattered light detected by detector <b>520</b> and determine one or more properties of the one or more objects from which the light beam is reflected.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As stated previously, the LIDAR <b>180</b> may be used to measure wind speed and/or direction at a remote location. Knowledge about the wind speed and direction at a remote location, e.g., in front of a rotor of a wind turbine, may allow the wind turbine to optimize one or more operational parameters such as blade pitch angle and/or generator torque to reduce loads on wind turbine components and/or increase energy capture. To measure the wind speed remotely, a light beam (e.g., a Laser beam) may be emitted into oncoming wind by, for example, emitter <b>510</b> of the LIDAR <b>180</b>. The emitted light may reflect off of aerosols (e.g., pollen, dust) in the wind and may be scattered in multiple directions. A portion of the scattered light may travel back to the LIDAR <b>180</b>, and may be detected by, e.g., the detector <b>520</b> of LIDAR <b>180</b>. Based on the backscattered light, one or more properties of the aerosols may be determined by the processing block <b>530</b>. For example, the processing block <b>530</b> may use the Doppler Effect to determine properties of the aerosols. Because the properties of the aerosols strongly correlate with the property of the wind carrying the aerosols, properties of the wind, e.g. wind speed and direction, may be determined based on the properties of the aerosols.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an exemplary control system <b>600</b> according to an embodiment of the invention. As illustrated, control system <b>600</b> may include a feed forward control block (FFC) <b>610</b>, a feedback control block (FBC) <b>620</b>, a pitch controller <b>630</b>, and a wind turbine rotor <b>640</b>. In one embodiment, the FFC block <b>610</b>, FBC <b>620</b>, and pitch controller <b>630</b> may be a part of a larger control system or controller, for example, the controller <b>210</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. For each predefined section of the rotor plane of the wind turbine, the FFC <b>610</b> may be configured to receive, from a LIDAR unit, one or more wind properties measured in a corresponding section of a plane in front of the rotor (as described above). The FFC block <b>610</b> may determine a desired pitch angle for the predefined section of the rotor plane based on the measured wind properties. The desired pitch angle may be determined based on capturing maximum energy from the wind, and/or avoiding damage to wind turbine components, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The FBC block <b>620</b> may be configured to receive blade load sensor readings from the wind turbine rotor <b>640</b>. The FBC may also receive blade azimuth angle readings for each blade. Therefore, the FBC may be configured to determine blade load in each predefined section of the rotor. Based on actual blade loads experienced in each predefined section of the rotor plane, the FBC block <b>620</b> may be configured to determine the desired pitch angle for each wind turbine section. The FBC block provides real time feedback on actual loads experienced by the wind turbine blades, thereby allowing further fine tuning of pitch angles that are defined for each section of the rotor plane based on expected wind properties. While the FBC block <b>620</b> provides distinct advantages, in some embodiments of the invention, the FBC block <b>620</b> may be omitted, and the pitch angle for each section of the wind turbine rotor plane may be determined based on LIDAR measurements alone.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one embodiment, the output of the FFC block <b>610</b> and FBC block <b>620</b> may be combined by, for example, computing an average or weighted average of the outputs A. The combined output may be provided to a pitch controller <b>630</b>. The pitch controller <b>630</b> may be configured to determine the location of each blade as it moves through the rotor plane, and adjust the blade pitch angle of each blade based on predefined blade pitch angles determined for each section of the rotor plane. In one embodiment, the blade pitch angles for each rotor plane section may be derived from the combined output A from the FFC <b>610</b> and FBC <b>620</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In one embodiment, the combined output A may be an offset value that may be applied to a common pitch reference signal that may be determined for all blades of a turbine. For example, the pitch controller may determine based on average wind conditions detected by, for example, a wind sensor, that all blades of the wind turbine should have a common pitch angle X. Thereafter, based on the outputs of the FFC <b>610</b> and FBC <b>620</b>, the pitch controller may adjust the common pitch angle by the offset value A for a given rotor plane section to alleviate loads, increase energy capture or the like, when a blade passes through that section.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flow diagram of exemplary operations performed by a controller of a wind turbine, according to an embodiment of the invention. The controller may be, for example, the controller <b>210</b>, control system <b>600</b>, or the like. The operations may begin in step <b>710</b> by determining properties of wind in a first section of a plane in front of a wind turbine rotor plane. The properties of wind expected at a corresponding second section of the wind turbine rotor plane may be determined based on the properties determined in the section of the plane ahead of the wind turbine rotor plane, in step <b>720</b>. In step <b>730</b>, a blade pitch angle may be determined for the section of the wind turbine rotor plane. In step <b>740</b>, the blade pitch angle of each wind turbine blade may be proactively adjusted to the determined blade pitch angle while the blade passes through the section of the wind turbine rotor plane. In some embodiments, step <b>720</b> may be omitted and the blade pitch angle for the section of a rotor plane may be determined simply based upon measurements in a corresponding section in a plane in front of the rotor plane.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> illustrate exemplary pitch control systems according to an embodiment of the invention. In one embodiment, the pitch control systems of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> may be a part of the feed forward controller <b>610</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In general, the pitch control systems may be configured to determine a pitch angle or a pitch offset (for each section of the rotor plane) based on input received from a LIDAR unit. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> illustrates an exemplary pitch control system <b>820</b> according to an embodiment of the invention. As illustrated, the pitch control system <b>820</b> may include a pitch estimator <b>821</b> and a compensation unit <b>822</b>. The pitch estimator <b>821</b> may be configured to receive, as input, one or more parameters measured by a LIDAR unit, e.g., wind speed and wind direction. The pitch estimator <b>821</b> may also be configured to receive the current pitch angle and a blade load reference value as inputs, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. Based on the received inputs, the pitch estimator <b>821</b> may be configured to determine an optimal pitch angle or pitch offset P, which may be transferred to the compensation unit <b>822</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The compensation unit <b>822</b> may be configured to generate a pitch reference signal P<b>1</b> based upon wind field propagation and pitch system dynamics. In other words, the compensation unit may be configured to determine when certain wind conditions can be expected at the rotor plane, and adjust the pitch angles at a given section of the rotor plane based upon the operational conditions of the pitch system.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> illustrates a particular embodiment of the pitch control system <b>820</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>.

The blade load estimator <b>811</b> may be configured to receive, as input, one or more parameters measured by a LIDAR unit, e.g., wind speed and wind direction. The blade load estimator may also be configured to receive the current pitch angle as an input, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>.
