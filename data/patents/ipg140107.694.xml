<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates generally to a mobile platform system and, more particularly, to a mobile platform system for movably supporting an auxiliary component of a gas turbine engine.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Many power systems include a gas turbine engine (&#x201c;GTE&#x201d;) and a power load assembly. The GTE typically includes a compressor section, a combustor section, and a turbine section. The power load assembly is driven by the GTE and is known to include, for example, a pump, a compressor, or an electric generator. Various configurations of support systems are employed to support the GTE and the power load assembly. In some such power systems, the GTE and the power load assembly are both mounted to a common, stationary support structure.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Such a stationary support structure may make replacing or repairing the power system difficult. Removing the GTE from the stationary support structure may involve unfastening the GTE from numerous fixed mounts, which may require considerable time and effort. Additionally, many repair operations may involve separating sections of the GTE from one another, which may require removing the GTE from the stationary support structure. For example, replacing a damaged section of the GTE may require removing the GTE from the stationary support structure, separating the damaged section from the other sections, installing a replacement section, and reassembling the sections of the GTE.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The power system may also include one or more auxiliary components (e.g., a gas fuel module or a liquid fuel module) to facilitate operation of the GTE and power load assembly. It is known to mount the auxiliary components on the stationary support structure. Unfortunately, mounting such auxiliary components in some locations on the stationary support structure may obstruct servicing the auxiliary component and/or other components of the power system.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One example of a power system including a GTE and an auxiliary component mounted on a stationary support structure is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,230,481 (the '481 patent) to Jahr. The '481 patent includes an operating and control system mounted within an internal chamber of a base frame on a sliding module. The module can move between a stored position within the internal chamber of the base frame and a service position outside of the internal chamber of the base frame. In the stored position, the operating and control system may be protected from damage from above by plates of the base frame and may be protected from the side by a pivoting side door. Additionally, the operating and control system is ventilated with an external ventilation device. When the operating and control system requires maintenance or inspection, the operating and control system can move horizontally from the stored position within the internal chamber to the service position outside of the internal chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Although the system of '481 patent allows for horizontal sliding of the operating and control system on the module, certain disadvantages may persist. The system of '481 may be inefficient because inspection of the operating and control system may be undesirably labor intensive. The system of the '481 patent may be expensive and overly complex because employment of the external ventilation system may undesirably increase the cost of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The disclosed mobile platform system is directed to overcoming one or more of the problems set forth above and/or other problems in existing technology.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a system for moving an auxiliary component of a gas turbine engine. The system may include a mobile support platform configured to support the auxiliary component during operation of the gas turbine engine. The system may further include at least one guide assembly operably connected to the mobile support platform and configured to guide movement of the mobile support platform. The system may also include a drive assembly operably connected to the mobile support platform and configured to impart movement of the mobile support platform between an elevated position and a lowered position.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a method of moving one or more sections of a gas turbine engine. The method may include the step of moving an auxiliary component supported on a mobile support platform between a first position and a second position. The auxiliary component may at least partially occupy a first space when in the first position. The method may further include the step of moving the one or more sections of the gas turbine engine into the first space when the auxiliary component is in the second position.</p>

An upper deck <b>46</b> may extend substantially along the upper plane, for example, from first side wall <b>30</b> to second side wall <b>32</b> and from first end wall <b>34</b> to second end wall <b>36</b>. Upper deck <b>46</b> may be formed by any number of plates and may also include one or more openings to access one or more internal chambers <b>50</b> of primary support structure <b>16</b>. For example, primary support structure <b>16</b> may include an auxiliary component chamber <b>52</b> to house one or more auxiliary components <b>14</b>. Auxiliary component chamber <b>52</b> may be at least partially enclosed by a plurality of walls (e.g., walls <b>30</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, and lower deck <b>42</b>), with a chamber opening <b>54</b> providing access to auxiliary component chamber <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Primary support structure <b>16</b> may provide a structural base for supporting power system <b>10</b>. For example, primary support structure <b>16</b> may include one or more GTE support brackets <b>56</b> to support compressor section <b>18</b>, combustor section <b>20</b>, and turbine section <b>22</b>. GTE support brackets <b>56</b> may be mounted to upper deck <b>46</b> of primary support structure <b>16</b>. During operation of GTE <b>12</b>, GTE support brackets <b>56</b> may support GTE <b>12</b> in a substantially horizontal position and maintain alignment of compressor section <b>18</b>, combustor section <b>20</b>, and turbine section <b>22</b> along longitudinal axis <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Auxiliary component <b>14</b> may be any type of component serving an ancillary role in operation of power system <b>10</b>. In other words, auxiliary component <b>14</b> may be any type of component serving the compressor section <b>18</b>, combustor section <b>20</b>, or turbine section <b>22</b>. For example, auxiliary component <b>14</b> may be a gas fuel module <b>58</b> or a liquid fuel module (not shown) for regulating fuel to combustor section <b>20</b>. Although only gas fuel module <b>58</b> is described in detail, any number or type of auxiliary components <b>14</b> may be utilized by power system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As illustrated in the cut-away portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and shown in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, primary support structure <b>16</b> may include a mobile platform system <b>60</b> having a mobile support platform <b>62</b>, a guide assembly <b>64</b>, and a drive assembly <b>66</b> (best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Gas fuel module <b>58</b> may be mounted on mobile support platform <b>62</b> and may include one or more subcomponents for supplying and regulating fuel to GTE <b>12</b>, including, for example, a pump <b>68</b>, valves <b>70</b>, gauges <b>72</b>, and fuel conduits <b>74</b>. Although not shown, gas fuel module <b>58</b> may also include a controller having one or more sensors (e.g., a flow sensor and a pressure sensor) for controlling the flow of fuel to GTE <b>12</b>. As discussed in more detail below, mobile platform system <b>60</b> may allow supporting gas fuel module <b>58</b> in an elevated, first position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, as well as supporting gas fuel module <b>58</b> in a lowered second position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>

With gas fuel module <b>58</b> elevated in the first position, mobile support platform <b>62</b> and gas fuel module <b>58</b> may be at least partially supported via one or more temporary supports, for example, support legs <b>76</b>. Each support leg <b>76</b> may include a first end <b>78</b>, which may be attached to mobile support platform <b>62</b> by one or more fasteners (not shown), and a second end <b>80</b> attached to lower deck <b>42</b> via a pivot bracket <b>82</b>. Each pivot bracket <b>82</b> may, for example, be attached to lower deck <b>42</b> via a fastener (not shown) and attached to a corresponding support leg <b>76</b> by a fastener (not shown). Each pivot bracket <b>82</b> may permit rotational movement of the support leg <b>76</b> relative to lower deck <b>42</b>. In lieu of pivot brackets <b>82</b>, second end <b>80</b> of each support leg <b>76</b> may rest on lower deck <b>42</b> without a fixed or rotational connection.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, mobile support platform <b>62</b> may include one or more guide assemblies <b>64</b> for guiding movement of mobile support platform <b>62</b> between the first position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and the second position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Each guide assembly <b>64</b> may include one or more platform sliders <b>84</b> traveling along a corresponding platform guide rail <b>86</b>. It is contemplated that each guide assembly <b>64</b> may include two platform sliders <b>84</b> associated with each platform guide rail <b>86</b>. Each platform guide rail <b>86</b> may be oriented in a substantially vertical orientation and mounted to primary support structure <b>16</b>, for example, along longitudinal internal wall <b>38</b> or an interior facing surface of first side wall <b>30</b> via one or more fasteners <b>88</b>. Platform sliders <b>84</b> may be attached to mobile support platform <b>62</b>, for example, via a mounting bracket <b>90</b> with one or more fasteners (not shown). In the exemplary embodiment, three guide assemblies <b>64</b> may be mounted to primary support structure <b>16</b> (e.g., within auxiliary component chamber <b>52</b>) to guide movement of mobile support platform <b>62</b>. For example, two guide assemblies <b>64</b> may be attached to longitudinal internal wall <b>38</b> and a single guide assembly <b>64</b> may be attached to first side wall <b>30</b>. It is contemplated that any number of guide assemblies <b>64</b> sufficient to support one or more auxiliary components <b>14</b> may be utilized. Further, each guide assembly <b>64</b> may include any combination and/or orientation of platform sliders <b>84</b> and platform guide rails <b>86</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Each guide assembly <b>64</b> may include mating geometry between its platform sliders <b>84</b> and platform guide rails <b>86</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each platform guide rail <b>86</b> may include a substantially T-shape cross section. In order to mate with T-shaped platform guide rails <b>86</b>, platform sliders <b>84</b> may be substantially C-shaped in cross section. Mating geometry between platform sliders <b>84</b> and platform guide rails <b>86</b> may aid in guiding mobile support platform <b>62</b> between the first position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and the second position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Although C-shaped platform sliders <b>84</b> and T-shaped platform guide rails <b>86</b> are described and shown, any known geometry of mating rails and sliders may be implemented to guide movement of mobile support platform <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">One or more of guide assemblies <b>64</b> may also include drive assembly <b>66</b> to facilitate movement of mobile support platform <b>62</b> between the first position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and the second position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Drive assembly <b>66</b> may include a lifting mechanism including, for example, a ball screw jack <b>92</b> or a scissor jack (not shown). In the exemplary embodiment, one of the three guide assemblies <b>64</b> may include a ball screw jack <b>92</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). It is contemplated that ball screw jack <b>92</b> may include a threaded shaft <b>94</b> and a traveler <b>96</b>. An actuator <b>98</b> may rotate threaded shaft <b>94</b> to move traveler <b>96</b> in a direction of the axis of threaded shaft <b>94</b>. Traveler <b>96</b> may be attached to mounting bracket <b>90</b>, thereby imparting movement of mobile support platform <b>62</b> between the first position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and the second position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Actuator <b>98</b> may be manually powered, for example, via a handle. Alternatively, actuator <b>98</b> may be powered by machinery, for example by an electrical actuator, a hydraulic actuator, or a pneumatic actuator. It is contemplated that one or more guide assemblies <b>64</b> may include a safety pin <b>99</b> removably positioned through guide rail <b>86</b> and into mounting bracket <b>90</b> to reduce the likelihood that mobile platform <b>60</b> may inadvertently move.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, primary support structure <b>16</b> may also include a temporary support structure for use during service, for example, a secondary support structure <b>100</b> that may be positioned adjacent either first or second side walls <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows secondary support structure <b>100</b> positioned adjacent first side wall <b>30</b>. Primary support structure <b>16</b> may also include one or more longitudinal GTE guide rails <b>102</b> and one or more lateral GTE guide rails <b>104</b>. One or more GTE sliders <b>106</b> may be mounted to GTE <b>12</b>, for example, beneath GTE support brackets <b>56</b> to permit movement of GTE <b>12</b> in a substantially longitudinal direction along corresponding longitudinal GTE guide rails <b>102</b> and/or in substantially lateral direction along corresponding lateral GTE guide rails <b>104</b>. That is, GTE sliders <b>106</b> may be added below support brackets <b>56</b> when it is desired to move GTE <b>12</b>. It is contemplated that one or more sections of GTE <b>12</b> may be moved on lateral GTE guide rails <b>104</b> from a first GTE position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) supported on primary support structure <b>16</b> to a second GTE position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) supported on secondary support structure <b>100</b>. GTE sliders <b>106</b> may include rollers to assist movement of the more or more sections of GTE <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Industrial Applicability</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The disclosed mobile platform system may be applicable to any power system where moveably supporting an auxiliary component may prove advantageous. The disclosed mobile platform system may permit moving the auxiliary component from a first position to a second position, such as to provide clearance for moving one or more other components of the power system.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Primary support structure <b>16</b> may include various features that permit GTE <b>12</b> and auxiliary component <b>14</b> to share physical space on primary support structure <b>16</b>. For example, in some circumstances, power system <b>10</b> may be arranged on primary support structure <b>16</b> in an operating configuration with auxiliary component <b>14</b> elevated in the first position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) at least partially above upper deck <b>46</b> of primary support structure <b>16</b>, and each section (e.g., compressor section <b>18</b>, combustor section <b>20</b>, and turbine section <b>22</b>) of GTE <b>12</b> may be positioned generally in the middle of primary support structure <b>16</b> between first and second side walls <b>30</b> and <b>32</b>. In other circumstances, power system <b>10</b> may be arranged on primary support structure <b>16</b> in a GTE service configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) with auxiliary component <b>14</b> lowered in the second position at least partially below upper deck <b>46</b> of primary support structure <b>16</b>, and at least one section of GTE <b>12</b> may be offset from its position in the operating configuration in a lateral direction relative to longitudinal axis <b>24</b>. In other words, it is contemplated that auxiliary component may not be entirely below upper deck <b>46</b> while permitting at least one section of GTE <b>12</b> to pass over auxiliary component <b>14</b>. Hence, in the GTE service configuration, GTE <b>12</b> may at least temporarily occupy space previously occupied by gas fuel module <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, arranging power system <b>10</b> in the operating configuration with gas fuel module <b>58</b> elevated in the first position may permit efficient inspection and ventilation of the gas fuel module <b>58</b>. When elevated in the first position, gas fuel module <b>58</b> may be at least partially above upper deck <b>46</b> of primary support structure <b>16</b>. Therefore, when gas fuel module <b>58</b> is in the first position, an operator may readily inspect one or more of the subcomponents (e.g., gauges <b>72</b>) of gas fuel module <b>58</b>. Further, supporting gas fuel module <b>58</b> in the first position may promote natural ventilation of gas fuel module <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">When supported in the first position by guide assemblies <b>64</b> and support legs <b>76</b>, gas fuel module <b>58</b> may extend at least partially above upper deck <b>46</b> of primary support structure <b>16</b>. In the elevated position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), gas fuel module <b>58</b> may obstruct movement of one or more sections of GTE <b>12</b> in a direction lateral to longitudinal axis <b>24</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, gas fuel module <b>58</b> may obstruct lateral movement of combustor section <b>20</b> in a direction toward first side wall <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, gas fuel module <b>58</b> may be moved from the elevated, first position to the lowered, second position to provide vertical clearance for lateral movement of one more sections of GTE <b>12</b>. Prior to initiating movement of gas fuel module <b>58</b>, one or more mechanical and/or electrical connections between GTE <b>12</b> and gas fuel module <b>58</b> may be disconnected. For example, fuel conduits <b>74</b> may be disconnected from combustor section <b>20</b>. It is contemplated that safety pin <b>99</b> may be removed from platform guide rail <b>86</b> to permit movement of gas fuel module <b>58</b>. Furthermore, drive assembly <b>66</b> may be implemented to slightly raise mobile support platform <b>62</b> to reduce the load on each support leg <b>76</b>. Subsequently, each support leg <b>76</b> may be disconnected from mobile support platform <b>62</b> and pivoted down toward lower deck <b>42</b> such that first end <b>78</b> may be adjacent lower deck <b>42</b>, or each support leg <b>76</b> may otherwise be moved from a vertical orientation to horizontal orientation so as not to restrict downward movement of mobile support platform <b>62</b>. Alternatively, each support leg <b>76</b> may be removed entirely from primary support structure <b>16</b>. Once support legs <b>76</b> no longer restrict downward movement of mobile support platform <b>62</b>, actuator <b>98</b> may be used to lower mobile support platform <b>62</b> and gas fuel module <b>58</b> from the elevated, first position to the lowered, second position. When gas fuel module <b>58</b> is in the lowered, second position, one or more sections of GTE <b>12</b> may be moved laterally into, and then through the physical space previously occupied by gas fuel module <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">One or more sections of GTE <b>12</b> (e.g., compressor section <b>18</b> and combustor section <b>20</b>) may be separated from a neighboring section (e.g., turbine section <b>22</b>) by disconnecting fasteners and moving one or more sections longitudinally on longitudinal GTE guide rails <b>102</b>. Once the one or more sections of GTE <b>12</b> are separated longitudinally from neighboring sections and gas fuel module <b>58</b> is in the lowered, second position, secondary support structure <b>100</b> may be moved into position adjacent first side wall <b>30</b>. Further, lateral GTE guide rails <b>104</b> may be mounted on primary support structure <b>16</b> and secondary support structure <b>100</b>. Lateral GTE guide rails <b>104</b> in combination with GTE sliders <b>106</b> may be utilized to substantially aid lateral movement of one or more sections of GTE <b>12</b> to pass over gas fuel module <b>58</b> when gas fuel module <b>58</b> is lowered at least partially into auxiliary component chamber <b>52</b> in the second position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). When one or more sections of GTE <b>12</b> are positioned on secondary support structure <b>100</b>, the one or more sections of GTE <b>12</b> may be removed for service or repair, for example, by a hoist or a cart (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">While operation of mobile platform system <b>60</b> is described and shown moving from the operation configuration to the service configuration for disassembly, mobile platform system <b>60</b> may also be utilized to provide clearance for reassembly of one or more sections of GTE <b>12</b> onto primary support structure <b>16</b>. After the one or more sections of GTE <b>12</b> are reassembled on primary support structure <b>16</b>, gas fuel module <b>58</b> may be raised from the lowered, second position to the elevated, first position with the aid of actuator <b>98</b>. Support legs <b>76</b> may be reinstalled to at least partially support mobile support platform <b>62</b> in the elevated, first position. Finally, any mechanical and/or electrical connections that were previously disconnected between gas fuel module <b>58</b> and GTE <b>12</b> during disassembly may be reconnected for reassembly.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Power system <b>10</b> may be efficiently serviced by implementing a mobile support platform <b>62</b> to permit easily moving an auxiliary component <b>14</b> mounted thereon from a first position obstructing lateral movement of one or more sections of GTE <b>12</b> to a second position providing vertical clearance for lateral movement of one or more sections of GTE <b>12</b>. Thus, utilizing mobile platform system <b>60</b> may reduce labor and time associated with removing one or sections of GTE <b>12</b> for service while providing auxiliary component <b>14</b> in a convenient location during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the disclosed system without departing from the scope of the disclosure.
