<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to consumer shopping and purchase support services and, more particularly, to a method and system for assisting in the evaluation of products, pricing and purchase options using a Rich Internet Application (RIA) client that can be download on demand or exist as a locally installed application, accessible directly from any accelerated or researchable page, web based or otherwise, containing product information, to collect and present targeted information from a central data repository(said information having been acquired by specialized software spiders), and consolidate it in a navigational user-interface that combines an array of information tools necessary for consumers to obtain comprehensive shopping and purchase support without leaving the web page they are viewing. A method for adding XML elements containing product-related information into a video stream is also disclosed, to thereby enable a user to ascertain static information about a product displayed in a video stream by selecting it with a pointing device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The volume of on-line shopping has eclipsed local shopping in recent years as consumers grow more comfortable with electronic commerce. Part of the trend is due to speed and convenience. When a user accesses a typical ecommerce web site with a product request, the request and its associated parameters, such as the product name and model number, are passed from a web server to an application server. The application server performs necessary computation to identify what kind of data it needs from the database. Then the application server sends appropriate queries to the database or other sources. After the database returns the query results to the application server, the application server uses these to prepare a web page and passes it to the web server, which then sends it to the user. In milliseconds, the user receives comprehensive product information including current pricing.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Despite the convenience, consumers are inherently uncomfortable unless they shop around. Even when an ultimate purchase is made locally, consumers very often conduct an online price check and do online research to ensure that their planned purchase is price-competitive and a worthy product. Still, consumers can spend an inordinate amount of time searching for specific products and performing price comparisons. A variety of existing search engines attempt to consolidate the comparison shopping task, including Google&#x2122; product search, Yahoo&#xae; Shopping, Epinions&#xae; and PriceScan&#xae;. These search engines break down information into categories-directories or indexes. Directories group retailers under similar categories, such as furniture or electronics. The results of a search will be a list of web sites related to a search term. Indexes use software programs called spiders that scour the Internet, analyzing millions of web pages principally hosted by database-driven ecommerce web sites, social network sites, publication sites and newsgroup postings, indexing all of the words. Depending on their revenue model, many such search engines solicit advertising and preferentially rank their advertisers, thereby eroding consumer confidence. As a result, finding a desirable or low price for an item on the Internet is no easy task. It is still necessary to check multiple websites to ensure that you are getting the price on the best product. The consumer typically finds an appealing product on a retailer website, then checks the manufacturer websites for detailed information on the product, then checks rating websites for user reviews or problems associated with the product, then checks multiple price comparison engines to find the best prices on the product, and then checks auction or reverse auction websites for a street value reference price. This prolonged web browsing process is cumbersome and time consuming, and is fraught with potential pitfalls. Even if a consumer succeeds in finding an item at a good price there is no unified way to measure if it is the best price available, because there is not a non-preferential comprehensive price listing to compare it to. Consequently, there remains a high degree of consumer doubt that such search engines are non-biased and truly comprehensive, giving a truly comprehensive price comparison despite nuances in retailer descriptions and product SKU numbers. Therefore, just because a price comparison website indicates a seemingly low price, the consumer should always be wary. Many price comparison sites lack a deep depth of merchants, or retailer neutrality, or merchant reliability ratings, and so a low price might not actually provide a consumer with a good value. There are, very simply, too many variables and details to keep track of when shopping, and no existing comparison sites which consolidate all variables and details in a clean, useable user-interface. The comparison tools described above individually give only part of the picture, though when used together they can be extremely valuable to consumers.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">With the continued growth in use of smart phones and personal data assistants (PDAs), some search engine providers have expanded into mobile comparison shopping. There are now a variety of mobile application price comparison engines, including SMS-based comparison, mobile web applications, and native client applications, which require installation on a computing device before use. Some existing native client applications even offer features such as bar code scanning, such as Barnes &#x26; Noble's Bookstore&#x2122; iPhone&#xae; applet. Users can snap a photo of a book cover, or barcode, which then links to more information about the book. The applet also includes a store locator, recommendations on other books that might appeal, a store events calendar, online purchasing, and video clips of interviews with authors. There is no price comparison or retailer neutrality.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Consolidating all the variables and details needed for truly informed product pricing decisions is a daunting task. Consumers typically do it manually by finding and visiting a variety of product review sites and price comparison engines, and then typing in search terms at each site. Partial solutions exist in the form of multiple price comparison website search engines. A variety of these exist, such as RoboShopper.com. With RoboShopper&#xae;, the consumer enters search keyword(s) once and click's a &#x201c;Shop&#x201d; button. However, the end result is a listing of multiple comparison and information engines. This approach saves keystrokes because it is no longer necessary to re-enter keywords at multiple sites each specializing in product information, reviews or online price comparison services, as well as local shopping engines (Yellow Pages). However, RoboShopper&#xae; is simply a navigation tool that links to these other sites, and it is still necessary to navigate amongst and between multiple sites to glean the necessary information.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">What is needed is an entirely different approach, a turnkey system including a central data repository including an Internet based database, spiders that scour the Internet analyzing the millions of product-oriented pages, a server application for classifying and indexing all of the information derived from the spiders, and a Rich Internet Application (RIA) that is accessible directly from any viewed webpage containing product information, which draws information from the central data repository and consolidates it in a navigational user-interface that puts all of the information tools necessary to obtain a comprehensive product picture at the consumers fingertips, without ever leaving the page they were originally viewing.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, the present system is a distributed computerized shopping system including a web-enabled host computer hosting a central data repository that includes an Internet based database, specialized spiders that scour the Internet analyzing the millions of product-specific pages, database-driven ecommerce web sites, social networking sites, newsgroup postings, blogs and other communication feeds, and a server application for classifying and indexing all of the information derived from the spiders to populate the central data repository. In addition, a Rich Internet Application (RIA) client may be either downloaded on demand or installed locally at any of a variety of web-enabled remote client devices (desktop or laptop computers, smartphones, tablet computers, etc.), and in either case can be activated directly from any page or graphic containing a minimal amount of product information via an accelerator, research option or other similar method. The RIA client draws detailed information from the central data repository about a specific product designated on a website visited by the remote computer, and any similar products within the product taxonomy. The client application presents a navigational user-interface on the client device that presents an array of robust information tools necessary for consumers to obtain comprehensive shopping support without leaving the page they are viewing.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present system also includes a method for identifying objects contained within graphic images, photographic images and image streams (collectively &#x201c;containing media&#x201d;) for the support of consumer shopping and purchasing. The object identification method comprises adding identifying information to the containing media, subsequently extracting the object information from the containing media to be used by the above-described shopping system or any other system in providing shopping assistance to the consumer. The embedded identifying information may include product identification codes, manufacturer, pricing and other details which could be used by the shopping system. This further simplifies the online shopping experience by allowing consumers to simply click on a raw image of a product that they are interested in, just as it is shown on a catalog page, video stream or otherwise, thereby obtaining comprehensive shopping support as per the above system without leaving the image or video that they are viewing. This will further intensify the online shopping trend while providing a new method for advertisers to reach their target audiences.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The present invention is a method and system for assisting in the evaluation of products and pricing options by collecting and consolidating information in a central data repository on a host computer system, dynamically downloading a Rich Internet Application (RIA) client from the host system (or by initiation of a local installation of the client) accessible directly from any open page, and collect targeted information from the central data repository and dynamically from other sources through the Rich Internet Application (RIA) client application and consolidating it into a navigational user-interface on the client device that presents an array of robust information tools necessary for consumers to obtain a comprehensive shopping and purchase support without leaving the product web page they are viewing.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of the shopping system hardware and software architecture according to the foregoing embodiment. The shopping system generally comprises any number of client devices <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> . . . <i>n </i>which may be cellular phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), PC Tablets, as well as laptops, PCs, or any other device that includes a user interface, processor and data entry facility, and operating system. Client devices <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> . . . <i>n </i>are in data communications via wired or wireless network via the Internet to an Internet enabled server <b>60</b> maintained by a hosting Application Service Provider (ASP). The ASP also maintains a data repository <b>62</b> stored on host server <b>60</b> or a separate connected database server. The present system has three software architectural tiers including a front &#x201c;presentation&#x201d; tier, a middle &#x201c;business logic and data access&#x201d; tier, and a backend data storage tier, with both front and middle tiers presenting multiple interfaces. The front tier comprises a Rich Internet Application (RIA) client. A Rich Internet Application client is a web application that has many of the characteristics of desktop applications, but is delivered by way of a (a) site-specific browser, (b) via a browser plug-in, (c) via an independent sandbox (a third-party mirrored development environment), (d) via extensive use of a scripting language, or (e) via virtual machines. Users first need to install a RIA platform which is a software framework that uses the computer's operating system to download, update, verify and execute the RIA thin client <b>120</b>. Adobe Flash, Java, and Microsoft Silverlight are currently the three most common RIA platforms. The middle tier comprises (a) a minimal WWW site for installation of the needed accelerators, research options or other components, (b) an operational middle tier providing Software as a Service (SAS) support to the Rich Internet Application (RIA) client <b>120</b>, (c) an operational middle tier providing SAS facilities to the spiders. The backend tier comprises a conventional database management system (DBMS), a set of software programs that controls the organization, storage, management, and retrieval of data in the data repository <b>62</b> stored on host server <b>60</b> (or connected database server). The DBMS accepts requests for data from RIA client <b>120</b> and instructs the operating system to transfer the appropriate data. The middle tier contains the operative software code that performs installation of needed components, delivery of the Rich Internet Application (RIA) client <b>120</b> on demand, the performance of the shopping and purchase support logic, maintenance of the marketplaces, as will be described, and also processes the data gathered by the spiders.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">When a consumer in possession of a client device <b>20</b> wishes to subscribe, the Internet enabled server <b>60</b> pushes out a self-installable RIA client front end <b>120</b> which will run on the client device <b>20</b> using the native user interface (UI) client application <b>100</b>. The native user interface (UI) client application <b>100</b> may be, for example, a browser like Chrome&#xae; 10 or Firefox&#xae; 4 or Internet Explorer&#xae; 9, or a media player like Windows&#xae; MediaPlayer&#xae; or RealPlayer&#xae; or Songbird&#xae;.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The RIA client front end <b>120</b> includes Internet communication protocols through which the RIA client front end <b>120</b> communicates with the middle tier shopping and purchase support engine and the marketplaces. The RIA client <b>120</b> is configured to provide menu choices to the consumer and to display information selectively derived from the Internet enabled server <b>60</b> and data repository <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Internet enabled server <b>60</b> can be implemented on a single server or multiple servers, and can be based on any well-known server environment including one or more central processing units, volatile memory (e.g. random access memory), persistent memory (e.g. hard disk devices) and network interfaces to allow Internet enabled server <b>60</b> to communicate over the internet. The nature of Internet enabled server <b>60</b> and the communication links to client devices <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> . . . <i>n </i>may be any combination of architectures that will support interactions between client devices <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> . . . <i>n </i>and Internet enabled server <b>60</b>. The network communications links include the Internet as well as appropriate gateways between client devices <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> . . . <i>n </i>and Internet enabled server <b>60</b>, using any network infrastructure (e.g. Global System for Mobile communications (&#x201c;GSM&#x201d;); Code Division Multiple Access (&#x201c;CDMA&#x201d;), Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (&#x201c;EDGE&#x201d;), Evolution Data-Optimized (&#x201c;EV-DO&#x201d;), High Speed Downlink Packet Access (&#x201c;HSPDA&#x201d;).) or on wireless local area network (&#x201c;WLAN&#x201d;) infrastructures such as the Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers (&#x201c;IEEE&#x201d;) 802.11 Standard (and its variants) or Bluetooth or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Internet enabled server <b>60</b> also runs a comprehensive data mining application <b>64</b> which is programmed to extract patterns from available data in order to populate SQL database in data repository <b>62</b>. Data mining application <b>64</b> deploys a plurality of software spiders, each being an automated socket application that requests data from other Internet-connected servers. These spiders are targeted autonomous robots that collect data based on pre-defined logic and criteria. These specialized spiders are specifically programmed to target product-oriented pages, database-driven ecommerce web sites, social networking sites, newsgroup postings, blogs and other communication feeds, and are further programmed to search product manufacturer URL's and retailer URL's and to gather from those URL's product specifications, marketing information, pricing information, warranty information, and recall and product hazard information. New URL's encountered and available product information are processed by Internet enabled server <b>60</b> and saved to the data repository <b>62</b>. Each new URL is subsequently evaluated for usability and the process is repeated until all available URLs are visited. The spiders are &#x201c;scrapers&#x201d; which employ logic and context intelligence geared toward accumulating specific data sets. In this way, the spiders &#x201c;scrape&#x201d; the data off the targeted Internet sites to amass a comprehensive product information database, which is classified and indexed to include and differentiate at least:

<br/>
Further records are compiled for retailers carrying each manufactured product and these records are linked to the manufacturer record. Retailer records include at least:
</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0018" num="0068">Retailer Product Name</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0019" num="0069">Current Retail Price</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0020" num="0070">Available Stock by Location</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0071">The foregoing product information is mined from the manufacturer when available, is not solicited, and so becomes the basis of a definitive information warehouse for all most all consumer and business products.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0072">Where a given use of the RIA client <b>120</b> on the client device <b>20</b>, and initiation in conjunction with the attached existing native user interface (UI) client application <b>100</b>, a client device <b>20</b> is configured to interact with product information database content available in the data repository <b>62</b> which is connected to the Internet enabled server <b>60</b>. Alternatively, the client application acts traditionally where the given use of the RIA client <b>120</b> on the client device <b>20</b> is as a locally installed application.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0073">The RIA client <b>120</b> is written as a three-dimensional transparent user interface, which is layered or stacked over the all native user interface (UI) client application <b>100</b> pages using an illusionary transparent effect, which offers the advantage that information on the native user interface (UI) client application <b>100</b> pages may still be read and interacted with. The RIA client <b>120</b> offers an additional suite of graphical icons, and text-based interfaces with visual, auditory and/or tactile indicators to fully facilitate delivery of the information and actions available to a user. The present RIA client <b>120</b> was programmed with Microsoft Silverlight&#x2122;, an RIA application framework that integrates multimedia, graphics, animation and interactivity into a single runtime environment, though one skilled in the art will understand that other development platforms such as Adobe Flash or other RIA platforms may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0074">The RIA client <b>120</b> is configured to provide menu choices to a user according to the particular native user interface (UI) client application <b>100</b> page being presented on client device <b>20</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a screen shot of a typical retailer webpage which, after searching for &#x201c;crib&#x201d;, displays an array of possible product selections identified by product name and showing product name and price.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0075">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> once the RIA client <b>120</b> is registered as a browser accelerator it is possible by highlighting a product identifier such as &#x201c;Cherry Finish Tori&#x201d; and clicking on the blue arrow accelerator icon (or right clicking) above the text to engender a drop-down menu of all browser add-ins or &#x201c;accelerators.&#x201d; Accelerators in general allow users to create context sensitive menus. The RIA client <b>120</b> is shown as a &#x201c;Find with Squinch&#x201d; to the right. Clicking on the &#x201c;Find with Squinch&#x201d; option initiates the native user interface (UI) client application <b>100</b> and engenders the maximized transparent user interface attached at top left to the background web browser as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The transparent user interface provides the user with several immediate options: a &#x201c;Product Information&#x201d; button (top left), a &#x201c;Community Opinions&#x201d; button (top right), an &#x201c;RSS Feeds&#x201d; icon (left center), &#x201c;Close/Maximize&#x201d; buttons (upper right), a &#x201c;Camera&#x201d; icon (lower right), a &#x201c;Product Search&#x201d; button (bottom left), a &#x201c;Purchase Options&#x201d; button (bottom right), and a signature series of indicators (green, yellow, red or white) appearing across the lower portion of the user interface. Note that the background web browser remains visible through the transparent user interface.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0076">The &#x201c;Close/Maximize&#x201d; buttons (upper right) simply close or maximize the native user interface (UI) client application <b>100</b>, and the minimized icon appears at lower right.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0077">Clicking on the &#x201c;Product Information&#x201d; button (top left) sends an information request for data stored in the data repository Internet enabled server <b>60</b>, which returns detailed product, photo, and manufacturer information that is used to populate a &#x201c;Product Information Synopsis&#x201d; screen as shown in the screen shot of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. This is neutral product information, not marketing information from the retailer website. Directly beneath the &#x201c;Product Information Synopsis&#x201d; screen appears a series of supplemental buttons including a &#x201c;Description&#x201d; button, &#x201c;News and Warnings&#x201d; button, and &#x201c;Related Products&#x201d; button. Clicking on the &#x201c;Description&#x201d; button engenders a more exhaustive product description. Clicking on the &#x201c;News and Warnings&#x201d; button engenders a profile of news articles, product warnings, and product recalls directed toward the product. Clicking on the &#x201c;Related Products&#x201d; button displays a listing of similar products for purchase. Clicking on any of these supplemental buttons sends a targeted information request for data stored in the data repository Internet enabled server <b>60</b>, which returns the appropriate data.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0078">Sometimes a search based on product name retrieves a plethora of possible results. For example, searching &#x201c;Cherry Crib&#x201d; will engender thousands of potential products. For this, the consumer is also given additional search options to narrow their initial search results, including &#x201c;Product Lists&#x201d;, &#x201c;Words/Barcodes&#x201d;, and &#x201c;Previous&#x201d; buttons shown at lower right. The &#x201c;Product Lists&#x201d; button allows searching via an indexed tree of product categories and sub-categories. The &#x201c;Words/Barcodes&#x201d; button allows searching based on a search string and/or barcode number. The &#x201c;Previous&#x201d; button allows for retrieving lists of previous search criteria used or products viewed.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0079">The &#x201c;Product Lists&#x201d; is an indexed tree of product categories, product lines, products and specific models that the consumer can navigate to find a desired product. Alternatively, as seen in the screen shot of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the consumer can search (or narrow a search) using the &#x201c;Words/Barcodes&#x201d; button, which engenders a dialogue that allows text entry of keywords, product UPC, or manufacturer SKU number. A series of check boxes below allow further specification of &#x201c;Exact Match&#x201d;, &#x201c;UPC&#x201d;, &#x201c;Model No.&#x201d;, or &#x201c;Product No.&#x201d; Once the appropriate keywords are entered, a search request is generated and transmitted to the data repository Internet enabled server <b>60</b>, which searches its comprehensive database and returns the requested information to the transparent user interface, where results are displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0080">Note the &#x201c;Search using Camera&#x201d; icon at top right. This feature allows the consumer to upload a photo of a product barcode for a barcode-based search. If the client device <b>20</b> is a cellphone or laptop with integrated camera, they need only snap a photo of a barcode to send the barcode request for data stored in the data repository Internet enabled server <b>60</b>, which returns the appropriate data based on the product barcode.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a screen shot of the &#x201c;Search Using Camera&#x201d; dialog, which display camera connectivity status and prompts the user through a series of camera actions, ultimately displaying the photographed barcode directly. This feature is helpful when retailers rename the manufacturer's products.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a screen shot of the search using &#x201c;Product Lists&#x201d; dialogue, which allows the consumer to search based initially of product category or manufacturer (check boxes lower left). Checking product manufacturer engenders a selectable list of product manufacturers, while checking product list engenders a categorical listing as shown. As the consumer clicks on a product category arrow, the index expands to show all product lines within that category (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> . . . Baby Gear&#x3e;&#x3e;Car seats), all products within that product line (Car seats&#x3e;&#x3e;Booster Car Seats), and all models of products.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0083">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, when each index entry is selected a search request is sent to the data repository <b>62</b> via Internet enabled server <b>60</b>, which returns collected information back to client device <b>20</b> and the transparent user interface displays all responses in the results screen at right, with synopsis information. This gives the consumer a ready way to search, or to narrow the myriad results of a nebulous text search using an indexed classification system. The index is maintained in the data repository Internet enabled server <b>60</b>, and the transparent user interface merely sends targeted requests thereto and receives/displays responses.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0084">When the consumer has narrowed their search and finally selects a specific product, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a screen shot illustrating the detailed information displayed for that product. The detailed product information is displayed in flip-chart format including tabs for &#x201c;Description&#x201d;, &#x201c;Features&#x201d;, &#x201c;Details&#x201d;, and &#x201c;Warranties&#x201d;. These tabs display the retailer description, manufacturer features, details, and available warranties.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0085">All searches including search parameters are archived. The &#x201c;Previous&#x201d; button presents a list of previous products viewed or searches made. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a screen shot of the search archive window attained by pressing the &#x201c;Previous&#x201d; button. A chronological listing of previous product searches is displayed by product number, and the user can select whether the display includes previously searched products r previously viewed products. This feature allows a consumer to quickly resume an earlier research effort.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0086">The consumer can then click on the &#x201c;News and Warranties&#x201d; button, and &#x201c;News and Warranty&#x201d; information is displayed in flip-chart format including tabs for &#x201c;News&#x201d;, &#x201c;Health&#x201d;, &#x201c;Hazards&#x201d; and &#x201c;Disclaimers&#x201d;. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, each index card is populated with &#x201c;RSS Feeds&#x201d; regarding that particular product and the selected information category (News, Health, Hazards and Disclaimers) collected and stored in the data repository Internet enabled server <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates a screen shot of the &#x201c;Hazards and Disclaimers&#x201d; screen, which aggregates Current Product Warnings including Health Warnings and known Hazards and Recalls.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0088">Clicking on the &#x201c;Community Opinions&#x201d; button (top right) engenders the review dialogue of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, which presents both users' and experts' reviews aggregated from other product review sites.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a screen shot of the Related Products Listing attained by clicking on the &#x201c;Related Products&#x201d; button of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The Related Products Listing displays a listing of alternative products for purchase, with best available prices so that the consumer can weigh the alternatives.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0090">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the &#x201c;RSS Feeds&#x201d; icon (left center) allows the user to subscribe to an RSS feed based on the current search parameters. When pressed, the feed is added to the Common Feed List of web-browser application <b>86</b>. As part of the RSS support platform in most conventional web browsers, users can subscribe to RSS feeds within the browser. When the user subscribes to a feed, it is added to the Common Feed List. The native user interface (UI) client application <b>100</b> imports feeds from the Common Feed List. Updated information from the search parameters is automatically downloaded directly to the client device <b>20</b> and can be viewed in the native user interface (UI) client application <b>100</b> and other programs.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0091">The series of indicators (green, yellow, red or white) appearing across the lower portion of the user interface connote one of the most robust features of the present system, and provide a tool that facilitates the most comprehensive shopping and purchase support possible without leaving the product web page. These indicators may also be associated with auditory and tactile indicators. When the consumer has identified a particular product using any of the afore-mentioned search tools, one or more of these indicators may be blinking in a recurring manner. The indicators represent the outcomes of a rules-based artificial intelligence engine that mines data directly from the open page and compares it to data mined and stored in the data repository <b>62</b> using the shopping and purchase support logic of Internet enabled server <b>60</b>. If the red indicator is blinking, this means that Internet enabled server <b>60</b> has found the same product at a lower price and the consumer should not purchase from the retailer website on current display or at the physical location of the consumer if being access from a mobile device with GPS capabilities and the product information has been accessed via barcode scanning or direct query. If the green indicator is blinking, this means that the data repository Internet enabled server <b>60</b> has not found the same product at a lower price and the consumer may freely purchase from the retailer website on current display or at the physical location of the consumer if being access from a mobile device with GPS capabilities and the product information has been accessed via barcode scanning or direct query with confidence that this is the best price available. The consumer may click on the red indicator to engender the &#x201c;Current Product Purchase Options&#x201d; screen shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, which presents a listing of all the product purchase options found at a lower price by the data repository Internet enabled server <b>60</b>. If the consumer sees a purchase option that might provide better value he may click through any listed option to go to the seller's website. If the yellow indicator is blinking, this means that the ASP host marketplace/exchange platform can offer the product at a better price than any retailer website referenced.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0092">As described in more detail below, the data repository Internet enabled server <b>60</b> hosts an ecommerce marketplace platform <b>66</b> using a number of different marketplace formats to compete for sales to the consumer referred to as a &#x201c;MoneyPincher&#x201d;. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the hosted marketplace/exchange platform <b>66</b> run by Internet enabled server <b>60</b> is an e-commerce system integrated with the native user interface (UI) client application <b>100</b> that allows each consumer to suggest the price they want to pay, and the type of marketplace/exchange that they wish to participate in.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0093">There is an individual acquisition format, a social (friends-only) group acquisition format, and a public group acquisition format. Both individual and group formats rely on dynamic generation of conditional purchase offers (CPOs), whereby the hosted marketplace/exchange at Internet enabled server <b>60</b> solicits bulk purchases for popular products, and then finds a supplier, either subscribed or via discovery by a spider and subsequent solicitation, willing to accept the required price to complete the sale to the consumer(s) given the variables of the acquisition format. All individual and group purchase options are called &#x201c;Pinches&#x201d;. Pinches may be combined in variations resulting in multiple CPO's being issued, but not all CPO's may be result in a final Purchase Order (PO).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0094">When the consumer sees a blinking yellow indicator this connotes that an active Pinch exists for the selected product at a lower price. By depressing the blinking yellow indicator, the consumer is presented with the &#x201c;Active Pinch&#x201d; screen of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. The &#x201c;Active Pinch&#x201d; screen displays a listing of all active Pinches for the selected product, along with bidding start date, desired closing date, desired price, last bid, group type, and Pinch type (see below). If the user sees an attractive active pinch, he/she can click on the listing and subscribe to the Pinch. They become part of the active pinchers group for that product. Assuming that the total quantity sought by the pinchers group exceeds the minimum purchase quantity by the desired closing date, the CPO is accepted and the hosted marketplace/exchange at Internet enabled server <b>60</b> exercises the conditional purchase, automatically collects payment from the successful Pinchers at the discounted price, and transmits drop-shipment orders along with payment to the subscribed supplier. The present CPO marketplace/exchange system utilized by the hosted marketplace/exchange at Internet enabled server <b>60</b> is similar to conventional systems such as disclosed in the Priceline.com U.S. Pat. No. 5,794,207, and it is the particular way that it is integrated with the native user interface (UI) client application <b>100</b> (triggering blinking yellow indicator) that gives the consumer a robust purchasing tool and valuable fingertip information about the street price of many popular products.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0095">As seen in the &#x201c;Completed Purchases&#x201d; screen shot of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the consumer may also view a &#x201c;Completed Pinches&#x201d; screen displaying a listing of all successfully-completed Pinches for products, along with bidding close date, last bid, price, group type, Pinch type, and quantity of product ordered. This allows the user to keep track of Pinch purchases.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0096">The blinking white indicator connotes that a product warning or recall exists, and clicking on the white indicator directs the consumer to the profile of news articles, product warnings, and product recalls directed toward the selected product as described above with the &#x201c;News and Warnings&#x201d; button.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0097">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the user may elect to explore other purchase options (including Pinches) and can press the &#x201c;Purchase Options&#x201d; button. This engenders the screen shot of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, which displays &#x201c;Prices&#x201d;, &#x201c;Purchase&#x201d; and &#x201c;Coupon&#x201d; buttons (right center). Pressing the &#x201c;Price&#x201d; button displays active Pinch pricing information. There are three types of Pinch marketplaces/exchanges: Individual, Friends and Public Group. In an individual Pinch, the consumer submits their own desired price and quantity. In Friends or Public Group marketplaces/exchanges, the consumer is a part of a specific buying cooperative with other friends or members of the public, respectively, seeking a specific desired price based on the group size. All three Pinch marketplaces/exchanges are hosted at Internet enabled server <b>60</b> which relies on an e-commerce system integrated with the native user interface (UI) client application <b>100</b> that allows each consumer to suggest the price they want to pay. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the Prices button displays current MSRP, Individual, Friends and Public Group pricing information for the selected product under all active Pinch formats. As the user scrolls down they see running statistics including Lowest Squinch price, Average Squinch price, and Highest Squinch price over time, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0098">Below the &#x201c;Prices&#x201d; button, the &#x201c;Purchase&#x201d; button is used to create and/or enroll in Pinch format purchase options and drops down a Pinch menu which allows check-box selection between the Type of Pinch desired and the Pinch action desired.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0099">Given the consumer's selection between Individual, Friends or Public Group marketplaces/exchanges, the consumer may also specify whether they wish to create a new Pinch, or join an existing Pinch.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0100">If the user wishes to join a Friends Group Pinch, this will engender the screen shot of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> which is essentially a filtered Active Pinch screen as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> but displaying only the consumer's circle of friends. The hosted exchange at Internet enabled server <b>60</b> maintains a social network service by which all registered consumers may create a personal profile, add other users as friends and exchange messages, including automatic notifications when they update their profile. Groups of friends can join the buying cooperatives by taking advantage of Friend Pinches, but only pre-designated friends (who have indicated and accepted previous invitations sent through the hosted marketplace/exchange at Internet enabled server <b>60</b>) may join a Friends Group Pinch. The &#x201c;Active Friends Group Pinch&#x201d; screen displays a listing of all active Friends Group Pinch Pinches for a selected product, along with bidding start date, desired closing date, desired price, last bid, group type, and Pinch type (Friends Group Pinch). This allows registered users to share the values that they have uncovered with the present system and share purchase with their designated friends. If the user sees an attractive bidding pool amongst friends, he/she can click on the listing and subscribe to the Pinch. They become part of the limited bidding pool for that product.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0101">If the user wishes to join a Public Group Pinch, the process is very similar and a filtered &#x201c;Active Pinches&#x201d; screen is shown displaying Pinches open to all registered members (not just friends).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0102">If the user wishes to join an Individual Pinch, the process is again similar and engenders the Individual Pinch subscription form of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. The consumer specifies desired quantity, Units, Desired price, Ship to Address, Delivery Method, and requisite closing date. The requisite closing date is selected by a calendar (left center) in conjunction with a series of check-boxes connoting different things: Quick Pinch requires a substantially instantaneous purchase offer/acceptance based on standing CPO's; Closing Date requires Pinches to close by a certain date specified; Need by date allows for shipping delay; and Open Date leaves the close open-ended. Once specified the filtered &#x201c;Active Pinch&#x201d; screen subscribes the consumer and awaits the result of the reverse auction format.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is a screen shot of the &#x201c;Coupons&#x201d; screen which is attained by depressing the &#x201c;Coupons&#x201d; button of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21-24</figref>. The &#x201c;Coupons&#x201d; screen presents both coupons aggregated from other coupon sites as well as manufacturer and retailer coupons mined from applicable feeds.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0104">It should now be apparent that the above-described system including hardware and software architecture provides Rich Internet Application (RIA) client accessible directly from any page, which draws information from a central data repository and consolidates it in a navigational user-interface that puts all of the information tools necessary to obtain a comprehensive product picture at the consumers fingertips, without ever leaving the product web page they were originally viewing. This adds greatly to consumer confidence during the shopping experience.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0105">Merchants occasionally advertise products via digital media in which a product is contained in the midst of digital graphic, photographic and video image(s) or streaming video without any associated XML/HTML code or tags identifying the depicted product. Thus, for example, a merchant web page will depict a catalog page containing a product image (an &#x201c;embedded&#x201d; image), or will display a streaming video in which a product is depicted. Without some associated XML/HTML code, metadata or tag (containing a product UPC code, link or otherwise), the above-described system would have no way of identifying the product within the image/video and would have no means for drawing information from the central data repository for use in its user-interface. To overcome this issue, the present system includes a method of object identification, including adding identifying information to the containing media (e.g. web site, digital publication, television broadcast or movie), and subsequently extracting said object information from the containing media to be used by the above-described or any other system in providing assistance.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0106">In an embodiment designed for XML static document or document streams which have an embedded image, the present method adds XML elements containing a limited amount of product-related information to the XML static document or document stream which has an embedded image, to thereby enable the present system to identify an object/product contained within that image when selected by a pointing device.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> is the top half of the front page of an exemplary magazine website which a consumer might visit, which illustrates the results of conversion of an actual XML static document to web page by a web browser (because of the actual page size, only the top of the page was captured by the snapshot of the screen).</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> presents a subset of the page of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> with a photographic image containing of a pair of women's shoes. Assuming that a consumer is browsing the web pages of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26-27</figref> and desires more information on those shoes, in accordance with the present invention they need only position their pointing device on the image and click to initiate the object/product's identification. The method is manifest in the code.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> presents the section of XML document responsible for definitions of the subset of the original page with the photographic image of the shoes as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. This section is a composite of Document Type Definitions (DTDs) and XML elements which a browser reads and subsequently composes the section presented. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> the following XML element was present in the actual XML document (the second element is represented in its abbreviated form, &#x201c;/&#x3e;&#x201d;, at the end of the example):</p>

<p id="p-0113" num="0132">Additional supplemental element pairs can be defined and there are no constraints beyond that defined by the XML specifications as to the exact tags to be used. Together, these XML elements when inserted in the XML static document or document stream allow any software components examining the XML static document or document stream to uniquely identify any object/product in an image in any digital media form and supply the information to the above-described shopping system or any other system to be used as needed. XML is not limited to usage in defining static websites or digital publications, but can also be used in digital broadcasts or recordings, either contained within or surrounding the broadcast or separately in either a static document or streaming document form.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0133">In an embodiment designed for video streams which have an embedded image, the present invention includes a method for adding XML elements containing a limited amount of product-related information to the video stream, and for identifying the object/product contained within that video stream when selected by a pointing device.</p>
