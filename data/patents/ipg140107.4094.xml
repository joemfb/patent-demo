<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-146392 filed Jun. 28, 2010. The entire content of the priority application is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a dither matrix selecting device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One type of printing device well known in the art converts multi-tone image data to binary image data using a dither matrix and forms a binary image with toner based on the binary image data. This type of printing device generally uses a clustered-dot dither matrix having a plurality of sub-matrices (basic matrices) with threshold values set so that a single dot grows from a starting pixel in each sub-matrix as the input value increases.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, this type of printing device is designed to achieve maximum performance using a prescribed toner with known properties (normally a proprietary toner product provided by the manufacturer of the printing device and referred to as the &#x201c;original manufacturer's product&#x201d;). Hence, using a non-prescribed toner in the printing device may result in less stable dot formation than when using the prescribed toner, producing patterns and unevenness in the printed image and other artifacts that can worsen printing quality.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the present invention to minimize a worsening in the quality of printed images caused by using a non-prescribed toner.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to attain the above and other objects, the invention provides a dither matrix selecting device including a storage unit, a determining unit, and a selecting unit. The storage unit is configured to store a first dither matrix and a second dither matrix different from the first dither matrix. The first dither matrix includes a plurality of sub-matrices. Each sub-matrix of the first dither matrix has a plurality of threshold values such that a single dot grows from a starting pixel as an input value increases. Each sub-matrix has a first region and a second region different from the first region. Each threshold value allocated in the first region is smaller than a prescribed value. An arrangement of each threshold value in the first region is identical for all of the plurality of sub-matrices such that dots corresponding to all sub-matrices grow simultaneously as the input value increases. The threshold values in the second region are arranged such that dots grow sequentially and nonsimulteneously as the input value increases. The determining unit is configured to determine whether or not toner accommodated in a printing device is a specified toner. The selecting unit is configured to select the first dither matrix when the determining unit determines that the toner is not the specified toner.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to another aspect, the present invention provides a method executed by a dither matrix selecting device, the method comprising: determining whether or not toner accommodated in a printing device is a specified toner; and selecting a first dither matrix among a plurality of dither matrices when the toner is not the specified toner, the first dither matrix including a plurality of sub-matrices, each sub-matrix of the first dither matrix having a plurality of threshold values such that a single dot grows from a starting pixel as an input value increases, each sub-matrix having a first region and a second region different from the first region, each threshold value that is allocated in the first region being smaller than a prescribed value, an arrangement of each threshold value in the first region being identical for all of the plurality of sub-matrices.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to another aspect, the present invention provides a non-transitory computer readable storage medium storing a set of program instructions installed on and executed by a computer, the program instructions comprising: determining whether or not toner accommodated in a printing device is a specified toner; and selecting a first dither matrix among a plurality of dither matrices when the toner is not the specified toner, the first dither matrix including a plurality of sub-matrices, each sub-matrix of the first dither matrix having a plurality of threshold values such that a single dot grows from a starting pixel as an input value increases, each sub-matrix having a first region and a second region different from the first region, each threshold value that is allocated in the first region being smaller than a prescribed value, an arrangement of each threshold value in the first region being identical for all of the plurality of sub-matrices.</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Next, a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described while referring to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing the general structure of a communication system including a personal computer (PC) <b>1</b>, and a printer <b>2</b> that are capable of performing data communications with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The PC <b>1</b> is a common data processor that includes a controller <b>11</b>, a storage unit <b>12</b>, a communication unit <b>13</b>, an operating unit <b>14</b>, and a display unit <b>15</b>. The controller <b>11</b> performs overall control of each component in the PC <b>1</b>. The controller <b>11</b> includes a CPU <b>111</b>, a ROM <b>112</b>, and a RAM <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The storage unit <b>12</b> is a nonvolatile storage device for storing data that can be overwritten. In this embodiment, a hard disk drive is employed as the storage unit <b>12</b>. Various software programs are installed on the storage unit <b>12</b>, including an operating system (OS) <b>121</b>; application programs <b>122</b> for implementing graphical program and other applications (so-called software); and a printer driver <b>123</b> for enabling a user to use the printer <b>2</b> through the personal computer <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The communication unit <b>13</b> is an interface for performing data communications with the printer <b>2</b>. The operating unit <b>14</b> is an input device that allows the user to input instructions through external operations. In this embodiment, the operating unit <b>14</b> is configured of a keyboard and a pointing device (a mouse, touchpad, or the like). The display unit <b>15</b> is an output device for displaying various data in a visual form that the user can understand. In this embodiment, the display unit <b>15</b> is configured of a liquid crystal display.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The printer <b>2</b> is an electrographic-type image forming device including a controller <b>21</b>, a storage unit <b>22</b>, a communication unit <b>23</b>, an operating unit <b>24</b>, a display unit <b>25</b>, and an image forming unit <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The controller <b>21</b> performs overall control of each component in the printer <b>2</b>. The controller <b>21</b> includes a CPU <b>211</b>, a ROM <b>212</b>, and a RAM <b>213</b>. The ROM <b>212</b> stores a program for controlling the CPU <b>211</b> to perform a dither switching process described below (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The storage unit <b>22</b> is a nonvolatile storage device for storing data that can be overwritten. In this embodiment, flash memory is employed as the storage unit <b>22</b>. Candidates for a dither matrix to be used in a thresholding process (hereinafter referred to as the &#x201c;active dither matrix&#x201d;) are stored in the storage unit <b>22</b> and include a standard dither matrix <b>221</b>, and a simultaneous growth dither matrix <b>222</b> in this embodiment. The standard dither matrix <b>221</b> is a conventional clustered-dot dither matrix such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and has threshold values set for reproducing the best quality image when using the original manufacturer's toner having known properties (where the original manufacturer's toner is a product supplied by the manufacturer of the printer <b>2</b>). The simultaneous growth dither matrix <b>222</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is used when toner other than the original manufacturer's toner (a third party toner) is loaded in the printer <b>2</b>, and will be described later in greater detail.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The communication unit <b>23</b> is an interface for performing data communications with the PC <b>1</b>. The operating unit <b>24</b> is an input device that allows the user to input instructions through external operations. The operating unit <b>24</b> includes various operating buttons.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The display unit <b>25</b> is an output device and includes a small liquid crystal display for displaying various data as images that convey information to the user. The image-forming unit <b>26</b> functions to form monochrome images by fixing toner to paper. More specifically, the image-forming unit <b>26</b> irradiates a laser beam onto the uniformly charged surface of a photosensitive drum based on binary image data in order to form an electrostatic latent image of the binary image. Next, the image-forming unit <b>26</b> deposits toner on the electrostatic latent image to form a toner image. The image-forming unit <b>26</b> transfers this toner image onto a sheet of paper, and further fixes the toner image to the paper by heat in a fixing unit to complete the image-forming (printing) process.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The printer <b>2</b> according to this embodiment employs a toner cartridge that is detachably mounted in the body of the printer <b>2</b>. The toner cartridge accommodates toner and can be replaced by the user as needed. An IC chip is attached to the original manufacturer's toner cartridge provided by the manufacturer of the printer <b>2</b>. The IC chip stores information indicating that the toner cartridge is the original manufacturer's product. The control unit <b>21</b> of the printer <b>2</b> can determine whether this toner cartridge is the original manufacturer's product by reading the information stored in the IC chip attached to the mounted toner cartridge. The image-forming unit <b>26</b> also includes a mounting sensor <b>261</b> for detecting when the toner cartridge is mounted in the body of the printer <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Next, an outline of the process executed by the printing system according to this embodiment will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">When the user of the personal computer <b>1</b> performs an operation to initiate a printing process in one of the application programs <b>122</b> executing on the personal computer <b>1</b>, such as a graphics tool, the personal computer <b>1</b> activates the printer driver <b>123</b> to transfer a print job to the printer <b>2</b>. Here, a print job is a command to print 256-level image data representing the image to be printed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">When the printer <b>2</b> receives a print job from the personal computer <b>1</b>, the printer <b>2</b> executes a thresholding process using a dither matrix for converting print data related to the print job into binary data. Subsequently, the printer <b>2</b> forms a binary image represented by the binary image data with toner and prints the image on paper.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The printer <b>2</b> is designed to achieve its maximum performance using the original manufacturer's toner (a polymer toner in this embodiment). Hence, if the printer <b>2</b> is using a third party toner for which the properties are unknown, problems often occur when charging or fixing the toner, making it difficult for the printer <b>2</b> to produce satisfactory printing results.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In particular, if the third party toner is a pulverized toner, dot formation may be unstable because the particle size of pulverized toner can vary greatly. Thus, the quality of images printed with this toner may be poor when the thresholding process is performed using the standard dither matrix <b>221</b> designed for use with the original manufacturer's toner. Further, with some third party pulverized toners, the fixing properties of the toner are poor in light regions (regions with low input values) of an image, but improve abruptly when the input values exceed a certain value. This is likely because the toner fixes more readily to paper when the number of pixels constituting dot clusters increases.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>) is a graph showing voltage changes over the surface of the photosensitive drum when forming two isolated dot each corresponding to a single pixel, where the vertical axis indicates voltage and the horizontal axis indicates the irradiating position of the laser on the photosensitive drum with respect to the axial direction thereof. The horizontal lines in the graph are guidelines indicating whether a substantial amount of toner is deposited. In other words, toner is more likely to be deposited when the voltage on the surface of the photosensitive drum rises above the horizontal line. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>), the line for the third party toner indicates a higher voltage than the line for the original manufacturer's toner and, hence, the third party toner is less likely to be deposited since the portion of the voltage that rises above the horizontal line for third party toner is smaller.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The graph in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>b</i>), on the other hand, shows changes in voltage on the surface of the photosensitive drum when a dot have a plurality of consecutive pixels arranged in the axial direction of the photosensitive drum. As illustrated in this graph, configuring dots with consecutive pixels produces a uniform power for the laser irradiated on the photosensitive drum, stabilizing the voltage. Accordingly, the portion of the voltage line that rises above the horizontal lines is much larger than when the dots have only a single pixel (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>)), increasing the likelihood that even the third party toner will be deposited reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Hence, third party toner is particularly unlikely to be deposited in light regions of an image in which dots are configured of a small number of pixels. When using the standard dither matrix <b>221</b> for this third party toner, the light regions of the printed image will appear excessively light.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Further, threshold values are set in the standard dither matrix <b>221</b> so that dot growth alternates between certain sub-matrices. Here, a &#x201c;dot&#x201d; indicates an aggregate of pixels set to ON, and &#x201c;dot growth&#x201d; signifies a gradual increase in the number of pixels constituting the dot causing the dot to grow gradually larger. Further, &#x201c;pixels set to ON&#x201d; denotes pixels for which toner will be deposited. As a result, dots with different numbers of pixels (shapes) are generally combined in a regular arrangement. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, where colored pixels indicate pixels that are ON for an input value of 43, dots having four pixels and dots having five pixels are combined in a regular arrangement. Each threshold value 1-43 is allocated in one of the plurality of sub-matrices and fails to be contained in at least one of the plurality of sub-matrices. This arrangement will cause no problems if all dots are properly formed (rendered) using the original manufacturer's toner. However, all pixels that are ON may not always be formed when using a third party toner, since the properties of the third party toner differ from those of the original manufacturer's toner and will not produce the same control and consistency designed with the original manufacturer's toner in mind. That is, there is a higher probability that dots with fewer pixels will not be formed properly than dots with more pixels. This can easily lead to regular patterns with a mixture of dots that are properly formed and dots that are not properly formed and can produce patterns and unevenness in the printed image, reducing image quality.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Therefore, when a third party toner is loaded in the printer <b>2</b> of this embodiment, the printer <b>2</b> uses the simultaneous growth dither matrix <b>222</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> in place of the standard dither matrix <b>221</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, like the standard dither matrix <b>221</b>, the simultaneous growth dither matrix <b>222</b> is a clustered-dot dither matrix configured by a plurality of sub-matrices. Each sub-matrix has threshold values set so that a single dot grows from a starting pixel as the input value increases. Each of the standard dither matrix and simultaneous growth dither matrix <b>222</b> has threshold values set between 1 and 255 so that area gradations corresponding to input values from 0 to 255 can be rendered a plurality of tones of images without gradation jumps. In other words, each of the standard dither matrix <b>221</b> and the simultaneous growth dither matrix <b>222</b> includes a plurality of sub-matrices. Each sub-matrix has a plurality of threshold values containing the smallest threshold value. Any threshold value allocated between each of the plurality of threshold values and the smallest threshold value in each sub-matrix is smaller than or equal to the each of the plurality of threshold values. Each threshold value greater than or equal to a prescribed value 49 is allocated in a region of one of the plurality of sub-matrix and is not contained in at least one of the plurality of sub-matrices.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">However, the simultaneous growth dither matrix <b>222</b> differs from the standard dither matrix <b>221</b> in that all sub-matrices share the same settings for threshold values between 1 and 48. Specifically, each threshold value (1-48) smaller than the prescribed value (49) is allocated in another region different from the allocated region of the threshold value 49-255. An arrangement of each threshold value (1-48) smaller than the prescribed value (49) is identical for all of the plurality of sub-matrices. In other words, threshold values are set in the simultaneous growth dither matrix <b>222</b> so that the dots in all sub-matrices grow simultaneously and in the same shape for input values up to 48, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>5</b>(<i>b</i>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>a</i>) shows the dots formed for the input value 30, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>b</i>) for the input value 48. For all other input values less than 48, the dots are similarly formed in the same shape in all sub-matrices.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">However, the threshold values are set in the storage unit <b>22</b> so that dot growth begins to alternate between certain sub-matrices for input values above 48, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>c</i>). As described earlier, third party toner often has poor fixing properties in light regions of an image, but these fixing properties often improve abruptly when the input value exceeds a certain value. In this embodiment, the simultaneous growth dither matrix <b>222</b> is designed under the assumption that 48 is the input value at which the fixing properties of third party toner change. Accordingly, threshold values are set so that dots in all sub-matrices grow simultaneously and in the same shape for input values up to 48. However, the input value 48 is merely an example.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Next, a dither matrix switching process executed by the control unit <b>21</b> of the printer <b>2</b> (and specifically the CPU <b>211</b>) will be described with reference to the flowchart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The control unit <b>21</b> begins the dither matrix switching process when the power to the printer <b>2</b> is switched on or when the mounting sensor <b>261</b> detects a toner cartridge being mounted while the power to the printer <b>2</b> is on (i.e., when the user performs an operation to replace the toner cartridge). The standard dither matrix <b>221</b> is set as the default active dither matrix when the power to the printer <b>2</b> is turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In S<b>101</b> at the beginning of this dither matrix switching process, the control unit <b>21</b> determines whether the toner cartridge currently mounted in the printer <b>2</b> is the original manufacturer's product. That is, the control unit <b>21</b> determines whether or not the toner accommodated in the printer <b>2</b> is a specified toner in S<b>101</b>. If the control unit <b>21</b> determines that the toner cartridge is not the original manufacturer's product (i.e., is a third party toner cartridge), in S<b>102</b> the control unit <b>21</b> selects the simultaneous growth dither matrix <b>222</b> and switches the active dither matrix to the simultaneous growth dither matrix <b>222</b> from the standard dither matrix <b>221</b>. Subsequently, the control unit <b>21</b> ends the dither matrix switching process and enters a standby state to wait for a print job. When the printer <b>2</b> receives a print job, the control unit <b>21</b> converts input values corresponding to the print job into output values based on the simultaneous growth dither matrix <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">However, if the control unit <b>21</b> determines in S<b>101</b> that the toner cartridge is the original manufacturer's product, the control unit <b>21</b> simply ends the dither matrix switching process with no further action. In this case, the active dither matrix remains the standard dither matrix <b>221</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">With the printing system according to the embodiment described above, the printer <b>2</b> selects the simultaneous growth dither matrix <b>222</b> as the active dither matrix when the printer <b>2</b> is using a third party toner, where the simultaneous growth dither matrix <b>222</b> has threshold values set so that the dots in all sub-matrices grow simultaneously and in the same shape for input values up to 48. With this simultaneous growth dither matrix <b>222</b>, dots in all sub-matrices always have the same number of pixels and the same shape, for input values up to 48, rather than combinations of dots with different pixel numbers (shapes). Consequently, there are unlikely to be irregularities in the size of fixed dots, preventing patterns and unevenness from being introduced into the printed image.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Further, the threshold values in the simultaneous growth dither matrix <b>222</b> are set so that dots in all sub-matrices grow simultaneously and in the same shape for input values up to 48, while dots in only some sub-matrices grow for input values exceeding 48, and the ratio of pixels set to ON in light regions of an image is higher when using the simultaneous growth dither matrix <b>222</b> than when using the standard dither matrix <b>221</b>. As a result, it is possible to prevent light regions of a printed image from becoming excessively light when formed with a third party toner.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The simultaneous growth dither matrix <b>222</b> used for third party toner in this embodiment can prevent the use of this toner from worsening image quality better than the standard dither matrix <b>221</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Moreover, the size of the sub-matrices in the simultaneous growth dither matrix <b>222</b> required for rendering gradations is smaller than in a dither matrix having threshold values configured to grow dots in all sub-matrices simultaneously and in the same shape for all input values. Consequently, the printer <b>2</b> can form images with high resolution and good toner reproduction.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Further, since the threshold values in the simultaneous growth dither matrix <b>222</b> are set for all input values, the printer <b>2</b> can achieve good tone reproduction without gradation jumps.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">While the invention has been described in detail with reference to the embodiment thereof, it would be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">For example, the standard dither matrix <b>221</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and the simultaneous growth dither matrix <b>222</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> are merely examples, and the present invention is not limited to these dither matrices.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the embodiment described above, the prescribed toner is the original manufacturer's toner, but the prescribed toner of the present invention is not limited to the original manufacturer's toner, provided that the toner is recommended by the manufacturer. For example, toner with known properties supplied by a manufacturer separate from the printer manufacturer may be considered a recommended toner. In this case, an IC chip storing information that indicates the toner is the prescribed (recommended) toner should be attached to the toner cartridge accommodating the recommended toner.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the embodiment, the prescribed toner (i.e., original manufacturer's toner) is described as a polymer toner, but the present invention may be applied to a printer that uses pulverized toner as the prescribed toner, provided that the properties of the toner are known in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the example of the simultaneous growth dither matrix <b>222</b> described in the embodiment, the threshold values 1-48 are set in common cells of all sub-matrices, while threshold values greater than 48 are arranged so that dots grow only in some of the sub-matrices for each input value above 48. However, the simultaneous growth dither matrix may be configured so that all threshold values are set commonly in all sub-matrices, for example. In other words, the simultaneous growth dither matrix of the present invention may include a dither matrix with threshold values set such that dots in all sub-matrices grow simultaneously and in the same shape for all input values. Such a dither matrix is effective when printing using a third party toner having poor fixing properties for all input values.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Further, in the illustrated embodiment, the controller <b>21</b> is implemented as a programmed general purpose computer. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the controller <b>21</b> can be implemented using a single special purpose integrated circuit (e.g., ASIC) having a main or central processor section for overall, system-level control, and separate sections dedicated to performing various different specific computations, functions and other processes under control of the central processor section, or a plurality of separate dedicated or programmable integrated or other electronic circuits or devices (e.g., hardwired electronic or logic circuits such as discrete element circuits, or programmable logic devices such as PLDs PLAs, PALs or the like). The controller <b>21</b> can be implemented using a suitably programmed general purpose controller, e.g., a microprocessor, microcontroller or other processor device (CPU or MPU), either alone or in conjunction with one or more peripheral (e.g., integrated circuit) data and signal processing devices. In general, any device or assembly of devices on which a finite state machine capable of implementing the flowcharts shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> can be used as the controller. A distributed processing architecture can be used for maximum data/signal processing capability and speed.</p>
