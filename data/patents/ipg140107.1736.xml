<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The foregoing examples of the related art and limitations related therewith are intended to be illustrative and not exclusive. Other limitations of the related art will become apparent to those of skill in the art upon a reading of the specification and a study of the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Liver disease has become one of the most common chronic illnesses, affecting tens of millions of people in the developed world, resulting in lifetime suffering and huge costs to the medical system. Viral hepatitis C (HCV) is one of the leading known causes of liver disease in the United States. It is a common cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as well as the most common reason for liver transplantation. At least 4 million people in United States are believed to have been infected with HCV, making HCV the most common chronic blood-borne infection nationally. Treatment for HCV has been successful in up to 60% of the cases, depending upon factors such as genotype, ethnicity, co-infections and other risk factors. In addition to the well-known chronic liver diseases due to viral hepatitis C(HCV), there is an increasing population with chronic liver diseases due to alcohol, autoimmune diseases, obesity and diabetes type 2 (associated with metabolic syndrome). Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a common chronic liver condition due to obesity and diabetes mellitus, affecting almost a quarter of the general population in the United States. The trend of rise in obesity in the western world is increasing annually. NAFLD includes a spectrum of liver conditions, ranging from simple steatosis (fat accumulation), also referred to as nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) disease, which is associated with liver injury. NASH may progress from fibrosis to cirrhosis, as a consequence of the distortion of the normal liver architecture that interferes with blood flow through the liver. Cirrhosis can also lead to an inability of the liver to perform its biochemical functions, resulting in complications that cause liver failure and liver cancer. Then, transplantation would be the only feasible solution, and in many cases, even transplantation is not an option. Currently, there are several treatments in the pipeline for NASH, but there is no known approved and effective treatment currently available.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Breath tests that are based on monitoring the <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>, which is a by-product of metabolization by the liver of <sup>13</sup>C labeled substrates, have been proposed as a tool for evaluation of liver function. Previously available tests for liver diseases generally involve drastically invasive procedures, and are therefore much less patient compliance than simple breath tests. Such procedures include biopsies of organs suspected of malfunction, blood tests and imaging technologies. It may take many years, if at all, until liver biopsy will be fully replaced. Although a biopsy is considered to yield reliable results, it is not the optimal tool for patient management since it is highly invasive, expensive, it requires day or overnight hospitalization of the patient and is very sensitive to sampling and analysis errors.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Blood tests for the detection of antibodies to suspected bacteria/virus and blood biochemistry tests include standard serum tests and tests following ingestion of suitable compounds. In any event, the blood tests do not specifically diagnose and distinguish NAFLD and NASH from other liver diseases. Most notably, the new serum tests (such as but not limited to FibroTest&#x2122;) aim at correlation to fibrosis but have difficulties in detecting small changes in liver condition, which are needed for a genuine follow up. None of them have been adapted for use in routine clinical practice yet. They also suffer from the disadvantages of being performed at a central lab, thereby eliminating the economic benefit from the clinic.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Current imaging technologies, including ultrasound, Computed Tomography (CT), X-ray and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) cannot distinguish NAFLD from NASH. The new Fibroscan (ultrasound) test is not as effective with obese patients (a very significant (and growing) sector of the population) nor does it provide data on inflammation in the liver, nor does it provide information on actual liver function. Most imaging solutions (besides simple ultrasound which is useless for detecting fibrosis) do not exist at the standard medical clinic and thus such solutions necessitate the patients to leave the physician's clinic, which has its drawbacks, such as location, long waiting period, lack of economic benefits and more. A basic test in any of these devices (CT, X-ray and MRI) is expensive to highly expensive. Furthermore, there are other disadvantages to the previously used tests, such as the fact that they rarely give real time information about the organ function or status being observed. In some cases, such as in the case of blood tests for antibodies of bacterial infections, they give historic results which may have no current therapeutic relevance, since antibodies to a particular bacterium can remain in the body for up to 2 years from the date that the infection has been eradicated.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Moreover, the liver is an organ that has a very high metabolic capacity reserve. It is well known that a small part of a standard liver mass is sufficient to accomplish its physiological tasks. This poses a challenge when the liver has to be evaluated. Ideally the physician would like to get a quantitative evaluation of the liver mass, percentage of the cells that are functioning normally, or any other related parameter.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, it is well known that the liver performs many tasks and thereby it is difficult to assess all of its functions with a single test. Furthermore, there are many factors that result in high intra and inter patient variability. Finally, different disease etiologies may impact different functions of the liver.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The use of two breath tests has been proposed to provide a more accurate picture of the liver diseases. It has been demonstrated that accuracy of evaluation can be improved by using more than one substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Methacetin, also known as N-(4-Methoxyphenyl)acetamide, p-Acetanisidine, p-Acetanisidine and [N-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethanamide] is a compound having the formula:</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001">
<img id="EMI-C00001" he="15.75mm" wi="34.04mm" file="US08622920-20140107-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/>
</chemistry>
</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Methacetin may be utilized for the evaluation of liver functional capacity and/or the extent of liver injury of &#x201c;liver health&#x201d;. The biochemical basis for the evaluation of functional capacity is that the compound is metabolized by a cytochrome p450 enzyme expressed in normal liver cells (hepatocytes). Diseases of the liver that cause a loss in functional mass and/or impact the metabolic function of hepatocytes are associated with and may be correlated to a loss of capacity to metabolize methacetin.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">One of the most common methods for determining the rate of metabolism of methacetin is to analyze the rate of metabolism of the methoxy group (CH<sub>3</sub>O) of methacetin to carbon dioxide, which is excreted in exhaled breath. To distinguish the carbon dioxide derived from methacetin from all other sources of carbon dioxide, the methoxy group is labeled with <sup>13</sup>C, a stable isotope of carbon. Thus all the CO<sub>2 </sub>derived from methacetin will contain <sup>13</sup>C (<sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>) in contrast to all other sources of CO<sub>2</sub>, which will contain approximately 99% <sup>12</sup>C, and 1% <sup>13</sup>C, the naturally abundant isotope. Thus, the rate of excretion of <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2 </sub>(normalized to <sup>12</sup>CO2) above background following the administration of methacetin-methoxy-<sup>13</sup>C indicates its rate of metabolism, which relates to the hepatic cell &#x201c;health&#x201d; and to the functional mass of the liver.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In common tests 75 mg of methacetin-methoxy<sup>13</sup>C is dissolved in 50-200 ml of water and taken orally following which the excretion rate of <sup>13</sup>CO2 in exhaled air (breath testing {BT}) is determined at intervals of 15 minutes up to 2 hr. It has been reported that individuals with well-established cirrhosis have a statistically significant reduction in the rate of metabolism of methacetin but considerable overlap exists between a group of volunteers having normal liver function and those with milder stages of potentially progressive liver disease and/or the degree of liver injury.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The probable causes for the wide variation in the methacetin breath testing within the normal population, which makes it difficult to distinguish it from the population with mild loss of functional capacity, need to be addressed and overcome as well as the intra-patient test variability. There is a need for a modified test that would enhance the usefulness of the methacetin in breath test for evaluating liver functional capacity and/or hepatic injury or health.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Octanoic acid, a medium-chain fatty acid and salts thereof undergo a metabolic process in the mitochondria of the liver cells. These compounds may be used in the assessment of hepatic mitochondrial &#x3b2;-oxidation. There is a need in the art for a test that would allow accurate evaluation of hepatic related conditions.</p>

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">More specifically, such devices, apparatuses and methods can be used for metabolic liver function test, which could be utilized to assess liver function. According to some embodiments, by administering a specific compound orally or intravenously, a compound is directly metabolized or removed by the liver from the blood and metabolized, and a metabolic product is then released into the blood and excreted in the bile, urine, saliva, or exhaled breath. Methods according to some embodiments may include measuring the amount of the administered product that remains in serum over time or the amount of metabolic product that is produced and/or the rate at which this product is excreted, provides a potentially accurate measure of hepatic metabolic function. Several compounds have been utilized to measure hepatic metabolic function in this manner including indocyanine green, galactose, aminopyrine, caffeine, lidocaine, phenylalanine and Methacetin [N-(4-Methoxy-phenyl)acetamide]. Previous studies of the hepatic metabolism of lidocaine to monoethylglycinexylodide (MEGX) have demonstrated that: a. declined metabolism was apparent with increasing liver fibrosis and with worsening stages of cirrhosis, b. improved metabolism was apparent with successful treatment of the underlying liver disease, and c. an accurate prediction of which patients with stable cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation were at risk to develop future hepatic decompensation. The liver tests are aimed at the patient population with acute or chronic liver disease. This includes persons infected with hepatitis C, patients with NASH or alcoholic related liver disease, liver transplant patients and more. By the administration of a substrate that is exclusively (or almost exclusively) metabolized by the liver, at least during the breath testing procedure, liver function can be analyzed.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In accordance with one embodiment, there is provided a breath test analyzer, including a very sensitive gas analyzer, capable of measuring a ratio of two chemically identical gases with different molecular weights. The gas analyzer is capable of measuring small quantities of isotopically labeled gas, which may be present in the breath of a patient.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">There are a number of different operational modes for each type of test for such a breath analyzer, in which the analysis is performed on-line in real time whilst a patient is continuing to provide breath for subsequent analyses. In a common mode of operation, a breath test analyzer senses exhaled breath of a patient before ingestion of an isotopically labeled substance, analyzes the exhaled breath of a patient for the percentage of isotopically labeled gas from the total exhaled gas of that composition, in order to obtain a baseline reading. At least one more similar analysis after ingestion of an isotopically labeled substance, provides an indication of a medical condition within a time period. The time period defined to be the last sensing, which is between the first sensing of the patient's exhaled breath and the second sensing. This feature differs these breath analyzers from all the rest, since it provide analyses in a very short time period.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In an alternative mode of operation, the analyses are made successively at times after ingestion of an isotopically labeled substance, and before the end of production of the isotopically labeled by-products of the substance, and the analyzer performs comparisons of the change from sample to sample of the percentage of the isotopically labeled gas in the total exhaled gas of that composition, and thereby provides an indication of a medical condition as soon as the detected change in gas composition percentage permits it, and before the end of production of the isotopically labeled by-products of the substance.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In accordance with some embodiments, there are at least two modes of analyzing the breath samples.

<p id="p-0140" num="0139">To assess the maximum capacity of the liver or a particular enzyme in the liver to metabolize a compound such as methacetin and the rate of its metabolization, the total amount should be fully delivered to the liver as quickly and as completely as possible. In terms of classical enzyme kinetics one should be at zero order kinetics and not first-order kinetics. In zero order kinetics the amount of test substance exceeds the maximum capacity of the enzyme to metabolize it and therefore the rate of product production is an accurate measure of the maximum functionally capacity of the enzyme.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Solubility of Methacetin and Methacetin-<sup>13</sup>C:</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Since the use of a stable isotope of carbon does not alter the general physical and chemical properties, all studies with Methacetin-<sup>13</sup>C may also apply to methacetin (unlabeled) and vice versa. According to some embodiments, the term &#x201c;methacetin&#x201d; may refer to an isotopically labeled methacetin.

<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The solubility of methacetin in water is limited and therefore dissolving methacetin in tap water room temperature is difficult even at concentrations of 75 mg to 150 ml. Furthermore, methacetin can form microcrystals and/or granule forms that further make its dissolution difficult. Common practice is to use 75 mg in 150-200 ml of tap water used for oral administration but in most cases it is difficult to assure 100% dissolution. How much may undergo decomposition in the acid environment of the stomach or may precipitate from solution is not known with certainty and may vary considerably.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Another variable is the length of time that both the insoluble and soluble methacetin enters the small intestines where absorption begins. The absorbed compound enters portal vein blood and is delivered to the liver for metabolism. The insoluble fraction must await solution in the intestinal and pancreatic fluids that enter the lumen before absorption occurs. Thus the phase of intestinal absorption is relatively long and delivery to the liver closer to first-order rather than zero order kinetics, which lessens the ability to distinguish low from normal enzyme levels in the liver and therefore loss of liver function. Also, it introduced an uncontrolled variable that affects the inter and intra patient variability (crucial in any case also when patients are in more advanced stages of disease). The correct dosage form may improve absorption.</p>

<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Cyclodextrins are cyclic oligosaccharides consisting of 6, 7, or 8 glucopyranose units, usually referred to as alpha, beta or gamma cyclodextrins, respectively. These naturally occurring compounds have relatively rigid doughnut-shaped structures, and may be used as natural complexing agents. The unique structures of these compounds owe their stability to intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the C<sub>2</sub>- and C<sub>3</sub>-hydroxyl groups of neighboring glucopyranose units. The molecule takes on the shape of a torus with the C<sub>2</sub>- and C<sub>3</sub>-hydroxyls located around the larger opening and the more reactive C<sub>6</sub>-hydroxyl aligned around the smaller opening. The arrangement of C<sub>6</sub>-hydroxyls opposite the hydrogen bonded C<sub>2</sub>- and C<sub>3</sub>-hydroxyls forces the oxygen bonds into close proximity within the cavity, leading to an electron rich, hydrophobic interior. The size of this hydrophobic cavity is a function of the number of glucopyranose units forming the cyclodextrin. The solubility of natural cyclodextrins is very poor and initially this prevented cyclodextrins from becoming effective complexing agents. Chemical substitutions at the 2, 3, and 6 hydroxyl sites would greatly increase solubility. The degree of chemical substitution, as well as, the nature of the groups used for substitution, determines the final maximum concentration of cyclodextrin in an aqueous medium. Cavity size is a major determinant as to which cyclodextrin is used in complexation. &#x201c;Fit&#x201d; is critical to achieving good incorporation of cyclodextrins. Six glucopyranose unit compounds or alpha-cyclodextrins have small cavities, which are not capable of accepting many molecules. Eight-glucopyranose unit compounds or gamma-cyclodextrins may, in some cases, have larger cavities than some molecules to be incorporated and cyclodextrin hydrophobic charges cannot effectively interact to facilitate complexation. Hydrophobic molecules may be incorporated into the cavity of cyclodextrins by displacing water. This reaction may be favored by the repulsion of the molecule by water. This effectively encapsulates the molecule of interest within the cyclodextrin, rendering the molecule water-soluble. When the water-soluble complex is diluted in a much larger volume of aqueous solvent, the process may be reversed, thereby releasing the molecule of interest into the solution (The Source. (1991).

According to some embodiments, the complexes may include from 10% to 50% by weight of methacetin according to the total weight of the complex. According to other embodiments, the complexes may include from 10% to 20% by weight of methacetin according to the total weight of the complex. According to other embodiments, the complexes may include from 15% to 25% by weight of methacetin according to the total weight of the complex. According to other embodiments, the complexes may include from 20% to 30% by weight of methacetin according to the total weight of the complex. According to other embodiments, the complexes may include from 30% to 40% by weight of methacetin according to the total weight of the complex.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">According to some embodiments, the water-soluble form of methacetin may include an organic solvent. In another embodiment, the organic solvent may be a non-toxic organic solvent. In another embodiment, the water-soluble form of methacetin may include methacetin pre-dissolved in an organic solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">According to some embodiments, the water-soluble form of methacetin may be in the form of a dry solid, particulates, powder, particles and the like. In another embodiment, water may be added prior to administration.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Stability of Methacetin and Methacetin-<sup>13</sup>C:</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">According to some embodiments, the water-soluble forms of methacetin as described herein may stabilize the methacetin and may prevent the loss of the methoxy group or other evidence of decomposition.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">According to some embodiments, methacetin-<sup>13</sup>C may be stable in water and does not undergo loss of the methoxy group or other evidence of decomposition.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Although cyclodextrins as a class of compounds are known to be useful for the solubilization of other chemicals, the solubility of methacetin in hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin is not predictable and other cyclodextrins such as alpha and gamma cyclodextrin, also known for their general solubilization properties, were found less effective in solubilizing methacetin.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Unexpected results showed potential enhancement of stability of the molecule may be attributable, according to some embodiments, to the allylic structure of methacetin, which makes it susceptible to oxidation. Within the torus it appears that the light energies that favor oxidation (decomposition) are absorbed by the sugar molecules and therefore shield the methacetin.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">In another embodiment, the disclosure also relates to pharmaceutical compositions, which may include a predetermined amount of water-soluble form of methacetin, a salt or a derivative thereof, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition may be in any form, including but not limited to a liquid, solution, gel, solid, particulates, powder, particles and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients may include water, binders, diluents, disintegrating agents, stabilizing agents, preservatives, lubricants, fragrances, flavoring agents, sweeteners and other excipients known in the field of the pharmaceutical technology. Carriers and excipients may include hydroxypropylcellulose, lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, calcium carbonate, starch, colloidal silicone dioxide, sodium starch glycolate, talc, magnesium stearate, polyvinylpyrolidone, and other excipients known in the field of the pharmaceutical technology.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Optionally, according to some embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions may be combination products including one or more active components in addition to methacetin.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Pharmaceutical compositions in a solid dosage forms, may be in accordance with some embodiments, tablets with immediate release of the methacetin, effervescent tablets or dispersion tablets and capsules.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">The pharmaceutical compositions may be prepared by methods known in the field of the pharmaceutical technology.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">In contrast to the current form of administration, specifically, methacetin in water, it is possible, according to some embodiments, to deliver all the pre-determined amount of methacetin as a small bolus that quickly clears the esophagus and enter the stomach where some dilution by gastric juice can occur. In another embodiment, dilution of the bolus does not cause precipitation of the methacetin and it will all be delivered more quickly to the intestines for absorption.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">In one embodiment, because a complexing agent, for example hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin maintains the solubility of methacetin, a greater concentration may come in contact with the intestinal mucosa and more rapid absorption ensues.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Thus, the administration of water-soluble form of methacetin more closely approaches zero order kinetics and may be a more uniform, test for functional liver capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">In one embodiment there is further provided a method for the preparation of a water-soluble form of methacetin a salt or a derivative thereof, the method may include dissolving a complexing agent in water and adding methacetin, a salt or a derivative thereof. In another embodiment, the method further includes stirring the mixture at a temperature in the range from about 20&#xb0; C. to 100&#xb0; C. (for example, but not limited to, stirring the mixture at a temperature in the range from about 20&#xb0; C. to 30&#xb0; C., until the methacetin, a salt or a derivative thereof are inserted is dissolved into the complex). In another embodiment, a complexing agent is used and or inserted into the complex at temperatures in the range of 20-100&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">In another embodiment, the method further includes drying in any appropriate manner. For example, but not limited to, lyophilization, spray-drying and any other suitable method.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">In another embodiment, the method further includes encapsulating the water-soluble form of methacetin. According to some embodiments, the capsule may be swallowed and dissolves in gastric juice in the stomach and may quickly enter the intestines as a small bolus. In another version the capsule may be enteric-coated and may not be dissolved until after entering the intestines. Dissolution of the capsule delivers the methacetin immediately and in large concentration to the absorbing surface thus yielding high concentrations in the portal vein, which delivers the medication to the liver.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">In another embodiment, the disclosure relates to use of the water-soluble form of methacetin, a salt or a derivative thereof for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for use in testing liver functional capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">In accordance with some embodiments, the water-soluble form of methacetin may be used in any of the methods referred to herein. In another embodiment, the water-soluble form of methacetin may be used in any test that evaluates the liver function. In another embodiment, the water-soluble form of methacetin may be used in any breath test that evaluates the liver function. According to some exemplary embodiments, the water-soluble form of methacetin may be used in any method that would be known to one of skill in the art for testing a liver function, for example, as disclosed in the following publications: B.
