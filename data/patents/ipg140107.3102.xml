<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/879,564 filed Jul. 18, 2007, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The subject matter discussed herein relates to the art of testing a stick electrode and more particularly to a system and method of rating a stick electrode as to the arc maintaining characteristic of the electrode as determined by open circuit voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Welding systems use stick electrodes that may vary in quality depending on many variables. For example only, a stick electrode may vary in quality because of handling and or storage of the electrode by an end user.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Embodiments relate to a system and method of rating a stick electrode. With reference to the drawings, like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views. However, the inclusion of like elements in different views does not mean a given embodiment necessarily includes such elements or that all embodiments of the invention include such elements.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A quality characteristic of a stick electrode is its ability to maintain an arc at low heat energy. This is also expressed as a low open circuit voltage. Indeed, this characteristic of maintaining an arc at low energy is more critical in an electrode which contains a fluxing system, because such system affects the arc stability and makes it more difficult to maintain an arc or plasma at a high arc length. The system and method relate to rating a stick electrode having an outside coating with a flux system, such as a rutile fluxing system.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The system and method relate to rating a stick electrode E for its ability to maintain an arc at low voltages and/or low currents. This is also expressed as low wattage and/or low power. The rating fixture or set-up <b>10</b> involves an elongated simulating pipe joint defined by gap <b>12</b> and upper groove <b>14</b> formed by two spaced plates <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> representing pipe sections. Stick electrode E is schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> and includes an integral fluxing system, e.g., a rutile fluxing system. Set-up fixture <b>10</b> is used to rate the arc maintaining capabilities of stick electrode E, which ability is an important quality characteristic of a stick electrode used in manual welding. Rating a stick electrode involves the ability of the electrode to maintain arc A as the voltage or current is decreased in a manner schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> or when the voltage is decreased as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. These two figures each illustrate a standard power source <b>30</b> driven by power supply <b>32</b> to create waveforms across output leads <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> connected to electrode E and workpiece WP. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the power source controller includes the capability of decreasing, in gradual increments, the arc current and recording such decrements as indicated by device <b>40</b>. In a like manner, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the controller of power source <b>30</b> includes a device <b>42</b> for decreasing gradually and recording changes in voltage. Devices <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, respectively, are used in performing different embodiments of the system and method.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In accordance with an embodiment, when welding in DC positive, the testing procedure set forth in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is normally employed wherein device <b>40</b> gradually decreases the arc current so a deposition rate decreases along curve <b>50</b> from a high starting point <b>52</b>. As electrode E is moved along groove <b>14</b> for welding in the joint between plates <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, device <b>40</b> continues to decrease the welding current until arc A is extinguished at OCV point <b>54</b>. At that point, the open circuit voltage of power source <b>30</b> is recorded. This is accomplished by device <b>60</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> wherein the arc voltage is detected by circuit <b>62</b> so that the open circuit voltage at point <b>54</b> appears as digital information on outlet line <b>62</b><i>a</i>. The open circuit condition is sensed by shunt <b>64</b>, which indicates zero current in line <b>66</b> when the arc has been extinguished at point <b>54</b>. Thus, at point <b>54</b> recording device <b>60</b>, e.g., a program or circuit, records a digital number indicative of the open circuit voltage at point <b>54</b>. As shown in column <b>72</b> the area of the particular electrodes being rated is recorded. In another embodiment, more than one electrode of each type is tested by the method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The number in column <b>72</b> is the average open circuit voltage OCV for all electrodes of a given type being rated. Thus, the rating of an electrode is the average open circuit voltage OCV, which average number or value is exhibited in column <b>74</b>. The number, in digital format, is used for expressing the arc stability characteristic of electrode E as rated by the present method. This rating method is performed by program <b>80</b> shown in the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In this program the electrode to be rated is selected as step <b>82</b>. The arc current is decremented, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and represented by step <b>84</b>. When the point <b>54</b> has been reached, the open circuit voltage is identified and recorded by device or program <b>60</b>, which constitutes step <b>86</b>. In one embodiment, this concludes the actual rating procedure. In another embodiment, several electrodes are processed to obtain an average open circuit voltage. This is indicated at step <b>90</b> wherein several electrodes A are processed to obtain several points <b>54</b>. The total value of the several values for the open circuit voltage at points <b>54</b> of the electrodes is averaged as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and represented at step <b>92</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Program <b>80</b> assigns a rating number to the electrode as indicated at step <b>94</b>. This rating number is recorded in column <b>74</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> to evaluate the arc maintaining capabilities of various competitive electrodes. The method may use the machine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to perform the procedures illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>; however, other methods can be used for determining the low energy arc stability of a stick electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Converting the open circuit voltage value at point <b>54</b> into an energy rating number is accomplished by circuit EC in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. Circuit EC is used to determine and record the combination of the current and open circuit voltage when the arc is extinguished at point <b>54</b>. The lowest energy required to maintain an arc is determined by circuit EC where the current on line <b>66</b> is directed to a holding circuit <b>100</b>, so output line <b>102</b> has a number representing the current at point <b>54</b>. This number is one input to multiplier <b>110</b>. The other input is a number representing the open circuit voltage at point <b>54</b>. The second number appears on line <b>62</b><i>a</i>. These two numbers or values are multiplied to provide a watt calculation on line <b>112</b>. This calculation gives a digital number referred to as the &#x201c;energy&#x201d; rating number and it is recorded in register <b>120</b>. Thus, after performing the rating method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, resulting data from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is processed by circuit EC to give an energy rating for electrode E. The electrode will lose its welding arc at an energy below the energy recorded in register <b>120</b>. This recorded number is a stability characteristic of electrode E. It indicates the ability to withstand large arc lengths and deviations in arc current. The rating method is described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and an evaluation technique for this data is performed by circuit EC of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Another embodiment for rating a stick electrode by the power or energy that will no longer sustain an arc is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-11</figref>. This embodiment is especially applicable for AC welding and DC negative welding and uses the machine schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. This machine has the features of the machine in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> with device <b>42</b> for incrementally reducing the welding voltage while maintaining the welding current constant. This embodiment of the invention is schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> where the rating method generates graph <b>150</b>. This graph is created by holding the welding current constant at a given value and then decreasing the arc voltage by device <b>42</b>. The arc voltage is directed to program or device <b>60</b> from voltage detector <b>62</b> on line <b>62</b><i>a</i>. A series of procedures are performed in rating electrode E. These procedures each involve holding the arc current constant and reducing the arc voltage until the arc energy does not sustain the plasma column or arc. These procedures are shown as separate procedures <b>150</b><i>a</i>-<b>150</b><i>g </i>to determine the points a-g at which the energy of the arc is insufficient to maintain the arc. Consequently, at each current of the procedures <b>150</b><i>a</i>-<b>150</b><i>g </i>an open circuit voltage point a-g is determined. These points are plotted as curve <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> for electrode E<b>1</b>. This curve is plotted by using the data created by the method described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Testing of electrode E<b>1</b> generates data points to plot curve <b>200</b>. Other electrodes E<b>2</b>, E<b>3</b> are processed by the method in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> to plot curve <b>202</b> and curve <b>204</b>, respectively. These curves have an integrated area <b>210</b> under the curve, which area encompasses all energy levels where the electrode cannot sustain an arc. Each energy level is a product of current and voltage and is the same as the output of circuit EC shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. Consequently, the area under the curves determine the quality characteristic of each electrode. The area represents the ability to sustain a welding arc at low energy levels. Areas A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b> and A<b>3</b> are set forth in column <b>222</b> of table <b>220</b> as they relate to and correlate with electrodes E<b>1</b>, E<b>2</b> and E<b>3</b> in column <b>222</b> of table <b>220</b>. The evaluation of the electrodes as compared to each other is the numerical value established by the area under the curve shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and is recorded on table <b>220</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In another rating procedure using calculated areas, the different electrodes are compared by a program performing the algorithm of the conversion chart <b>230</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Several electrodes are processed in accordance with the method in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> to establish the area under the plotted curve, as disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The summation of all of these areas for a given electrode is then divided by the number of electrodes tested. This data manipulation generates a digital number recorded in column <b>236</b> of chart <b>230</b>. The recorded number relates to the electrodes in column <b>232</b> by executing the intermediate calculation in column <b>234</b>. The relative quality of the individual electrodes is the number in column <b>224</b> of table <b>220</b> or the number in column <b>236</b> of conversion chart <b>230</b>. This rating technique or method is performed, using the basic concept shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> as further set forth and modified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A flow chart of program <b>300</b> for the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Step <b>302</b> involves selecting the electrode to be evaluated. At step <b>304</b>, a constant current is maintained at one of the several procedures set forth in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. At step <b>306</b>, the arc voltage is decreased by device <b>42</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to create one of the &#x201c;out&#x201d; points a-g of graph <b>150</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, step <b>310</b> involves plotting the curves <b>200</b>, <b>202</b> or <b>204</b> based upon the determined open circuit points a-g. At step <b>312</b>, the area under a curve is calculated by an algorithm, as explained in connection with table <b>220</b>. This process step assigns a rating number at step <b>314</b>. This rating number is either the area of column <b>224</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> or the calculated number for the average area in column <b>236</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-10</figref> illustrate the basic concept of reducing either the current or the voltage to determine the open circuit voltage or the point in which the arc energy will not sustain an arc. This determination of the open circuit voltage or arc sustaining energy is expressed in an assigned number to rate the quality of the electrode. In alternative embodiments, there are other processes for employing the concept of measuring the sustaining power or energy of the arc for a given electrode to rate an electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The procedure in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a single procedure wherein the current is reduced until the arc plasma is no longer sustained. This same simple one step procedure is used many times in the rating method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. This one step concept is schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> wherein procedure <b>350</b> is like one of the several procedures <b>150</b><i>a</i>-<b>150</b><i>g</i>. The arc current is held constant at a value K and the arc voltage is reduced along line <b>352</b> until the arc is extinguished at point <b>354</b>. This is the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, but using voltage. These procedures determine the wattage, or more simply the open circuit voltage, at which the arc is no longer sustainable. This value is used in determining the quality of a stick electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In summary, an embodiment of the present invention comprises a method of representing arc maintainability of an electric arc welding stick electrode for depositing molten metal from the electrode onto a workpiece by using an arc between the electrode and the workpiece, wherein the arc is caused by a voltage from a power source where the voltage creates a current of the arc. In accordance with an embodiment, the stick electrode has an outer coating containing a fluxing system, and the fluxing system is rutile based. The method includes creating the arc between the electrode and the workpiece and moving the electrode along the workpiece while maintaining the arc.

The method also includes determining an open circuit voltage of the power source at the point where the arc is extinguished and rating the electrode by multiplying the open circuit voltage by a current of the arc just before reaching the point where the arc is extinguished to obtain an energy rating number. The step of decreasing may relate to the current of the arc or the voltage of the arc. The voltage may be one of a DC positive voltage, a DC negative voltage, or an AC voltage. The rating step may further include obtaining the point for N electrodes, adding the energy rating numbers of the N points to obtain a total, and using the total to rate the electrodes. The total may be divided by N before being used to rate the electrodes, in accordance with an embodiment.</p>
