<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from Japanese patent application No. 2010-239920, filed on Oct. 26, 2010, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a piping system connected to equipment in a petrochemical plant or a power plant. The equipment is a rotary machine such as an expander of a fluidized catalytic cracker (FCC) or to a high-temperature reactor, and the like in which the allowable value of a load applied from a pipe arrangement is small.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Since the expander of the FCC has a precise rotational mechanism, any excessive force or moment must be prevented from being applied to an equipment of this type. Hence, in a metal piping system connected into an equipment nozzle installed in such an equipment, measures are taken to reduce loads on the nozzle.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One of such measures taken conventionally is installing several tied expansion joints installed in the piping system to absorb displacement caused by thermal displacement of the equipment nozzle and thermal expansion of the pipe during facility running. As the expansion joint, a bellows type expansion joint including a bellows (refer to Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS) B 2352) is generally known. Table 1 of JIS B 2352 shows several types of bellows type expansion joints. Applying a simplest untied bellows type expansion joint among them to connect the pipes to each other enables absorption of axial displacement, axial-perpendicular displacement, and angular displacement of the pipe in an arbitrary plane excluding a twist. As a result, loads on the nozzle can be reduced by converting large force due to bending of pipe into small force due to bending of bellows.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a joint of this type, however, a force (hereinafter, internal-pressure thrust) generated by internal pressure in the bellows in a direction on separating the pipes from each other (or direction for attracting each other) is applied to the equipment nozzle. This makes it difficult to apply the simple untied bellows type expansion joint when a pipe bore or the internal pressure becomes larger. In such a case, a tied bellows type expansion joint is used, which includes a mechanism of restricting axial expansion of the bellows no to transmit the internal-pressure thrust to the outside of the bellows. Well-known types of tied bellows type expansion joints include a hinge type expansion joint that absorbs only angular displacement in one plane by using a hinge at pipe ends connected via the bellows, a gimbal type expansion joint that absorbs not only the angular displacement in one plane but also angular displacement in an arbitrary plane, and a universal expansion joint that absorbs axial-perpendicular displacement in the arbitrary plane (refer to JP10-141565A).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Where the piping system moves vertically due to thermal expansion of each piping member, a special pipe support device to support piping weight with following the vertical movement is necessary. For this purpose, the piping system is installed in a lifted state by using spring hanger supports such as variable spring hangers or constant spring hangers that has a mechanism to reduce load variation by the movement.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As a method for using the bellows type expansion joint to absorb the axial displacement without transmitting the internal-pressure thrust to the outside of the bellows type expansion joint, a bellows type expansion joint of pressure balanced type is used, which additionally includes a bellows to cancel the internal-pressure thrust and tie rods disposed to permit the axial displacement in a state of keeping the balance (refer to FIG. 8 of JP10-141565A or FIGURES of U.S. Pat. No. 4,265,472).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As described above, in the conventional piping system that includes several tied bellows type expansion joints, the loads applied on the equipment nozzle can be reduced. However, this load reduction measure is becoming insufficient due to recent trend toward larger capacity plant.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">When a pipe bore increases as the plant is enlarged, the internal-pressure thrust applied at bellows becomes larger, and the spring constant of the bellows itself increases. The pipe also becomes longer, and hence displacement to be absorbed is enlarged. A frictional force at a sliding portion such as the hinge or the gimbal increases, causing an increase in loads on the equipment nozzle. The spring hanger supports also have friction at sliding portion and spring itself, and reaction force generates during movement. This force is called as load for initial movement and it becomes approximately 5% of supporting load. Thus, an influence of the force in the spring hanger supports on the equipment nozzle can no longer be negligible. For example, pipe weight is 11 tons per meter in the case of a stainless-steel pipe having a diameter of &#x3c6;3500 millimeters and a thickness of 135 millimeters. When 14 meters of pipe is supported by spring hanger supports on the equipment nozzle, total pipe weight is 150 tons and the load for initial movement reaches about 7.5 tons. As a result, this load becomes predominant, exceeding the allowable value of a load for the equipment nozzle.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In order to prevent application of various loads including the internal-pressure thrust, the spring reaction force, and the frictional force of the piping system, and the operation resistance of the hanger support on the equipment nozzle, a method for installing a bellows type expansion joint of pressure balanced type between the equipment nozzle and the piping member and setting a fixed point (anchor) as close as possible to the bellows of the piping member to fix the piping system, has been considered on a conceptual basis. This anchor prevent any piping load, friction and reaction force being transmitted to the equipment nozzle side from another side of the anchor by rigidly supporting the piping However, in the conventional art, this method has been difficult for the following reasons.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Under such conditions, an internal-pressure thrust and a spring reaction force due to displacement of the bellows are applied to the equipment nozzle. The internal-pressure thrust can be absorbed by employing the above-mentioned bellows type expansion joint of pressure balanced type. However, when the piping member close to the bellows is fixed, all axial thermal expansion at the equipment nozzle must be absorbed by compression displacement of the bellows. When the bellows type expansion joint of pressure balanced type is employed, the pipe bore is enlarged to increase the spring constant of the single bellows, and the influence of an additional pressure balanced type bellows increases the spring constant more. As a result, the spring reaction force increases, and the loads on the equipment nozzle exceed the allowable value, making it impractical to set an anchor in the piping member close to the bellows within the scope of conventional art. Therefore, there is an urgent need to achieve a method for setting an anchor in the piping member close to the bellows by developing a pressure balanced type expansion joint system with a novel technology. That is to balance spring reaction force of main bellows by displacement at equipment nozzle with that of balanced bellows by thermal displacement at piping piece in the expansion joint system.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention has been developed in view of the problems of the background art, and an object of the present invention is to provide a piping system that can reduce loads applied to an equipment nozzle with reliability although pipe bore is enlarged by recent trend to increase plant capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to an aspect of the present invention, a piping system includes: a bellows type expansion joint connected into an equipment nozzle of an equipment; a main pipe; a first pipe member that is connected to the equipment nozzle that extends from the equipment, and that is connected to one end of the main pipe via a first bellows; a second pipe member having one end connected to a side part of the main pipe; a third pipe member connected to the other end of the second pipe member via a second bellows;</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">a first tie rod support member (flange) fixed to an outer circumference of the first pipe member; a second tie rod support member (flange) fixed to an outer circumference of the third pipe member; tie rods that maintain a fixed distance between the first tie rod support member and the second tie rod support member; and an anchor disposed to set a portion of the main pipe near the first bellows as a fixed point.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In this case, lengths of the pipe members between the first tie rod support member and the second tie rod support member are determined so that the first bellows contracts due to thermal displacement at the equipment nozzle, the first pipe member, and the pipe member of the main pipe closer to the equipment nozzle than to the anchor, and the second bellows contracts so that it is displaced (contraction amount) equally to the first bellows by thermal expansion of all the pipe members between the first and second tie rod support members.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">This configuration uses a structure of the bellows type expansion joint of pressure balanced type. Hence, the internal-pressure thrust generated by internal pressure can be balanced by the first bellows and the second bellows. A length of each piping member between the first tie rod support member and the second tie rod support member is adjusted, and both bellows are always set to be equal in contraction displacement with respect to thermal expansion of the equipment nozzle and all the piping members. As a result, spring reaction forces of the bellows are canceled.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Thus, according to the present invention, in the piping system, where pipes that are heavier than the equipment nozzle and that thermally expand (or thermally contract) due to the temperature of the internal fluids are connected, loads on the equipment can be reduced. As compared to the conventional design method in which a conventional hinge-type expansion joint, a gimbal type expansion joint and an universal expansion joint are used, a friction force or operation resistance that is applied to the equipment nozzle from the piping system can be more significantly reduced because the anchor set is set close to the nozzle. Moreover, the spring reaction forces of the bellows are canceled by using the displacement of the bellows caused by the thermal expansion of the piping members in the piping system, and hence loads on the equipment nozzle can be reduced more significantly than in the case of using the conventional pressure balanced type expansion joint.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate examples of the present invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0044">A piping system according to the present invention employs a bellows type expansion joint to which a pressure balance method is being applied. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a side view showing in outline the piping system according to an exemplary embodiment. As shown, a lower end of the piping system is connected to an equipment nozzle such as a rotary machine, and the piping system is an apparatus designed to reduce an external force (pipe self-weight, thermal expansion of a pipe, spring reaction force of a bellows, internal-pressure thrust, loads of other places, frictional force, or operation resistance) on the equipment nozzle.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example where a pipe extending in a horizontal direction is connected into the equipment nozzle. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, elbow pipe (curved pipe) <b>1</b> has input terminal <b>2</b> and discharge terminal <b>3</b>. Discharge terminal <b>3</b> of elbow pipe <b>1</b> is connected to the pipe that extends in the horizontal direction. Input terminal <b>2</b> of elbow pipe <b>1</b> is connected to straight pipe <b>5</b> via bellows <b>4</b>. Straight pipe <b>5</b> is connected to equipment nozzle <b>6</b>. On a surface of an arch portion of elbow pipe <b>1</b>, straight pipe <b>7</b> is welded to be in series with a straight-pipe portion of elbow pipe <b>1</b>. Straight pipe <b>7</b> communicates with the inside of elbow pipe <b>1</b>. Straight pipe <b>7</b> and elbow pipe <b>1</b> are equal in diameter. To set a temperature of straight pipe <b>7</b> equal to that of elbow pipe <b>1</b>, the opening of a communication portion is preferably formed large so that internal fluids having some temperature can sufficiently flow into straight pipe <b>7</b>. Thus, the elbow of elbow pipe <b>1</b> may be replaced with a tee. Straight pipe <b>9</b> is connected to an end of straight pipe <b>7</b> opposite elbow pipe <b>1</b> via bellows <b>8</b> equal in diameter to bellows <b>4</b>. Straight pipes <b>5</b> and <b>9</b> respectively include tie rod support flanges <b>10</b> and <b>11</b>. The two tie rod support flanges <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> are interconnected by a plurality of tie rods <b>12</b> arranged at equal intervals and equal in length. The flanges are taken as examples of tie rod support members in the exemplary embodiment. However, the tie rod support members are not limited to the flanges. Other support units can be applied.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0046">The straight pipe portion of elbow pipe <b>1</b> close to bellows <b>4</b> is connected to anchor <b>13</b>. This connection portion is not moved by any external force (namely, fixed point). Anchor <b>13</b> is made of a plate material, and welded to elbow pipe <b>1</b>. An attaching portion of anchor <b>13</b> is fixed to a shaped-steel structure directly fixed to a concrete foundation in which equipment <b>14</b> is installed. Equipment <b>14</b> is fixed so as not to be moved by any external force. Fixed point <b>15</b> of the equipment and anchor <b>13</b> (fixed point) of the piping system are respectively base points of thermal expansion of the equipment nozzle and the piping system. However, these base points are not necessarily on a center line of equipment nozzle <b>6</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, as long as they are on a straight line vertical to the installation surface of equipment <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0047">As described above, bellows <b>4</b> is disposed between equipment nozzle <b>6</b> and elbow pipe <b>1</b> connected to equipment nozzle <b>6</b>, and the portion of elbow pipe <b>1</b> as close as possible to bellows <b>4</b> on manufacturing is set as the fixed point by using anchor <b>13</b>. Thus, an external force of the piping system is prevented from being directly applied on the equipment while contraction (namely, spring reaction force) of bellows <b>4</b> is reduced as much as possible. The portion as close as possible to bellows <b>4</b> on manufacturing can appropriately be determined from a distance larger by, for example, four to five times than a thickness of the pipe from a connection terminal (welding line) of bellows <b>4</b> and elbow pipe <b>1</b> in view of a thermal influence, or the other restrictions on manufacturing or installation.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0048">In the piping system, an axial internal-pressure thrust is applied on both ends of bellows <b>4</b> due to the pressure of fluids that pass through elbow pipe <b>1</b> (pipe inner pressure). A spring reaction force generated by displacement of bellows <b>4</b> and bellows <b>8</b>, when each piping member is thermally expanded, is applied to equipment nozzle <b>6</b>. However, when an internal-pressure thrust is applied to bellows <b>4</b>, an internal-pressure thrust is also applied to bellows <b>8</b>. A downward internal-pressure thrust of bellows <b>4</b> is transmitted to straight pipe <b>5</b>, while an upward internal-pressure thrust of bellows <b>8</b> is transmitted to straight pipe <b>9</b>. However, both internal-pressure thrusts cancel each other because straight pipes <b>5</b> and <b>9</b> are interconnected by tie rods <b>12</b>. Hence, no internal-pressure thrust of the bellows is applied to equipment nozzle <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0049">For easy understanding, it is presumed that displacement due to thermal expansion between an upper end of tie rod support flange <b>10</b> and a lower end of tie rod support flange <b>11</b> is not taken into consideration. Then, bellows <b>4</b> contracts with respect to thermal movement of equipment nozzle <b>6</b>, while bellows <b>8</b> expands by an equal amount, and hence spring reaction forces of the bellows generated by such displacement are applied to equipment nozzle <b>6</b> in the same direction.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0050">The present invention employs the following design approach to prevent application of loads to equipment nozzle <b>6</b> by canceling the spring reaction forces of bellows <b>4</b> and <b>8</b> generated by the displacement.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0051">First, thermal expansion from equipment nozzle <b>6</b> to anchor <b>13</b> is checked. Concerning thermal expansion of the members above equipment nozzle <b>6</b>, straight pipe <b>5</b>, and part of elbow part <b>1</b> under anchor <b>13</b> of elbow pipe <b>1</b>, bellows <b>4</b> contracts and absorbs the thermal expansion by all members because anchor <b>13</b> is fixed. Next, thermal expansion between tie rod support flanges <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> is checked. The members between tie rod support flanges <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> move up as a whole while the length is maintained by thermal expansion of equipment nozzle <b>6</b>. Because of holding between these portions by tie rod <b>12</b>, bellows <b>4</b> and bellows <b>8</b> contract and absorb thermal expansion of elbow pipe <b>1</b>, straight pipe <b>7</b>, the members close to elbow pipe <b>1</b> from tie rod support flange <b>10</b> of straight pipe <b>5</b>, and the members close to straight pipe <b>7</b> from tie rod support flange <b>11</b> of straight pipe <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0052">The contraction amount of bellows <b>4</b> is determined based on the presence of anchor <b>13</b> in elbow pipe <b>1</b>. The contraction amount of bellows <b>8</b> is determined by remaining contraction amount between tie-rod support flange <b>10</b> and <b>11</b>. The distance LT0 between tie rod flanges <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> is enough long so that displacement of bellows <b>8</b> is also in contracting direction by thermal expansion between the tie-rod flanges taking bigger than the displacement at equipment nozzle <b>6</b>. Furthermore if the distance LT0 is adequately adjusted by strict calculation of thermal expansion, contraction amounts spring reaction forces by bellows <b>4</b> and bellows <b>8</b> can be same and thus spring reaction force by bellows <b>4</b> and bellows <b>8</b> can be equalized. As a result, no spring reaction force of the bellows is applied to equipment nozzle <b>6</b>, although equipment nozzle <b>6</b> is displaced.</p>

Hence, the following formula 1 is established:

<p id="p-0053" num="0070">In formula 1, assuming that the temperature distribution is uniform and materials are similar in the piping system, displacements due to thermal expansion of the respective pipe portions are calculated by the coefficient of thermal expansion &#x3b1;<sub>(t) </sub>at the same temperature.

<p id="p-0054" num="0071">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, when it is presumed that the temperature of the tie rods is unchanged, the length LT0 of tie rod <b>12</b> between the end of tie rod support flange <b>10</b> opposite equipment nozzle <b>6</b> and the end of tie rod support flange <b>11</b> on equipment nozzle <b>6</b> side becomes fixed irrespective of temperature changes of the other pipe portions. The sum of displacements due to thermal expansion of all the pipe portions there between is accordingly equal to the sum of displacements (contraction amounts) of bellows <b>4</b> and bellows <b>8</b>. Hence, following formula 2 is established:

Thus, in formula 2, when bellows <b>4</b> and <b>8</b> are equal in displacement, &#x394;LB2 can be replaced with &#x394;LB1. Hence, the following formula 3 can be established:

The piping system according to the exemplary embodiment has the structure of the bellows type expansion joint of pressure balanced type, and hence the internal-pressure thrust generated by the internal pressure can also be canceled.

<p id="p-0070" num="0087">When the bellows are different from each other in temperature and material, the theory that spring reaction forces of the bellows are equal when displacements of the bellows are equal has not been established.

<p id="p-0075" num="0092">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a straight pipe <b>21</b> disposed in a vertical direction (vertical direction shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) has input terminal <b>2</b> and discharge terminal <b>3</b>. Discharge terminal <b>3</b> of straight pipe <b>21</b> is connected to a pipe that extends in the vertical direction. Input terminal <b>2</b> of straight pipe <b>21</b> is connected to straight pipe <b>5</b> via bellows <b>4</b> (main pipe bellows). Straight pipe <b>5</b> is connected to equipment nozzle <b>6</b>. On an upper surface of straight pipe <b>21</b>, straight pipe <b>7</b> is welded to extend in a direction perpendicular to the extending direction of straight pipe <b>21</b>. Straight pipe <b>7</b> communicates with the inside of straight pipe <b>21</b>. Straight pipe <b>9</b> is connected to an end of straight pipe <b>7</b> opposite straight pipe <b>21</b> via bellows <b>8</b> (pressure balanced type bellows) equal in diameter to bellows <b>4</b>. Straight pipes <b>5</b> and <b>9</b> respectively include tie rod support flanges <b>10</b> and <b>11</b>. A plurality of tie rods <b>12</b>A arranged at equal intervals are connected to tie rod support flange <b>10</b>, and a plurality of tie rods <b>12</b>B arranged at equal intervals are connected to tie rod support flange <b>11</b>. Tie rod <b>12</b>A and tie rod <b>12</b>B extend in directions orthogonal to each other, and are connected to cam plates <b>25</b> fitted in a shaft attached to tie plate <b>22</b> disposed in straight pipe <b>21</b>. Thus, even when bellows <b>4</b> (main pipe bellows) and bellows <b>8</b> (pressure balanced type bellows) are not in a straight line, internal-pressure thrusts thereof can be balanced. The difference in size between straight pipe <b>21</b> that is thermally expanded and tie rod <b>12</b>A that is not thermally expanded can be transmitted to tie rod support flange <b>11</b> by rotating cam plates <b>25</b>. However, tie plate <b>22</b> is fixed to straight pipe <b>21</b>, and must be strong enough to receive a force of changing the direction of an internal-pressure thrust generated by internal pressure. In order to maintain application of formulas 2, 3, and 4, tie plate <b>22</b> is insulated to suppress thermal expansion with respect to the temperature in straight pipe <b>21</b>, and the length of LT02 must be kept unchanged.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0093">A straight pipe portion of straight pipe <b>21</b> close to bellows <b>4</b> is connected to anchor <b>13</b>.

<p id="p-0077" num="0094">Thus, in the piping system, as in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, spring reaction forces of the bellows can be canceled by adjusting sizes of the pipe portions.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0095">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, size LT3 in formula 4 corresponds to LT31+LT32: LT31 is a length [millimeters] of a pipe portion from the fixed point (anchor <b>13</b>) to the rotation axis (center of cam plate <b>25</b>) of tie plate <b>22</b>, and LT32 is the length [millimeters] from one (center of left cam plate <b>25</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of rotation axes <b>25</b> of tie plate <b>22</b> close to second bellows <b>8</b> to the connection terminal of the second bellows and second pipe member <b>7</b>. In other words, size LT31 and size LT32 can be determined by appropriately dividing a calculation result of the right side (2&#xb7;D1/&#x3b1;<sub>(t)</sub>+2&#xb7;L1+LT1+LT2&#x2212;LT4) of formula 4. By constructing the piping system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> using the determined sizes LT31 and LT32, with respect to displacement (only in a vertical direction) due to thermal expansion of equipment nozzle <b>6</b> caused by a temperature change, movement of equipment nozzle <b>6</b> can be canceled, and the spring reaction force of bellows <b>4</b> at this time can be canceled. This piping system also has a structure of a bellows type expansion joint of an pressure balanced type, and hence the internal-pressure thrust generated by internal pressure can be canceled. As a result, the external force applied from the piping system on the equipment nozzle can be reduced as much as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0096">When the temperature distribution in the piping system is uniform, and spring constants of bellows <b>4</b> and bellows <b>8</b> are equal to each other, the size of LT31 is calculated by the following formula 6:

<p id="p-0081" num="0098">Another example where a pipe extends straight in a vertical direction is a piping system that includes a plurality of pressure balanced type bellows shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0099">Pulleys and chains can be used in place of cam plates <b>25</b> and tie rods <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B. All the tie rods can be replaced with chains, or some tie rods can be replaced with chains.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0100">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, on an upper surface of straight pipe <b>21</b>, support plate <b>23</b> is welded to extend in a direction perpendicular to the extending direction of straight pipe <b>21</b>. Two pipes <b>7</b> are fixed on an upper surface of support plate <b>23</b>, and arranged in parallel sandwiching straight pipe <b>21</b>. Each straight pipe <b>7</b> communicates with the inside of straight pipe <b>7</b> via each conductor <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0101">Straight pipe <b>9</b> is connected to an end of each pipe <b>7</b> opposite support plate <b>23</b> via bellows <b>8</b> (pressure balanced type bellows) that is equal in cross-sectional area (namely, equal internal-pressure reaction force) and in bellows spring reaction force to bellows <b>4</b> at the sum of two places of both sides of straight pipe <b>21</b>. To describe more specifically for better understanding, the single bellows <b>8</b> has a cross-sectional area &#xbd; times larger than that of bellows <b>4</b>, and hence its diameter is larger by 1/&#x221a;2 times (effective bellows diameter: intermediate diameter between bottom and peak of bellows). The spring constant is larger by nearly 1&#x221a;2 times in proportion to this diameter when bellows cross-sectional shapes are similar. Thus, by adjusting the bottom-to-peak height of the bellows to be larger, and setting the spring constant to be larger by &#xbd; times than that of bellows <b>4</b>, balance can be kept with bellows <b>4</b> by bellows <b>8</b> at two places. Straight pipes <b>5</b> and <b>9</b> respectively include tie rod support flanges <b>10</b> and <b>11</b>. The two tie rod support flanges <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> are interconnected by a plurality of tie rods <b>12</b> arranged at equal intervals and equal in length. The straight pipe portion of straight pipe <b>21</b> close to bellows <b>4</b> is connected to anchor <b>13</b>. This connection portion is set as a place not moved by any external force (fixed point). As in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, anchor <b>13</b> is fixed by a shaped-steel structure directly fixed to the concrete foundation in which equipment <b>14</b> is installed.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0102">Thus, in the piping system, by using formulas 6 and 7, spring reaction forces of the bellows can be canceled by adjusting sizes of the pipe portions. In this piping system, there is no link type cam plate similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and hence the frictional force and resistance are reduced more.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0103">However, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, communication is established with straight pipes <b>7</b> and <b>9</b> through conductor <b>24</b> relatively smaller in bore than straight pipe <b>21</b>, and the structure is closed beyond pipes <b>7</b> and <b>9</b>. Thus, flowing of internal fluids stops here. The flowing structure of heat conducted from straight pipe <b>21</b> through the pipe member is smaller than those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, and hence it is difficult to maintain temperatures equal between straight pipes <b>7</b> and <b>9</b> and straight pipe <b>21</b>. This necessitates use of a value of a coefficient of thermal expansion &#x3b1;<sub>(t) </sub>different from that of straight pipe <b>21</b>. For example, when the temperatures of straight pipes <b>7</b> and <b>9</b> and bellows <b>8</b> are not increased, causing no thermal expansion, &#x3b1;<sub>(LT3, t)</sub>, &#x3b1;<sub>(LB2, t) </sub>and &#x3b1;<sub>(LT4, t) </sub>become zero in formula 7. The formula is accordingly simplified, and the size of LT31 is calculated by the following formula 8:

<p id="p-0088" num="0105">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref> do not show any hanger support, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, weights of straight pipe <b>5</b> and tie rod support flange <b>10</b> located below the bellows <b>4</b>, straight pipe <b>9</b> and tie rod support flange <b>11</b> located above the pressure balanced type bellows <b>8</b>, and tie rods <b>12</b> must be lifted by a spring support (or constant spring hanger lesser in load fluctuation caused by movement). The piping system must be supported at the center height of the pipe when used for a horizontal pipe. The frictional force and operation resistance must be reduced as much as possible in this case. Such a pipe support is not shown for simplicity.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0106">The installation of such a constant spring hanger necessitates examination of initial loads of the constant spring hanger. According to the present invention, however, the pipe members above bellows <b>4</b> are fixed by anchor <b>13</b> not to be moved. Thus, loads lifted by the constant spring hanger to reduce loads on equipment nozzle <b>6</b> are limited to tie rods <b>12</b> and the pipe members connected by the tie rods. Loads of such main pipes as elbow pipe <b>1</b> and straight pipe <b>12</b>, and pipes connected to the main pipes are supported by anchor <b>13</b>. Loads are accordingly reduced more greatly than those when the constant spring hanger lifts almost the entire piping system in the piping system of the conventional type, and initial loads of the constant spring hanger can be greatly reduced. As a result, even when a larger bore of a pipe is accompanied by an increase in pipe loads, loads on the equipment nozzle can be reduced more greatly than in the conventional piping system.</p>
