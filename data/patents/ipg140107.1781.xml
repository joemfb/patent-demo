<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A dispensing device for dispensing first and second medicaments to a patient that is made up of first and second stand-alone, interconnectable assemblies. The first of these assemblies comprises a fluid reservoir assembly that houses a fluid reservoir defining component while the second assembly comprises a fluid delivery and control assembly that includes an adding assembly for controllably dispensing the second medicament to the patient, a novel flow control means that functions to control the flow of medicinal fluid from the fluid reservoir of the first assembly toward the patient via a plurality of fluid flow control passageways. Because the stand-alone fluid delivery and control assembly is initially totally separate from the fluid reservoir assembly of the apparatus, the fluid flow passageways of the fluid delivery and control assembly can be effectively sterilized using conventional gamma ray sterilization techniques without adversely affecting the medicament contained within the fluid reservoir of the apparatus.</p>

<p id="p-0005" num="0004">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention relates generally to fluid dispensing devices. More particularly, the invention concerns a two part medicament dispenser for dispensing medicinal fluids to ambulatory patients that uniquely enables sterilization of the fluid flow channels without adversely affecting the medicament contained within the reservoir of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">2. Description of Related Art Including Information Disclosed Under 37 CFR 1.97 and 1.98</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A number of different types of medicament dispensers for dispensing medicaments to ambulatory patients have been suggested in the past. Many of the devices seek either to improve or to replace the traditional gravity flow and hypodermic syringe methods which have been the standard for delivery of liquid medicaments for many years.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">With regard to the prior art, one of the most versatile and unique fluid delivery apparatus developed in recent years is that developed by one of the present inventors and described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,205,820. The components of this novel fluid delivery apparatus generally include: a base assembly, an elastomeric membrane serving as a stored energy means, fluid flow channels for filling and delivery, flow control means, a cover, and an ullage which comprises a part of the base assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another prior art patent issued to one of the present applicants, namely U.S. Pat. No. 5,743,879, discloses an injectable medicament dispenser for use in controllably dispensing fluid medicaments such as insulin, anti-infectives, analgesics, oncolylotics, cardiac drugs, bio-pharmaceuticals, and the like from a pre-filled container at a uniform rate. The dispenser, which is quite dissimilar in construction and operation from that of the present invention, includes a stored energy source in the form of a compressively deformable, polymeric, elastomeric member that provides the force necessary to controllably discharge the medicament from a pre-filled container which is housed within the body of the device. After having been deformed, the polymeric, elastomeric member will return to its starting configuration in a highly predictable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A more recent fluid dispensing apparatus invented by one of the named inventors of the present application is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,220,245. This apparatus comprises a compact fluid dispenser for use in controllably dispensing fluid medicaments, such as, antibiotics, oncolylotics, hormones, steroids, blood clotting agents, analgesics, and like medicinal agents from prefilled containers at a uniform rate. The dispenser uniquely includes a stored energy source that is provided in the form of a substantially constant-force, compressible-expandable wave spring that provides the force necessary to continuously and uniformly expel fluid from the device reservoir. The device further includes a fluid flow control assembly that precisely controls the flow of medicament solution to the patient.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">By way of brief summary, one form of the dispensing device of the present invention for dispensing medicaments to a patient comprises first and second stand-alone, interconnectable assemblies. The first of these assemblies comprises a fluid reservoir assembly that houses a fluid reservoir defining component while the second assembly comprises a fluid delivery and control assembly that includes a novel flow control means that functions to control the flow of medicinal fluid from the fluid reservoir of the first assembly toward the patient via a plurality of fluid flow control passageways. A novel and highly important feature of the apparatus of the present invention resides in the fact that, because the stand-alone fluid delivery and control assembly is initially totally separate from the fluid reservoir assembly of the apparatus, the fluid flow passageways of the fluid delivery and control assembly can be effectively sterilized using conventional gamma ray sterilization techniques without adversely affecting the medicament contained within the fluid reservoir of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">With the forgoing in mind, it is an object of the present invention to provide a novel, two-part fluid dispensing apparatus for use in controllably dispensing fluid medicaments, such as antibiotics, anesthetics, analgesics, and like medicinal agents, at a uniform rate in which the fluid flow passageways of the apparatus can be effectively sterilized using conventional gamma ray sterilization techniques without adversely affecting the medicament contained within the fluid reservoir of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another object of the invention is to provide a fluid dispensing apparatus of the aforementioned character dispenser of simple construction and one that can be used in the home care environment with a minimum amount of training.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another object of the invention is to allow infusion therapy to be initiated quickly at the point of care without the assistance of a medical professional.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another object of the invention is to provide a novel, two part dispensing apparatus in which a stored energy source is provided in the form of a compressible, expandable or retractable member of novel construction that provides the force necessary to continuously and uniformly expel fluid from the device reservoir.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Another object of the invention is to provide a dispenser of the character described in the preceding paragraphs in which the stored energy source is provided in the form of a constant force spring that comprises a tightly coiled wound band of pre-hardened spring steel or stainless steel strip with built-in curvature so that each turn of the strip wraps tightly on its inner neighbor. When the strip is extended (deflected), the inherent stress resists the loading force; the same as a common extension spring but at a nearly constant (zero) rate.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Another object of the invention is to provide a dispenser of the class described which includes a fluid flow control assembly that precisely controls the flow of the medicament solution to the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Another object of the invention is to provide a dispenser of the type described which includes a fluid flow control assembly that, in turn, includes novel adding means for delivering selected additional medicaments to the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Another object of the invention is to provide a fluid dispensing apparatus that enables precise variable flow rate selection.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Another object of the invention is to provide a fluid dispensing apparatus of the character described in the preceding paragraphs that embodies an integrally formed, aseptically filled, unitary semi-rigid collapsible container that includes a fluid reservoir that contains the beneficial agents to be delivered to the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Another object of the invention is to provide a fluid dispensing apparatus of the class described which is compact and lightweight, is easy for ambulatory patients to use and is extremely reliable in operation.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Another object of the invention is to provide a fluid dispensing apparatus that is easy and inexpensive to manufacture in large quantities.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Definitions</heading>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">As used herein the following terms mean:</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Unitary Container:</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">A closed container formed from a single component.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Continuous/Uninterrupted Wall:</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">A wall having no break in uniformity or continuity.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Hermetically Sealed Container:</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">A container that is designed and intended to be secure against the entry of microorganisms and to maintain the safety and quality of its contents after pressurizing.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Aseptic Processing:</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">The term &#x2018;aseptic processing&#x2019; as it is applied in the pharmaceutical industry refers to the assembly of sterilized components and product in a specialized clean environment.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Sterile Product:</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">A sterile product is one that is free from all living organisms, whether in a vegetative or spore state.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Blow-Fill-Seal Process:</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The concept of aseptic blow-fill-seal (BFS) is that a container is formed, filled, and sealed as a unitary container in a continuous manner without human intervention in a sterile enclosed area inside a machine. The process is multi-stepped; pharmaceutical grade resin is extruded into a tube, which is then formed into a container. A mandrel is inserted into the newly formed container and filled. The container is then sealed, all inside a sterile shrouded chamber. The product is then discharged to a non-sterile area for packaging and distribution.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">Integrally Formed:</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">An article of one-piece construction, or several parts that are rigidly secured together, and smoothly continuous in form and that any such components making up the part have been then rendered inseparable.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Frangible:</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">An article, item or object that is capable of being ruptured or broken, but does not necessarily imply any inherent materials weakness. A material object, under load that demonstrates a mechanical strain rate deformation behavior, leading to disintegration.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Spring:</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">A mechanical element that can be deformed by a mechanical force such that the deformation is directly proportional to the force or torque applied to it. An elastic machine component able to deflect under load in a prescribed manner and able to recover its initial shape when unloaded.

<p id="h-0020" num="0000">Constant Force Spring:</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Constant force springs are a special variety of extension spring. They are tightly coiled wound bands of pre-hardened spring steel or stainless steel strip with built-in curvature so that each turn of the strip wraps tightly on its inner neighbor. When the strip is extended (deflected), the inherent stress resists the loading force, the same as a common extension spring but at a nearly constant (zero) rate. The constant-force spring is well suited to long extensions with no load build-up. In use, the spring is usually mounted with the Internal Diameter (ID) tightly wrapped on a drum and the free end attached to the loading force. Considerable flexibility is possible with constant-force springs because the load capacity can be multiplied by using two or more strips in tandem, or back-to-back. Constant force springs are available in a wide variety of sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Referring to the drawings and particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 8</figref>, one form of the two part fluid dispensing apparatus of the present invention for dispensing medicaments is there shown. The dispensing apparatus, which is generally designated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>1</b>A and <b>8</b>A by the numeral <b>50</b>, comprises two stand-alone, interconnectable assemblies <b>52</b> and <b>54</b>.

<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Considering first the unitary fluid reservoir assembly <b>52</b>, in addition to the reservoir defining component <b>56</b>, this assembly includes a carriage <b>60</b> and a stored energy means that is operably associated with the carriage for moving the carriage between a first retracted position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and a second advanced position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. As best seen by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, carriage <b>60</b> includes a base <b>60</b><i>a</i>, a reservoir receiving flange <b>60</b><i>b</i>, a carriage locking member receiving protuberance <b>60</b><i>c </i>and a stored energy means receiving skirt <b>60</b><i>d </i>which receives the novel stored energy means of the invention. Carriage <b>60</b> is releasably locked in its first position by a novel carriage locking means, the character of which will be described in the paragraphs which follow.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">The reservoir defining component <b>56</b>, the carriage <b>60</b> and a stored energy means are all housed within a generally cylindrically shaped housing <b>62</b> that includes a base <b>62</b><i>a</i>, an outer wall <b>62</b><i>b </i>and a front wall <b>62</b><i>c</i>. Connected to front wall <b>62</b><i>c </i>is an externally threaded connector neck <b>64</b>.

Sterile barrier <b>64</b><i>a</i>, which includes a pull tab <b>65</b>, here comprises a thin membrane constructed from any suitable polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, reservoir defining component <b>56</b> here comprises an integrally formed, hermetically sealed container that includes a front portion <b>56</b><i>a</i>, a rear portion <b>56</b><i>b </i>and a collapsible accordion-like, continuous, uninterrupted side wall <b>56</b><i>c </i>that interconnects the front and rear portion of the container. As illustrated in the drawings, the accordion like side wall <b>56</b><i>c </i>comprises a multiplicity of adjacent generally &#x201c;V&#x201d; shaped interconnected folds, <b>56</b><i>d</i>. Rear portion <b>56</b><i>b </i>of the container includes an inwardly extending ullage segment <b>66</b> having a side wall <b>66</b><i>a </i>and an end wall <b>66</b><i>b</i>.

<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Reservoir defining component <b>56</b> is constructed in accordance with aseptic blow-fill seal manufacturing techniques the character of which is well understood by those skilled in the art. Basically, this technique involves the continuous plastic extrusion through an extruder head of a length of parison in the form of a hollow tube between and through two co-acting first or main mold halves. The technique further includes the step of cutting off the parison below the extruder head and above the main mold halves to create an opening which allows a blowing and filling nozzle assembly to be moved downwardly into the opening in the parison for molding and then filling the molded container in a sterile fashion. Following the molding, filling and sealing of the container, it is sterilized at high temperature in a manner well understood by those skilled in the art. Unlike chemical or gamma ray sterilization, this temperature sterilization step has no adverse effect on the medicament contained within the container reservoir.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Containers for use in dispensing beneficial agents in specific dosages such as the unidose reservoir assembly of the present invention, present unique requirements. More particularly, it is important that as much of the beneficial agents contained within the reservoir assembly be dispensed from a container to avoid improper dosage, waste and undue expense. Accordingly the previously identified ullage segment functions to fill the interior space of the collapsible container when it is collapsed in the manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> of the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">In a manner presently to be described, fluid medicament reservoir <b>74</b> of the fluid reservoir assembly <b>52</b> is accessible via a penetrating member <b>58</b> which forms the inlet to the fluid delivery and control assembly <b>54</b>.

As previously described, the reservoir defining assembly <b>56</b> is formed using the earlier described aseptic blow fill technique and the reservoir portion of the container is sealed by the thin closure wall <b>72</b>. Prior to heat sterilization of the container, the piercable membrane <b>78</b> is positioned over the closure wall and the closure cap <b>80</b> is positioned over the piercable membrane and is secured to the neck portion <b>70</b> by any suitable means such as adhesive bonding, sonic welding or heat welding.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">Considering now the second assembly <b>54</b> of the fluid dispensing apparatus, which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> and <b>8</b>, this assembly comprises a generally cylindrically shaped housing <b>80</b> having a forward portion <b>80</b><i>a </i>and a rearward portion <b>80</b><i>b</i>. Rearward portion <b>80</b><i>b </i>which is covered by a cover, here shown as a second sterile barrier <b>82</b> having a pull tab <b>83</b>, includes an internally threaded cavity <b>84</b>.

<p id="p-0171" num="0170">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> of the drawings, housing <b>80</b> includes a longitudinally extending bore <b>86</b> that rotatably receives the rate control housing <b>88</b> of the second assembly <b>54</b>. Rate control housing <b>88</b>, which forms a part of the flow control means of the invention, includes an elongated body portion <b>88</b><i>a </i>and a forwardly extending finger engaging portion <b>88</b><i>b</i>. A plurality of longitudinally spaced apart O-rings <b>89</b>, which circumscribe body portion <b>88</b><i>a</i>, function to prevent fluid leakage between housing <b>80</b> and the body portion <b>88</b><i>a </i>of the rate control housing. Elongated body portion <b>88</b><i>a </i>is also provided with a longitudinally extending bore <b>90</b> that slidably receives a disabling shaft <b>92</b>, the construction and operation of which will presently be described.</p>

For a purpose presently to be described, body portion <b>88</b><i>a </i>is also provided with a pair of longitudinally spaced fluid flow passageways <b>98</b> and <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Fluid flow passageway <b>98</b> comprises an inlet passageway that communicates with a rate control assembly <b>102</b> that is mounted within a cavity <b>104</b> provided in a housing <b>80</b>.

As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> of the drawings, rate control cover <b>106</b> is disposed within a cavity <b>108</b> formed in housing <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">As previously mentioned, since assembly <b>54</b> comprises a stand alone, unitary assembly containing no medicinal fluids, it can be sterilized in the preferred manner by irradiating it with gamma-rays.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 through 22</figref>, rate control assembly <b>102</b> comprises a rate control plate <b>110</b>, which as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is provided with a serpentine micro-channel <b>112</b> having an inlet <b>112</b>A and an outlet <b>112</b><i>b </i>which communicates with passageway <b>100</b> that comprises an outlet passageway. The length, width and depth of the micro-channel determine the rate at which the fluid will flow toward outlet <b>112</b><i>b</i>. A thin cover <b>114</b> covers the channel in the manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. When assemblies <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> are interconnected in the manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, inlet <b>112</b>A is in communication with penetrating member <b>58</b> via an outlet tube <b>115</b> that is received within and positioned by an upstanding collar <b>116</b> provided on rate control plate <b>110</b>, via passageway <b>98</b>, via passageway <b>94</b> and via passageway <b>96</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). Because the second assembly has been sterilized in the manner previously described, these passageways are completely sterile at the time assembly <b>54</b> is connected to assembly <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">In using the apparatus of the invention, the first step is to remove the sterile covers <b>64</b><i>a </i>and <b>82</b> from assemblies <b>52</b> and <b>54</b>. This done, the assemblies can be irreversibly interconnected in the manner illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> by inserting the externally threaded neck <b>64</b> of assembly <b>52</b> into internally threaded cavity <b>84</b> of assembly <b>54</b> and rotating assembly <b>52</b> relative to assembly <b>54</b>. As the assemblies mate, penetrating member <b>58</b> will penetrate elastomeric member <b>78</b> and closure wall <b>72</b> of the container.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">With communication between the fluid reservoir <b>74</b> and the internal fluid passageway <b>58</b><i>a </i>of the penetrating member <b>58</b> having thusly been established, the fluid contained within the fluid reservoir can be expelled from the reservoir <b>74</b> by rotating the carriage release member <b>120</b> which comprises a part of the previously identified carriage locking means. This is accomplished by grasping the finger engaging arm <b>120</b>A of the release member (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) and rotating the member in the manner indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> until the threaded shank <b>120</b><i>b </i>of the knob threadably disengages from the locking member receiving protuberance <b>60</b><i>c</i>. Release member <b>120</b> is held in position within housing base <b>62</b><i>a </i>by means of circumferentially spaced locking tabs <b>121</b> provided on shank <b>120</b><i>b</i>. Once the carriage release member is free from the locking member receiving protuberance, the stored energy means, here shown as a coil spring <b>126</b> that is movable from the first compressed position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> to a second extended position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, will urge the carriage forwardly in the manner illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> of the drawings. As the carriage moves forwardly, the circumferentially spaced guide tabs <b>60</b><i>e </i>formed on the carriage (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) will slide within and be guided by guide channel <b>62</b><i>g </i>formed in housing <b>62</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). As the accordion side walls collapse, the fluid will be forced outwardly of the reservoir into internal passageway <b>58</b><i>a </i>of the penetrating member. In the manner previously described, the fluid will then flow toward the fluid flow control means of the invention, which functions to control the flow of fluid from the fluid reservoir of the fluid delivery portion of the device toward the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">To enable the fluid to flow from the reservoir <b>74</b> to the patient via the administration set <b>130</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>), the fluid control locking means must be operated in the manner presently to be described.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> of the drawings, the administration set <b>130</b> is sealably interconnected with an outlet port <b>132</b> formed in housing <b>80</b>. More particularly, the administration set <b>130</b> is connected to housing <b>80</b> by means of a connector <b>134</b> so that the proximal end <b>136</b><i>a </i>of the administration line <b>136</b> is in communication with an outlet fluid passageway <b>138</b> formed in housing <b>80</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). Disposed between the proximal end <b>136</b><i>a </i>and the distal end <b>136</b><i>b </i>of the administration line are a conventional clamp <b>140</b>, a conventional gas vent and filter <b>142</b>, and a generally Y-shaped injector site, generally designated by the numeral <b>144</b>. A luer connector <b>146</b> of conventional construction is provided at the distal end <b>136</b><i>b </i>of the administration line.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">To permit fluid flow from the outlet <b>112</b><i>b </i>of the rate control micro-channel <b>112</b> toward passageway <b>138</b>, the rate control housing <b>88</b> must be rotated to a position wherein flow passageway <b>100</b> aligns with a flow passageway <b>150</b> formed in housing <b>80</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) and also with outlet passageway <b>138</b>. Since passageway <b>150</b> is in communication with outlet <b>112</b><i>b </i>of the rate control channel, fluid can flow through the micro-channel at a controlled, fixed rate depending upon the configuration of the channel, into passageway <b>150</b>, then into passageway <b>100</b>, then through the rate control housing and finally into passageway <b>138</b>. From passageway <b>138</b> the fluid will flow into the inlet of the administration set for delivery to the patient at a predetermined fixed rate. During the fluid delivery step any gases contained within the device reservoir and the various fluid passageways are vented to atmosphere via vent port <b>153</b> and passageway <b>153</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">As previously mentioned, rotation of the rate control housing <b>88</b> cannot be accomplished until the rate control locking means is operated by the caregiver. In the present form of the invention this rate control locking means comprises a plunger <b>154</b> that includes a locking finger <b>154</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>) that prevents rotation of the rate control housing, unless and until the plunger is moved inwardly of the housing against the urging of a biasing means shown here as coil spring <b>156</b> that is housed within a chamber <b>158</b> formed in housing <b>80</b>. Once the plunger is appropriately urged inwardly, rate control housing <b>88</b> can be rotated into the correct fluid flow position by grasping rotation fingers <b>88</b><i>b </i>and imparting a rotational force to the rotating fingers (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24</figref>, <b>25</b> and <b>26</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, it is to be noted that a reservoir viewing window <b>160</b> is provided in housing <b>62</b> so that the remaining amount of fluid contained within reservoir <b>74</b> can be viewed. Additionally, fluid level indicating indicia <b>162</b> are provided on housing <b>62</b>, proximate window <b>160</b> so that the fluid remaining within the reservoir can be accurately monitored by the caregiver.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">Fluid flow from the reservoir <b>74</b> toward the rate control assembly via passageway <b>98</b> can be prevented through operation of the disabling means of the invention. This important disabling means, which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 27</figref> through <b>29</b>, comprises the previously identified disabling shaft <b>92</b>. As indicated in the drawings, when the disabling shaft <b>92</b> is pushed inwardly from the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> into an inward position, wherein it resides within a cavity <b>157</b> provided in housing <b>88</b>, the forward portion <b>92</b><i>a </i>of the disabling shaft will move into a cavity <b>165</b> formed in rate control housing <b>88</b>, thereby blocking fluid flow from the internal passageway <b>58</b><i>a </i>of the penetrating member into passageway <b>98</b>. By stopping fluid flow in this manner, the apparatus is substantially safely disabled until the disabling shaft <b>92</b> is once again returned to the starting position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> of the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30</figref>, <b>31</b> and <b>32</b>, an alternate form of the two part fluid dispensing apparatus of the present invention for dispensing medicaments is there shown.

Once the carriage release member is free from the locking member receiving protuberance, the stored energy means, here shown as a coil spring <b>126</b> that is movable from the first compressed position to the second extended position, will urge the carriage forwardly. As the carriage moves forwardly, the accordion side walls of the container collapse causing the fluid to be forced outwardly of the reservoir into internal passageway <b>178</b><i>a </i>of the penetrating member. The fluid will then flow toward passageway <b>230</b> of the rate control plate <b>220</b> via the pressure regulator <b>231</b>.

When the locking finger is seated within a particular locking channel, one of the radially extending passageways formed in the rate control housing (here shown as passageway <b>194</b>) will be locked in communication with one of the outlets of one of the plurality of micro channels formed in the rate control plate in the fluid will flow through the selected micro channel toward the patient at a selected fixed-rate. When it is desired to once again create a fluid flow toward the patient, the plunger <b>248</b> must once again be depressed and the rate control housing rotated into another position.</p>

Rate control assembly <b>208</b>, which also forms a part of the flow control means of this latest form of the invention, is substantially identical in construction and operation to the previously described rate control assembly <b>208</b> and is maintained within cavity <b>346</b> by a rate control cover <b>348</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53A</figref> of the drawings, rate control cover <b>348</b> is disposed within a cavity <b>350</b> formed in housing <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">As previously discussed and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34 through 36</figref>, rate control assembly <b>208</b> comprises a rate control plate <b>220</b>, which is provided with a plurality of spaced apart, serpentine micro-channels <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> and <b>228</b>.

A thin cover <b>235</b> covers the channels in the manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">When assemblies <b>62</b> and <b>304</b> are interconnected in the manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</figref>, elongated passageway <b>324</b> is in communication with penetrating member <b>305</b> via a connector collar <b>236</b> provided on rate control plate <b>220</b>, via passageways <b>352</b> and <b>354</b> formed in housing <b>308</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53A</figref>). The previously identified additive means of this latest form of the invention is in communication with the administration set of the invention via passageway <b>357</b> formed in housing <b>308</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 53 and 60</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">The novel additive means, or medicament vial assembly, of this latest form of the invention comprises an additive housing <b>360</b> that is integrally formed with housing <b>308</b> in the manner depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 49</figref>, <b>49</b>A and <b>53</b>. Housing <b>360</b> is provided with a chamber <b>362</b> for telescopically receiving a medicament containing fill-vial <b>364</b> containing the second medicament.

<p id="p-0227" num="0226">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>, needle holding component <b>366</b> carries a longitudinally extending, elongated hollow needle <b>368</b> having a flow passageway <b>368</b><i>a </i>that communicates with an elongate fluid passageway <b>370</b> that is provided within needle holding component <b>366</b>. Fill-vial <b>364</b>, needle holding component <b>366</b> and hollow needle <b>370</b> all form a part of the adding means of the apparatus of the present invention. The method of operation of this important adding means will presently be described.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">Referring particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>, the medicament containing fill-vial <b>364</b> can be seen to comprise a container that is sealed at one end by an end wall <b>364</b><i>a </i>and at the other end by slidable, elastomeric plunger <b>372</b> having a pierceable central wall <b>372</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">In operating the adding means of the invention, with the on-off selector <b>373</b> rotated to an &#x201c;on&#x201d; position such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 79A and 79B</figref>, a pressure exerted on container <b>364</b> urging the container into chamber <b>362</b> of additive housing <b>360</b> will cause the needle <b>368</b> to pierce central wall <b>372</b><i>a</i>. A continued inward pressure exerted on container <b>364</b> will cause the slidable elastomeric plunger <b>372</b> to be moved inwardly of the fluid reservoir <b>364</b><i>b </i>by the needle holding component <b>366</b>. The inward movement of plunger <b>372</b> will, in turn, cause the fluid &#x201c;F&#x201d; contained within the reservoir <b>364</b><i>b </i>of the container to flow into flow passageway <b>368</b><i>a </i>of needle <b>368</b>, then into fluid passageway <b>370</b> and finally into the administration set via fluid passageway <b>357</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>, fluid passageway <b>357</b> also communicates with a fluid passageway <b>378</b> that is in communication with a conventional gas vent <b>380</b> that is mounted in additive housing <b>360</b>. Gas vent <b>380</b> functions in a conventional manner to vent to atmosphere any gases trapped within the fluid passages of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">Medicament containing fill vial <b>364</b> can be of various volumes and can contain various second beneficial agents. Similarly, fluid medicament reservoir <b>74</b> of the fluid reservoir assembly <b>62</b> can be of various volumes and can contain various first beneficial agents.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">In using the apparatus of this latest form of the invention to deliver a first medicament from collapsible fluid container <b>56</b>, the first step is to rotate the on-off selector <b>373</b> to an &#x201c;off&#x201d; position, wherein the reduced diameter portion <b>375</b><i>a </i>of the closure member <b>375</b> of the selector <b>373</b> is moved into a chamber <b>377</b> formed in housing <b>360</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 51 and 60</figref>). With portion <b>375</b><i>a </i>of the closure member <b>375</b> moved into a chamber <b>377</b>, fluid flow from passageway <b>370</b> into passageways <b>357</b> is blocked. The next step is to remove the sterile covers <b>64</b><i>a </i>and <b>310</b><i>a </i>from assemblies <b>62</b> and <b>304</b>. This done, the assemblies can be interconnected by inserting the externally threaded neck <b>64</b> of assembly <b>62</b> into internally threaded cavity <b>383</b> of assembly <b>304</b> and rotating assembly <b>62</b> relative to assembly <b>304</b>. As the assemblies are mated, penetrating member <b>305</b> will penetrate elastomeric member <b>78</b> and closure wall <b>72</b> of the collapsible container <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">With communication between the fluid reservoir <b>74</b> and the internal passageway <b>305</b><i>a </i>of the penetrating member <b>305</b> having thusly been established, the fluid contained within the fluid reservoir <b>74</b> can be expelled from the reservoir by rotating the carriage release member <b>120</b> in the manner previously described. Once the carriage release member is free from the locking member receiving protuberance, the stored energy means, here shown as a coil spring <b>126</b> that is movable from the first compressed position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref> to the second extended position shown in FIG. <b>65</b>A, will urge the carriage forwardly. As the carriage moves forwardly, the accordion side walls of the container collapse, causing the fluid to be forced outwardly of the reservoir <b>74</b> into internal passageway <b>305</b><i>a </i>of the penetrating member. The fluid will then flow toward passageway <b>230</b> of the rate control plate <b>220</b> via passageways <b>352</b> and <b>354</b> formed in housing <b>308</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53A</figref>). From passageway <b>230</b> the fluid will flow into and fill each of the micro-channels to <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> and <b>228</b> that are interconnected with passageway <b>230</b> in the manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">To enable the fluid to flow from the reservoir <b>74</b> to the patient via the administration set <b>130</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>) that can be connected to the outlet port <b>233</b> of housing <b>180</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>), the fluid control locking means of this latest form of the invention must be operated. More particularly, to permit fluid flow selectively from the outlets <b>222</b><i>a</i>, <b>224</b><i>a</i>, <b>226</b><i>a</i>, and <b>228</b><i>a</i>, respectively, of the differently configured micro-channels (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>), the rate control shaft <b>312</b> must be controllably rotated in a manner to selectively align the radially extending passageways <b>328</b>, <b>330</b>, <b>332</b> and <b>334</b> with the longitudinally spaced apart flow passageways <b>384</b>, <b>386</b>, <b>388</b> and <b>390</b> formed in housing <b>308</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 53 through 59</figref>). Since passageways <b>328</b>, <b>330</b>, <b>332</b> and <b>334</b> are in communication with micro-channel outlets <b>222</b><i>a</i>, <b>224</b><i>a</i>, <b>226</b><i>a</i>, and <b>228</b><i>a</i>, respectively, of the differently configured micro-channels, fluid can flow from the selected micro-channel toward the selected flow passageway <b>328</b>, <b>330</b>; <b>332</b> and <b>334</b> at a controlled rate that depends upon the configuration of the particular channel selected.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">From the selected radially extending passageways <b>328</b>, <b>330</b>, <b>332</b> and <b>334</b>, fluid will flow into passageway <b>324</b> formed in shaft <b>312</b>, toward the inlet of the administration set. Any gases trapped in the device reservoir and in the various fluid passageways will be vented to atmosphere via a vent port <b>394</b> mounted in control housing <b>308</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">As in the earlier described embodiment of the invention, rotation of the rate control shaft <b>312</b> cannot be accomplished until the rate control locking means is operated by the caregiver. In this latest form of the invention, the rate control locking means comprises a plunger <b>396</b> that includes a locking finger <b>396</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53A</figref>) that prevents rotation of the rate control housing, unless and until the plunger is moved inwardly of the housing against the urging of a biasing means shown here as coil spring <b>397</b> that is housed within a chamber <b>400</b> formed in housing <b>308</b>. Once the plunger is appropriately urged inwardly and the locking finger <b>396</b><i>a </i>is removed from the channels, or cavities, that are formed on the rear face of flange <b>312</b><i>b</i>, the rate control shaft <b>312</b> can be rotated into the desired fluid flow position by grasping rotation fingers <b>312</b><i>c </i>and imparting a rotational force thereto. As the rate control housing is rotated, spring <b>397</b> continuously urges locking finger <b>396</b><i>a </i>into a selected locking channel <b>312</b><i>d </i>formed in flange <b>312</b><i>b</i>. As before, when the locking finger is seated within a particular locking channel, one of the radially extending passageways formed in the rate control shaft will be locked in communication with one of the outlets of one of the plurality of micro channels formed in the rate control plate and the fluid will flow through the selected micro channel toward the patient at a selected fixed-rate.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">When it is desired to dispense the second medicinal fluid to the patient from the adding means of the invention, the sealable barrier <b>403</b> is removed from the additive housing <b>364</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>). This done, the on-off selector <b>373</b> is rotated to an &#x201c;on&#x201d; position, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>. With the on-off selector <b>373</b> in the &#x201c;on&#x201d; position, a pressure exerted on container <b>364</b> urging the container into chamber <b>362</b> of additive housing <b>360</b> will cause the needle <b>368</b> to pierce central wall <b>372</b><i>a</i>. A continued inward pressure exerted on container <b>364</b> will cause the slidable elastomeric plunger <b>372</b> to be moved inwardly of the fluid reservoir <b>364</b><i>b </i>by the needle holding component <b>366</b>. The inward movement of plunger <b>372</b> will, in turn, cause the fluid &#x201c;F&#x201d; contained within the reservoir <b>364</b><i>b </i>of the container to flow into flow passageway <b>368</b><i>a </i>of needle <b>368</b>, then into fluid passageway <b>370</b>, and finally into the administration set via fluid passageway <b>376</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 66 through 81</figref>, still another form of fluid dispensing apparatus of the present invention for dispensing medicaments is there shown. This fourth, alternate, form of dispensing apparatus is similar in many respects to the earlier described embodiments of the invention and like numerals are used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 66 through 81</figref> to identify like components. As before, dispensing apparatus comprises two stand-alone, inter-connectable assemblies, the first of which is substantially identical in construction and operation to the previously described first assembly <b>62</b>. However, second assembly <b>404</b> is of a somewhat different construction.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">The primary difference between second assembly <b>404</b> and the previously described second assembly <b>304</b> resides in the provision of a fixed rather than a variable fluid flow rate. The adding means, including the medicament containing vial assembly, is substantially identical in construction and operation to that previously described. Additionally, the collapsible fluid container <b>56</b> of this latest form of the invention is also substantially identical in construction and operation to that previously discussed. Further, fluid medicament reservoir <b>74</b> of the fluid reservoir assembly <b>62</b> is accessible in the manner previously described via the penetrating member <b>405</b> of the fluid delivery and control assembly <b>404</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</figref>). More particularly, penetrating member <b>405</b> is adapted to pierce closure wall <b>72</b> as well as a pierceable membrane <b>78</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>) which is positioned over closure wall <b>72</b> by means of a closure cap <b>80</b> which is affixed to the neck portion <b>70</b> of reservoir defining assembly <b>56</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">Considering now in greater detail the second assembly <b>404</b> of this latest form of the fluid dispensing apparatus the construction which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 67 and 68</figref>. This assembly comprises a control housing <b>408</b> having a forward portion <b>408</b><i>a </i>and a rearward portion <b>408</b><i>b</i>. Rearward portion <b>408</b><i>b</i>, which is sealed by a hermetically affixed sterile barrier having a pull tab, includes an internally threaded cavity <b>413</b>. This second sterile barrier, which is removably connected to rearward portion <b>408</b><i>b</i>, here comprises a thin membrane constructed from any suitable polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 67 and 68</figref> of the drawings, housing <b>408</b> includes a longitudinally extending bore <b>411</b> that rotatably receives the rate control shaft <b>412</b> of the second assembly <b>404</b>. Rate control shaft <b>412</b> which forms a part of the flow control means of this latest embodiment of the invention includes an elongated body portion <b>412</b><i>a </i>and a forward flange <b>412</b><i>b</i>. Additionally, a plurality of longitudinally spaced apart O-rings <b>414</b>, which circumscribe body portion <b>412</b><i>a</i>, function to prevent fluid leakage between housing <b>408</b> and the body portion <b>412</b><i>a </i>of the rate control shaft as the shaft is rotated. Elongated body portion <b>412</b><i>a </i>is also provided with a longitudinally extending bore <b>418</b> that slidably receives the rearward portion of a disabling shaft <b>420</b>, the construction and operation of which will presently be described.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 67 through 79</figref>, body portion <b>412</b><i>a </i>is also provided with a longitudinally extending fluid passageway <b>424</b> that communicates with the flow passageway <b>405</b><i>a </i>of the previously identified piercing member <b>405</b> via a passageway <b>426</b> provided in control housing <b>408</b>. For a purpose presently to be described, control housing <b>408</b> is also provided with a pair of longitudinally spaced fluid flow passageways <b>428</b> and <b>430</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">Fluid flow passageway <b>428</b> comprises an inlet passageway that communicates with a rate control assembly <b>102</b> that is mounted within a cavity <b>434</b> provided in a housing <b>408</b>.

As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</figref> of the drawings, rate control cover <b>436</b> is disposed within a cavity <b>438</b> formed in housing <b>408</b>. Rate control assembly <b>102</b> is substantially identical in construction and operation to that described in connection with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 29</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 through 22</figref>, rate control assembly <b>102</b> comprises a rate control plate <b>10</b>, which as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is provided with a serpentine micro-channel <b>112</b> having an inlet <b>112</b>A and an outlet <b>112</b><i>b </i>which communicates with passageway <b>100</b> that comprises an outlet passageway. The length, width and depth of the micro-channel determine the rate at which the fluid will flow toward outlet <b>112</b><i>b</i>. A thin cover <b>114</b> covers the channel in the manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. When assemblies <b>52</b> and <b>404</b> are interconnected, inlet <b>112</b>A is in communication with penetrating member <b>405</b> via passageway <b>428</b>, via passageway <b>432</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76</figref>), and via passageway <b>426</b>.

<p id="p-0244" num="0243">In using the apparatus of the invention, the first step is to remove the sterile covers from assemblies <b>52</b> and <b>404</b>.

<p id="p-0245" num="0244">With communication between the fluid reservoir <b>74</b> and the internal fluid passageway <b>405</b><i>a </i>of the penetrating member <b>405</b> having thusly been established, the fluid contained within the fluid reservoir can be expelled from the reservoir <b>74</b> by rotating the carriage release member <b>120</b> which comprises a part of the previously identified carriage locking means. This is accomplished by grasping the finger engaging arm <b>120</b>A of the release member (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) and rotating the member in the manner indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> until the threaded shank <b>120</b><i>b </i>of the knob threadably disengages from the locking member receiving protuberance <b>60</b><i>c</i>. Release member <b>120</b> is held in position within housing base <b>62</b><i>a </i>by means of circumferentially spaced locking tabs <b>121</b> provided on shank <b>120</b><i>b</i>. Once the carriage release member is free from the locking member receiving protuberance, the stored energy means, here shown as a coil spring <b>126</b> that is movable from the first compressed position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> to a second extended position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, will urge the carriage forwardly in the manner illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> of the drawings. As the carriage moves forwardly, the circumferentially spaced guide tabs <b>60</b><i>e </i>formed on the carriage (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) will slide within and be guided by guide channel <b>62</b><i>g </i>formed in housing <b>62</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). As the accordion side walls collapse, the fluid will be forced outwardly of the reservoir into internal passageway <b>405</b><i>a </i>of the penetrating member. In the manner previously described, the fluid will then flow toward the fluid flow control means of the invention which functions to control the flow of fluid from the fluid reservoir of the fluid delivery portion of the device toward the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">To enable the fluid to flow from the reservoir <b>74</b> to the patient via the administration set <b>130</b> which is substantially identical in construction and operation to that previously described (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>), the fluid control locking means must be operated in the manner presently to be described.

<p id="p-0247" num="0246">To permit fluid flow toward the rate control micro-channel <b>112</b>, the rate control shaft, or housing <b>412</b>, must be rotated to a position wherein flow passageway <b>432</b> aligns with a flow passageway <b>428</b> formed in housing <b>412</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 73 and 76</figref>). Since passageway <b>428</b> is in communication with the rate control channel, fluid can flow through the micro-channel at a controlled fixed rate, depending upon the configuration of the channel, into passageway <b>438</b>, into passageway <b>440</b> and finally into passageway <b>442</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 72 and 77</figref>). From passageway <b>442</b>, the fluid will flow into the inlet of the administration set for delivery to the patient at a predetermined fixed rate. During the fluid delivery step any gases contained within the device reservoir and the various fluid passageways are vented to atmosphere via vent port <b>444</b> and passageway <b>444</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">As previously mentioned, rotation of the rate control housing <b>412</b> cannot be accomplished until the rate control locking means is operated by the caregiver.

Once the plunger is appropriately urged inwardly, rate control housing can be rotated from the &#x201c;off&#x201d; position into the fluid flow, or &#x201c;on&#x201d; position, by grasping rotation fingers <b>454</b> and imparting a rotational force to the rotating fingers (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 70 through 78</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">Fluid flow from the reservoir <b>74</b> toward the patient can be prevented through operation of the disabling means of the invention. This important disabling means, which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 67 and 70</figref>, comprises the previously identified disabling shaft <b>420</b>. As indicated in the drawings, when the disabling shaft <b>420</b> is pushed inwardly from the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</figref> into an inward position, the forward portion <b>420</b><i>a </i>of the disabling shaft will move into a cavity <b>455</b> formed in rate control housing <b>408</b>, thereby blocking fluid toward the internal passageway <b>442</b>. By stopping fluid flow in this manner, the apparatus is substantially safely disabled until the disabling shaft <b>420</b> is once again returned to the starting position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</figref> of the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">In operating the adding means of this latest form of the invention, which as previously mentioned is substantially identical in construction and operation to that previously described, with the on-off selector <b>373</b> rotated to an &#x201c;on&#x201d; position such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65A</figref>, the container <b>364</b> is mated with the additive housing in the manner previously described. As before, the inward movement of plunger <b>372</b> will cause the fluid &#x201c;F&#x201d; contained within the reservoir <b>364</b><i>b </i>of the container to flow into flow passageway <b>368</b><i>a </i>of needle <b>368</b>, then into fluid passageway <b>370</b>, and finally into the administration set via fluid passageway <b>457</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</figref>). As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</figref>, fluid passageway <b>457</b> also communicates with a fluid passageway <b>459</b> that is in communication with a conventional gas vent <b>462</b> that is mounted in the additive housing. Gas vent <b>462</b> functions in a conventional manner to vent to atmosphere any gases trapped within the fluid passages of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 80 through 98</figref>, still another form of fluid dispensing apparatus of the present invention for dispensing medicaments is there shown and generally identified by the numeral <b>464</b>. This fifth, alternate, form of dispensing apparatus is also similar in many respects to the earlier described embodiments of the invention and like numerals are used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 80 through 98</figref> to identify like components. As before, dispensing apparatus comprises two stand-alone, inter-connectable assemblies, the first of which is substantially identical in construction and operation to the previously described first assembly <b>62</b>. However, second assembly <b>464</b> is of a somewhat different construction (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 81</figref>, <b>82</b> and <b>82</b>A).</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">The primary difference between second assembly <b>464</b> and the previously described second assembly <b>404</b> resides in the provision of a novel adding means that is removably connected to the control housing <b>468</b> of second assembly <b>464</b>. As will be discussed in greater detail hereinafter, control housing <b>468</b> is generally similar in construction and operation to the previously described control housing <b>408</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">In this latest form of the invention, the fluid medicament reservoir <b>74</b> of the fluid reservoir assembly <b>62</b> is accessible in the manner previously described via the penetrating member <b>469</b> of the fluid delivery and control assembly <b>464</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82</figref>). More particularly, penetrating member <b>469</b> is adapted to pierce closure wall <b>72</b> as well as a pierceable membrane <b>78</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 81</figref>) which is positioned over closure wall <b>72</b> by means of a closure cap <b>80</b> which is affixed to the neck portion <b>70</b> of reservoir defining assembly <b>56</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">Considering now in greater detail the second assembly <b>464</b> of this latest form of the fluid dispensing apparatus the construction of which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82</figref>. This assembly comprises a control housing <b>468</b> having a forward portion <b>468</b><i>a </i>and a rearward portion <b>468</b><i>b</i>. Rearward portion <b>468</b><i>b</i>, which is sealed by a hermetically affixed sterile barrier having a pull tab, includes an internally threaded cavity <b>473</b>. This second sterile barrier which is removably connected to rearward portion <b>468</b><i>b</i>, here comprises a thin membrane constructed from any suitable polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82</figref> of the drawings, housing <b>468</b> includes a longitudinally extending bore <b>471</b> that rotatably receives the rate control shaft <b>472</b> of the second assembly <b>464</b>. Rate control shaft <b>472</b> which forms a part of the flow control means of this latest embodiment of the invention, includes an elongated body portion <b>472</b><i>a </i>and a forward flange <b>472</b><i>b</i>. Additionally, a plurality of longitudinally spaced apart O-rings <b>474</b>, which circumscribe body portion <b>472</b><i>a</i>, function to prevent fluid leakage between housing <b>468</b> and the body portion <b>472</b><i>a </i>of the rate control shaft as the shaft is rotated. Elongated body portion <b>472</b><i>a </i>is also provided with a longitudinally extending bore <b>478</b> that slidably receives the rearward portion of a disabling shaft <b>480</b>, the construction and operation of which will presently be described.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 82 and 84</figref>, body portion <b>472</b><i>a </i>is also provided with a longitudinally extending fluid passageway <b>484</b> that communicates with the flow passageway <b>469</b><i>a </i>of the previously identified piercing member <b>469</b> via a passageway <b>486</b> provided in control housing <b>464</b>. For a purpose presently to be described, body portion <b>468</b> is provided with a pair of longitudinally spaced fluid flow passageways <b>488</b> and <b>490</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">Fluid flow passageway <b>488</b> comprises an inlet passageway that communicates with a rate control assembly <b>102</b> that is mounted within a cavity <b>494</b> provided in a housing <b>464</b>. Rate control assembly <b>102</b> which also forms a part of the flow control means of this latest form of the invention is maintained within cavity <b>494</b> by a rate control cover <b>496</b>, which also forms a part of the flow control means of the invention. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82A</figref> of the drawings, rate control cover <b>496</b> is disposed within a cavity <b>498</b> formed in housing <b>464</b>. Rate control assembly <b>102</b> is substantially identical in construction and operation to that described in connection with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 29</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 through 22</figref>, rate control assembly <b>102</b> comprises a rate control plate <b>10</b>, which as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is provided with a serpentine micro-channel <b>112</b> having an inlet <b>112</b>A and an outlet <b>112</b><i>b </i>which communicates with passageway <b>100</b> that comprises an outlet passageway. The length, width and depth of the micro-channel determine the rate at which the fluid will flow toward outlet <b>112</b><i>b</i>. A thin cover <b>114</b> covers the channel in the manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. When assemblies <b>52</b> and <b>464</b> are interconnected, inlet <b>112</b>A is in communication with penetrating member <b>469</b> via passageway <b>486</b>, via passageway <b>488</b> and via passageway <b>492</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82D</figref>). Because the second assembly has been sterilized in the manner previously described, these passageways are completely sterile at the time assembly <b>464</b> is connected to assembly <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">In using the apparatus of the invention, the first step is to remove the sterile covers from assemblies <b>52</b> and <b>464</b>. This done, the assemblies can be irreversibly interconnected in the manner previously described by inserting the externally threaded neck <b>64</b> of assembly <b>52</b> into internally threaded cavity <b>473</b> of assembly <b>464</b> and rotating assembly <b>52</b> relative to assembly <b>464</b>. As the assemblies mate, penetrating member <b>469</b> will penetrate elastomeric member <b>78</b> and closure wall <b>72</b> of the container.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">With communication between the fluid reservoir <b>74</b> and the internal fluid passageway <b>469</b><i>a </i>of the penetrating member <b>469</b> having thusly been established, the fluid contained within the fluid reservoir can be expelled from the reservoir <b>74</b> by rotating the carriage release member <b>120</b> which comprises a part of the previously identified carriage locking means. This is accomplished by grasping the finger engaging arm <b>120</b>A of the release member (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) and rotating the member in the manner indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> until the threaded shank <b>120</b><i>b </i>of the knob threadably disengages from the locking member receiving protuberance <b>60</b><i>c</i>. Release member <b>120</b> is held in position within housing base <b>62</b><i>a </i>by means of circumferentially spaced locking tabs <b>121</b> provided on shank <b>120</b><i>b</i>. Once the carriage release member is free from the locking member receiving protuberance, the stored energy means, here shown as a coil spring <b>126</b> that is movable from the first compressed position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> to a second extended position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, will urge the carriage forwardly in the manner illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> of the drawings. As the carriage moves forwardly, the circumferentially spaced guide tabs <b>60</b><i>e </i>formed on the carriage (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) will slide within and be guided by guide channel <b>62</b><i>g </i>formed in housing <b>62</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). As the accordion side walls collapse, the fluid will be forced outwardly of the reservoir into internal passageway <b>469</b><i>a </i>of the penetrating member. In the manner previously described, the fluid will then flow toward the fluid flow control means of the invention which functions to control the flow of fluid from the fluid reservoir of the fluid delivery portion of the device toward the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">To enable the fluid to flow from the reservoir <b>74</b> to the patient via the administration set <b>495</b> which is somewhat similar in construction and operation to the previously described administration set <b>130</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the fluid control locking means must be operated in the manner presently to be described. The administration set <b>495</b> here comprises a first leg <b>495</b><i>a </i>that is sealably interconnected with an outlet port formed in the on-off selector of the vial control assembly, the character of which will presently be described (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82</figref>), and a second leg <b>495</b><i>b </i>that is interconnected with outlet <b>497</b> of housing <b>468</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 80</figref>, interconnected within the second leg <b>495</b><i>b </i>is a conventional clamp <b>140</b>, a conventional gas vent and filter <b>142</b>, a generally Y-shaped injector site generally designated by the numeral <b>144</b>, and a &#x201c;Y&#x201d; connector <b>145</b>. A luer connector <b>146</b> of conventional construction is provided at the distal end <b>136</b><i>b </i>of the administration line.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">To permit fluid flow toward the rate control micro-channel <b>112</b>, the rate control shaft, or housing <b>472</b>, must be rotated to a position wherein a radially extending flow passageway <b>492</b> aligns with a flow passageway <b>488</b> formed in housing <b>468</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 82B and 82D</figref>). Since passageway <b>488</b> is in communication with the rate control channel, fluid can flow through the micro-channel at a controlled, fixed rate depending upon the configuration of the channel into passageway <b>490</b>, into passageway <b>494</b> and finally into passageway <b>496</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82C</figref>). From passageway <b>442</b> the fluid will flow into the inlet <b>442</b><i>a </i>of the administration set for delivery to the patient at a predetermined fixed rate. During the fluid delivery step, any gases contained within the device reservoir and the various fluid passageways are vented to atmosphere via vent port <b>497</b> and passageway <b>497</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262">As previously mentioned, rotation of the rate control housing <b>472</b> cannot be accomplished until the rate control locking means is operated by the caregiver. In the present form of the invention, this rate control locking means comprises a plunger <b>502</b> that includes a locking finger <b>502</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82</figref>) that prevents rotation of the rate control housing, unless and until the plunger is moved inwardly of the housing against the urging of a biasing means shown here as coil spring <b>505</b> that is housed within a chamber <b>508</b> formed in housing <b>468</b>. Once the plunger is appropriately urged inwardly, rate control housing can be rotated from the &#x201c;off&#x201d; position into the fluid flow, or &#x201c;on&#x201d; position by grasping rotation fingers <b>510</b> and imparting a rotational force to the rotating fingers.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">Fluid flow from the reservoir <b>74</b> toward the patient can be prevented through operation of the disabling means of the invention. This important disabling means, which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82</figref> and is similar in construction and operation to that previously described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 79</figref>, <b>80</b> and <b>81</b>, comprises the previously identified disabling shaft <b>480</b>. As indicated in the drawings, when the disabling shaft <b>480</b> is pushed inwardly the forward portion of the disabling shaft will move into cavity <b>455</b><i>a</i>, thereby blocking fluid toward the internal passageway <b>496</b>. By stopping fluid flow in this manner, the apparatus is substantially safely disabled until the disabling shaft is once again returned to the starting position.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0264">Additive sub-system <b>514</b>, the details of construction and operation of which will presently be described, is also operably interconnected with the control portion <b>464</b> in the manner best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>7</b>, reservoir housing <b>52</b> which can be constructed from metal, plastic or any suitable material, includes a generally cylindrically shaped wall portion <b>62</b> and a base portion <b>62</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">Considering now the details of the construction of the previously mentioned adding means of this latest form of the invention, this important means for controllably delivering a second medicament to the patient here comprises an additive sub-system <b>514</b> of the construction illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 86 through 93</figref> of the drawings. Additive sub-system <b>514</b>, which is operably interconnected with housing <b>464</b> of the control portion of this latest form of the invention, here comprises a generally tubular-shaped vial housing <b>516</b> having a chamber <b>516</b><i>a </i>for telescopically receiving a medicament-containing, fill vial assembly <b>364</b> of the character previously described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>. Housing <b>516</b> can be constructed from metal, plastic or any suitable material, and includes a generally cylindrically shaped wall portion <b>516</b><i>b </i>and a base portion <b>516</b><i>c</i>. Formed on base portion <b>516</b><i>c </i>is a dovetail receiving groove <b>519</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85</figref>), the purpose of which will presently be described.</p>

<p id="p-0268" num="0267">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 86</figref>, needle holding component <b>520</b> carries a longitudinally extending, elongated hollow needle <b>522</b> having a flow passageway <b>522</b><i>a </i>that communicates with an elongate fluid passageway <b>524</b> that is provided within needle holding component <b>520</b>. Fill-vial <b>364</b>, needle holding component <b>520</b>, and hollow needle <b>522</b> all form a part of the adding means of the apparatus of this latest form of the invention. The method of operation of this latest adding means will presently be described.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">As previously discussed and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>, the medicament containing fill-vial <b>364</b> comprises a container that is sealed at one end by an end wall <b>364</b><i>a </i>and at the other end by slidable, elastomeric plunger <b>372</b> having a pierceable, central wall <b>372</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 86 through 92</figref> of the drawings, this latest form of the apparatus of the invention includes a novel selector means that is of a somewhat different construction from that previously described selector means that included an on-off selector <b>523</b>. This novel selector means includes a vial plug <b>526</b> that is closely received within a cavity <b>527</b> formed in needle holding component <b>520</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 86 and 93</figref>). The vial plug <b>526</b> includes a pierceable membrane <b>526</b><i>a </i>that is pierceable by the piercing end <b>528</b><i>a </i>of an externally threaded piercing shaft <b>528</b> that is carried within a threaded bore <b>529</b> formed in the forward part of housing <b>516</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 93</figref>).

<p id="p-0272" num="0271">With the additive subsystem interconnected with the housing <b>464</b> of the control portion of the dispenser unit and with communication having been established between passageway <b>522</b><i>a </i>of needle <b>522</b> in the manner described in the preceding paragraphs, a pressure exerted on container <b>364</b> urging the container into chamber <b>516</b><i>a </i>of additive housing <b>516</b> will cause the needle end <b>522</b><i>a </i>to pierce wall <b>372</b><i>a </i>of plug <b>372</b>. A continued inward pressure exerted on container <b>364</b> will cause the slidable elastomeric plunger <b>372</b> to be moved inwardly of the fluid reservoir <b>364</b><i>b </i>by the needle holding component <b>520</b>.

For example, as will be discussed in greater detail in the paragraphs that follow, in this latest form of the invention the elongated band or strip portion <b>552</b><i>a </i>of the spring has been modified to exhibit a cross-sectional mass that varies along the length of the band.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0273">Referring particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 94 and 95</figref>, like the earlier described embodiments of the invention, this latest form of the dispensing apparatus comprises two stand-alone, interconnectable assemblies of the character shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 94 and 95</figref>.

Front portion <b>555</b><i>a</i>, rear portion <b>555</b><i>b </i>and side wall <b>555</b><i>c </i>cooperate to define the fluid reservoir <b>570</b> of the fluid reservoir assembly. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 96A</figref>, side wall <b>555</b><i>c </i>is a laminate construction comprising individual laminates L-1, L-2, L-3, L-4 and L-5. As previously mentioned, this novel laminate construction comprises a co-extrusion formed by a blow-fill-seal process.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">Co-extrusion in the blow-fill-seal process is typically used in the prior art to package liquids that are either oxygen or moisture sensitive. Further, oxygen sensitive products, as well as compounds that need a longer shelf life, are frequently packaged using co-extruded plastic. Blow-Fill-Seal is a preferred drug packaging modality because polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene are typically used. Compared to a traditional flexible solution bag made from PVC, a PP or PE, the blow-fill-seal container is much less permeable.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">With suitable resins, co-extruded plastic blow-fill-seal containers can readily be constructed to prevent water vapor loss out of container, and ingress of oxygen into the container contents. The typical co-extruded material is a five layer system that exhibits substantially the same thickness as a comparable container constructed from a single layer resin material. That is, each layer is &#x2155; of the equivalent container that is homogeneous (non-laminate). However, it should be recognized that, at a minimum a three layer system is required to suit the purposes of the present invention, while a system having up to about 10 layers would be feasible for certain applications.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">In a typical five layer co-extruded blow-fill-seal container, the laminate material may comprise an inert internal polyolefin, such as PP. The barrier material in the center of the five layer laminate may be selected to exhibit gas or water barrier properties, or both. The barrier material is affixed to the inert hydrophobic plastic layer (e.g. PP) via a binder layer.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">Although a variety of plastic resins may be used for the co-extrusion of blow-fill-seal containers, polyolefins (e.g. PP of LDPE) are desirable to be in contact with the parenteral solution, as this material is inert and hydrophobic.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">It is well know in the food packaging industry that Ethylene-Vinyl Alcohol Copolymer (EVOH) is an excellent gas barrier. Additionally, a variety of nylon based materials (also referred to as polyamides (PA)) can act as strong vapor barriers. Those skilled in the art will also recognize cyclic polyolefin copolymers (COP) for their effectives as water barriers, and therefore there use in co-extruded blow-fill-seal containers.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">Other suitable barrier materials may included, but are not limited to, polyvinyl chloride, oriented polyvinyl chloride (OPVC), biaxially oriented PET, silica-deposited resins, sequentially biaxially oriented polyvinyl alcohol, biaxially oriented polyester, vinylidene chloride (or copolymers of vinylidene chloride and methyl methacrylate), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), oriented polyethylene terephthalate (OPET), polystyrene (PS), ethylene methyl acrylate copolymer (EMA), and other polymer resins known to those skilled in the art which are generally termed &#x201c;high gas barrier polymers&#x201d; HBP. Additionally, those skilled in the art will recognize multi-lamellar barrier materials, such as those based on the blends of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and co-polyester (PETG) prepared via melt extrusion, and poly(ethylene-co-acrylic acid) (EAA) as a compatibilizer incorporated into the blends, as possible barrier materials as well.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285">A variety of binder materials may be used to &#x201c;tie&#x201d; the dissimilar polyolefin and the barrier materials together. These include, but are not limited to agents of the formula AMXP in which AM is a backbone copolymer prepared by copolymerizing propylene with &#x3b1;-olefins and where X is selected from among citraconic anhydride, fumaric acid, mesaconic acid, the anhydride of 3-allylsuccinic acid and maleic anhydride, and P is a polyamide oligomer prepared from caprolactam, 11-aminoundecanoic acid or dodecalactam; ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA); a coextrusion binder comprising a metallocene polyethylene (A1), a cografting monomer said cografting monomer being an unsaturated carboxylic acid grafting monomer or functional acid derivative thereof, and an ethylene homopolymer; an ethylene copolymer wherein the comonomer is (a) an alpha-olefin, (b) an ester of an unsaturated carboxylic acid or (c) a vinyl ester of a saturated carboxylic acid; and a hydrocarbon elastomeric copolymer; and Celanex (polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) copolymer binder).</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">Although the most common coextrusion systems seem to be a 5 layer laminate, a variety of different &#x201c;size&#x201d; laminate materials would be workable in BioQ dispensers and fit the spirit of the expanded invention. At a minimum, a three layer sandwich would be required (i.e. inert polyolefin, binder and barrier) would be required. At a maximum, many repeated layers that comprise both oxygen and moisture barriers would be feasible.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287">A more detailed consideration of the stored energy sources, or variable force springs of this latest form of the invention will now be undertaken. At the outset it is to be understood that the objective of many prior art fluid and drug delivery systems is to deliver fluid at a constant flow rate. One method for achieving a constant flow rate over time involves ensuring that the pressure driving the fluid through the device is constant, i.e., the pressure inside the fluid reservoir of the apparatus is constant. In this latest form of the invention, achieving constant pressure in the bellows-like fluid reservoir <b>94</b> of the device is accomplished in a unique manner by modifying a typical constant force spring, such as a Negator spring &#x201c;NS&#x201d; of the character shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 97</figref>. Negator springs are readily commercially available from a number of sources including Stock Drive Products/Sterling Instruments of New Hyde Park, N.Y.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">The prior art Negator extension spring comprises a pre-stressed flat strip &#x201c;FS&#x201d; of spring material that is formed into virtually constant radius coils around itself or on a drum &#x201c;Z&#x201d; having a radius R-<b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 93</figref>). The area identified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 93</figref> of the drawings as &#x201c;FGR&#x201d; designates the &#x201c;active region&#x201d; or &#x201c;the force generating region&#x201d; of the constant force spring. It should be understood that in this &#x201c;active region&#x201d; the radius of curvature of the spring changes and it is this change in radius of curvature of the spring that is responsible for the generation of the force. In fact, the radius of curvature changes from essentially infinity to a value equal to the radius R-<b>1</b> of the spool on which the spring is wound. As will be discussed in greater detail hereinafter, increasing the mass of material in this &#x201c;force generating region&#x201d; will increase the force provided by the spring. Conversely, decreasing the mass of material in the &#x201c;force generating region&#x201d; will result in a reduction of the force generated by the spring. The mass in the active region can be changed by changing the thickness of the spring, the width of the spring, the density of material of the spring, or any combination of these. It should be further noted that because the force generating region takes up some portion of the length of the spring it will tend to average any point-by-point changes in physical or structural properties of the spring. The variable L shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 93</figref> of the drawings is defined to be the distance from the force generating region to the end of the spring. When deflected, the spring material straightens as it leaves the drum (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 93</figref>). This straightened length of spring actually stores the spring's energy through its tendency to assume its natural radius.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">The force delivered by a typical prior art constant force spring, such as the Negator extension spring, depends on several structural and geometric factors. Structural factors include material composition and heat treatment. Geometric factors include the thickness of the spring &#x201c;T&#x201d;, the change in radius of curvature of the spring as the spring is extended, and the width &#x201c;W&#x201d; of the spring.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290">Turning now to a consideration of the novel variable force springs of the present invention, these springs can be constructed from various materials, such as metal, plastic, ceramic, composite and alloys, that is, intermetallic phases, intermetallic compounds, solid solution, metal-semi metal solutions including but not limited to Al/Cu, Al/Mn, Al/Si, Al/Mg, Al/Mg/Si, Al/Zn, Pb/Sn/Sb, Sn/Sb/Cu, Al/Sb, Zn/Sb, In/Sb, Sb/Pb, Au/Cu, Ti/Al/Sn, Nb/Zr, Cr/Fe, non-ferrous alloys, Cu/Mn/Ni, Al/Ni/Co, Ni/Cu/Zn, Ni/Cr, Ni/Cu/Mn, Cu/Zn, Ni/Cu/Sn. These springs comprise a novel modification of the prior art constant force springs to provide variable springs suitable for use in many diverse applications</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">With the forgoing in mind, if one wanted to produce a spring that delivered a force that increased by a factor of two as the spring returned from its fully extended conformation to its equilibrium, or fully coiled conformation, one would require that, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 94</figref> of the drawings, the width of the spring change by a factor of two along its length. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 94A</figref>, the force will decrease by a factor of w<sub>1</sub>/w<sub>2 </sub>as the spring changes from a fully extended configuration to a fully retracted configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">With the forgoing in mind, one form of the modified spring of the present invention can be described algebraically as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">If x denotes the position of a point along a line that is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the spring and w(x) denotes the width of the spring at that point then:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>w</i>(<i>x</i>)=(constant)<i>x </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
This describes the case wherein the width varies linearly with x as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 94</figref> of the drawings.
</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">However, it is to be observed that the relationship between a position along the longitudinal axis of the spring and the width of the spring at that position need not be linear as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 94</figref>. Further, the width of the spring could be any arbitrary function of x. Thus:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>w</i>(<i>x</i>)=<i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where (x) denotes an arbitrary function of x.
</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">Using this concept, a spring can be designed that can be used to controllably compress a bellows type reservoir, such as reservoir <b>94</b>, which when compressed by the modified spring exhibits a pressure vs. degree of compression curve of the character shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 94B</figref>. Stated another way, it is apparent that the concept can be employed to design a spring that generates a pressure that is independent of the degree of compression of the bellows-type reservoir.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">By way of example, suppose that the pressure vs. degree of compression curve for a bellows-like container when compressed by a constant force spring is exemplified by the curve P(x) and the force of the constant force spring is identified as &#x201c;FCFS&#x201d;. Further assume that the drop in pressure as the container is compressed is due to the force &#x201c;BF(x)&#x201d;, which is the force required to compress the container. Then the net force producing the pressure in the container can then be written:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>F</i>(<i>x</i>)=<i>FCFS&#x2212;BF</i>(<i>x</i>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0297">Assume for simplicity that the area on which the force F acts is constant and is represented by &#x201c;A&#x201d;. Then the pressure in the bottle is:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>P</i>(<i>x</i>)=(<i>FCFS&#x2212;BF</i>(<i>x</i>))/<i>A </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
This equation describes, in functional form, the curve labeled P(x) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 94B</figref>, and includes explicitly the contributions of the two forces generating the pressure within the reservoir <b>94</b> of the bellows-like container, that is the force due to the spring and the force due to the bellows-like container.
</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0298">The forgoing analysis allows one to design a spring, the force of which changes in such a way that the sum of all forces generating the pressure in the container is independent of the degree of the compression of the container, i.e., independent of the variable x. The force delivered by such a spring can be stated as:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>F</i><sub>ms</sub>(<i>x</i>)=<i>FCFS+AF</i>(<i>x</i>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
Where &#x201c;FCFS&#x201d; is the force delivered by the original constant force spring and AF(x) is an additional force whose functional form is to be determined. Thus, the modified spring can be thought of as being composed of two parts, one part delivers the force of the original constant force spring (a force independent of x) and the other delivers a force that depends on the variable x.
</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299">For this system the net force generating the pressure in the reservoir of the bellows-like container is stated as:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>FS</i>(<i>x</i>)=<i>F</i><sub>ms</sub>(<i>x</i>)&#x2212;<i>BF</i>(<i>x</i>)=<i>FCFS+AF</i>(<i>x</i>)&#x2212;<i>BF</i>(<i>x</i>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
Assuming that:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>AF</i>(<i>x</i>)=<i>BF</i>(<i>x</i>) for all <i>x. </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
Then the total force compressing the container is:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>FS</i>(<i>x</i>)=<i>FCFS+AF</i>(<i>x</i>)&#x2212;<i>AF</i>(<i>x</i>)=<i>FCFS </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
which force is independent of the degree of compression of the container, and wherein the pressure within the container is independent of the degree of compression of the container.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>P</i><sub>ms</sub>(<i>x</i>)=(<i>FCFS+AF</i>(<i>x</i>)&#x2212;<i>AF</i>(<i>x</i>))/<i>A=FCFS/A </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
Where P<sub>ms</sub>(x) denotes the pressure in the fluid reservoir when the modified spring of the invention is used.
</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">In designing the modified spring of the present invention, the information contained in the pressure vs. displacement curve when the container is compressed by a constant force spring can be used to determine how the cross-sectional mass, in this case the width of the spring, must vary as a function of x in order that the pressure in the container when compressed with the modified spring remains constant.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301">The force delivered by the spring being linearly dependent on the width of the spring if all other things remain constant, thus:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>AF</i>(<i>x</i>)=(constant)<i>w</i>(<i>x</i>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
Substituting this into equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>P</i>(<i>x</i>)=(<i>FCFS&#x2212;BF</i>(<i>x</i>))/<i>A</i>, then:<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>P</i>(<i>x</i>)=(<i>FCFS&#x2212;AF</i>(<i>x</i>))/<i>A</i>=(<i>FCFS&#x2212;</i>constant)<i>w</i>(<i>x</i>))/<i>A </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
However, it is to be observed that FCFS/A&#x2212;P(x) is just the difference between the two curves shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 94B</figref>, FCFS/A being the horizontal line. Thus, the modification to the width, denoted w(x), of the original constant force spring is proportional to the difference between the two curves shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 94B</figref>. In other words, the shape of the change in the width of the spring as a function of x is similar to the difference between the two curves as a function of x. Furthermore, one can simply &#x201c;read off&#x201d; the shape of the curve w(x) from the pressure vs. displacement curve.
</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0302">The broader utility of a variable force spring whose width defines the specific force may be that the spring design can be appropriately constructed to deliver a non-linear and highly variable force to meet a specific requirement. In this way, a spring that has a width that simply decreases as it is unrolled could be used. Alternatively, the spring could have an increasing width, followed by a width that decreases again during its distention. The spring force provided is therefore highly tunable to meet a variety of applications and requirements, simply by constructing a spring of specific width at the desired distension.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0303">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 99 and 99A</figref> of the drawings, still another form of variable force spring having varying cross-sectional mass along its length is there illustrated. In this instance, the varying cross-sectional mass is achieved by a constant force spring wherein the force generating region of the spring has been modified to include a plurality of spaced-apart apertres &#x201c;AP&#x201d; along its length. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 99A</figref>, which is a schematic plot (not to scale) of force versus cross-sectional mass, the spring uniquely provides an increasing force in a stair step fashion as it is retracted. It is to be understood, that the apertures formed in the pre-stressed strip of spring material can be located in any desired configuration and can be both transversely and longitudinally spaced-apart to provide the desired force as the spring is retracted.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0304"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 100</figref> is a generally perspective view of still another form of the retractable spring of a modified configuration that can be used in an apparatus of the character illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 94 and 95</figref> of the drawings. This latter form of the retractable spring here comprises a novel laminate construction made up of a first laminate FL and a second interconnected laminate SL. The varying cross-sectional mass is once again achieved by providing a plurality of the elongated transversely and longitudinally spaced-apart apertures, or slits.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0305">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 100</figref>, yet another form of the first assembly of the apparatus of the invention is there shown and generally identified by the numeral <b>580</b>. First assembly <b>580</b> is similar in many respects to the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 94</figref> and like numerals are used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 101 and 102</figref> to identify like components. The primary difference between first assembly <b>580</b> and the previously described assembly <b>554</b> resides in the provision of the different stored energy means for moving the carriage <b>264</b> from a first retracted position to a second advanced position. As before, second assembly <b>54</b> includes a rate control assembly that permits the delivery of fluid to the patient at substantially a fixed rate.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0306">In this latest form of the invention, the stored energy means comprise a plurality of circumferentially spaced variable force spring assemblies <b>582</b> that are somewhat similar in construction to prior art constant force spring assemblies, but have been modified to produce highly specific and desirable linear and non-linear force-distention curves to meet the fluid delivery requirements of the invention. For example, as will be discussed in greater detail in the paragraphs that follow, in this latest form of the invention the elongated band or strip portion <b>582</b><i>a </i>of the spring is coiled about a spring drum <b>584</b> in predetermined varying degrees of tightness. Accordingly, like the earlier described variable force springs in which the elongated band or strip portion of the spring has been modified to exhibit a cross-sectional mass that varies along the length of the band, springs with a variation of coil tightness such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 104 and 105</figref>, can produce highly specific and desirable linear and non-linear force-distention curves to meet the fluid delivery requirements of the invention. This type of &#x201c;inter-wound negative gradient&#x201d; spring has no slot. In fact, it is that the winding process is done precisely to create a &#x201c;negative gradient&#x201d; so that as the spring retracts, it provides a higher force.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0307">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 104 and 105</figref> of the drawings, one example of the spring coiling method is there illustrated. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 104</figref>, the band portion <b>582</b> of the spring is initially wound tightly about the drum <b>584</b> to produce a first segment <b>587</b> having a diameter &#x201c;D-<b>1</b>&#x201d;. This done, the band portion is then coiled, or wound more loosely about the drum <b>584</b> to produce a second segment <b>589</b> having a diameter &#x201c;D-<b>2</b>&#x201d;. Finally, the band portion is coiled, or wound even more loosely about the drum <b>584</b> to produce a third segment <b>591</b> having a diameter &#x201c;D-<b>3</b>&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0308">By coiling the springs about their respective drums with a variation of coil tightness in the manner described in the preceding paragraph and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 104 and 105</figref>, springs having highly specific and desirable linear and non-linear force-distention curves can be produced which will meet the fluid delivery requirements of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0309">Spring assemblies, such as those depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 104 and 105</figref> of the drawings, that exhibit a variation of coil tightness that produce highly specific and desirable linear and non-linear force-distention curves to meet the fluid delivery requirements of the invention, are available by custom order from various sources, including Vulcan Mfg. &#x26; Spring Company of Telford, Pa.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0310">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 106</figref> of the drawings, still another form of variable force spring that can be used with the apparatus illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 94 and 95</figref> is there shown. This spring, which is generally identified by the numeral <b>594</b>, is of a novel laminate construction. This latter form of the retractable spring here comprises a novel laminate construction made up of a first laminate FL and a second interconnected laminate SL. As in the spring of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 104 and 105</figref>, the elongated band or strip portion <b>594</b><i>a </i>of the spring is coiled about a spring drum Z in predetermined varying degrees of tightness. Accordingly, like the earlier described variable force springs in which the elongated band or strip portion of the spring has been modified to exhibit a cross-sectional mass that varies along the length of the band, springs with a variation of coil tightness such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 104 and 105</figref>, can produce highly specific and desirable linear and non-linear force-distention curves to meet the fluid delivery requirements of the invention.
