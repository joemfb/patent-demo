<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is U.S. National Phase of International Application PCT/CA2008/000159, filed Jan. 24, 2008, designating the U.S., and published in English as WO 2009/092149 on Jul. 30, 2009.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to a method, system and media for wireless process control of mobile equipment.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In remote mobile mining operations, a train of mobile mining equipment comprised of one or more pieces of mobile equipment, may work together in mining and processing a mined resource material. Communication between the various large pieces of mining equipment is accomplished through a wired medium. Although wired systems can assist in the control and operation of mobile equipment, they also present many challenges. In general, wired systems are limited in their ability to support process control by the extent and availability of wired connections. In addition, with wired systems, an operator of the mobile equipment is at the mercy of the cabling required, which can reduce mobility, range of operation and range of motion of the mobile equipment. Cabling in a wired system is also susceptible to both physical and environmentally induced damage, including from inadvertent operator and equipment impacts.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the context of large mobile mining equipment, wired systems are yet further susceptible to damage and operational and maintenance problems. For instance, large mobile mining equipment can have hundreds or thousands of I/O points, further complicating the cabling requirements. The result is that for a wired system the cabling requirements are often very substantial, with very large numbers of cables connected to the various pieces of mining equipment. In addition, when one wishes to relocate a train of mobile mining equipment, or swap out one of the pieces of mobile mining equipment, a vast array of cables forming part of the wired control system often needs to be disconnected, collected and then laid out and reconnected at the new mining operations site. Given the critical data and instructions that may need to be communicated over the wired system, reconnecting all of the cabling can lead to a tremendous amount of time spent recommissioning the mobile mining equipment to ensure that all cabling has been correctly reconnected.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is therefore a need for a method and system of wireless control of mobile equipment that offers enhancements or alternatives to the manner in which mobile equipment, including mobile mining equipment, is controlled and operated remotely.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention provides an improved method, system and media for wireless process control of mobile equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a system adapted to support real-time remote monitoring and control of mobile equipment. With this aspect, the system comprises a plurality of equipment data collectors and controllers, a plurality of first wireless bridges, a plurality of second wireless bridges and a host equipment control computer. Each of the plurality of equipment data collectors and controllers are positionable on a corresponding one of a plurality of mobile equipment, and are operative to collect a set of status and operational data from the corresponding one of the plurality of mobile equipment. The plurality of equipment data collectors and controllers are also operative to control at least one feature of a corresponding one of the plurality of mobile equipment. The plurality of first wireless bridges are positionable on at least one of the plurality of mobile equipment, with each of the first wireless bridges operative to communicate according to a first radio frequency band, operative to transmit the first set of status and operational data for processing, and operative to receive data and instructions for controlling at least one of the plurality of equipment data collectors and controllers. The plurality of second wireless bridges are also positionable on at least one of the plurality of mobile equipment, with each of the second wireless bridges operative to communicate according to a second radio frequency band substantially different from the first radio frequency band, operative to transmit, concurrent with the same or substantially the same data transmitted by the plurality of first wireless bridges, the first set of status and operational data, and operative to receive, concurrent with the same or substantially the same data and instructions received by any of the plurality of first wireless bridges, data and instructions for controlling at least one of the plurality of equipment data collectors and controllers. The host equipment control computer is operative to communicate with plurality of mobile equipment via at least one of the plurality of mobile equipment and operative to control at least a set of features on the plurality of mobile equipment. The host equipment control computer comprises an equipment monitoring and control program stored on a computer-readable media, with the program comprising computer-readable instructions adapted to instruct the host equipment control computer to: (a) monitor for and process status and operational data specific to each of the plurality of mobile equipment, received via both the plurality of first wireless bridges and the plurality of second wireless bridges when positioned on the mobile equipment, including control data and run status data for each of the plurality of mobile equipment; and (b) provide at least part of each set of status and operational data for display on a user interface displayed on a display device connected to at least one of the host equipment control computer and a remote computer in communication with the host equipment control computer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a system for real-time remote monitoring and control of mobile mining equipment using at least two concurrently operational wireless networks. With this aspect, the system comprises a first mobile mining process train, a first plurality of equipment data collectors and controllers and a host equipment control computer. The first mobile mining process train comprises a first plurality of mobile mining equipment including a first mobile slurry facility operative to receive and process mined material from other equipment in the first mobile mining process train. The first plurality of equipment data collectors and controllers are each positioned on a corresponding one of the first plurality of mobile mining equipment, with each of the first plurality of equipment data collectors and controllers operative to collect a set of status and operational data from the corresponding one of the first plurality of mobile mining equipment, and operative to control at least one feature of the corresponding one of the first plurality of mobile mining equipment. The first plurality of equipment data collectors and controllers are positioned in communication with first and second wireless bridges. Each first wireless bridge is positioned on a corresponding one of the first plurality of mobile mining equipment, is operative to communicate according to a first radio frequency band, is operative to transmit the first set of status and operational data for processing, and is operative to receive data and instructions for controlling the corresponding equipment data collector and controller. Each second wireless bridge is positioned on a corresponding one of the first plurality of mobile mining equipment, is operative to communicate according to a second radio frequency band substantially different from the first radio frequency band, is operative to transmit, concurrent with the same or substantially the same data transmitted by the first wireless bridge, the first set of status and operational data for further processing, and is operative to receive, concurrent with the same or substantially the same data and instructions received by the first wireless bridge, data and instructions for controlling the corresponding equipment data collector and controller.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, there is shown a first embodiment of a system <b>10</b> for wireless process control, for use in the mining industry in accordance with one aspect of the present invention. In general terms, the system <b>10</b> comprises at least a first wireless network <b>36</b> and a second wireless network <b>38</b>, which use different radio frequency bands that do not substantially interfere with each other. The first wireless network <b>36</b> is used to communicate real-time instructions and data between one or more pieces of mobile equipment to at least one other piece of mobile equipment. The second wireless network <b>38</b> is used to concurrently communicate the same or substantially the same real-time instructions and data as are communicated over the first wireless network <b>36</b>. The concurrent operation of the two wireless networks supports a reliable system for remote monitoring and control of the mobile equipment, while minimizing the risk of an interruption or loss of communication of real-time instructions and data.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0029">In the first embodiment, the system <b>10</b> includes a mobile mining process train <b>50</b> (or mobile mining process line) for use in the mobile excavation and mining of a mineable resource material. In operation, the mobile mining process train <b>50</b> is located proximate an open pit oil sands mine face and comprises a plurality of mobile mining equipment, including a mobile shovel <b>22</b>, a mobile sizer <b>20</b>, a mobile mining conveyor hopper (or MMCH) <b>18</b>, a mobile mining conveyor (or MMC) <b>16</b> and a mobile slurry facility <b>14</b>, although other types of mobile mining equipment may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0030">The mobile shovel <b>22</b> is operative to excavate the mineable resource material from a resource-bearing body, the excavated mineable resource material forming a mined material. In the first embodiment, the mined material comprises a bitumen-bearing formation material excavated from an oil sands deposit, although the mined material may comprise any other form of mineable resource material, including an ore-bearing material excavated from an ore-bearing body. The mobile sizer <b>20</b> is operative to receive the mined material from the mobile shovel <b>22</b> and to comminute the mined material to a conveyable size. Preferably, the mobile sizer <b>20</b> causes the mined material to have pieces of material that do not exceed a predetermined size. The mobile mining conveyor hopper <b>18</b> is operative to receive the mined material from the mobile sizer <b>20</b> for transfer at a regulated rate to the mobile mining conveyor <b>16</b>. The mobile mining conveyor <b>16</b> is operative to receive the mined material from the mobile mining conveyor hopper <b>18</b> and to transport the mined material for processing downstream. The mobile slurry facility <b>14</b> is operative to receive the mined material from the mobile mining conveyor <b>16</b> and to size and combine it with water for transport to an extraction facility. The mobile mining process train <b>50</b> may include other pieces of equipment, including, for instance, a transfer conveyor <b>52</b> that acts as a bridge, receiving the mined material from the mobile mining conveyor <b>16</b> via the receiving end <b>54</b> and transporting the mined material to the mobile slurry facility <b>14</b>. It will be noted that the pieces of mobile mining equipment identified above are illustrative of, but are not meant to limit, the types of mobile mining equipment that may be used in the system <b>10</b>. For instance, the mobile sizer <b>20</b> may be any type of mobile comminuting device suitable for mining, including a mobile crusher. The mobile shovel <b>22</b> may also be any type of mobile excavator suitable for mining, including a mobile loader. In addition to supporting communications with the mobile mining equipment, the system <b>10</b> can also support communications with other sites and other forms of equipment, such as a hydro-transport booster pump house (HTBPH) <b>24</b> or another type of hydro-transport booster pump, which may be mobile or relocatable.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0031">The system <b>10</b> cooperates with a remote plant <b>28</b> for monitoring the mobile mining process train <b>50</b> and for sending and receiving data to and from the mobile mining process train <b>50</b>. Communication between the remote plant <b>28</b> and the mobile mining process train <b>50</b> may be accomplished directly or indirectly, including, for example, through a substation <b>26</b>, wherein the substation <b>26</b> communicates over a first communication medium <b>30</b> with the mobile slurry facility <b>14</b> and the mobile slurry facility communicates over the first communication medium <b>30</b> with the rest of the mobile mining process train <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0032">The first communication medium <b>30</b> is a wireless medium further comprising at least two wireless connections <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> that operate at substantially different radio frequency bands from each other. The wireless connections <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> provide concurrent point-to-point connections between the substation <b>26</b> and the hub of the mobile mining process train <b>50</b>, which in the first embodiment is positioned on the mobile slurry facility <b>14</b>. In the first embodiment, wireless connections <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> are an IEEE 802.11g wireless connection and an IEEE 802.11a wireless connection respectively, although other wireless communications standards may be used provided that the two wireless connections use different radio frequency bands that do not substantially interfere with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0033">In the first embodiment, the mobile slurry facility <b>14</b> serves as a gateway for the mobile mining process train <b>50</b>, sending and receiving data between the mobile mining process train <b>50</b> and substation <b>26</b>. The substation <b>26</b> serves as a communication interface for the remote plant <b>28</b> wherein communication between the substation <b>26</b> and remote plant <b>28</b> occurs over a second communication medium <b>37</b>, which is, for illustration purposes, a single mode fiber, although other wired or wireless connections may be used for the second communication medium <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0034">Communication in and between the mobile mining equipment, including the mobile slurry facility <b>14</b>, is managed via the first wireless network <b>36</b> and the second wireless network <b>38</b>. In the first embodiment, communication between the remote plant <b>28</b> and the mobile mining equipment of the mobile mining process train <b>50</b>, other than the mobile slurry facility <b>14</b>, is facilitated through the mobile slurry facility <b>14</b>. The remote plant <b>28</b> (via the substation <b>26</b>) communicates with the mobile slurry facility <b>14</b> while the other mobile mining equipment, such as the mobile mining conveyor <b>16</b>, communicates with the mobile slurry facility <b>14</b> over both the first wireless network <b>36</b> and the second wireless network <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0035">The first wireless network <b>36</b> operates using a radio frequency in accordance with the IEEE 802.11g standard. The second wireless network <b>38</b> operates using a different radio frequency in accordance with the IEEE 802.11a standard. It will be noted, however, that other wireless communications standards may be used for the first and second wireless networks provided that the two wireless networks use different radio frequency bands that do not substantially interfere with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0036">The wireless connections <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> provide real-time concurrent wireless connections between the mobile slurry facility <b>14</b> and substation <b>26</b>, while the wireless networks <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> provide real-time concurrent wireless connections between the mobile slurry facility <b>14</b> and the other pieces of mobile mining equipment in the mobile mining process train <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, the mobile equipment communication and control portion of the system <b>10</b> for each of the pieces of mobile mining equipment of the mobile mining train <b>50</b> is shown in more detail at <b>70</b>. Each of the mobile mining equipment has positioned on it an equipment data collector and controller <b>80</b> that collects a set of status and operational data from the corresponding piece of mobile mining equipment, and is operative to control at least one feature of the corresponding piece of mobile mining equipment. Instances of the equipment data collector and controller <b>80</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> include those referenced at <b>40</b>, <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>43</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>45</b> and <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0038">Each equipment data collector and controller <b>80</b> includes a programmable logic controller (PLC) programmed to support to the operation of the respective equipment data collector and controller. Each of the pieces of mobile mining equipment also has positioned on it, either as part of or in communication with the applicable equipment data collector and controller <b>80</b>, a first wireless bridge <b>76</b>, a second wireless bridge <b>78</b>, a first antenna <b>72</b>, and a second antenna <b>74</b>. The first wireless bridge <b>76</b> communicates instructions and data between the equipment data collector and controller <b>80</b> and the first antenna <b>72</b> while the second wireless bridge <b>78</b> communicates instructions and data between the equipment data collector and controller <b>80</b> and the second antenna <b>74</b>. The first antenna <b>72</b> communicates via the first wireless network <b>36</b> transmitting the first set of status and operational data for processing and receiving data and instructions for controlling the equipment data collector and controller <b>80</b>. The second antenna <b>74</b> communicates via the second wireless network <b>38</b> transmitting, concurrent with the same or substantially the same data transmitted via the first antenna <b>72</b>, the first set of status and operational data for processing, and receiving, concurrent with the same or substantially the same data and instructions received by the first antenna <b>72</b>, data and instructions for controlling the equipment data collector and controller <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0039">The establishing of the first wireless network <b>36</b> for monitoring and controlling the plurality of pieces of mobile mining equipment includes configuring a first set of wireless bridges comprising a plurality of the first wireless bridges <b>76</b> to communicate according to a first frequency band.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0040">The establishing of the second wireless network <b>38</b> for monitoring and controlling the plurality of pieces of mobile mining equipment concurrently with the first wireless network <b>36</b> includes configuring a second set of wireless bridges comprising a plurality of second wireless bridges <b>78</b> to communicate according to a second radio frequency band substantially different from the first radio frequency band. The second set of wireless bridges preferably communicate substantially the same data concurrently transmitted by corresponding ones of the first set of wireless bridges.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0041">Once the first and second wireless networks <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> have been established, a set of status and operational data are collected from each of the plurality of mobile mining equipment via the equipment data collector and controller <b>80</b> positioned on each of the plurality of mobile mining equipment so as to form collected sets of status and operational data.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0042">Although in the first embodiment a single equipment data collector and controller is positioned on each piece of mobile mining equipment, it will be noted that alternatively two or more equipment data collectors and controllers may be positioned on each piece of mobile mining equipment that each communicate over the first and second wireless networks <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> via the first and second wireless bridges <b>76</b> and <b>78</b>. In yet another variation, the two wireless bridges <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> may be replaced with a single wireless bridge that is operative to communicate on both the first and second wireless networks <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> via one or more antennae.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0043">In the first embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the remote plant <b>28</b> comprises a host equipment control computer <b>29</b> that is operative to communicate with the mobile mining equipment over the wireless connections <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> via the mobile slurry facility <b>14</b>, and is operative to control at least a set of features on the mobile mining process train <b>50</b>. The host equipment control computer <b>29</b> includes an equipment monitoring and control program stored on a computer-readable media and adapted to instruct the host equipment control computer <b>29</b> to perform the operations described below for the host equipment control computer <b>29</b>. The computer-readable media may be of one or more types, including volatile memory such as Random Access Memory (RAM), and non-volatile memory, such as a hard disk or Read Only Memory (ROM).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0044">The collected sets of status and operational data from the first and second wireless bridges <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> positioned on the plurality of mobile mining equipment are transmitted via the first and second wireless networks <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> to the host equipment control computer <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0045">The host equipment control computer <b>29</b> is programmed to monitor for and process status and operational data specific to each of the pieces of equipment in the mobile mining process train <b>50</b>. The status and operational data is received via both the first and second wireless bridges <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) positioned on the mobile slurry facility <b>14</b> over the wireless connections <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>. The status and operational data may include control data and run status data for each of the mobile mining equipment in the mobile mining process train <b>50</b>. At least part of each set of status and operational data is provided by the host equipment control computer <b>29</b> for display on a user interface displayed on a display device connected to the host equipment control computer <b>29</b> or a remote computer in communication with the host equipment control computer.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0046">Thus, the host equipment control computer <b>29</b> is operatively configured for processing at least part of the collected sets of status and operational data received from the first and second wireless bridges <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> and their associated antennae <b>72</b> and <b>74</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) via the first and second wireless networks <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0047">The method of monitoring and controlling a plurality of mobile mining equipment including the establishing of the first and second wireless networks <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>, the collecting and transmitting of the status and operational data, and subsequent process and display of the data is shown generally at <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0048">The host equipment control computer <b>29</b> is preferably programmed to permit a user to control at least one piece of the mobile mining equipment of the mobile mining process train <b>50</b> via the host equipment control computer <b>29</b> or a remote computer such as the wireless personal computing device <b>90</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). This allows the user to control one or more features of one or more of the pieces of mobile mining equipment including the mobile slurry facility <b>14</b> and mobile sizer <b>20</b>. In another variation, the host equipment control computer <b>29</b> is preferably programmed to control and operate, in addition or in the alternative, the mobile shovel <b>22</b> or other pieces of mobile mining equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0049">In another variation, the host equipment control computer <b>29</b> may be configured for providing at least part of the collected sets of status and operational data for display on a user interface of a field operator's personal computing device operative to remotely monitor and control at least a portion of the features of the plurality of mobile mining equipment. In yet another variation, the host equipment control computer <b>29</b> may be positioned on one of the pieces of mobile mining equipment, for example on the mobile slurry facility <b>14</b>. Having the host equipment control computer <b>29</b> located on the mobile slurry facility <b>14</b> or another piece of mobile mining equipment allows for local control and operation of the mobile mining equipment even if the connection to the remote plant <b>28</b> is lost. Local control and operation via the host equipment control computer <b>29</b> can enable a user such as an operator or controller to have improved visibility of the mobile equipment while operating same via the host equipment control computer <b>29</b> through the wireless networks <b>36</b> and/or <b>38</b>. In yet another variation, the host equipment control computer <b>29</b> is a personal computing device, such as a wireless laptop computer.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0050">It will be noted that the wireless connections <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> and the wireless networks <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> provide for the same or substantially the same data to be transmitted and received over a plurality of connections, which provides for the ability of the system <b>10</b> to remain operational so long as at least one of the wireless connections <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> and at least one of the wireless networks <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> are operational.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0051">In order to monitor for and respond to interruptions in communications over the system <b>10</b>, the host equipment control computer <b>29</b> is programmed to generate and provide a network activity alert signal to the user interface, if one of the first and second wireless networks <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> is interrupted including if communication is lost with any wireless bridge within one of the first and second wireless networks <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> for at least a predetermined time limit. In the first embodiment the predetermined time limit is set at 10 seconds, although other longer or shorter time limits may be used to meet the desired sensitivity of the system. For example, the predetermined time limit may be anywhere from about 600 milliseconds to about 10 seconds or more, depending on the distance between pieces of the mobile mining equipment. For shorter distances, such as when pieces of mobile mining equipment are about 300 to about 900 meters apart, the predetermined time limit may be about 600 milliseconds to about 1.5 seconds. For situations when pieces of mobile mining equipment or other equipment in the system <b>10</b> are spaced apart by at least about 1 km or more, the predetermined time limit is preferably no less than about 2 or 2.5 seconds, so as to provide time for round trip communications to occur with some lag without triggering a network activity alert signal warning of a possible loss of communication. In environments where more adaptability to potential, short interruptions may occur (such as due to intervening vehicles temporarily blocking a signal), a higher predetermined time limit is preferred, such as no less than about 3 seconds or more preferably yet about 4 seconds. This adds some further slack without triggering a network activity alert signal, and thereby adds further capacity for the networks to operate in the presence of minor lag, for instance where distances between points of communication extend to about 1 km or more.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0052">The host equipment control computer <b>29</b> is also programmed to generate and provide an equipment failure alert signal for further processing or for display on the user interface, if the run status data received for any piece of mobile mining equipment in the mobile mining process train <b>50</b> indicates that the corresponding piece of mobile mining equipment has a failure falling within a predetermined class of critical failures. Preferably, the equipment failure alert signal identifies the corresponding piece of mobile mining equipment that has failed.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0053">In response to the equipment failure alert signal, the host equipment control computer <b>29</b> is preferably programmed to initiate a first type of shutdown of at least the portion of the plurality of mobile mining equipment in the mobile mining process train <b>50</b> affected by the equipment failure. In this case, the mobile mining equipment affected by the equipment failure is or are preferably identified by the equipment failure alert signal. The first type of shutdown is preferably adapted to occur according to a first predetermined shutdown sequence adapted to at least the portion of the plurality of mobile mining equipment identified by the equipment failure alert signal as having the equipment failure. The predetermined shutdown sequence may also be adapted to other mobile mining equipment affected by an interruption in the operation of the mobile mining equipment having the equipment failure. In yet another arrangement, when the equipment failure alert signal identifies a critical equipment failure, the first type of shutdown is adapted to shut down all or substantially all of the operations of the mobile mining process train <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0054">The host equipment control computer <b>29</b> preferably monitors, according to a predetermined verification schedule, the operability of each of the first and second wireless networks <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> by transmitting, via the mobile slurry facility <b>14</b>, unique device identifiers to each of the first and second wireless bridges <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> positioned on each piece of mobile mining equipment in the mobile mining process train <b>50</b>. For each unique device identifier transmitted, the host equipment control computer <b>29</b> is instructed to monitor for receipt, via the corresponding wireless bridge positioned on the mobile slurry facility <b>14</b>, of a receipt confirmation signal in less than the predetermined time limit from the corresponding wireless bridge (and associated antenna) of the corresponding piece of equipment in the mobile mining process train <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0055">In addition, two or more of the equipment data collectors and controllers or the corresponding wireless communication equipment (e.g. corresponding wireless bridges and antennae), may be adapted, over the predetermined verification schedule, to transmit to and wait for confirmed receipt from each other heartbeat signals containing a unique identifier associated with the particular target recipient device. Failure to receive a confirmed receipt in the form of a return signal within the first predetermined time limit, or optionally within a second predetermined time limit different from the first predetermined time limit, results in detection of an interruption, which is then sent to the host equipment control computer <b>29</b>. In one variation, this approach may be used to have any piece of mobile mining equipment transmit heartbeat signals and other signals to all other pieces of mobile mining equipment in the mobile mining process train <b>50</b> that have an interlock relationship with the piece of mobile mining equipment transmitting the heartbeat signals or other signals.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0056">If either or both of the first and second wireless networks <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> are concurrently interrupted for at least the predetermined time limit, a network failure alert signal is provided by the host equipment control computer <b>29</b> to the applicable user interface. For instance, the network failure alert signal will be sent to the user interface if communications are lost with at least one wireless bridge in either or both each of the first and second wireless networks <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> for at least the predetermined time limit. The network failure alert signal preferably indicates which wireless bridges have lost communication. If the host equipment control computer <b>29</b> identifies a failure of both the first and second wireless networks <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>, or at least one wireless connection in each of the first and second wireless networks <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>, then the host equipment control computer <b>29</b> initiates a second type of shutdown of at least the portion of the mobile mining process train <b>50</b> affected by the applicable failure.

<p id="p-0058" num="0063">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, there is shown a system <b>10</b>A, which is an alternate embodiment of the system <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, wherein a third wireless connection <b>35</b> and a third wireless network <b>39</b> are included. The third wireless connection <b>35</b> provides an additional connection (in addition to first and second wireless connections <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>) for communication between the mobile slurry facility <b>14</b> and the substation <b>26</b>. The third wireless network <b>39</b> provides an additional network connection for communication between each of the pieces of mobile mining equipment of the mobile mining process train <b>50</b>. Each communication device within the third wireless network <b>39</b> operates at a radio frequency band different than that of the radio frequency bands of the first and second wireless networks <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>. The third wireless connection <b>35</b> also operates at the same radio frequency as the third wireless network <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0064">The third wireless connection <b>35</b> and a third wireless network <b>39</b> may be adapted to support the concurrent communication of the same or substantially the same data and instructions as that which is communicated over wireless connections <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> and over wireless networks <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>. In this configuration, the third wireless connection <b>35</b> and a third wireless network <b>39</b> provide a yet further level of reliability to the wireless communication of data and instructions between the various pieces of mobile mining equipment in the mobile mining process train <b>50</b> and between the mobile slurry facility <b>14</b> and the remote plant <b>28</b> via substation <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0065">In another alternative, the third wireless connection <b>35</b> and a third wireless network <b>39</b> may be adapted to support the concurrent communication of different data and instructions from that which is communicated concurrently over wireless connections <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> and over wireless networks <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>. In this configuration the third wireless connection <b>35</b> and a third wireless network <b>39</b> can be used to provide segmented communication of data and instructions associated with features of the mobile mining equipment not communicated over wireless connections <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> and over wireless networks <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>. For example, the third wireless connection <b>35</b> and a third wireless network <b>39</b> may be adapted to communicate data and instructions associated with non-critical features of the mobile mining process train <b>50</b> (e.g. data and instructions that do not need to be monitored or controlled for emergency shutdown purposes, such as video data or routine maintenance information). Transferring communication of non-critical data and instructions to the third wireless connection <b>35</b> and a third wireless network <b>39</b> allows one to minimize the risk of overloading critical communications transmitted concurrently over both the wireless connections <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> and over wireless networks <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0066">In one variation, the third wireless network <b>39</b> may be configured according to the same communications standard as the first wireless network <b>36</b>, but allocated a dedicated channel of the communications standard that is sufficiently different from other channels making up the communications standard so as to minimize the risk of interference between the first and third wireless networks. For example, where the first wireless network <b>36</b> is configured for 802.11g and the third wireless network <b>39</b> may also be configured for 802.11g, provided the third wireless network <b>39</b> is allocated a select dedicated channel within 802.11g different from the channels used by the first wireless network <b>36</b> within the 802.11g standard. In such an arrangement, the first wireless bridges forming part of the first wireless network <b>26</b> are preferably configured to provide the select dedicated channel to the third wireless network <b>39</b>. In one arrangement of this variation, each antenna used for the first wireless network <b>36</b>, when positioned on a piece of mobile mining equipment, is spaced apart at least about 2 meters from the antenna used for the third wireless network.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0067">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, a further variation (<b>10</b>B) of system <b>10</b>A is provided involving another embodiment of a third wireless connection <b>35</b> and a third wireless network <b>39</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> wireless connection <b>61</b> is equivalent to third wireless connection <b>35</b> and wireless network <b>63</b> is equivalent to third wireless network <b>39</b>. In the variation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, wireless connection <b>61</b> and wireless network <b>63</b> operate on the same radio frequency band, which is sufficiently different from that of the radio frequency bands of wireless connections <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> and wireless networks <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> so as not to interfere with wireless connections <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> and wireless networks <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>. It should be noted that the wireless connection <b>61</b> and the wireless network <b>63</b> may operate on different radio frequency bands from each other if desired, provided they do not interfere with the communications over wireless connections <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> and wireless networks <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> combined, each of the mobile slurry facility <b>14</b>, the mobile mining conveyor <b>16</b>, the mobile mining conveyor hopper <b>18</b>, the mobile sizer <b>20</b>, and the mobile shovel <b>22</b> are fitted with one or more cameras <b>65</b>. Video feed from the cameras <b>65</b> is transmitted over the wireless network <b>63</b> and wireless connection <b>61</b> to the remote plant <b>28</b> allowing a user to visually monitor each of the mobile mining equipment of the mobile mining process train <b>50</b> as well as the surrounding operating conditions. The video feed may also be viewed at a facility or a computer not located within the remote plant <b>28</b>. For example, the video feed may be viewed on the personal computing device <b>90</b> as shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>

In this variation, for illustration purposes, the mobile mining equipment used are the mobile slurry facility <b>14</b> and the mobile mining conveyor <b>16</b>, although other sets of mobile mining equipment may be selected for purposes of wireless communication. In this embodiment, the mobile mining conveyor <b>16</b> communicates with the mobile slurry facility <b>14</b> concurrently over both a fourth wireless connection <b>47</b> and a fifth wireless connection <b>48</b>. Wireless connections <b>47</b> and <b>48</b> provide a point-to-point wireless connection between the mobile mining conveyor <b>16</b> and mobile slurry facility <b>14</b>. The radio frequency band of wireless connection <b>47</b> is different from the radio frequency band of wireless connection <b>48</b>, so as to avoid interference between the two concurrently operating connections.</p>

The personal computing device <b>90</b> is operative to communicate wirelessly with the mobile mining equipment of the mobile mining process train <b>50</b> via the first and second networks <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>. The personal computing device <b>90</b> also comprises an instance of the equipment monitoring and control program stored on a computer-readable media local to or in communication with the personal computing device <b>90</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the personal computing device <b>90</b> may communicate with the mobile mining equipment indirectly via another network <b>92</b> such as the Internet or an intranet with which a secure communication is established directly or indirectly, for instance via the substation <b>26</b> or the remote plant <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0070">In another variation, a system <b>10</b>E is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, which corresponds to a variation of the system <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, further adapted to cooperate with a plurality of mobile mining process trains. For instance, the system <b>10</b>E may be adapted to cooperate with both a first mobile mining process train <b>50</b>A over a first wireless network <b>36</b>A and a second wireless network <b>38</b>A, and with a second mobile mining process train <b>50</b>B over a third wireless network <b>36</b>B and a fourth wireless network <b>38</b>B. In this variation, the second mobile mining process train <b>50</b>B is remote from the first mobile mining process train <b>50</b>A, and the second mobile mining process train <b>50</b>B includes a second plurality of mobile mining equipment. The system <b>10</b>E can include a second plurality of equipment data collectors and controllers each positioned on a corresponding one of the second plurality of mobile mining equipment. Each of the second plurality of equipment data collectors and controllers is operative to collect a set of status and operational data from the corresponding one of the second plurality of mobile mining equipment, and is operative to control at least one feature of the corresponding one of the second plurality of mobile mining equipment.

<p id="p-0069" num="0078">In another variation, the system <b>10</b> illustrated in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or any of the variations thereof illustrated in connection with the other figures, can have the first and second wireless networks <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> adapted to support a mesh network. With a mesh network, communications between the host equipment control computer <b>29</b> or any one piece of mobile mining equipment and another piece of mobile mining equipment can be established either directly (where available) or indirectly via any one or more intermediate pieces of mobile mining equipment within communications range and capable of establishing an indirect communications link. For instance, in this variation, communications between the host equipment control computer and the mobile sizer <b>20</b> may be established either via the mobile slurry facility <b>14</b>, directly or via the mobile mining conveyor hopper <b>18</b>, the mobile mining conveyor <b>16</b> and the mobile slurry facility <b>14</b>. In another example, the mobile slurry facility <b>14</b> may communicate indirectly with the other pieces of mobile mining equipment, for instance, with the mobile mining conveyor hopper <b>18</b> via the mobile mining conveyor <b>16</b>. This added adaptability enables the first and second wireless networks <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> to be established and remain even more reliably available without any substantial interruption even in the presence of additional potential obstructions for direct communications or where two pieces of mobile mining equipment which are intended to communicate with each other are unable to directly communicate with each other because of the distance between them.</p>

With a single wireless network, however, there is an increased risk of network failure, and in such an arrangement, if one node in the wireless network goes down, the system <b>10</b> is adapted to shut down all or substantially all of the operations of the plurality of mobile mining equipment in the mobile mining process train. To reduce the risk of network failures when only the first wireless network is established, it is preferable to conduct site surveys to check for signal interfering objects or equipment with much greater frequency. In order to improve network reliability when only a single wireless network is used, it can be preferable to move from an unlicensed frequency such as 802.11g, to a licensed frequency. This will provide a dedicated frequency or set of frequencies for the first wireless network in the system <b>10</b>.
