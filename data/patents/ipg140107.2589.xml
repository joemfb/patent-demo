<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An object is to manufacture a highly reliable semiconductor device including a thin film transistor with stable electric characteristics. In a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device including a thin film transistor in which an oxide semiconductor film is used for a semiconductor layer including a channel formation region, heat treatment (for dehydration or dehydrogenation) is performed to improve the purity of the oxide semiconductor film and reduce impurities including moisture or the like. After that, slow cooling is performed under an oxygen atmosphere. Besides impurities including moisture or the like exiting in the oxide semiconductor film, heat treatment causes reduction of impurities including moisture or the like exiting in a gate insulating layer and those in interfaces between the oxide semiconductor film and films which are provided over and below the oxide semiconductor and in contact therewith.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, a technique for forming a thin film transistor (TFT) by using a semiconductor thin film (having a thickness of approximately several nanometers to several hundred nanometers) formed over a substrate having an insulating surface has attracted attention. Thin film transistors are applied to a wide range of electronic devices such as ICs or electro-optical devices, and prompt development of thin film transistors that are to be used as switching elements in image display devices, in particular, is being pushed. Indium oxide, which is an example of a metal oxide, is used for a material of a transparent electrode which is needed in a liquid crystal display or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some metal oxides have semiconductor characteristics. The examples of such metal oxides having semiconductor characteristics are a tungsten oxide, a tin oxide, an indium oxide, a zinc oxide, and the like. A thin film transistor in which a channel formation region is formed using such metal oxides having semiconductor characteristics is known (Patent Documents 1 to 4 and Non-Patent Document 1).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, not only single-component oxides but also multi-component oxides are known as metal oxides. For example, homologous compound, InGaO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>m </sub>(m is a natural number) is known as a multi-component oxide including In, Ga and Zn (also referred to as an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn-based oxide) (Non-Patent Documents 2 to 4).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, it is confirmed that an oxide semiconductor including such an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn-based oxide is applicable to a channel layer of a thin film transistor (Patent Document 5, Non-Patent Documents 5 and 6).</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0018">An object is to manufacture a highly reliable semiconductor device including a thin film transistor with stable electric characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0019">In a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device including a thin film transistor in which an oxide semiconductor film is used for a semiconductor layer including a channel formation region, heat treatment (which is used for dehydration or dehydrogenation) is performed so as to improve the purity of the oxide semiconductor film and reduce impurities including moisture or the like. Besides impurities including moisture or the like exiting in the oxide semiconductor film, heat treatment causes reduction of impurities including moisture or the like exiting in a gate insulating layer <b>402</b> and those in interfaces between the oxide semiconductor film and films which are provided over and below the oxide semiconductor to be in contact therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0020">In order to reduce impurities including moisture or the like, after formation of the oxide semiconductor film, heat treatment is performed in an inert-gas atmosphere including nitrogen or a rare gas such as argon or helium or under reduced pressure, at 200&#xb0; C. or higher, preferably, 400&#xb0; C. to 600&#xb0; C. inclusive, in such a condition that the formed oxide semiconductor film is exposed. As a result, impurities including moisture or the like, which are included in the oxide semiconductor film, are reduced. After the heat treatment, slow cooling is performed to a temperature which is equal to or higher than room temperature and lower than 100&#xb0; C. in an oxygen atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0021">Use of an oxide semiconductor film in which included impurities including moisture or the like are reduced by heat treatment performed under an inert-gas atmosphere including nitrogen, argon, or the like or under reduced pressure and which is submitted to a slow cooling in an oxygen atmosphere allows improvement of electric characteristics of a thin film transistor comprising the oxide semiconductor film, and enhancement of mass productivity of a thin film transistor of high performance.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0022">A temperature ramp was applied to a plurality of samples in a nitrogen atmosphere, except otherwise specified. Such a plurality of samples were measured with a thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) apparatus. Measurement results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0023">The thermal desorption spectroscopy apparatus is used for detecting and identifying a gas component discharged or generated from the samples by a quadrupole mass analyzer; thus, a gas and a molecule discharged from surfaces and insides of the samples can be observed. Discharge or generation of gas from the samples occurs while the samples are heated and the temperature is rising in high vacuum. With use of a thermal desorption spectrometer (product name: EMD-WA1000S) manufactured by ESCO Ltd., measurement was performed under a condition where the rising temperature was at approximately 10&#xb0; C./min., the SEM voltage was set to 1500 V, the dwell time was 0.2 (sec), and the number of channels to be used was 23. In addition, during the measurement, the pressure was at a degree of vacuum of about 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>(Pa). Note that the ionization coefficient, the fragmentation coefficient, the pass-through coefficient, and the pumping rate of H<sub>2</sub>O were respectively 1.0, 0.805, 1.56, and 1.0.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a graph showing TDS results of comparison between a sample (comparative sample) which includes only a glass substrate and a sample (Sample 1) where an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based non-single-crystal film with a thickness of 50 nm is formed over a glass substrate. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows results obtained by measuring H<sub>2</sub>O. Discharge of impurities such as moisture (H<sub>2</sub>O) from the In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based non-single-crystal film can be confirmed from a peak in the vicinity of 300&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a graph showing comparison of samples, which shows TDS measurement results of H<sub>2</sub>O. The comparison was performed on the following samples: the sample (Sample 1) where an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based non-single-crystal film with a thickness of 50 nm is formed over a glass substrate; a sample (Sample 2) where the structure of Sample 1 is subjected to heat treatment for an hour at 350&#xb0; C. under an air atmosphere; and a sample (Sample 3) where the structure of Sample 1 is subjected to heat treatment for an hour at 350&#xb0; C. under a nitrogen atmosphere. From the results shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, peak intensity in the vicinity of 300&#xb0; C. of Sample 3 is lower than that of Sample 2. Thus, discharge of moisture (H<sub>2</sub>O) and the like due to heat treatment performed under a nitrogen atmosphere can be confirmed. Moreover, it is found that heat treatment performed under a nitrogen atmosphere reduces impurities such as moisture (H<sub>2</sub>O) more than heat treatment performed under an air atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a graph showing TDS measurement results of H<sub>2</sub>O in samples. The respective samples were formed as follows: the sample (Sample 1) where an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based non-single-crystal film with a thickness of 50 nm is formed over a glass substrate; a sample (Sample 4) where the structure of Sample 1 is subjected to heat treatment for an hour at 250&#xb0; C. under a nitrogen atmosphere; the sample (Sample 3) where the structure of Sample 1 is subjected to heat treatment for an hour at 350&#xb0; C. under a nitrogen atmosphere; a sample (Sample 5) where the structure of Sample 1 is subjected to heat treatment for an hour at 450&#xb0; C. under a nitrogen atmosphere; and a sample (Sample 6) where the structure of Sample 1 is subjected to heat treatment for 10 hours at 350&#xb0; C. under a nitrogen atmosphere. From the results shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, it is found that the higher the heat temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere is, the smaller the amount of impurities such as moisture (H<sub>2</sub>O) discharged from the In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based non-single-crystal film becomes.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0027">In addition, from the graphs of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, two peaks can be confirmed: a first peak in the vicinity of 200&#xb0; C. to 250&#xb0; C., which indicates discharge of impurities such as moisture (H<sub>2</sub>O); and a second peak at 300&#xb0; C. or higher, which indicates discharge of impurities such as moisture (H<sub>2</sub>O).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0028">Note that in the case where the sample which has been subjected to heat treatment at 450&#xb0; C. under a nitrogen atmosphere is left at room temperature in an air atmosphere even for approximately one week, discharge of moisture at 200&#xb0; C. or higher was not observed. Thus, it is found that by performing heat treatment, the In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based non-single-crystal film becomes stable.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0029">Further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows measurement results of carrier concentrations. Conditions of heat temperature in a nitrogen atmosphere were set to 150&#xb0; C., 175&#xb0; C., 200&#xb0; C., 225&#xb0; C., 250&#xb0; C., 275&#xb0; C., 300&#xb0; C., 325&#xb0; C., 350&#xb0; C., 375&#xb0; C., 400&#xb0; C., 425&#xb0; C., and 450&#xb0; C., and a carrier concentration at each temperature was measured.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0030">From the results of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, it is found that there is a relation, at 250&#xb0; C. or higher in TDS measurement, between discharge of impurities such as moisture (H<sub>2</sub>O) from the In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based non-single-crystal film and change in carrier concentration. When the impurities such as moisture (H<sub>2</sub>O) are discharged from the In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based non-single-crystal film, the carrier concentration is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0031">Moreover, H, O, OH, H<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, N, N<sub>2</sub>, and Ar, in addition to H<sub>2</sub>O, were each measured by TDS. The measurement showed that significant peaks of H<sub>2</sub>O, H, O, and OH were observed but peaks of H<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, N, N<sub>2</sub>, and Ar were not observed. As samples of the above measurement, a structure where an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based non-single-crystal film with a thickness of 50 nm was formed over a glass substrate was used. The conditions of heat treatment were set as follows: heat treatment in a nitrogen atmosphere at 250&#xb0; C. for an hour; that in a nitrogen atmosphere at 350&#xb0; C. for an hour; that in a nitrogen atmosphere at 350&#xb0; C. for ten hours; that in an air atmosphere at 350&#xb0; C. for an hour; and that in an air atmosphere at 450&#xb0; C. for an hour. As comparative samples, a structure in which heat treatment was not performed on an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based non-single-crystal film and a structure including only a glass substrate were measured.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0032">According to the above results, it is found that by application of the heat treatment of the In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based non-single-crystal film, mainly moisture is discharged. In other words, the heat treatment causes mainly discharge of moisture (H<sub>2</sub>O) from the In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based non-single-crystal film, and decomposition of water molecules causes discharge of H, O, OH, or the like. Note that hydrogen and OH which are considered to be included in the In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based non-single-crystal film are discharged together by the heat treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0033">In this specification, heat treatment performed under an inert gas atmosphere including nitrogen or an inert gas such as argon or helium or under reduced pressure is referred to as heat treatment for dehydration or dehydrogenation. In this specification, &#x201c;dehydrogenation&#x201d; does not indicate elimination of only H<sub>2 </sub>by heat treatment. For convenience, elimination of H, OH, and the like is referred to as &#x201c;dehydration or dehydrogenation&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0034">Impurities (H<sub>2</sub>O, H, OH, or the like) included in an oxide semiconductor layer are reduced and the carrier concentration is increased by heat treatment performed in an inert gas, and then slow cooling is performed. After the slow cooling, the carrier concentration in the oxide semiconductor layer is reduced by formation of an oxide insulating film in contact with the oxide semiconductor layer or the like, which leads to improvement in reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0035">By heat treatment performed under a nitrogen atmosphere, the resistance of an oxide semiconductor layer is reduced (the carrier concentration is increased, preferably to 1&#xd7;10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>or higher), so that a low-resistance oxide semiconductor layer can be obtained. After that, if an oxide insulating film is formed to be in contact with the low-resistance oxide semiconductor layer, in the low-resistance oxide semiconductor layer, the resistance of at least a region in contact with the oxide insulating film is increased (the carrier concentration is reduced, preferably lower than 1&#xd7;10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>). Thus, a high-resistance oxide semiconductor region can be obtained. During a manufacturing process of a semiconductor device, it is important to increase and decrease the carrier concentration in the oxide semiconductor layer by application of heating in an inert gas atmosphere (or under reduced pressure), slow cooling in an oxygen atmosphere, formation of an oxide insulating film, and the like. In other words, heat treatment for dehydration or dehydrogenation is performed on an oxide semiconductor layer, which results in that the oxide semiconductor layer becomes an oxygen-deficiency type and is turned into an n-type (such as n<sup>&#x2212;</sup> or n<sup>+</sup>-type) oxide semiconductor layer. Then, by formation of an oxide insulating film, the oxide semiconductor layer is in an oxygen-excess state and forms an i-type oxide semiconductor layer. When an oxide insulating film is formed over the In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based non-single-crystal film, the carrier concentration of the oxide insulating was of 1&#xd7;10<sup>14</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>or lower, which is indicated by a dotted line <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In this manner, a semiconductor device including a thin film transistor having high electric characteristics and high reliability can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0036">Note that as the oxide insulating film formed to be in contact with the low-resistance oxide semiconductor layer, an inorganic insulating film which blocks impurities such as moisture, hydrogen ions, and OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup> is used. Specifically, a silicon oxide film or a silicon nitride oxide film is used.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0037">In addition, after the oxide insulating film serving as a protective film is formed to be over and in contact with the low-resistance oxide semiconductor layer, second heat treatment may be performed. In the case where second heat treatment is performed after formation of the oxide insulating film serving as a protective film to be over and in contact with the oxide semiconductor layer, variation in electric characteristics of thin film transistors can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0038">Moisture included in the oxide semiconductor layer can include a variety of forms such as moisture (H<sub>2</sub>O), M-OH, M-H, and the like as well as hydrogen (M denotes a metal atom). An average value or a peak value of the hydrogen concentration which is the absolute quantity is 3&#xd7;10<sup>20 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>or lower, preferably 1&#xd7;10<sup>20 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>or lower.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0039">Such a concentration range can be measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) or on the basis of data of SIMS.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0040">With the above structure, at least one of the above defined objectives can be attained.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0041">The oxide semiconductor used in this specification is, for example, a thin film having a composition expressed by InMO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>m </sub>(m&#x3e;0), and a thin film transistor using the thin film as an oxide semiconductor layer is manufactured. Note that M denotes one metal element or a plurality of metal elements selected from Ga, Fe, Ni, Mn, and Co. For example, M denotes Ga in some cases; meanwhile, M can denote Ni or Fe in addition to Ga (Ga and Ni or Ga and Fe for examples) in other cases. Further, the above oxide semiconductor may include Fe or Ni, another transitional metal element, or an oxide of the transitional metal as an impurity element in addition to the metal element included as M. In this specification, an oxide semiconductor layer whose composition formula is represented as InMO<sub>3 </sub>(ZnO)<sub>m </sub>(m&#x3e;0) where at least Ga is included as M is referred to as an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor, and a thin film thereof is also referred to as an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based non-single-crystal film.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0042">As the oxide semiconductor which is applied to the oxide semiconductor layer, any of the following oxide semiconductors can be applied in addition to the above: an In&#x2014;Sn&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor; an In&#x2014;Al&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor; a Sn&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor; an Al&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor; a Sn&#x2014;Al&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor; an In&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor; an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor; a Sn&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor; an Al&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor; an In&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor; a Sn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor; and a Zn&#x2014;O-based oxide semiconductor. Moreover, silicon oxide may be included in the above oxide semiconductor layer. Addition of silicon oxide (SiO<sub>x </sub>(x&#x3e;0)) which hinders crystallization into the oxide semiconductor layer can suppress crystallization of the oxide semiconductor layer in the case where heat treatment is performed after formation of the oxide semiconductor layer in the manufacturing process. Note that the preferable state of the oxide semiconductor layer is amorphous, but partial crystallization thereof is acceptable.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0043">The oxide semiconductor preferably includes In, further preferably, includes In and Ga. Dehydration or dehydrogenation followed by the formation of an oxide layer in contact with the oxide semiconductor is effective in forming an i-type (intrinsic) oxide semiconductor layer.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0044">Since a thin film transistor is easily broken due to static electricity or the like, a protective circuit for protecting a driver circuit is preferably provided over the same substrate as a gate line or a source line of the driver circuit. The protective circuit is preferably formed with a non-linear element including an oxide semiconductor.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0045">Further, formation of a gate insulating layer and an oxide semiconductor film of a same transistor may be successively performed without exposure to air. Such treatment is also called successive treatment, in-situ step, or successive film formation. Successive formation without exposure to air enables an interface between the gate insulating layer and the oxide semiconductor film to be formed without being contaminated by atmospheric components or contamination impurities floating in the air, such as moisture or hydrocarbon. Thus, variation in characteristics of thin film transistors can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0046">Note that the term &#x201c;successive treatment&#x201d; in this specification means that during the process from a first treatment step performed by a PCVD method or a sputtering method to a second treatment step performed by a PCVD method or a sputtering method, an atmosphere in which a substrate to be processed is disposed is not contaminated by a contaminant atmosphere such as air, and is constantly controlled to be vacuum or an inert-gas atmosphere (a nitrogen atmosphere or a rare gas atmosphere). By the successive treatment, treatment such as film formation can be performed while moisture and the like is prevented from attaching again to the substrate to be processed, substrate which has been previously cleaned.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0047">Performing the process from the first treatment step to the second treatment step in the same chamber is within the scope of the successive treatment in this specification.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0048">Further, the case where the process from the first treatment step to the second treatment is performed in different chambers in the following manner is also within the scope of the successive treatment in this specification: the substrate is transferred after the first treatment step to another chamber without being exposed to air and subjected to the second treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0049">Note that the case where there is the following step between the first treatment step and the second treatment step is also within the scope of the successive treatment in this specification: a substrate transfer step, an alignment step, a slow cooling step, a heating or cooling a substrate step which is for setting the substrate to have temperature suitable to the second film formation step, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0050">However, the following case is not within the scope of the successive treatment in this specification: there is a step in which liquid is used, such as a cleaning step, a wet etching step, or a resist formation step between the first treatment step and the second treatment step.</p>

<p id="p-0082" num="0090">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. However, the present invention is not limited to the description below, and it is easily understood by those skilled in the art that modes and details disclosed herein can be modified in various ways without departing from the spirit and the scope of the present invention. Therefore, the present invention is not construed as being limited to description of the embodiments.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading>
<p id="p-0083" num="0091">A semiconductor device and a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1D</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a top view of a thin film transistor <b>470</b> of a semiconductor device, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a cross-sectional view along line C<b>1</b>-C<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. The thin film transistor <b>470</b> is an inverted staggered thin film transistor and includes, over a substrate <b>400</b> which is a substrate having an insulating surface, a gate electrode layer <b>401</b>, a gate insulating layer <b>402</b>, an oxide semiconductor layer <b>403</b>, and source and drain electrode layers <b>405</b><i>a </i>and <b>405</b><i>b</i>. In addition, an oxide insulating film <b>407</b> is provided to cover the thin film transistor <b>470</b> and to be in contact with the semiconductor layer <b>403</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0093">The oxide semiconductor layer <b>403</b> is subjected to at least heat treatment (heat treatment for dehydration or dehydrogenation) for reducing impurities such as moisture and the like, after formation of the oxide semiconductor film <b>403</b>, so that its resistance is reduced (the carrier concentration is increased, preferably to 1&#xd7;10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>or higher). Then, the oxide insulating film <b>407</b> is formed in contact with the oxide semiconductor layer <b>403</b> while slow cooling is performed under an oxygen atmosphere, which results in that the resistance is increased (the carrier concentration is reduced, preferably lower than 1&#xd7;10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>), so that the oxide semiconductor film can be used as a channel formation region.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0094">After elimination of impurities such as moisture (H<sub>2</sub>O) by application of heat treatment for dehydration or dehydrogenation, it is preferable that slow cooling be performed under an oxygen atmosphere. After the heat treatment for dehydration or dehydrogenation and the slow cooling under an oxygen atmosphere, the carrier concentration of the oxide semiconductor layer is reduced by formation of an oxide insulating film to be in contact with the oxide semiconductor layer or the like, which improves reliability of the thin film transistor <b>470</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0095">Besides impurities such as moisture inside the semiconductor layer <b>403</b>, the heat treatment causes reduction in impurities such as moisture inside the gate insulating layer <b>402</b> and at lower and upper interfaces thereof, and interfaces of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>403</b>, more specifically the interfaces between the oxide semiconductor layer <b>403</b> and the gate insulating layer <b>402</b> and the oxide insulating film <b>407</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0096">The source and drain electrode layers <b>405</b><i>a </i>and <b>405</b><i>b </i>in contact with the oxide semiconductor layer <b>403</b> which is an oxide semiconductor layer are formed using one or more materials selected from titanium, aluminum, manganese, magnesium, zirconium, and beryllium. Further, an alloy film including these elements in combination, and the like, may be stacked.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0097">The oxide semiconductor layer <b>403</b> including a channel formation region may be formed using an oxide material having semiconductor characteristics. Typically, an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based non-single-crystal film is used.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1D</figref> are cross-sectional views illustrating manufacturing steps of the thin film transistor <b>470</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0099">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the gate electrode layer <b>401</b> is provided over the substrate <b>400</b> which is a substrate having an insulating surface. An insulating film serving as a base film may be provided between the substrate <b>400</b> and the gate electrode layer <b>401</b>. The base film may have a function of preventing diffusion of an impurity element from the substrate <b>400</b>, and can be formed to have a single-layer or stacked-layer structure using one or more of a silicon nitride film, a silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride oxide film, and a silicon oxynitride film. The gate electrode layer <b>401</b> can be formed as a single layer or a stacked layers using a metal material such as molybdenum, titanium, chromium, tantalum, tungsten, aluminum, copper, neodymium, or scandium or an alloy material which includes any of these materials as its main component.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0100">For example, as a two-layer structure of each of the gate electrode layer <b>401</b>, the following two-layer structures are preferable: a two-layer structure of an aluminum layer and a molybdenum layer thereover, a two-layer structure of a copper layer and a molybdenum layer thereover, a two-layer structure of a copper layer and a titanium nitride layer or a tantalum nitride layer thereover, and a two-layer structure of a titanium nitride layer and a molybdenum layer. Alternatively, a three-layer structure in which a tungsten layer or a tungsten nitride layer, an aluminum-silicon alloy layer or an aluminum-titanium alloy layer, and a titanium nitride layer or a titanium layer are stacked is preferably used.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0101">The gate insulating layer <b>402</b> is formed over the gate electrode layer <b>401</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0102">The gate insulating layer <b>402</b> can be formed in a single layer or a stacked layer using a silicon oxide layer, a silicon nitride layer, a silicon oxynitride layer, or a silicon nitride oxide layer by a plasma CVD method, a sputtering method, or the like. For example, a silicon oxynitride layer may be formed using a deposition gas containing SiH<sub>4</sub>, oxygen, and nitrogen by a plasma CVD method.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0103">Examples of a sputtering method include an RF sputtering method in which a high-frequency power source is used as a sputtering power source, a DC sputtering method, and a pulsed DC sputtering method in which a bias is applied in a pulsed manner. An RF sputtering method is mainly used in the case of forming an insulating film, and a DC sputtering method is mainly used in the case of forming a metal film.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0104">In addition, there is a multi-source sputtering apparatus in which a plurality of targets of different materials can be set. With the multi-source sputtering apparatus, films of different materials can be deposited to be stacked in the same chamber, and a film of plural kinds of materials can be deposited by electric discharge at the same time in the same chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0105">In addition, there are a sputtering apparatus provided with a magnet system inside the chamber and used for a magnetron sputtering, and a sputtering apparatus used for an ECR sputtering in which plasma generated with the use of microwaves is used without using glow discharge.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0106">Furthermore, as a deposition method by sputtering, there are also a reactive sputtering method in which a target substance and a sputtering gas component are chemically reacted with each other during deposition to form a thin compound film thereof, and a bias sputtering method in which a voltage is also applied to a substrate during deposition.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0107">Next, an oxide semiconductor film is formed over the gate insulating layer <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0108">Note that before the oxide semiconductor film is formed by a sputtering method, particles on a surface of the gate insulating layer <b>402</b> are preferably removed by reverse sputtering in which an argon gas is introduced and plasma is generated. The reverse sputtering refers to a method in which, without application of voltage to a target side, an RF power source is used for application of voltage to a substrate side in an argon atmosphere to generate plasma in the vicinity of the substrate to modify a surface. Note that instead of an argon atmosphere, a nitrogen atmosphere, a helium atmosphere, or the like may be used. Alternatively, an argon atmosphere to which oxygen, N<sub>2</sub>O, or the like is added may be used. Further alternatively, an argon atmosphere to which Cl<sub>2</sub>, CF<sub>4</sub>, or the like is added may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0109">The oxide semiconductor film is formed by a sputtering method with use of an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O based metal oxide semiconductor target. Alternatively, the oxide semiconductor film can be formed by a sputtering method under a rare gas (typically argon) atmosphere, an oxygen atmosphere, or an atmosphere of a rare gas (typically argon) and oxygen.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0110">The gate insulating layer <b>402</b> and the oxide semiconductor film may be formed successively without exposure to air. Successive film formation without exposure to air makes it possible to obtain an interface of stacked layers, which are not contaminated by atmospheric components or impurity elements floating in air, such as moisture or hydrocarbon. Therefore, variation in characteristics of the thin film transistor can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0111">The oxide semiconductor film is processed into an island-shaped oxide semiconductor layer (a first oxide semiconductor layer) by a photolithography step (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0112">Heat treatment is performed on the oxide semiconductor layer in an atmosphere of an inert gas (such as nitrogen, helium, neon, or argon) or under reduced pressure, and then, slow cooling is performed in an oxygen atmosphere (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). By heat treatment performed on the oxide semiconductor layer <b>430</b> in such an atmosphere, impurities included in the oxide semiconductor layer <b>430</b>, such as hydrogen and moisture, can be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0113">Note that in heat treatment, it is preferable that moisture, hydrogen, and the like be not included in nitrogen or a rare gas such as helium, neon, or argon. Alternatively, it is preferable that nitrogen or a rare gas such as helium, neon, or argon introduced into an apparatus for heat treatment have purity of 6N (99.9999%) or more, preferably, 7N (99.99999%) or more; that is, an impurity concentration is set to 1 ppm or lower, preferably, 0.1 ppm or lower.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0114">As heat treatment, an instantaneous heating method can be employed, such as a heating method using an electric furnace, a GRTA (gas rapid thermal annealing) method using a heated gas, or an LRTA (lamp rapid thermal anneal) method using lamp light.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0115">Here, a heating method using an electric furnace <b>601</b> is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> as one mode of heating treatment of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>430</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic view of the electric furnace <b>601</b>. Heaters <b>603</b>, which heat the chamber <b>602</b>, are provided outside a chamber <b>602</b>. Inside the chamber <b>602</b>, a susceptor <b>605</b> in which a substrate <b>604</b> is mounted is provided. The substrate <b>604</b> is transferred into/from the chamber <b>602</b>. In addition, the chamber <b>602</b> is provided with a gas supply means <b>606</b> and an evacuation means <b>607</b>. With the gas supply means <b>606</b>, a gas is introduced into the chamber <b>602</b>. The evacuation means <b>607</b> exhausts the inside of the chamber <b>602</b> or reduces the pressure in the chamber <b>602</b>. Note that the temperature rise characteristics of the electric furnace are preferably set between 0.1&#xb0; C./min and 20&#xb0; C./min. The temperature decrease characteristics of the electric furnace are preferably set between 0.1&#xb0; C./min and 15&#xb0; C./min.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0117">The gas supply means <b>606</b> includes a gas supply source <b>611</b><i>a</i>, a gate supply source <b>611</b><i>b</i>, a pressure adjusting valve <b>612</b><i>a</i>, a pressure adjusting valve <b>612</b><i>b</i>, a refining apparatus <b>613</b><i>a</i>, a refining apparatus <b>613</b><i>b</i>, a mass flow controller <b>614</b><i>a</i>, a mass flow controller <b>614</b><i>b</i>, a stop valve <b>615</b><i>a</i>, and a stop valve <b>615</b><i>b</i>. In this embodiment, it is preferable that the refining apparatus <b>613</b><i>a </i>and the refining apparatus <b>613</b><i>b </i>be provided between the gas supply sources <b>611</b><i>a </i>and <b>611</b><i>b </i>and the chamber <b>602</b>. The refining apparatus <b>613</b><i>a </i>and the refining apparatus <b>613</b><i>b </i>can remove impurities such as moisture and hydrogen in a gas which is introduced from the gas supply source <b>611</b><i>a </i>and the gas supply source <b>611</b><i>b </i>into the chamber <b>602</b>; thus, entry of impurities such as moisture and hydrogen into the chamber <b>602</b> can be suppressed by provision of the refining apparatus <b>613</b><i>a </i>and the refining apparatus <b>613</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0118">In this embodiment, nitrogen or a rare gas is introduced into the chamber <b>602</b> from the gas supply source <b>611</b><i>a</i>, so that the inside of the chamber <b>602</b> is in a nitrogen or a rare gas atmosphere. In the chamber <b>602</b> heated at from 200&#xb0; C. to 600&#xb0; C. inclusive, preferably, from 400&#xb0; C. to 450&#xb0; C. inclusive, the oxide semiconductor layer <b>430</b> formed over the substrate <b>604</b> is heated, whereby the oxide semiconductor layer <b>430</b> can be dehydrated and dehydrogenated.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0119">Alternatively, the chamber <b>602</b> in which the pressure is reduced by the evacuation means is heated at from 200&#xb0; C. to 600&#xb0; C. inclusive, preferably, from 400&#xb0; C. to 450&#xb0; C. inclusive. In such a chamber <b>602</b>, the oxide semiconductor layer <b>430</b> formed over the substrate <b>604</b> is heated, whereby the oxide semiconductor layer <b>430</b> can be dehydrated and dehydrogenated.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0120">Next, introduction of nitrogen or a rare gas from the gas supply source <b>611</b><i>a </i>to the chamber <b>602</b> is stopped and the heaters are turned off. Then, oxygen is introduced from the gas supply source <b>611</b><i>b </i>into the chamber <b>602</b> and the chamber <b>602</b> of a heating apparatus is slowly cooled. That is, the inside of the chamber <b>602</b> is set to an oxygen atmosphere and the substrate <b>604</b> is slowly cooled. Here, it is preferable that the oxygen introduced from the gas supply source <b>611</b><i>b </i>into the chamber <b>602</b> do not include impurities such as moisture and hydrogen. In addition, it is preferable that purity of the oxygen introduced from the gas supply source <b>611</b><i>b </i>into the chamber <b>602</b> be 6N (99.9999%) or lower, preferably 7N (99.99999%) (that is, an impurity concentration in the oxygen is 1 ppm, preferably 0.1 ppm) or lower. The resistance of the oxide semiconductor layer is reduced (the carrier concentration is increased, preferably 1&#xd7;10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>or higher) by heat treatment under an inert gas atmosphere or under reduced pressure and slow cooling under an oxygen atmosphere, so that an oxide semiconductor layer <b>431</b> (a second oxide semiconductor layer) whose resistance is reduced can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0121">As a result, reliability of the thin film transistor formed later can be improved.</p>

<p id="p-0117" num="0125">If the heating apparatus has a multi-chamber structure, heat treatment and cooling treatment can be performed in chambers different from each other.

The oxide insulating film <b>407</b> which is formed to be in contact with the low-resistance oxide semiconductor layer does not include impurities such as moisture and OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup> and is formed using an inorganic insulating film which prevents the impurities from entering from the outside.

<p id="p-0168" num="0176">Next, a third photolithography step is performed to form a resist mask and then unnecessary of the conductive film <b>132</b> portions are etched, so that source and drain electrode layers <b>105</b><i>a </i>and <b>105</b><i>b </i>and a second terminal <b>122</b> are formed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10D</figref>). Wet etching or dry etching is employed as an etching method at this time. For example, when an aluminum film or an aluminum alloy film is used as the conductive film <b>132</b>, wet etching can be performed using a solution in which phosphoric acid, acetic acid, and nitric acid are mixed. Alternatively, the conductive film <b>132</b> may be wet-etched using an ammonia peroxide mixture (hydrogen peroxide:ammonia:water=5:2:2) to form the source and drain electrode layers <b>105</b><i>a </i>and <b>105</b><i>b</i>. In this etching step, an exposed region of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>134</b> is partly etched to form an oxide semiconductor layer <b>135</b>. Therefore, a region of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>135</b>, which lies between the source and drain electrode layers <b>105</b><i>a </i>and <b>105</b><i>b </i>has a small thickness. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10D</figref>, the etching for forming the source and drain electrode layers <b>105</b><i>a </i>and <b>105</b><i>b </i>and the semiconductor layer <b>135</b> is performed at one time by dry etching. Accordingly, end portions of the source and drain electrode layers <b>105</b><i>a </i>and <b>105</b><i>b </i>are aligned with end portions of the semiconductor layer <b>135</b>; thus, continuous structures are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0177">In the third photolithography step, the second terminal <b>122</b> formed from the same material as the source and drain electrode layers <b>105</b><i>a </i>and <b>105</b><i>b </i>is also left in the terminal portion. Note that the second terminal <b>122</b> is electrically connected to a wiring (the wiring can be any of the source and drain electrode layers <b>105</b><i>a </i>and <b>105</b><i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0178">Further, by use of a resist mask having regions with plural thicknesses (typically, two different thicknesses) which is formed using a multi-tone mask, the number of resist masks can be reduced, resulting in simplified process and lower costs.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0179">Then, the resist mask is removed and a protective insulating layer <b>107</b> is formed to cover the gate insulating layer <b>102</b>, the oxide semiconductor layer <b>103</b>, and the source and drain electrode layers <b>105</b><i>a </i>and <b>105</b><i>b</i>. The protective insulating layer <b>107</b> is formed using a silicon oxynitride film formed using a PCVD method. An exposed region of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>135</b> provided between the source and drain electrode layers <b>105</b><i>a </i>and <b>105</b><i>b</i>, and the protective insulating layer <b>107</b> made of the silicon oxynitride film, are provided in contact with each other, so that the resistance of the region in the oxide semiconductor layer <b>135</b>, which is in contact with the protective insulating layer <b>107</b>, is increased (the carrier concentration is reduced, preferably lower than 1&#xd7;10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>), and thus an oxide semiconductor layer <b>103</b> including a channel formation region whose resistance is increased can be formed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0180">After formation of the protective insulating layer <b>107</b>, heat treatment may be performed. The heat treatment may be performed in an air atmosphere or a nitrogen atmosphere at a temperature higher than or equal to 150&#xb0; C. and lower than 350&#xb0; C. When the heat treatment is performed, the oxide semiconductor layer <b>103</b> is heated while being in contact with the protective insulating layer <b>107</b>, which enables further increase in the resistance of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>103</b>. Therefore, electric characteristics of a transistor can be improved and variation in the electric characteristics can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0181">Through the above steps, a thin film transistor <b>170</b> can be manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0182">Next, a fourth photolithography step is performed to form a resist mask. The protective insulating layer <b>107</b> and the gate insulating layer <b>102</b> are etched to form a contact hole <b>125</b> reaching the drain electrode layer <b>105</b><i>b</i>. In addition, a contact hole <b>127</b> reaching the second terminal <b>122</b> and a contact hole <b>126</b> reaching the first terminal <b>121</b> are also formed in the same etching step. A cross-sectional view at this stage is <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0183">Next, the resist mask is removed, and then a transparent conductive film is formed. The transparent conductive film is formed using indium oxide (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), indium tin oxide (abbreviated as ITO), or the like using a sputtering method, a vacuum evaporation method, or the like. Such a material is etched with a hydrochloric acid-based solution. Instead, because a residue tends to be generated particularly in etching of ITO, an alloy of indium oxide and zinc oxide (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;ZnO) may be used as the transparent conductive film in order to improve etching processability.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0184">Next, a fifth photolithography step is performed to form a resist mask. Then, unnecessary portions of the transparent conductive film are etched, so that a pixel electrode layer <b>110</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0185">Through the fifth photolithography step, a storage capacitor is formed with the capacitor wiring <b>108</b> and the pixel electrode layer <b>110</b>, in which the gate insulating layer <b>102</b> and the protective insulating layer <b>107</b> in the capacitor portion are used as dielectrics.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0186">In addition, in the fifth photolithography step, the first terminal <b>121</b> and the second terminal <b>122</b> are covered with the resist mask, and transparent conductive films <b>128</b> and <b>129</b> are left in the terminal portions. The transparent conductive films <b>128</b> and <b>129</b> function as electrodes or wirings connected to an FPC. The transparent conductive film <b>128</b> formed over the first terminal <b>121</b> is a connecting terminal electrode serving as an input terminal of a gate wiring. The transparent conductive film <b>129</b> formed over the second terminal <b>122</b> is a connection terminal electrode which functions as an input terminal of the source wiring.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0187">Subsequently, the resist mask is removed. A cross-sectional view at this stage is <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>. Note that a plan view at this stage corresponds to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0188">Further, FIGS. <b>13</b>A<b>1</b> and <b>13</b>A<b>2</b> are a cross-sectional view of a gate wiring terminal portion at this stage and a plan view thereof, respectively.

In FIG. <b>13</b>A<b>1</b>, a transparent conductive film <b>155</b> formed over a protective insulating layer <b>154</b> is a connection terminal electrode serving as an input terminal.

Moreover, FIG. <b>13</b>B<b>1</b> corresponds to a cross-sectional view taken along F<b>1</b>-F<b>2</b> of FIG. <b>13</b>B<b>2</b>. In FIG. <b>13</b>B<b>1</b>, the transparent conductive film <b>155</b> formed over the protective insulating layer <b>154</b> is a connection terminal electrode serving as an input terminal. Furthermore, in the terminal portion of FIG. <b>13</b>B<b>1</b>, an electrode layer <b>156</b> formed from the same material as the gate wiring is located below and overlapped with a second terminal <b>150</b>, which is electrically connected to the source wiring, with the gate insulating layer <b>102</b> interposed therebetween. The electrode layer <b>156</b> is not electrically connected to the second terminal <b>150</b>, and a capacitor to prevent noise or static electricity can be formed if the potential of the electrode layer <b>156</b> is set to a potential different from that of the second terminal <b>150</b>, such as floating, GND, or 0 V. The second terminal <b>150</b> is electrically connected to the transparent conductive film <b>155</b> through an opening portion of the protective insulating layer <b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0190">A plurality of gate wirings, source wirings, and capacitor wirings are provided depending on the pixel density. Also in the terminal portion, the first terminal at the same potential as the gate wiring, the second terminal at the same potential as the source wiring, the third terminal at the same potential as the capacitor wiring, and the like are each arranged in plurality. The number of each of the terminals may be any number, and the number of the terminals may be determined by a practitioner as appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0191">Through the five photolithography steps described above, the storage capacitor and a pixel thin film transistor portion including the bottom-gate staggered thin film transistor <b>170</b> can be completed using the five photomasks. Then, they are arranged in a matrix corresponding to pixels so that a pixel portion is formed; thus, one substrate for manufacturing an active matrix display device can be formed. In this specification, such a substrate is referred to as an active matrix substrate for convenience.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0192">In the case of manufacturing an active matrix liquid crystal display device, an active matrix substrate and a counter substrate provided with a counter electrode are bonded together with a liquid crystal layer interposed therebetween. Note that a common electrode electrically connected to the counter electrode of the counter substrate is provided over the active matrix substrate, and a fourth terminal electrically connected to the common electrode is provided in the terminal portion. The fourth terminal is provided so that the common electrode is set to a fixed potential such as GND or 0 V.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0193">In addition, a pixel electrode may overlap with a gate wiring of an adjacent pixel with the protective insulating layer and the gate insulating layer interposed therebetween to form a storage capacitor without a capacitor wiring.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0194">In an active matrix liquid crystal display device, pixel electrodes arranged in a matrix are driven to form a display pattern on a screen. Specifically, voltage is applied between a selected pixel electrode and a counter electrode corresponding to the pixel electrode, so that a liquid crystal layer provided between the pixel electrode and the counter electrode is optically modulated and this optical modulation is recognized as a display pattern by an observer.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0195">In displaying moving images, a liquid crystal display device has a problem that a long response time of liquid crystal molecules themselves causes afterimages or blurring of moving images. In order to improve the moving-image characteristics of a liquid crystal display device, a driving method called black insertion is employed in which black is displayed on the whole screen in each frame period.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0196">Alternatively, a driving method called double-frame rate driving may be employed in which a vertical synchronizing frequency is 1.5 times or 2 times or more as high as a usual vertical synchronizing frequency to improve the moving-image characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0197">Further alternatively, in order to improve the moving-image characteristics of a liquid crystal display device, a driving method may be employed, in which a plurality of LEDs (light-emitting diodes) or a plurality of EL light sources are used to form a surface light source as a backlight, and each light source of the surface light source is independently driven in a pulsed manner in one frame period. As the surface light source, three or more kinds of LEDs may be used and an LED emitting white light may be used. Since a plurality of LEDs can be controlled independently, the light emission timing of LEDs can be synchronized with the timing at which a liquid crystal layer is optically modulated. According to this driving method, LEDs can be partly turned off; therefore, an effect of reducing power consumption can be obtained particularly in the case of displaying an image having a large part on which black is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0198">By combining these driving methods, the display characteristics of a liquid crystal display device, such as moving-image characteristics, can be improved as compared to those of conventional liquid crystal display devices.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0199">The n-channel transistor disclosed in this specification includes an oxide semiconductor film which is used for a channel formation region and has excellent dynamic characteristics; thus, it can be combined with these driving methods.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0200">In manufacturing a light-emitting display device, one electrode (also referred to as a cathode) of an organic light-emitting element is set to a low power supply potential such as GND or 0 V; thus, a terminal portion is provided with a fourth terminal for setting the cathode to a low power supply potential such as GND or 0 V. Also in manufacturing a light-emitting display device, a power supply line is provided in addition to a source wiring and a gate wiring. Accordingly, the terminal portion is provided with a fifth terminal electrically connected to the power supply line.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0201">Use of an oxide semiconductor for a thin film transistor leads to reduction in manufacturing cost. In particular, since impurities such as moisture or the like are reduced to increase purity of an oxide semiconductor film by heat treatment for dehydration or dehydrogenation, a semiconductor device including a highly reliable thin film transistor with excellent electric characteristics can be manufactured without using a special sputtering apparatus in which the dew point of a deposition chamber is lowered or an ultra-high purity metal oxide target.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0202">The channel formation region in the oxide semiconductor layer is a highly-resistant region; thus, electric characteristics of the thin film transistor are stabilized and increase in off current can be prevented. Thus, a semiconductor device including a highly reliable thin film transistor having excellent electric characteristics can be provided.</p>

Additionally, the scan line driver circuit may include a level shifter, a buffer, and the like in some cases. In the scan line driver circuit, when the clock signal (CLK) and the start pulse signal (SP) are input to the shift register, a selection signal is generated. The generated selection signal is buffered and amplified by the buffer, and the resulting signal is supplied to a corresponding scan line. Gate electrodes of transistors in pixels of one line are connected to the scan line. Since the transistors in the pixels of one line have to be turned on all at once, a buffer which can supply a large current is used.</p>

<p id="p-0232" num="0240">Moreover, the signal-line driver circuit and the scanning-line driver circuit can be manufactured using only the n-channel TFTs described in any of Embodiments 1 to 3. The n-channel TFT described in any of Embodiments 1 to 3 has a high mobility, and thus a driving frequency of a driver circuit can be made high. Further, in the case of the n-channel TFT described in any of Embodiments 1 to 3, since parasitic capacitance is reduced, frequency characteristics (also referred to as f characteristics) are excellent. For example, a scan line driver circuit using the n-channel TFT described in any of Embodiments 1 to 3 can operate at high speed, and thus a frame frequency can be increased and insertion of black images and the like can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0241">In addition, when the channel width of the transistor in the scan line driver circuit is increased or a plurality of scan line driver circuits are provided, for example, higher frame frequency can be realized. When a plurality of scan line driver circuits are provided, a scan line driver circuit for driving scan lines of even-numbered rows is provided on one side and a scan line driver circuit for driving scan lines of odd-numbered rows is provided on the opposite side; thus, an increase in frame frequency can be realized. Furthermore, the use of the plurality of scan line driver circuits for output of signals to the same scan line is advantageous in increasing the size of a display device.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0242">Further, when an active matrix light-emitting display device which is an example of a semiconductor device is manufactured, a plurality of thin film transistors are arranged in at least one pixel, and it is preferable to provide a plurality of scan line driver circuits. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref> is an example of a block diagram of an active matrix light-emitting display device.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0243">The light-emitting display device illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref> includes, over a substrate <b>5400</b>, a pixel portion <b>5401</b> including a plurality of pixels each provided with a display element; a first scan line driver circuit <b>5402</b> and a second scan line driver circuit <b>5404</b>, one of which input a signal in a scan line in contact with a given pixel; and a signal line driver circuit <b>5403</b> that controls a video signal input to a signal line in contact with the given pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0244">In the case of inputting a digital video signal to the pixel of the light-emitting display device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>, the pixel is put in a light-emitting state or non-light-emitting state by switching on/off of the transistor of the pixel. Thus, grayscale can be displayed using an area grayscale method or a time grayscale method. An area grayscale method refers to a driving method in which one pixel is divided into a plurality of subpixels and the respective subpixels are driven independently based on video signals so that grayscale is displayed. Further, a time grayscale method refers to a driving method in which a period during which a pixel emits light is controlled so that grayscale is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0245">Since the response speed of a light-emitting element is higher than that of a liquid crystal element or the like, the light-emitting element is more suitable for a time grayscale method than the liquid crystal element. Specifically, in the case of displaying with a time grayscale method, one frame period is divided into a plurality of subframe periods. Then, in accordance with video signals, the light-emitting element in the pixel is brought into a light-emitting state or a non-light-emitting state in each subframe period. By dividing one frame period into a plurality of subframe periods, the total length of time, in which a pixel actually emits light in one frame period, can be controlled by video signals so that grayscale can be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0246">Note that in the light-emitting display device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>, in the case where one pixel includes two switching TFTs, a signal which is inputted to a first scanning line serving as a gate wiring of one of the switching TFTs is generated from the first scanning-line driver circuit <b>5402</b> and a signal which is inputted to a second scanning line serving as a gate wiring of the other of the switching TFTs is generated from the second scanning-line driver circuit <b>5404</b>. However, the signal which is inputted to the first scanning line and the signal which is inputted to the second scanning line may be generated together from one scanning-line driver circuit. In addition, for example, there is a possibility that a plurality of scan lines used for controlling the operation of the switching element are provided in each pixel, depending on the number of the switching TFTs included in one pixel. In this case, one scan line driver circuit may generate all signals that are input to the plurality of scan lines, or a plurality of scan line driver circuits may generate signals that are input to the plurality of scan lines.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0247">Also in the light-emitting display device, a part of a driver circuit that can include n-channel TFTs among driver circuits can be formed over the same substrate as the thin film transistors of the pixel portion. Moreover, the signal-line driver circuit and the scanning-line driver circuit can be manufactured using only the n-channel TFTs described in any of Embodiments 1 to 3.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0248">Moreover, the above-described driver circuit can be used for an electronic paper that drives electronic ink using an element electrically connected to a switching element, without being limited to applications to a liquid crystal display device or a light-emitting display device. The electronic paper is also referred to as an electrophoretic display device (an electrophoretic display) and is advantageous in that it has the same level of readability as plain paper, it has lower power consumption than other display devices, and it can be made thin and lightweight.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0249">Electrophoretic displays can have various modes. However, electrophoretic displays contain a plurality of microcapsules dispersed in a solvent or a solute, each microcapsule containing first particles which are positively charged and second particles which are negatively charged. By applying an electric field to the microcapsules, the particles in the microcapsules move in directions opposite to each other and only the color of the particles gathering on one side is displayed. Note that the first particles and the second particles each contain pigment and do not move without an electric field. Moreover, the first particles and the second particles have different colors (which may be colorless).</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0250">Thus, an electrophoretic display is a display that utilizes a so-called dielectrophoretic effect by which a substance having a high dielectric constant moves to a high-electric field region. An electrophoretic display does not need to use a polarizer substrate, which is required in a liquid crystal display device; therefore, the weight of the electrophoretic display device is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0251">A solution in which the above microcapsules are dispersed in a solvent is referred to as electronic ink. This electronic ink can be printed on a surface of glass, plastic, cloth, paper, or the like. Furthermore, by using a color filter or particles that have a pigment, color display can also be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0252">In addition, if a plurality of the above microcapsules are arranged as appropriate over an active matrix substrate so as to be interposed between two electrodes, an active matrix display device can be completed, and display can be performed by application of an electric field to the microcapsules. For example, the active matrix substrate obtained using the thin film transistor of any of Embodiments 1 to 3 can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0253">Note that the first particles and the second particles in the microcapsules may each be formed of a single material selected from a conductive material, an insulating material, a semiconductor material, a magnetic material, a liquid crystal material, a ferroelectric material, an electroluminescent material, an electrochromic material, and a magnetophoretic material, or formed of a composite material of any of these.</p>

The liquid crystal composition which includes a liquid crystal showing a blue phase and a chiral agent has a short response time of 1 msec or less, and has optical isotropy, which makes the alignment process unneeded and allows a small viewing angle dependence.</p>

<heading id="h-0015" level="1">Embodiment 6</heading>
<p id="p-0282" num="0290">An example of electronic paper will be described as a semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0291">The thin film transistor described in any of Embodiment 1 to 3 may be used for electronic paper in which electronic ink is driven by an element electrically connected to a switching element. The electronic paper is also called an electrophoretic display device (electrophoretic display) and has advantages in that it has the same level of readability as regular paper, it has less power consumption than other display devices, and it is thin and light.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0292">Electrophoretic displays can have various modes. Electrophoretic displays contain a plurality of microcapsules dispersed in a solvent or a solute, each microcapsule containing first particles which are positively charged and second particles which are negatively charged. By applying an electric field to the microcapsules, the particles in the microcapsules are moved in opposite directions to each other and only the color of the particles concentrated on one side is exhibited. Note that the first particles and the second particles each contain pigment and do not move without an electric field. Moreover, the first particles and the second particles have different colors (which may be colorless).</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0293">Thus, an electrophoretic display is a display that utilizes a so-called dielectrophoretic effect by which a substance having a high dielectric constant moves to a high-electric field region.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0294">A solution in which the above microcapsules are dispersed in a solvent is referred to as electronic ink. This electronic ink can be printed on a surface of glass, plastic, cloth, paper, or the like. Furthermore, by using a color filter or particles that have a pigment, color display can also be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0295">In addition, if a plurality of the aforementioned microcapsules are arranged as appropriate over an active matrix substrate so as to be interposed between two electrodes, an active matrix display device can be completed, and display can be performed by application of an electric field to the microcapsules. For example, the active matrix substrate obtained using the thin film transistor of any of Embodiments 1 to 3 can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0296">Note that the first particles and the second particles in the microcapsules may each be formed of a single material selected from a conductive material, an insulating material, a semiconductor material, a magnetic material, a liquid crystal material, a ferroelectric material, an electroluminescent material, an electrochromic material, and a magnetophoretic material, or formed of a composite material of any of these.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0297"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates active matrix electronic paper as an example of the semiconductor device. A thin film transistor <b>581</b> used for the semiconductor device can be formed in a manner similar to the thin film transistor described in Embodiment 1, which is a highly reliable thin film transistor including an oxide semiconductor layer. The thin film transistor described in Embodiment 2 or Embodiment 3 can also be used as the thin film transistor <b>581</b> of this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0298">The electronic paper in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is an example of a display device using a twisting ball display system. The twisting ball display system refers to a method in which spherical particles each colored in black and white are arranged between a first electrode layer and a second electrode layer, and a potential difference is generated between the first electrode layer and the second electrode layer to control orientation of the spherical particles, so that display is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0299">The thin film transistor <b>581</b> is a bottom gate thin film transistor and is covered with an insulating film <b>583</b> which is in contact with an oxide semiconductor layer. A source electrode layer or a drain electrode layer of the thin film transistor <b>581</b> is in contact with a first electrode layer <b>587</b> in an opening portion formed in an insulating layer <b>585</b>, whereby the thin film transistor <b>581</b> is electrically connected to the first electrode layer <b>587</b>. Between the first electrode layer <b>587</b> and a second electrode layer <b>588</b>, spherical particles <b>589</b> are provided. Each spherical particle <b>589</b> includes a black region <b>590</b><i>a </i>and a white region <b>590</b><i>b</i>, and a cavity <b>594</b> filled with liquid around the black region <b>590</b><i>a </i>and the white region <b>590</b><i>b</i>. The spherical particles <b>589</b> are surrounded by filler <b>595</b> such as a resin. The first electrode layer <b>587</b> corresponds to a pixel electrode, and the second electrode layer <b>588</b> corresponds to a common electrode. The second electrode layer <b>588</b> is electrically connected to a common potential line provided over the same substrate <b>580</b> as the thin film transistor <b>581</b>. With the use of a common connection portion, the second electrode layer <b>588</b> can be electrically connected to the common potential line via conductive particles provided between the substrates <b>580</b> and a substrate <b>596</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0300">Further, instead of the twisting ball, an electrophoretic element can also be used. A microcapsule having a diameter of about 10 &#x3bc;m to 200 &#x3bc;m in which transparent liquid, positively charged white microparticles, and negatively charged black microparticles are encapsulated, is used. In the microcapsule which is provided between the first electrode layer and the second electrode layer, when an electric field is applied by the first electrode layer and the second electrode layer, the white microparticles and the black microparticles move to opposite sides, so that white or black can be displayed. For this reason, an electrophoretic display device is usually designated as &#x201c;electronic paper&#x201d;. The electrophoretic display element has higher reflectance than a liquid crystal display element, and thus, an auxiliary light is unnecessary, power consumption is low, and a display portion can be recognized in a dim place. Further, even when power is not supplied to the display portion, an image which has been displayed once can be maintained. Accordingly, a displayed image can be stored even if a semiconductor device having a display function (which may simply be referred to as a display device or a semiconductor device provided with a display device) is distanced from an electric power source.</p>

<p id="p-0295" num="0303">An example of a light-emitting display device will be described as a semiconductor device. As a display element included in a display device, a light-emitting element utilizing electroluminescence is described here. Light-emitting elements utilizing electroluminescence are classified according to whether a light-emitting material is an organic compound or an inorganic compound. In general, the former is referred to as an organic EL element, and the latter is referred to as an inorganic EL element.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0304">In an organic EL element, by application of voltage to a light-emitting element, electrons and holes are separately injected from a pair of electrodes into a layer containing a light-emitting organic compound, and current flows. The carriers (electrons and holes) are recombined, and thus, the light-emitting organic compound is excited. The light-emitting organic compound returns to a ground state from the excited state, thereby emitting light. Owing to such a mechanism, this light-emitting element is referred to as a current-excitation light-emitting element.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0305">The inorganic EL elements are classified according to their element structures into a dispersion-type inorganic EL element and a thin-film inorganic EL element. A dispersion-type inorganic EL element has a light-emitting layer where particles of a light-emitting material are dispersed in a binder, and its light emission mechanism is donor-acceptor recombination type light emission that utilizes a donor level and an acceptor level. A thin-film inorganic EL element has a structure where a light-emitting layer is sandwiched between dielectric layers, which are further sandwiched between electrodes, and its light emission mechanism is localized type light emission that utilizes inner-shell electron transition of metal ions. Note that an example of an organic EL element as a light-emitting element is described here.</p>

<p id="p-0301" num="0309">The second electrode (common electrode <b>6408</b>) of the light-emitting element <b>6404</b> is set to a low power supply potential. Note that the low power supply potential is a potential satisfying the low power supply potential&#x3c;a high power supply potential with reference to the high power supply potential that is set to the power supply line <b>6407</b>. As the low power supply potential, GND, 0 V, or the like may be employed, for example. A potential difference between the high power supply potential and the low power supply potential is applied to the light-emitting element <b>6404</b> and current is supplied to the light-emitting element <b>6404</b>, so that the light-emitting element <b>6404</b> emits light. Here, in order to make the light-emitting element <b>6404</b> emit light, each potential is set so that the potential difference between the high power supply potential and the low power supply potential is a forward threshold voltage or higher of the light-emitting element <b>6404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0310">Note that gate capacitor of the driver transistor <b>6402</b> may be used as a substitute for the capacitor <b>6403</b>, so that the capacitor <b>6403</b> can be omitted.

<p id="p-0390" num="0398">As in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34A</figref>, a gate electrode layer <b>1401</b> is formed over a substrate <b>1400</b>. Next, an oxide semiconductor layer is formed over a gate insulating layer <b>1402</b> covering the gate electrode layer <b>1401</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0392" num="0400">Just after deposition of an oxide semiconductor film or after patterning of the oxide semiconductor film, dehydration or dehydrogenation is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0393" num="0401">In order to perform dehydration or dehydrogenation, heat treatment is performed under an atmosphere of an inert gas (nitrogen, helium, neon, argon or the like) or under reduced pressure and then slow cooling is performed under an oxygen atmosphere. The heat treatment is performed at 200&#xb0; C. to 600&#xb0; C. inclusive, preferably 400&#xb0; C. to 450&#xb0; C. inclusive.

<p id="p-0394" num="0402">Next, a channel protective layer <b>1418</b> is formed in contact with the oxide semiconductor layer <b>1403</b>.

<p id="p-0395" num="0403">In addition, after the dehydration or dehydrogenation, the channel protective layer <b>1418</b> can be formed successively without exposure to the air. Successive process without exposure to air makes it possible to obtain each interface between stacked layers, which is not contaminated by atmospheric components or impurity elements floating in air, such as moisture, hydrocarbon, or the like.

<p id="p-0397" num="0405">The channel protective layer <b>1418</b> can be formed using an inorganic material including oxygen (such as silicon oxide, silicon nitride oxide, or silicon oxynitride).

The same portion as or a portion having function similar to those described in Embodiment 1 can be formed and manufacturing steps for forming those portions can be performed in a manner similar to that described in Embodiment 1; therefore, repetitive description is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0417" num="0425">In this embodiment, after patterning of a first oxide semiconductor layer, heat treatment is performed under an atmosphere of an inert gas (nitrogen, helium, neon, argon, or the like) or under reduced pressure, and then slow cooling is performed under an oxygen atmosphere. By subjecting the first oxide semiconductor layer to the heat treatment under the atmosphere, impurities such as hydrogen and moisture in an oxide semiconductor layer <b>403</b> can be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0418" num="0426">Next, a second oxide semiconductor film used for forming source and drain regions (also referred to as n<sup>+</sup> layers or buffer layers) of a thin film transistor is formed over the first oxide semiconductor layer and then a conductive film is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0419" num="0427">Then, the first oxide semiconductor layer, the second oxide semiconductor film, and the conductive film are selectively etched through an etching step to form the oxide semiconductor layer <b>403</b>, source and drain regions <b>404</b><i>a </i>and <b>404</b><i>b</i>, and source and drain electrode layers <b>405</b><i>a </i>and <b>405</b><i>b</i>. Note that the oxide semiconductor layer <b>403</b> is partly etched to have a groove portion (a recessed portion).</p>
<p id="p-0420" num="0428">Next, a silicon oxide film as an oxide insulating film <b>407</b> is formed in contact with the oxide semiconductor layer <b>403</b>, using a sputtering method or a PCVD method. As the oxide insulating film <b>407</b> formed so as to be in contact with the low-resistance oxide semiconductor layer, an inorganic insulating film which does not include impurities such as moisture, hydrogen ions, oxygen ions, or OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, and blocks their entry from the outside. Specifically, a silicon oxide film or a silicon nitride oxide film is used.</p>
<p id="p-0421" num="0429">When the oxide insulating film <b>407</b> is formed in contact with the low-resistance oxide semiconductor layer <b>403</b>, using a sputtering method or a PCVD method, or the like, the resistance of at least a region in contact with the oxide insulating film <b>407</b>, which is in the low-resistance oxide semiconductor layer <b>403</b>, is increased (the carrier concentration is reduced, preferably lower than 1&#xd7;10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, more preferably lower than or equal to 1&#xd7;10<sup>14</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>) so that the region becomes a high-resistance oxide semiconductor region. When the oxide insulating film <b>407</b> is formed in contact with the oxide semiconductor layer <b>403</b>, the high-resistance oxide semiconductor region is obtained. Thus, the thin film transistor <b>470</b> can be manufactured (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0422" num="0430">In the structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based non single crystal is used for the source and drain regions <b>404</b><i>a </i>and <b>404</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0423" num="0431">In addition, the source region is provided between the oxide semiconductor layer <b>403</b> and the source electrode layer, and the drain region is provided between the oxide semiconductor layer and the drain electrode layer. As the source and drain regions, an oxide semiconductor layer exhibiting an n-type conductivity is used.</p>
<p id="p-0424" num="0432">In addition, the second oxide semiconductor layer used for the source and drain regions <b>404</b><i>a </i>and <b>404</b><i>b </i>of a thin film transistor <b>473</b> is preferably thinner than the oxide semiconductor layer <b>403</b> used for a channel formation region and preferably has higher conductivity (electrical conductivity) than the oxide semiconductor layer <b>403</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0425" num="0433">Further, the oxide semiconductor layer <b>403</b> used for the channel formation region has an amorphous structure and the second oxide semiconductor layer used for the source and drain regions includes a crystal grain (nanocrystal) in an amorphous structure in some cases. The crystal grain (nanocrystal) in the second oxide semiconductor layer used for the source region and the drain region has a diameter of 1 nm to 10 nm, typically about 2 nm to 4 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0426" num="0434">Further, after the oxide insulating film <b>407</b> is formed, the thin film transistor <b>473</b> may be subjected to heat treatment (preferably at a temperature higher than or equal to 150&#xb0; C. and lower than 350&#xb0; C.) under a nitrogen atmosphere or an air atmosphere (in the air). For example, the heat treatment is performed under a nitrogen atmosphere at 250&#xb0; C. for one hour. When the heat treatment is performed, the oxide semiconductor layer <b>403</b> is heated while being in contact with the oxide insulating film <b>407</b>, which enables reduction in variation in electric characteristics of the thin film transistor <b>473</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0427" num="0435">This embodiment can be implemented in appropriate combination with any of the structures described in the other embodiments.</p>
<heading id="h-0025" level="1">EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<p id="p-0428" num="0436">In this example, in an oxide semiconductor layer including a region having high oxygen concentration and a region having low oxygen concentration, the simulation result thereof in change of the oxygen concentration before and after heat treatment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>. As software for the simulation, Materials Explorer 5.0 manufactured by Fujitsu Limited was used.</p>
<p id="p-0429" num="0437"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref> illustrates a model of an oxide semiconductor layer which was used for the simulation. Here, a structure in which a low oxygen concentration layer <b>703</b> and a high oxygen concentration layer <b>705</b> were stacked was employed for an oxide semiconductor layer <b>701</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0430" num="0438">For the low oxygen concentration layer <b>703</b>, an amorphous structure was employed in which the numbers of In atoms, Ga atoms, and Zn atoms were each 15 and the number of O atoms was 54.</p>
<p id="p-0431" num="0439">In addition, for the high oxygen concentration layer <b>705</b>, an amorphous structure was employed in which the numbers of In atoms, Ga atoms, and Zn atoms were each 15 and the number of O atoms was 66.</p>
<p id="p-0432" num="0440">Moreover, the density of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>701</b> was set at 5.9 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0433" num="0441">Next, the classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed on the oxide semiconductor layer <b>701</b> to calculate the variations of oxygen concentration under conditions of NVT ensemble and a temperature of 250&#xb0; C. The time step was set at 0.2 fs, and the total simulation time was set at 200 ps. In addition, Born-Mayer-Huggins potential was used for the potentials of metal-oxygen bonding and oxygen-oxygen bonding. Moreover, movement of atoms at an upper end portion and a lower end portion of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>701</b> was fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0434" num="0442">Then, the simulation result is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>. In z-axis coordinates, the range of 0 nm to 1.15 nm indicates the low oxygen concentration layer <b>703</b>, and the range of 1.15 nm to 2.3 nm indicates the high oxygen concentration layer <b>705</b>. The distribution of oxygen densities before the MD simulation is indicated by a solid line <b>707</b>, and the distribution of oxygen densities after the MD simulation is indicated by a dashed line <b>709</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0435" num="0443">The solid line <b>707</b> shows that oxygen densities are higher above the interface separating the low oxygen concentration layer <b>703</b> from the high oxygen concentration layer <b>705</b> and in the high oxygen concentration layer <b>705</b>. On the other hand, the dashed line <b>709</b> shows that the oxygen densities are uniform throughout the low oxygen concentration layer <b>703</b> and the high oxygen concentration layer <b>705</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0436" num="0444">As described above, when there is non-uniformity in the distribution of oxygen concentrations as in the stack of the low oxygen concentration layer <b>703</b> and the high oxygen concentration layer <b>705</b>, it is found that the oxygen diffuses from where an oxygen concentration is higher to where an oxygen density is lower by heat treatment and thus the oxygen concentrations becomes uniform.</p>
<p id="p-0437" num="0445">That is, as described in Embodiment 1, since the oxygen concentration at the interface between the oxide semiconductor layer <b>431</b> and the oxide insulating film <b>407</b> is increased by formation of the oxide insulating film <b>407</b> over the oxide semiconductor layer <b>431</b>, the oxygen diffuses into the oxide semiconductor layer <b>431</b> where the oxygen concentration is low and thus the resistance of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>431</b> is increased. Further, in Embodiment 1, after the oxide semiconductor layer is heated in an atmosphere of an inert gas (nitrogen, helium, neon, argon, or the like) or under reduced pressure, the oxide semiconductor layer is slowly cooled under an oxygen atmosphere, and then the oxide insulating film <b>407</b> is formed, whereby the oxygen concentration of a surface of the oxide semiconductor layer can be increased. Thus, the oxygen diffuses into the oxide semiconductor layer <b>431</b> where the oxygen concentration is low and thus the resistance of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>431</b> is increased. As described above, reliability of a thin film transistor can be improved.</p>
