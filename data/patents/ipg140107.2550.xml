<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is the U.S. National Phase filing under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;371 of PCT/JP2009/004765, filed Sep. 18, 2009, which designated the United States and was published in a language other than English, which claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a)-(d) to Japanese Patent Application No. 2008-243095, filed Sep. 22, 2008. The contents of these applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an iron chelating agent, for example, an iron chelating agent capable of chelating non-transferrin-bound iron, a method for determining the amount of iron ions and a method for trapping iron ions.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Recently, a new disease concept called Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) has been identified and has attracted worldwide attention. Chronic Kidney Disease is treated by the use of angiotensin II inhibitors, by diet control by means of rice with low protein content, and by the control of various risk factors. However, 40,000 people undergo dialysis annually, which carries a risk of death as a consequence of cardiovascular disturbance complications, and accordingly there is a demand for a new treatment method. As a treatment method for chronic kidney disease, a method of removing non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI), and a carbonyl compound that are the main causes of chronic kidney disease is effective.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As a treatment methods of removing iron from a living body (in particular, non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI)), there are (1) phlebotomy, (2) an iron-limiting diet, (3) medical therapy using an iron chelating agent, and (4) extracorporeal circulating and cleaning therapy. Phlebotomy is good in terms of patient Quality of Life (QOL), but results in side effects such as anemia or hypoproteinemia and can only be applied to patients who do not suffer from anemia. The iron-limiting diet results in side effects such as nutrition imbalance and can only be applied to some hepatic diseases. The medical therapy using an iron chelating agent has a pronounced iron chelating effect and is mainly used with patients who have an iron overload disorder after a blood transfusion. However, it is said that in iron-related organ disorders resulting from a mild iron overload disorder or an iron metabolism disorder, side effects caused by over-chelating occur with high frequency. Further, extracorporeal circulating and cleaning therapy is a method of removing iron (iron ions) by extracorporeal circulation of blood and has a property of enabling the treatment of unstable iron having toxicity in a living body without causing organ toxicity by over-chelating.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As a result, a method of removing non-transferrin-bound iron by extracorporeal circulation and cleaning therapy has been studied. There is a demand for the development of a ligand (iron chelating agent) which specifically and effectively adsorbs non-transferrin-bound iron. In particular, there is a demand for the development of an iron chelating agent capable of trapping only non-transferrin-bound iron without having chelating ability with respect to transferrin-bound iron which is useful for a living body (that is, without trapping transferrin-bound iron).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, when chronic kidney disease enters stage 4, load is applied on the remaining nephrons due to the increased number of failed nephrons and thus more nephrons fail; dialysis must be introduced as a result of falling into this vicious circle. On the other hand, in stage 3, the risk of cardiovascular pathology is markedly increased. The dialysis treatment needs be carried out three times per week, and the time required to perform the dialysis is 4 hours and thus the QOL of a patient is decreased, as well as causing the loss of the chance to work. Therefore, as long as treatment is carried out in stage 3, introduction of dialysis and cardiovascular disturbance complications can be prevented, which can lead to a reduction in high medical expenses (it is said that dialysis expenses may exceed 1.2 trillion yen in Japan).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Meanwhile, various proposals have been made in regard to an iron chelating agent capable of chelating iron ions (for example, see Patent Literature 1 to 8).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, there is a problem in that, in a method of determining the amount of non-transferrin-bound iron using high-performance liquid chromatography, NTBI values in the blood of healthy persons are often represented as negative values and this leads to a lack of reliability. It is thought that, by clarifying and ameliorating the problems of the NTBI measuring system using HPLC, a stable and highly sensitive NTBI measuring system could be constructed and that, as a result, NTBI values in the blood of healthy persons could be precisely determined.</p>

<p id="p-0041" num="0047">[Iron Chelating Agent]</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0048">The iron chelating agent of the present invention is a compound represented by formula (1). The compound represented by formula (1) bonds a hydroxyl group (&#x2014;OH group) and an amino acid residue-alkylene group (&#x2014;R<sup>1</sup>&#x2014;NR<sup>2</sup>&#x2014;CHR<sup>3</sup>&#x2014;COOH group) to adjacent carbon atoms in ring Z. In other words, the iron chelating agent of the present invention has a structure (tripod type) where a hydroxyl group and an amino acid residue-alkylene group are bonded to carbon atoms of ring Z in a position relationship at the ortho position.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0049">For example, the inventors of the present invention carried out various studies in which the chelating agent of Patent Document 1 also had a predetermined structure (a tripod type structure) at the ortho position to a hydroxyl group of phenol, and as a result, the inventors found that the chelating agent according to the present invention bonds the predetermined substituent containing an amino acid residue-alkylene group at the ortho position to the hydroxyl group, and thereby can selectively trap only non-transferrin-bound iron without trapping transferrin-bound iron.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0050">As for the chelating agent according to the present invention, a substituent at the ortho position to a hydroxyl group of a phenol-based chelating agent has a (&#x2014;R<sup>1</sup>&#x2014;NR<sup>2</sup>&#x2014;CHR<sup>3</sup>&#x2014;COOH) structure and the number of coordinated atoms coordinatable to iron ions in the substituent is 3 to 4. The inventors found that non-transferrin-bound iron can be selectively trapped in the phenol-based chelating agent and that when the coordination number in the substituent at the ortho position to a hydroxyl group is 3 to 4, selectivity can be increased at the time when the iron ions combine with a coordinatable hydroxyl group and trap the non-transferrin-bound iron. In other words, the iron chelating agent of the present invention is a four-coordinated ligand that has a total coordination number of 4 or a five-coordinated ligand that has a total coordination number of 5.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0051">In the substituent, N of an amino acid residue and O of a carboxyl group are coordinated atoms of iron ions and one or two coordinated atoms are suitably provided in a group represented by R<sup>2 </sup>and R<sup>3 </sup>in the substituent. Therefore, a chelating agent that selectively traps non-transferrin-bound iron can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0052">When the group represented by R<sup>2 </sup>and R<sup>3</sup>, as described above, is a combination with a total coordination number of 1 to 2, it can be suitably selected and used from a group consisting of a hydrogen atom, hydrocarbon and a group having chelating ability.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0053">As the group containing R<sup>2</sup>, it is preferable that an amino acid residue containing N is used, whereby N becomes a preferable coordinated atom in relation to iron ions. Further, by selecting, as the amino acid residue, one corresponding to an amino acid forming protein in a living body, toxicity generated upon application to the human body can be suppressed to be extremely low. Therefore, a chelating agent having extremely high safety in respect to the human body can be provided. Further, as a group represented by R<sup>1</sup>, an alkylene group having no coordinated atom for iron ions is preferably used. At this time, when the alkylene group has approximately 1 to 10 carbon atoms, non-transferrin-bound iron can be selectively chelated. As for the size of an alkylene group represented by R<sup>1</sup>, it has been clarified by the studies of the present inventors that in particular the nitrogen of the amino acid residue connected to R1 affects the degree of coordinated force shown with respect to iron ions. In particular, in order to increase the selectivity of non-transferrin-bound iron, it is preferable to have approximately 1 to 4 carbon atoms, in particular, the selectivity of non-transferrin-bound iron can be increased by using a methylene group.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0054">According to the chelating agent of the present invention which is formed as described above, by disposing a suitable number of coordinated atoms at suitable positions in the chelating agent for trapping non-transferrin-bound iron, the non-transferrin-bound iron can be selectively trapped, and, alongside this, the chelating agent is disposed so as to enclose the iron ions, whereby a stable complex is formed and further dissociation of the iron ions can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0055">When a substituent and a hydroxyl group can be supported at suitable positions in a phenol-based chelating agent where the substituent is bonded, ring Z forming a phenol portion in formula (1) may be any one of an aromatic hydrocarbon ring or an aromatic heterocyclic ring, but an aromatic hydrocarbon ring is more preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0056">The ring Z is preferably a five- or more-membered ring, more preferably a five-to eight-membered ring and particularly preferably a six-membered ring. In other words, a six-membered aromatic hydrocarbon ring (benzene ring) is most preferable as the ring Z. Further, it is preferable that the aromatic heterocyclic ring of ring Z contains at least two atoms selected from a carbon atom, a nitrogen atom, and an oxygen atom as atoms forming the ring (ring-forming atoms). It is most preferable that the ring contains only a carbon atom and a nitrogen atom. Examples of an aromatic heterocyclic ring containing only a carbon atom and a nitrogen atom as the ring-forming atom include a six-membered aromatic heterocyclic ring such as a pyridine ring, a pyridazine ring, pyrimidine ring, and a pyrazine ring.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0057">The aromatic hydrocarbon ring and aromatic heterocyclic ring as ring Z may have a substituent. In other words, a substituent may be bonded to a ring-forming atom other than the carbon atom where a hydroxyl group or an amino acid residue-alkylene group is bonded. Substituents may form a ring [an aromatic ring (aromatic hydrocarbon ring or aromatic heterocyclic ring, or the like), a non-aromatic ring (non-aromatic hydrocarbon ring or non-aromatic heterocyclic ring, or the like) or the like] by bonding with each other. The substituent is not specifically limited as long as the substituent is a group that does not inhibit the chelating ability by a hydroxyl group or an amino acid residue-alkylene group. For example, when ring Z is a benzene ring, the substituent is preferably 5-Cl or 3-OH or the like. Further, the substituent is preferably a group having no chelating ability. Specifically, the substituent may be a hydrocarbon group such as an alkyl group.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0058">Examples of the alkylene group of R<sup>1 </sup>include an alkylene group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms such as a methylene group, an ethylene group, a trimethylene group, a propylene group, or a tetramethylene group, and an alkylene group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms is preferable. Specifically, a methylene group or an ethylene group is preferable, and a methylene group is most preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0059">R<sup>2 </sup>and R<sup>3 </sup>each independently represent a hydrogen atom, a hydrocarbon group or a group having chelating ability.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0060">The hydrocarbon group of R<sup>2 </sup>and R<sup>3 </sup>is a group having no chelating ability, and for example, includes an alkyl group, an aryl group, an aralkyl group, and a cycloalkyl group. Examples of the alkyl group include a straight and branched alkyl group such as a methyl group, an ethyl group, a propyl group, an isopropyl group, a butyl group, an isobutyl group, an s-butyl group, a t-butyl group, a pentyl group, a hexyl group, a heptyl group, and an octyl group. Examples of the aryl group include a phenyl group and a naphthyl group. Examples of the aralkyl group include a phenylmethyl group. Examples of the cycloalkyl group include a cyclohexyl group, a cycloheptyl group, and a cyclooctyl group.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0061">The hydrocarbon group of R<sup>3 </sup>preferably includes a methyl group (&#x201c;&#x2014;CH<sub>3</sub>&#x201d;), a 1-methylethyl group (&#x201c;&#x2014;CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)CH<sub>3</sub>&#x201d;), a 2-methylpropyl group (&#x201c;&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)CH<sub>3</sub>&#x201d;), a 1-methylpropyl group (&#x201c;&#x2014;CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>&#x201d;) or a phenylmethyl group (&#x201c;a group represented by the following formula (2a)&#x201d;), corresponding to an amino acid forming protein in a living body.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0062">Examples of the group having chelating ability in R<sup>2 </sup>include a group having a functional group such as a hydroxyl group, a carboxyl group, a carbamoyl group, an amino group, a guanidino group, an amidino group, and a nitrogen atom-containing heterocyclic group; preferably a group having one or two functional groups selected from a hydroxyl group, a carboxyl group, a carbamoyl group and a nitrogen atom-containing heterocyclic group; more preferably an alkyl group having one or two functional groups selected from a hydroxyl group, a carboxyl group, a carbamoyl group, and a nitrogen atom-containing heterocyclic group.

<p id="p-0057" num="0063">The group having chelating ability in R<sup>3 </sup>may be the same group as one having chelating ability in R<sup>2</sup>, and preferably includes a hydroxymethyl group (&#x201c;&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>OH)&#x201d;), a 1-hydroxyethyl group (&#x201c;&#x2014;CH(OH)CH<sub>3</sub>)&#x201d;), a (p-hydroxyphenyl)methyl group (&#x201c;a group represented by the following formula (2b)&#x201d;), an indolylmethyl group (&#x201c;a group represented by the following formula (2c)&#x201d;), a carbamoylmethyl group (&#x201c;&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>CONH<sub>2</sub>&#x201d;), a 2-carbamoylethyl group (&#x201c;&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CONH<sub>2</sub>&#x201d;), a carboxymethyl group (&#x201c;&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>COOH&#x201d;), a 2-carboxyethyl group (&#x201c;&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>COOH&#x201d;), a 4-aminobutyl group (&#x201c;&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>&#x201d;), a (1H-imidazol-4-yl)methyl group (&#x201c;a group represented by the following formula (2d)&#x201d;), a 3-guanidinopropyl group (&#x201c;&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NHC(&#x2550;NH)NH<sub>2</sub>&#x201d;), a mercaptomethyl group (&#x201c;&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>SH&#x201d;) or a 2-methylthioethyl group (&#x201c;&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>SCH<sub>3</sub>&#x201d;), corresponding to an amino acid forming protein in a living body.

<p id="p-0059" num="0065">In the present invention, it is critical that the sum of the coordination numbers (actual coordination number coordinated to iron ions) of groups represented by R<sup>2 </sup>and R<sup>3 </sup>is 1 or 2. In other words, according to the description based on R<sup>3</sup>, when R<sup>3 </sup>is a group (hydrogen atom or hydrocarbon group) having no chelating ability, R<sup>2 </sup>is a group having chelating ability with a coordination number of 1 or 2. When R<sup>3 </sup>is a group having chelating ability with a coordination number of 1, R<sup>2 </sup>is a group having no chelating ability or a group having chelating ability with a coordination number of 1. When R<sup>3 </sup>is a group having chelating ability with a coordination number of 2, R<sup>2 </sup>is a group having no chelating ability. For example, in a case where an amino acid forming protein in a living body is used as the material, when a group corresponding to R<sup>3 </sup>has chelating ability, R<sup>2 </sup>is an unchanged hydrogen atom and there is no need to introduce other groups, and, when R<sup>3 </sup>is a group having no chelating ability, a group having chelating ability needs to be introduced as R<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0066">Specifically, when R<sup>3 </sup>is a group having chelating ability such as a hydroxymethyl group, a 1-hydroxyethyl group, a (p-hydroxyphenyl)methyl group, an indolylmethyl group, a carbamoylmethyl group, a 2-carbamoylethyl group, a carboxymethyl group, a 2-carboxyethyl group, a 4-aminobutyl group, a (1H-imidazol-4-yl)methyl group, or a 3-guanidinopropyl group, R<sup>2 </sup>is a hydrogen atom or a hydrocarbon group having no chelating ability, and is preferably a hydrogen atom.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0067">When R<sup>3 </sup>is a group having no chelating ability such as a hydrogen atom, a methyl group, a 1-methylethyl group, a 2-methylpropyl group, a 1-methylpropyl group, or a phenylmethyl group, R<sup>2 </sup>is a group having chelating ability. Specifically, R<sup>2 </sup>preferably includes a chelating group having a coordination number of one (coordination number of actually coordinated atoms) such as a carboxyalkyl group, a hydroxyalkyl group, a carbamoylalkyl group, a pyridylalkyl group, a pyrazinylalkyl group, a pyrimidinylalkyl group, a pyrrolylalkyl group, an imidazolylalkyl group, a benzoimidazolylalkyl group, and a pyrazolylalkyl group.</p>

The sulfur atom in the chelating agent has high affinity with respect to metal ions other than iron ions. Therefore, there is a concern that the inclusion of a sulfur atom in some portion of the chelating agent will result in a reduction of selectivity to non-transferrin-bound iron.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0069">The iron chelating agent of the present invention is a compound represented by formula (1) or a salt thereof. Examples of the salt forms include alkali metal salts such as a sodium salt or a potassium salt, or an ammonium salt of the compound represented by formula (1). Further, when the iron chelating agent of the present invention has a salt form, generally, a phenolic hydroxyl group becomes a salt form, but other portions may become a salt form.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0070">Further, the iron chelating agent of the present invention may take the form of a hydrate or solvate. Further, stereoisomers such as optical isomers may be present in the iron chelating agent of the present invention in some cases. When stereoisomers are present in the iron chelating agent, the iron chelating agent may be any stereoisomers, a mixture of any stereoisomers or take a racemic form.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0071">The various functional groups of the iron chelating agent of the present invention, such as a hydroxyl group or a carboxyl group, may be protected by a protective group during the period before the chelating agent is used. However, it is critical that such protective groups are removed when the iron chelating agent is used and the various functional groups such as the hydroxyl group or the carboxyl group are restored to a separate state.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0072">The iron chelating agent of the present invention has four-coordinated ligands of which the coordination number is four or five-coordinated ligands of which the coordination number is five. Further, the iron chelating agent of the present invention has a structure where a hydroxyl group and an amino acid residue-alkylene group are bonded to adjacent carbon atoms in ring Z. That is to say, the chelating agent has a structure (tripod type) where the amino acid residue-alkylene group is bonded at the ortho position to a hydroxyl group bonded to a carbon atom of ring Z.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0073">The iron chelating agent of the present invention has four- or five-coordinated ligands and is a tripod type, and one iron chelating agent can be coordinated to one iron ion. That is to say, the iron chelating agent of the present invention has a mononuclear coordination (complex) form where one iron chelating agent is coordinated to one iron ion, and can be coordinated to the iron ion. Therefore, the iron ions are encapsulated in a complex coordinated to the iron ion by the iron chelating agent of the present invention and are not easily dissociated (not moved). Therefore, when the iron chelating agent is applied to the human body, the toxicity to the human body (particularly the kidney) is extremely low, and thus safety with regard to the human body is extremely high. Further, since the iron chelating agent of the present invention can form that portion of amino acid residue forming the protein of a living body, such as serine, histidine, or glutamine, the toxicity to the human body is extremely low and thus safety with regard to the human body is extremely high.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0074">Further, iron ions chelatable by the iron chelate of the present invention may be any iron ions, further the valency of the iron ion may be any one of divalency and trivalency, and is preferably trivalency. Further, the iron ions may be non-transferrin-bound iron, since all non-transferrin-bound iron is trivalent iron ion.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0075">In the present invention, non-transferrin-bound iron means an iron ion which is not bonded to transferrin and is capable of having an adverse effect on the human body. Therefore, for example, the non-transferrin-bound iron does not include iron bonded to transferrin (iron ion in transferrin iron complex; transferrin-bound iron); iron stored in the liver, spleen, and marrow as ferritin; hemoglobin formed of four molecules of heme (porphyrin complex compound having iron) and one molecule of globin (four polypeptide chains) in red blood cells; or myoglobin containing one heme which is present in muscle and is a color protein where oxygen molecules are stored until they are needed for metabolism. It is thought that iron ions such as a non-transferrin-bound iron do not have a completely dissociated form in a living body, and take the form of a pair of an iron ion and an anion. Examples of the anion include a hydroxy ion (OH&#x2014;), or the like. That is to say, it is considered that non-transferrin-bound iron exists in a form such as Fe<sup>3+</sup>.3(OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) or a hydroxy-citrate- (Cit) complex (FeCitOH<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) in a living body.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0076">The iron chelating agent of the present invention can be used for the medical application described above. For example, when the iron chelating agent is administrated to a human body, it can be orally or parenterally administered. Examples of the parenteral administration include intravenous, intramuscular, interadermal, or subcutaneous injection. Further, the iron chelating agent can be used in industrial applications other than medical applications.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0077">[Production Method of Iron Chelating Agent]</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0078">Any production method may be used as the method of producing the iron chelating agent of the present invention, as long as the method is one which can produce the iron chelating agent of the present invention represented by formula (1). For example, there is a preferable production method including a step of reacting an aromatic hydrocarbon ring compound or an aromatic heterocyclic ring compound having a structure where a hydroxyl group and a formyl group or a formylalkyl group are bonded to adjacent carbon atoms, with an amino acid or a salt thereof corresponding to an amino acid residue in formula (1). According to this method, the iron chelating agent of the present invention can be efficiently produced with mild conditions and at low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0079">In formula (1), when the iron chelating agent where ring Z is a benzene ring and R<sup>1 </sup>is a methylene group is produced, salicylaldehyde can be used as a substance (aromatic hydrocarbon ring compound or aromatic heterocyclic ring compound having a structure where a hydroxyl group and a formyl group or a formylalkyl group are bonded to adjacent carbon atoms).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0080">Further, examples of the amino acid corresponding to the amino acid residue in formula (1) which can be used include glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, tryptophan, asparagine, glutamine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, lysine, histidine, arginine, cysteine, and methionine, which are amino acids forming protein in a living body. Among them, the amino acids which may be preferably applied include serine, threonine, tyrosine, tryptophan, asparagine, glutamine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, lysine, histidine, arginine, cysteine, and methionine, which include a group having chelating ability at the position corresponding to R<sup>3</sup>. In particular, the amino acids having no sulfur atom which are preferably used include serine, threonine, tyrosine, tryptophan, asparagine, glutamine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, lysine, histidine, arginine. That is to say, an amino acid having a group having chelating ability can be used, and thereby the iron chelating agent of the present invention can be simply produced without the need to introduce a group having separate chelating ability. Further, the iron chelating agent produced by using the amino acid forming protein in a living body has extremely high safety in respect to the human body. It is suitably substituted and used by adding and deleting a functional group of a group corresponding to R<sup>3 </sup>of the amino acid.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0081">For example, in formula (1), when the iron chelating agent where ring Z is a benzene ring and R<sup>1 </sup>is a methylene group, R<sup>2 </sup>is a hydrogen atom, and R<sup>3 </sup>is a hydroxymethyl group (amino acid residue is serine residue) is produced, an iron chelating agent can be produced by the production method having a step of reacting salicylaldehyde and serine or a salt thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0082">More specifically, for example, aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (2N aqueous sodium hydroxide solution) is added to a beaker, D,L-serine (powder) is added as it is by little and little under stirring at room temperature (about 10 to 30&#xb0; C.), followed by stirring for 30 minutes, thereby dissolving serine in aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. Subsequently, water is removed using an evaporator at a temperature of 40 to 50&#xb0; C. The white residue is added to methanol using a beaker while being stirred at room temperature (about 10 to 30&#xb0; C.), and then be stirred for 30 minutes. The resultant is dissolved and salicylaldehyde having the same number of moles as D,L-serine is directly added to this solution at room temperature (about 10 to 30&#xb0; C.) while being stirred. At this time, the solution rapidly becomes a yellow color. Methanol is completely removed by an evaporator at the temperature of 30 to 40&#xb0; C., the remaining yellow solid is dissolved in methanol in a beaker at room temperature (about 10 to 30&#xb0; C.) while being stirred. Solid state of sodium borohydride (NaBH<sub>4</sub>) is added as it is bit by bit to the methanol solution while being stirred at room temperature (about 10 to 30&#xb0; C.). At this time, the solution becomes white. When all of the yellow components are come out (about 60 minutes), the addition of sodium borohydride is stopped, followed by stirring at room temperature (about 10 to 30&#xb0; C.) for one hour, a small amount of water is added thereto at room temperature (about 10 to 30&#xb0; C.), and then insoluble materials are filtered off by natural filtration. Then, the solvent from the filtrate is removed using an evaporator at a temperature of 40 to 50&#xb0; C., the remaining white residue is added bit by bit to water in a beaker at room temperature (about 10 to 30&#xb0; C.) while stirring, followed by dissolution in water, and aqueous hydrochloric acid solution (2N aqueous hydrochloric acid solution) is slowly added to this aqueous solution at room temperature (about 10 to 30&#xb0; C.) while stirring. White crystals are precipitated according to the reduction of the pH of the solution (at this time, the pH is adjusted not to be 1 or lower). Then, the resultant is left (still standing) at room temperature (about 10 to 30&#xb0; C.) and the crystal is filtered by suction filtration, washed with methanol and dried using a desiccator for 24 hours. The iron chelating agent of the present invention where ring Z is a benzene ring, R<sup>1 </sup>is a methylene group, R<sup>2 </sup>is a hydrogen atom, and R<sup>3 </sup>is a hydroxymethyl group in formula (1) is obtained. Other iron chelating agents can be produced based on this specific production method.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0083">As described above, a reaction of an aromatic hydrocarbon ring compound or an aromatic heterocyclic ring compound having a structure where a hydroxyl group and a formyl group or a formylalkyl group are bonded to adjacent carbon atoms, with an amino acid or a salt thereof corresponding to an amino acid residue in formula (1) can be carried out at room temperature (about 10 to 30&#xb0; C.), also the reaction can be carried out under very mild conditions. Further, the reaction time in the respective steps is generally within 1 hour and thus the reaction can be carried out rapidly. Furthermore, the reaction can proceed in an air atmosphere, and there is no need for substitution with inert gas (nitrogen gas or the like). Further, aqueous solvents or hydrophilic organic solvents can be used as the solvents. In addition, methanol as a hydrophilic organic solvent can be reused by recovery, and thus it is advantageous from the viewpoint of the environment. Furthermore, the raw materials or the like are relatively inexpensive and thus it is advantageous from the viewpoint of cost. Further, according to the production method, an iron chelating agent having a yield of 50% or more and a purity of approximately 100% can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0084">Further, the introduction of a desirable group to R<sup>2 </sup>is carried out before or after reaction with a substance on the ring Z side, and is preferably carried out after reaction with the substance of the ring Z side from the viewpoint of synthesis. That is to say, the production method having steps A and B described below can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0085">Step A: a step of reacting an aromatic hydrocarbon ring compound or an aromatic heterocyclic ring compound having a structure where a hydroxyl group and a formyl group or formylalkyl group are bonded to adjacent carbon atoms, with an amino acid or a salt thereof corresponding to an amino acid residue in formula (1)</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0086">Step B: a step of reacting a compound corresponding to R<sup>2 </sup>with the chelating agent obtained by step A</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0087">[Method of Determining the Amount of Iron Ion]</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0088">The method of determining the amount of iron ions of the present invention is characterized by determining the amount of the iron ions using the iron chelating agent of the present invention. The determining method of the present invention can efficiently determine even non-transferrin-bound iron as iron ions. Therefore, for example, the amount of non-transferrin-bound iron in the blood collected from a living body may be determined, and an iron excess state or the like in a living body can be evaluated.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0089">A complex (iron complex or iron chelating form) in which the iron chelating agent of the present invention is coordinated to an iron ion has a characteristic absorption wavelength which is different from the absorption wavelength of iron ions or the iron chelating agent. Therefore, light (for example, light having a wavelength of 466 nm (visible light)) of a desirable wavelength according to the light absorption wavelength of the iron complex is used, allowing absorption spectrometry to be carried out. In addition, since the absorbance of the iron complex depends on the concentration of the iron complex, and absorption strength increases in proportion to the increase in the concentration of the iron complex, the determination of the amount of iron ions can thus be carried out by absorption spectrometry (absorptiometry).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0090">Specifically, according to the method of determining the amount of the iron ions of the present invention, for example, the amount of iron complex (that is to say, the amount of iron ions) can be measured by adding the iron chelating agent solution of the present invention to a solution containing iron ions, and, after reaction (chelating reaction) completion, radiating light (for example, light having a wavelength of 466 nm) of a specific wavelength using a spectrophotometer, whereby an absorbed amount is measured when the light passes through samples (that is to say, solution containing the iron complex). Further, when the amount of iron ions is determined, in advance, the relationship between the absorbance of the iron complex and the concentration of the iron complex is ascertained and calibration data is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0091">Solvents used for iron ion-containing solutions or iron chelating agent solutions include Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (D-PBS), pure water (for example, pure water and the like produced by an ultrapure water producing device (Milli-Q) manufactured by MILLIPORE Corporation; commonly known as Milli-Q water) and the like, when the amount of iron ions is determined. The solvent may be used singly or in combination of two or more kinds.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0092">Further, when an amount of iron ions is determined, the iron chelating agent is added in excess with respect to the number of moles of iron ions, thus it is critical to reliably chelate all the iron ions from the viewpoint of accurately determining the amount of iron ions.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0093">Further, the method of determining the amount of the iron ions of the present invention can be used in medical applications or in industrial applications.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0094">[Trapping Method of Iron Ions]</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0095">The trapping method of iron ions of the present invention is characterized by trapping iron ions by using the iron chelating agent of the present invention. The iron chelating agent of the present invention has an extremely high chelating ability in respect to iron ions (particularly trivalent iron ions), and selectively traps iron ions, so that the amount of iron ions in the system can be effectively reduced. Further, since non-transferrin-bound iron as iron ions is also effectively trapped, non-transferrin-bound iron that is excessive iron in a living body is effectively trapped, and thus adverse effects caused by the excessive iron in a living body can be reduced. Further, after the excessive iron is trapped in a living body, it can be removed from the living body.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0096">Specifically, the method of trapping iron ions, for example, may be any one of a method of introducing the iron chelating agent (or iron chelating agent-containing composition) of the present invention to an iron ion containing composition or a method of introducing the iron ion containing composition to the iron chelating agent of the present invention (or iron chelating agent-containing composition). Further, examples of the iron ion containing composition include liquid phase materials containing iron ions, and aqueous liquid phase materials are preferable. Further, the iron chelating agent-containing composition is suitably determined according to the types used, and is not limited. Examples of the iron chelating agent-containing composition include liquid phase materials in which the iron chelating agent is dissolved or dispersed; solid phase materials having water solubility or water decomposability in which the iron chelating agent is mixed; capsule-form materials having water solubility or water decomposability which contain the iron chelating agent therein; and solid phase materials (filter, or the like) where the iron chelating agent is fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0097">As for the method of trapping iron ions of the present invention, it is preferable to directly trap iron ions using the iron chelating agent of the present invention, but the iron ions may be complexed (chelated) by other chelating agents such as nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), N-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediamine-N,N&#x2032;,N&#x2032;-triacetic acid (HEDTA), ethylenediamine-N,N,N&#x2032;,N&#x2032;-tetraacetic acid (EDTA), and then iron ions in the complex (in the chelate form) may be captured by the iron chelating agent of the present invention, therefore enabling the trapping of the iron ions.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0098">Further, the iron chelating agent of the present invention has low chelating ability with iron (transferrin-bound iron) bonded to transferrin and most of or all the iron ions from the transferrin-bound iron are not captured (substituted). Therefore, in the present invention, when excessive iron is trapped in a living body, it is possible to effectively trap only non-transferrin-bound iron unnecessary for the living body while most of or all the iron ions from transferrin-bound iron required for a living body are not taken, thus the reduction of excessive iron can be effectively achieved in a living body.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0099">Further, the method of trapping iron ions of the present invention can be used in medical applications or in industrial applications.</p>

<p id="p-0158" num="0164">50 &#x3bc;l of 50 &#x3bc;M transferrin iron complex solution was taken in a 1.5 mL sample tube, 50 &#x3bc;l of each of iron chelating agent solutions (Fe-Ser&#x2022;Na (5 mM), Fe-His&#x2022;Na (5 mM), NTA solution (5 mM), HEDTA solution (5 mM)) was added thereto and left at room temperature under light shielding for 24 hours. 50 &#x3bc;l of various reaction liquids was taken in a centrifugal ultrafiltration unit (trade name &#x201c;Amicon Ultra-4 Ultracel-30k&#x201d; UFC8030, manufactured by Millipore Corporation), and 450 &#x3bc;l of 1&#xd7;D-PBS (pH 7.2) was added thereto, centrifugation was carried out at 3,500 rpm and 20&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes, and transferrin and each low molecular chelating agents were separated (first time). After centrifugation, the filtrate was discarded. 450 &#x3bc;l of 1&#xd7;D-PBS (pH 7.2) was added again to the solution (about 50 &#x3bc;l) containing transferrin concentrated in a unit and centrifugation was carried out with the same conditions (second time). A solution containing transferrin concentrated in a unit was recovered after the second time of centrifugation and the absorbance at the wavelength of 466 nm was measured using a spectrophotometer (trade name &#x201c;Spectrophotometer DU 640&#x201d;, manufactured by Beckman Coulter).

<p id="p-0160" num="0166">From Table 5, it has been concluded that even when the chelating agent according to Examples was added to the transferrin iron complex solution, there was little change of absorbance (wavelength 466 nm) and all or most of the iron ions were not captured from the transferrin iron complex. Further, in the case of the iron chelating agent according to Example 1, the absorbance (wavelength 466 nm) after the addition to the transferrin iron complex solution was increased. This seems because the iron chelating agent according to Example 1 does not remove iron ions of the transferrin iron complex, but removes background iron ions present in the system.</p>
<heading id="h-0017" level="1">EXAMPLE 4</heading>
<p id="p-0161" num="0167">The removal of iron in reagents and solvents in the pretreatment of a sample (serum) was attempted by using a chelating agent and ion exchange resin. On the other hand, an ultrafiltration unit was washed using distilled water with iron removed.</p>

<p id="p-0164" num="0170">NTA Solution:</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0171">NTA reagents having various lot numbers were prepared, and mixed iron was compared and studied in advance. In addition, the lot number with the least mixed iron was selected. Conventionally, the preparation method of NTA solution includes mixing an NTA&#x2022;2Na solution (pH 6.30) and an NTA&#x2022;3Na solution (pH 11.30), and thus the ratio of the mixture was prepared to have the desirable pH. For example, when 0.1 mL of an NTA&#x2022;3Na solution was added to 5.0 mL of an NTA&#x2022;2Na solution, the pH of the an NTA solution was 7.21. However, when a strong acidic cation exchange resin is used, it is difficult to adjust the pH of the solution. Also, an NTA solution was prepared with only NTA&#x2022;3Na, the solution was diluted in MOPS Buffer after the removal of iron, and thus the pH of the NTA solution could be adjusted to a natural range. NTA&#x2022;3Na crystal (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) was dissolved in distilled water which had been treated with Chelex100 to produce 800 mM of solution (pH 11.42). 1 g of strong acidic cation exchange resin (SK1BH, Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation) was added to 1 mL of 800 mM NTA&#x2022;3Na solution, and supernatant was recovered after stirring for 1 hour. The solution was diluted ten times in 100 mM MOPS buffer (Dojin Corporation) after completing Chelex100 resin treatment to produce 80 mM NTA&#x2022;3Na solution (pH 7.08).

<p id="p-0187" num="0193">NTBI in the blood of a healthy person was measured using reagents and solutions after the removal of iron. The measuring method was improved upon the conventional method and a &#x201c;Subtraction method&#x201d; was contrived. Iron mixed in NTA reagent scavenging (chelating) non-transferrin-bound iron in serum can be removed, but iron mixed in [Na<sub>3</sub>(Co(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>].3H<sub>2</sub>O solution was not completely removed and samples were divided into two components, one was defined as a sample for measuring the total iron concentration with background, the other was defined as a sample for measuring the background iron concentration and the iron concentrations thereof were determined respectively, and a true iron concentration (NTBI) could be calculated by subtracting the background iron concentration from the total concentration. The conventional measuring method is shown below.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0194">Pretreatment of Sample:</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0195">A pretreatment method of samples is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Samples (serum) frozen for preservation were thawed rapidly and were refrigerated and stored in ice until used. 450 &#x3bc;l of the thawed sample was taken in a 1.5-mL sample tube, and 50 &#x3bc;l of 5 mM [Na<sub>3</sub>(Co(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>].3H<sub>2</sub>O was added thereto. The solution was left in a constant temperature bath at 37&#xb0; C., and cobalt ions were introduced to the site of iron bound to apotransferrin. After 1 hour, the sample was removed from the constant temperature bath at 37&#xb0; C., the cobalt ion-treated samples were added in 225 &#x3bc;l portions to two newly prepared 1.5-mL sample-tubes. 25 &#x3bc;l of 80 mM NTA&#x2022;3Na solution was added to one sample tube (sample A), and 25 &#x3bc;l of solvent used when preparing 80 mM NTA&#x2022;3Na solution was added to the other sample tube (sample B). The solution was left at room temperature for 30 minutes, and non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) was scavenged as Fe-NTA complex. Then, in order that Fe-NTA was separated from iron bonded-protein transferrin, ferritin, or colored protein billirubin in the sample, the sample was added to an ultrafiltration unit with a fractionated molecular weight of 10,000, centrifugation was carried out at 14,000&#xd7;g at 20&#xb0; C. for 1 hour, and the ultrafiltrate was recovered. 20 &#x3bc;l of each of the ultrafiltrate of sample A and the ultrafiltrate of sample B was injected to a non-metal HPLC system.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0196">Determination of the Amount of NTBI by HPLC:</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0197">Device: A non-metal HPLC system having an OmniSpher5C18 glass&#x2022;column (G100&#x2032; 3 Repl), ChromSep guard&#x2022;column (Varian) equipped on a 2796BioSeparation Module, 2998Photodiode Array detector (Waters) using a Non-metallic PEEK(polyether-ethylketone) tube was constructed.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0198">Mobile phase: 5 mL MOPS (manufactured by Dojin Corporation), 3 mM CP-22 (color chelating agent described in Biochemical Pharmacology 57:1305-1310, 1999; synthesis by requirement), 20% acetonitrile (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) solution was prepared, filtration by a filter unit and degassing were carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0199">Determination of amount: To obtain a standard curve for calculating iron concentrations, Fe-NTA solution in which iron concentration was determined by electrical heating atomic absorbance was used, and a standard curve having iron concentrations in the range of 0 to 10 &#x3bc;M was obtained. 20 &#x3bc;l of each of the ultrafiltrate of sample A and the ultrafiltrate of sample B were injected and an iron concentration was determined from a peak corresponding to a position where Fe-NTA used at the time of determining a standard curve was detected as Fe-CP22 (wavelength in detector was 450 nm), and values obtained by subtracting the iron concentration in sample B (iron concentration as background) from the iron concentration in sample A (the total iron concentration with background) were calculated as NTBI in the sample.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0200">Results:</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0201">As a target, healthy persons other than patients having a need for treatment were selected at the time of blood collection. There were two categories which were 20 men (average age 33.4, average Hb value 15.6 g/dl) and 16 women (average age 33.8, average Hb value 13.2 g/dl). The average value of NTBI was 0.206&#xb1;0.091 &#x3bc;M for the men, and 0.212&#xb1;0.095 &#x3bc;M for the women.</p>

<p id="p-0197" num="0203">With respect to a measuring system using the conventionally reported HPLC, the contamination of iron mixed in at each step was reduced by using various chelating agents and specimens were divided into two portions during the course of measurement and finally subtracting the background, whereby it became possible to measure NTBI at a very low concentration. It was concluded that NTBI was present in the serum of healthy persons by the method established in the present invention, and further measured values also were obtained in a stable manner.</p>
<heading id="h-0019" level="1">COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 4</heading>
<p id="p-0198" num="0204">It was thought that the conventional HPLC measuring method has problems due to iron ions in reagents and solutions used in the pretreatment of the samples (serum) shown below. Iron ions are mixed in distilled water as a solvent for dissolving reagents, phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for dilution of the samples, nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) for trapping NTBI, tris-cobalt carbonate ([Na<sub>3</sub>(Co(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>].3H<sub>2</sub>O) for blocking the site of iron bonded to apotransferrin.
