<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Various medical instruments may be used in connection with an endoscope for performing a number of operations at a site deep within a patient's body cavity. One such instrument, a biopsy forceps device, samples tissue from a body cavity with minimal intervention and discomfort to patients. Typically, a biopsy forceps device, like other endoscopic instruments, has a long flexible tubular member for insertion into a lumen of an endoscope. The tubular member is sufficiently long and flexible to follow a long, winding path of the body cavity. An end effector assembly, such as a biopsy forceps assembly, is attached at a distal end of the tubular member, and a handle is attached at a proximal end of the tubular member. The handle may have an elongate portion and a spool portion disposed around the elongate portion. The spool portion may be configured to move longitudinally relative to the elongate portion. An elongate mechanism, such as pull wires, extend through the tubular member to connect the end effector assembly to a hypotube. The hypotube is then connected to a portion of the handle, such as the spool portion. Longitudinal movement of the spool portion relative to the elongate portion of the handle causes the elongate mechanism to move longitudinally in the tubular member, which in turn causes the actuation of the end effector assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In methods of using the biopsy forceps device, an endoscope is placed in a patient's body cavity adjacent to a tissue site from which the acquisition of a tissue sample is desired. The biopsy forceps device is then advanced to the tissue site via a working channel of the endoscope. Once the biopsy forceps device is next to the portion of the tissue from which the acquisition of a tissue sample is desired, the spool portion is moved relative to the elongate portion so as to move the hypotube and the pull wires. The movement of the hypotube and the pull wires causes the jaws of the biopsy forceps assembly to open. The open jaws are then advanced to the tissue site, and the spool portion is again moved relative to the elongate portion so as to move the hypotube and the pull wires such that the jaws close. The closing of the jaws causes a tissue sample to be lodged in the end effector assembly. The biopsy forceps device is then removed from the body cavity via the working channel of the endoscope.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">During various endoscopic procedures, including biopsy procedures, the body cavity, such as the colon, may be insufflated to, for example, widen the organ so that the physician has a better view of the tissue site and/or the body cavity. Insufflation may be accomplished by forcing air into the body cavity, for example, before, during, or after advancing the biopsy forceps device into the endoscope and into the body cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An endoscope typically includes appropriate seals to prevent the escape of the insufflated air out of the body cavity and to the external environment via the endoscope. In some cases, however, some of the air forced into the body cavity during insufflation escapes into the outside environment via the end effector assembly, the lumen of the elongate shaft member, and the handle assembly. This escape of air hinders the insufflation and the maintenance of the internal organ pressure. In addition, it can result in undesirable spraying of air or other gas or liquid into the operating room and onto those performing the procedure.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Reference will now be made in detail to the present exemplary embodiments of the invention illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">An exemplary embodiment of an endoscopic instrument <b>10</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The endoscopic instrument <b>10</b> includes a handle portion <b>11</b> and an end effector assembly <b>12</b> connected to each other by a flexible elongate member <b>13</b>. Control wires <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> extend between the handle portion <b>11</b> and the end effector assembly <b>12</b> via a lumen the flexible elongate member <b>13</b>. The handle portion <b>11</b> includes an elongate portion <b>16</b> connected at its proximal end to a ring portion <b>17</b> and a spool portion <b>18</b> slidably disposed around the elongate portion <b>16</b>. A part of the handle portion <b>11</b>, for example, the spool portion <b>18</b>, may be connected to a hypotube <b>22</b> which in turn may be connected to the control wires <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>. The elongate member <b>13</b> may having a coiled portion <b>153</b> covered by an outer jacket or a sheath <b>27</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>). However, the elongate member <b>13</b> may not have a coiled portion <b>153</b>, and instead may include a single layer tubular member. The end effector assembly <b>12</b> may be any type of assembly, for example, biopsy forceps jaws as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The control wires <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> may be connected at their distal ends to opposing portions of the end effector assembly <b>12</b>, and at their proximal ends to a hypotube <b>22</b>. The hypotube <b>22</b> is connected to the spool portion <b>18</b>. Longitudinal movement of the spool portion <b>18</b> relative to the elongate portion <b>16</b> causes the actuation of the end effector assembly <b>12</b> via the control wires <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">An interface between the elongate member <b>13</b>, elongate portion <b>16</b>, and spool portion <b>18</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The elongate portion <b>16</b> includes a distal hole <b>19</b> which receives the proximal portion <b>20</b> of the elongate member <b>13</b>. Rib portions <b>21</b> guide the proximal portion <b>20</b> of the elongate member <b>13</b> within the elongate portion <b>16</b>, and may also fix the elongate member <b>13</b> within the elongate portion <b>16</b>. The control wires <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> extend through the elongate member <b>13</b> until they reach the proximal portion <b>20</b>, and then enter the distal end of a hypotube <b>22</b>. The hypotube <b>22</b>, with the control wires <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> therein, extends through the central cavity of the elongate portion <b>16</b> until they reach the spool portion <b>18</b>. The hypotube <b>22</b> and control wires <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> then extend through the spool portion <b>1</b> for example in roughly an S-type configuration, so as to secure the hypotube <b>22</b> and the control wires <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> in the spool portion <b>18</b>. The open proximal end <b>26</b> of the hypotube <b>22</b> may or may not extend through the proximal side of the spool portion <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes certain leak paths permitting the passage of air, or other gas or liquid, from the lumen of the elongate member <b>13</b> to the external environment. For example, a gap <b>23</b> may exist between the elongate member <b>13</b> and the hypotube <b>22</b>, for example, between the inner surface <b>24</b> of the elongate member <b>13</b> and the outer surface <b>25</b> of the hypotube <b>22</b>. The gap <b>23</b> may be large enough to allow the passage of gas and/or fluid therethrough, for example, from the end effector assembly <b>12</b> via the lumen of elongate member <b>13</b> and to the external environment. Air or other gas or fluid also may pass through the open proximal end <b>26</b> of the hypotube <b>22</b> via the lumen of the elongate member <b>13</b> and hypotube <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Embodiments of the present invention include seals to prevent the escape of air or other gas or fluid from a medical instrument. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts an embodiment of a sealing device configured to prevent (or at least impede) fluid flow through gap <b>23</b>. The sealing device <b>40</b> has a proximal portion <b>42</b> and a distal portion <b>41</b>. The distal portion <b>41</b> is substantially cylindrical and has an inner diameter or circumference at surface <b>43</b> that is substantially the same as (or slightly less than) the outer diameter or circumference of elongate member at outer surface <b>44</b>, so as to form a substantially fluid tight seal between the surfaces <b>43</b>, <b>44</b>. The proximal portion <b>42</b> has a substantially circular cross-section along its length, and tapers from the distal portion <b>41</b> until the end <b>45</b> of the proximal portion <b>41</b> contacts the outer surface <b>25</b> of the hypotube <b>22</b>. The end <b>45</b> of the proximal portion <b>42</b> has substantially the same (or slightly less) diameter or circumference as the outer diameter or circumference of hypotube <b>22</b> at surface <b>25</b>, so as to form a substantially fluid tight seal between end <b>45</b> of the proximal portion <b>42</b> and the outer surface <b>25</b> of the hypotube <b>22</b>. Accordingly, the sealing device <b>40</b> assists in forming a substantially fluid tight seal between the elongate member <b>13</b> and the hypotube <b>22</b>, such that no (or at least a reduced) amount of fluid flows into the central portion <b>164</b> of the handle elongate portion <b>16</b> from either the elongate member <b>13</b>, the hypotube <b>22</b>, or the gap <b>23</b> between the two.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The sealing device <b>40</b>, and other sealing devices disclosed herein, may be formed of flexible silicone, rubber, plastic, or any other material suitable to substantially prevent (or at least impede) fluid from flowing across and/or permeating through it.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts another exemplary embodiment of a sealing device configured to prevent (or at least impede) fluid flow through gap <b>23</b>. The sealing device <b>50</b> has a distal portion <b>51</b> and a proximal portion <b>52</b> that are substantially similar to the distal portion <b>41</b> and proximal portion <b>42</b> of the sealing device <b>40</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In this embodiment, however, sealing device <b>50</b> is held in place between elongate portion <b>16</b> and elongate member <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">More particularly, the inner surface <b>53</b> of the distal portion <b>51</b> and the outer surface <b>44</b> of the elongate member <b>13</b> are configured to form a substantially fluid tight seal, and the end <b>54</b> of the proximal portion <b>52</b> and the outer surface <b>25</b> of the hypotube <b>22</b> are also configured to form a substantially fluid tight seal. In this embodiment, the outer surface <b>56</b> of the sealing device <b>50</b> (at least along distal portion <b>51</b>) interacts with the end portions <b>55</b> of the ribs <b>21</b> of the elongate portion <b>16</b> to assist in holding the sealing device <b>50</b> in place. For example, the sealing device <b>50</b> may be slightly compressed between the end portions <b>55</b> of the ribs <b>21</b> and outer surface <b>44</b> of the elongate member <b>13</b>, so as to prevent longitudinal movement of the sealing device <b>50</b> relative to the elongate member <b>13</b> and/or the elongate portion <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts another exemplary embodiment of a sealing device configured to prevent (or at least impede) fluid flow through gap <b>23</b>. The sealing device is substantially an O-ring <b>60</b> disposed between the proximal end <b>62</b> of the elongate member <b>13</b>, the outer surface <b>25</b> of the hypotube <b>22</b>, and an inner protrusion <b>61</b> of the elongate portion <b>16</b>. The inner diameter or circumference of the O-ring <b>60</b> is substantially the same as (or slightly less than) the outer diameter or circumference of hypotube <b>22</b> at surface <b>25</b>, such that a substantially fluid tight seal is formed between the O-ring <b>60</b> and hypotube <b>22</b>. The O-ring <b>60</b> also, at least when compressed between the proximal end <b>62</b> of the elongate member <b>13</b> and the inner protrusion <b>61</b> of the elongate portion <b>16</b>, forms a substantially fluid tight seal between the O-ring <b>60</b> and the elongate member <b>13</b>. However, the O-ring <b>60</b> may also form a substantially fluid tight seal with the proximal end <b>62</b> of the elongate member <b>13</b> irrespective of whether the O-ring <b>60</b> is contacting the inner protrusion <b>61</b>. A seal may also be formed between the O-ring <b>60</b> and the inner surface <b>262</b> of the elongate portion <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As an alternative to using inner protrusion <b>61</b> to anchor O-ring <b>60</b> against elongate member <b>13</b>, O-ring <b>60</b> may be affixed or otherwise coupled to member <b>13</b> in any suitable manner, such as an adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> depicts still another exemplary embodiment of a sealing device configured to prevent (or at least impede) fluid flow through gap <b>23</b>. Grease <b>70</b>, or any other viscous substance, may be placed in at least a portion of gap <b>23</b> between the inner surface <b>24</b> of the elongate member <b>13</b> and the outer surface <b>25</b> of the hypotube <b>22</b>. The grease <b>70</b> may prevent air or fluid from escaping the elongate member <b>13</b> through the gap <b>23</b>. The grease <b>70</b> also allows the sealing of the gap <b>23</b> despite any potential movement of the hypotube <b>22</b> relative to the elongate member <b>13</b>, as the grease <b>70</b> may be placed along a sufficient portion of the gap <b>23</b> so that despite movement of the hypotube <b>22</b> relative to the elongate member <b>13</b>, some grease <b>70</b> will still remain in the gap <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts a further exemplary embodiment of a sealing device configured to prevent (or at least impede) fluid flow through gap <b>23</b>. The sealing device <b>80</b> includes a distal portion <b>81</b> substantially similar to the distal portions <b>41</b>, <b>51</b> set forth above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. The sealing device <b>80</b> also has a bellows portion <b>82</b> with an end portion <b>83</b> that is substantially similar to the end portions <b>45</b>, <b>54</b> described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. The bellows portion <b>82</b> is configured to connect the distal portion <b>81</b> and the end portion <b>83</b>, and also to allow movement of the hypotube <b>22</b> relative to the elongate member <b>13</b>, in that the bellows portion <b>82</b> will collapse and expand to adapt to longitudinal movement of the hypotube <b>22</b> and elongate member <b>13</b> relative to each other. This allows the distal portion <b>81</b> and the end portion <b>83</b> to be more securely fastened and/or sealed relative to the elongate member <b>13</b> and the hypotube <b>22</b>, respectively, as the distal portion <b>81</b> and the end portion <b>83</b> do not need to move relative to surfaces <b>44</b>, <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In various embodiments, for example of the sealing devices in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the inner surface of the distal portion and the outer surface of the elongate member may slightly interfere with each other such that a seal is formed between the surfaces. However, the inner surface of the distal portion may also have a circumference or diameter larger than the circumference or diameter of the outer surface of the elongate member. While in such a state a completely fluid tight seal may not necessarily be formed, such a configuration is sufficient to substantially impede fluid flow. The end of the proximal portion and the outer surface of the hypotube may also slightly interfere with each other such that a seal is formed between the end and the surface. However, the end of the proximal portion may also have a circumference or diameter slightly larger than that of the outer surface of the elongate member. While in such a state a completely fluid tight seal may not necessarily be formed, such a configuration is sufficient to substantially impede fluid flow. The sealing devices may move longitudinally relative to the elongate member and/or hypotube and still maintain the substantially fluid tight sealed state.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In various embodiments, the inner surface of the hypotube may surround the outer surface of the elongate member, and thus there may be a gap between the outer surface of the elongate member and the inner surface of the hypotube through which gas or fluid may flow. Accordingly, at least certain features of the embodiments set forth above may be reversed. For example, grease may be applied to the outer surface of the elongate member and inner surface of the hypotube. In another example, the proximal portion of the sealing device in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, and <b>7</b> may be substantially cylindrical, and the distal portion may taper into an end that seals against the elongate member. In yet another example, the O-ring may be placed around the outer surface of the elongate member and abut an end of the inner surface of the hypotube. Other variations will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> depicts an exemplary embodiment of a sealing device configured to prevent (or at least impede) fluid flow through the open proximal end <b>26</b> of hypotube <b>22</b>. The sealing device <b>90</b> is solder or other suitable material, for example adhesives, disposed in the proximal end <b>26</b> of the hypotube <b>22</b>. The sealing device <b>90</b> fills substantially the entire proximal end <b>26</b> and is configured to resist pressure, for example from the interior of the hypotube <b>22</b>, in order to prevent fluid flow therethrough. The sealing device <b>90</b> may also secure the control wires <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> in the hypotube <b>22</b> and/or prevent their movement longitudinally relative to the hypotube <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> depicts another exemplary embodiment of a sealing device configured to prevent (or at least impede) fluid flow through the open proximal end <b>26</b> of hypotube <b>22</b>. The sealing device is a cap <b>100</b> that is securely fastened around the proximal end <b>26</b> of the hypotube <b>22</b>. The inner surface <b>101</b> of the cap <b>100</b> and the outer surface <b>25</b> of the hypotube <b>22</b> form a substantially fluid tight seal. The cap <b>100</b> and hypotube <b>22</b> may fit snugly through a friction fit or other suitable coupling means, such as adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> depicts still another exemplary embodiment of a sealing device configured to prevent (or at least impede) fluid flow through the open proximal end <b>26</b> of hypotube <b>22</b>. The sealing device is a plug <b>110</b> that is securely disposed in the proximal end <b>26</b> of the hypotube <b>22</b>. The outer surface <b>111</b> of the plug <b>110</b> has a substantially circular cross-section along its entire length, and tapers from its proximal end to its distal end. The outer surface <b>111</b> is inserted into the proximal end <b>26</b> of the hypotube <b>22</b> until it forms a substantially fluid tight press fit with the inner surface <b>112</b> of the hypotube <b>22</b>. In such a configuration, at least some of the plug <b>110</b> may be disposed in the hypotube <b>22</b>. In other embodiments, the plug may be non-tapered and/or substantially the entire plug may be configured to fit inside the hypotube <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> depicts yet another exemplary embodiment of a sealing device configured to prevent (or at least impede) fluid flow through the open proximal end <b>26</b> of hypotube <b>22</b>. The hypotube <b>22</b> has a crimped portion <b>120</b> at its proximal end <b>26</b> configured to prevent fluid flow therethrough. The crimped portion <b>120</b> may also secure the control wires <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> in the hypotube <b>22</b> so as to substantially prevent longitudinal movement of the control wires <b>14</b> relative to the hypotube <b>22</b>. The crimped portion <b>120</b> may be formed by any method known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> depicts yet another exemplary embodiment of a sealing device configured to prevent (or at least impede) fluid flow through the open proximal end <b>26</b> of hypotube <b>22</b>. Here, the hypotube <b>22</b> has a crimped portion <b>130</b> substantially similar to the crimped portion <b>120</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, except that the crimped portion <b>130</b> is folded over, for example, to assist in keeping the crimped portion <b>130</b> from unraveling and/or to provide a tighter seal. The control wires <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> may be secured in crimped portion <b>130</b> in substantially the same manner as set forth above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, or the control wires <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> may fall short and not be disposed in the crimped portion <b>130</b> at all.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> depicts a still further exemplary embodiment of a sealing device configured to prevent (or at least impede) fluid flow through the open proximal end <b>26</b> of hypotube <b>22</b>. The sealing device includes a set screw assembly <b>140</b>. The set screw assembly <b>140</b> has a set screw <b>141</b> secured in a housing <b>142</b> configured to receive and retain the set screw <b>141</b>. The housing <b>142</b> also has a passage <b>143</b> through which the hypotube <b>22</b> can be passed through. Once the proximal end <b>26</b> of the hypotube <b>22</b> is in or extended past the passage <b>143</b>, the set screw <b>141</b> in the housing <b>142</b> is screwed onto the hypotube <b>22</b> so as to deform the hypotube <b>22</b> so that fluid cannot flow therethrough. The control wires <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> also may be held in the hypotube <b>22</b> by the set screw assembly <b>141</b> in the same manner as the hypotube <b>22</b> is held in the passage <b>143</b>, so that the control wires <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> are substantially prevented from shifting longitudinally relative to the hypotube <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A-14C</figref> depict an exemplary embodiment of a sealing device configured to prevent (or at least impede) fluid flow through the elongate member <b>13</b>. The sealing device is a plug <b>150</b>. The plug <b>150</b> has a plurality of external threads <b>151</b> extending radially outward from its central tube <b>152</b>. The external threads <b>151</b> are configured, for example, to screw into the coiled section <b>153</b> of the elongate member <b>13</b> and engage the depressions in the coiled section <b>153</b>, i.e. the spaces between adjacent coils of the elongate member <b>13</b>. However, the external threads <b>151</b> of the plug <b>150</b> also may be flexible enough such that the plug <b>150</b> can be advanced into the hollow portion of the elongate member <b>13</b> without screwing or threading. In such a case, during advancement of the plug <b>150</b>, the external threads <b>151</b> will bend and, once positioned, will expand between coils in the coiled section <b>153</b>. A substantially fluid tight seal is formed between at least a portion of the outer surface <b>154</b> of the plug <b>150</b>, especially the portion that includes the external threads <b>151</b>, and the inner surface <b>155</b> of the coiled section <b>153</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The interior of the plug <b>150</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>, has a plurality of chambers <b>156</b> with connecting passages <b>157</b>. The connecting passages <b>157</b> have a smaller cross-sectional area than the chambers <b>156</b>. The connecting passages <b>157</b> are configured such that the control wires <b>14</b>,<b>15</b> may pass through them, for example, because the connection passages have a cross-sectional area slightly larger than the combined cross-sectional areas of the control wires <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>. The chambers <b>156</b> and the connecting passages <b>157</b> are also configured not to substantially impede the longitudinal movement of the control wires <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> relative to the plug <b>150</b> or the elongate member <b>13</b>. The chambers <b>156</b> and connecting passages <b>157</b> are configured to impede and/or prevent fluid flow through the interior of the plug <b>150</b>. For example, air or other fluid that enters the distal most chamber <b>156</b> will contact the proximal wall <b>158</b> of the chamber <b>156</b> and attempt to pass through more proximal connecting passages <b>157</b> and chambers <b>156</b>. Accordingly, as the gas or fluid reaches the proximal end of the plug <b>150</b>, it will have lost substantially velocity, pressure, and/or momentum it had when entering the distal end of the plug <b>150</b>. In another example, fluid attempting to enter the proximal end of the plug <b>150</b> and exit the distal end of the plug <b>150</b> will encounter substantially the same effect.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In various embodiments, the sealing devices need not form a completely fluid tight seal, or even any seal at all, between the components of the endoscopic instrument. Indeed, the sealing devices may simply impede the flow of fluid therethrough, for example, to reduce the velocity, pressure, and/or volume of fluid flowing through the endoscopic instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In various embodiments, any of the sealing devices may be used on other portions of the endoscopic instrument, including other portions of the handle, elongate member, and distal end effector assembly, as appropriate. In various embodiments, different combinations of any of the above sealing devices may be used. For example, an endoscopic instrument may have both a plug <b>150</b> within elongate member <b>13</b> and grease <b>70</b> in the gap <b>23</b>. In other example, the proximal end <b>26</b> of the hypotube <b>22</b> may have both solder <b>90</b> and a cap <b>100</b>. Accordingly, any combination of the above sealing devices is contemplated. The invention may be used in conjunction with any medical or non-medical device and with any medical or non-medical procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Embodiments of the invention also include methods of advancing fluid through portions of elongate devices. Fluids that may be advanced through portions of elongate devices include cleaning fluids sterilizing fluids, saline solution, water, viscous substances, oils, lubrication, disinfecting fluids, drugs or other medications, visual contrast dyes, X-ray contrast dyes, and any other fluid known in the art. For example, to clean an endoscopic instrument, it may be desirable to pass fluid through the instrument, including a lumen of the elongate member for example. One method includes plugging the end effector assembly into a vacuum receptacle and submerging the handle portion into a tank of fluid. A vacuum is then pulled on the receptacle and the tank is pressurized. As a result, fluid is forced and/or advanced into the end effector assembly from the handle portion via the lumen of the elongate member. Ultrasound vibrations and/or heat may be used to assist in the cleaning of the endoscopic instrument. In endoscopic devices that include seals according to any of the embodiments of the invention, including those described above, however, the seal may hinder the passage of the fluid. Thus, other methods of passing fluid through the endoscopic device to, for example, clean the device, are required.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In an exemplary embodiment of the method of the present invention, an endoscopic instrument having a sealing device, for example one of the sealing devices set forth above, is provided. Before advancing fluid through the endoscopic instrument, the sealing device may be removed, for example, by disassembling at least that portion of the endoscopic instrument accommodating the sealing device. The endoscopic instrument, without the sealing device, may then have fluid advanced through it using any method known in the art, for example using the method set forth above, and then the endoscopic instrument may be reassembled. After advancing fluid through the endoscopic instrument, the sealing device may or may not be placed back on or within the endoscopic instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, in another exemplary embodiment of the method of the present intention, an endoscopic instrument having a sealing device, for example one of the sealing devices set forth above, is provided. An outer covering or jacket <b>27</b> on the elongate member <b>13</b> is at least partially peeled back from coiled section <b>153</b> of the elongate member <b>13</b>. Fluid may then be advanced through the endoscopic instrument <b>10</b>, for example through the peeled, uncovered portions <b>160</b> of the coiled section <b>153</b>, and into the lumen of the elongate member to the handle <b>11</b> and/or the end effector assembly <b>12</b>. By removing the outer covering or jacket <b>27</b>, the fluid may bypass the sealing devices. Fluid may be injected into the elongate member lumen between adjacent coils through any suitable method, including methods described below. If the coiled section <b>153</b> is placed under tension by, for example pulling or bending the coiled section, gaps <b>161</b> form between adjacent coils of the coiled section <b>153</b>, such as the gaps shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>. These gaps <b>161</b> may assist in the delivery of fluid to the lumen of elongate member <b>13</b>. After delivery of fluid, jacket <b>27</b> may or may not be replaced, as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In other embodiments, for example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C</figref>, the outer covering or jacket <b>27</b> may not be removed, but have slits <b>162</b> cut therein so as to allow fluid to flow through the coils of the coiled section <b>153</b>, through any suitable injection method, into the lumen <b>164</b> of the elongate member <b>13</b>. The slits <b>162</b> may be cut in portions of the outer covering or jacket <b>27</b> or both or either side of the sealing device and/or devices so as to facilitate fluid flow around the sealing device and/or devices. The fluid may then advance through the elongate member lumen and to the handle <b>11</b>, the end effector assembly <b>12</b>, and/or other portions of the endoscopic instrument <b>10</b>. After advancing the fluid, the outer covering <b>27</b> or jacket <b>27</b> may either be placed back on the coiled sections <b>153</b> of the elongate member <b>13</b> or may be repaired such that fluid no longer enters the central hollow portion (lumen) <b>164</b> of the elongate member <b>13</b> through the coiled section <b>153</b>, or may be left off the endoscopic instrument <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In a further embodiment of the method of the present invention, an endoscopic instrument having a sealing device, for example one of the sealing devices set forth above, is provided. A needle containing a fluid is then used to place the fluid into the device. From there, the fluid may flow through the elongate member, the handle, the end effector assembly, the sealing device, and/or any other portion of the endoscopic instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a long injection needle <b>170</b> may be placed into the end effector assembly <b>12</b> and/or a part of the hollow central portion <b>164</b> of the elongate member <b>13</b>. The fluid is then injected into that portion of the endoscopic instrument, and the fluid may then flow proximally from there until it reaches the distal end of the sealing device. The fluid may also flow distally from there until it reaches the proximal end of the elongate member <b>13</b> and/or the end effector assembly <b>12</b>. The needle <b>170</b> may also be used to remove the fluid from portions of the endoscopic instrument, for example, the fluid that it or another needle injected into the endoscopic instrument. The needle <b>170</b> may be removed after its use.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In another example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, a hypodermic needle <b>180</b> may be used to pierce the elongate member <b>13</b>, for example the outer covering and/or jacket <b>27</b> and/or a coiled portion <b>153</b>, and the fluid may be injected into the hollow lumen <b>164</b> of the elongate member <b>13</b>. Depending on where the fluid is injected in the elongate member <b>13</b>, for example proximal to or distal to the sealing device, the fluid may flow toward the handle <b>11</b>, the sealing device, the elongate member <b>13</b>, and/or the end effector assembly <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In yet another example, the hypodermic needle <b>180</b> could pierce a portion of the handle <b>11</b>, (e.g., the elongate portion <b>16</b>, the spool portion <b>18</b>, and/or the hypotube <b>22</b>) and the fluid could then be injected into that handle portion <b>11</b>. Depending on where the fluid is injected in the handle portion <b>11</b>, for example proximal to or distal to the sealing device, the fluid may flow to other portions of the handle <b>11</b>, the sealing device, the elongate member <b>13</b>, and/or the end effector assembly <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In still another example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, a needle <b>190</b> could be used to force fluid around the sealing device, for example the sealing device <b>40</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The needle <b>190</b>, however, may be used with any sealing device of the present invention. A needle <b>190</b> may be advanced to the sealing device <b>40</b> from any direction, and then the distal end of the needle <b>190</b> could be advanced between the inner surface <b>43</b> of the sealing device <b>40</b> and the outer surface <b>44</b> of the elongate member <b>13</b>. Once past the region where the sealing device <b>40</b> and the elongate member <b>13</b> meet, fluid could be injected into the elongate member <b>13</b> on the side of the sealing device <b>40</b> opposite the rest of the needle <b>190</b>, and then fluid could flow to the elongate member <b>13</b>, the end effector assembly <b>12</b>, and/or the handle <b>11</b>. In a variation of the previous example, the needle <b>190</b> could also be forced through, as opposed to around; the sealing device <b>40</b>. After interaction with the needle <b>190</b>, the sealing devices <b>40</b> may need to be repaired and/or repositioned in the endoscopic instrument <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In a still further embodiment of the method of the present invention, an endoscopic instrument having a sealing device, for example one of the sealing devices set forth above, is provided. The sealing device may then be partially removed and/or dislodged from the endoscopic instrument so as to allow fluid flow through the previously sealed portion. The partial removal and/or dislodging of the sealing device may be accomplished, for example, by advancing a pin, tweezers, and/or other like device, into the sealed portion of the endoscopic instrument and then manipulating the sealing device with the pin, tweezers, or device. Once fluid has been advanced through the endoscopic instrument, including the previously sealed portion, the sealing device may either be reconfigured such that it once again prevents fluid flow through that portion of the endoscopic instrument, for example using the aforementioned pin, tweezers, or device, or it may be left as is so as to permit fluid flow therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In still another embodiment of the method of the present invention, an endoscopic instrument having a sealing device, for example one of the sealing devices set forth above, is provided. At least a portion of the endoscopic instrument is submerged in fluid inside of a sealed chamber. A vacuum may then be used on the sealed chamber to draw at least some of the air from the interior of the endoscopic instrument, including the interior portions adjacent to the sealing device. The chamber then may be pressurized so as to force fluid into the interior of the endoscopic instrument, for example, the interior portions of the endoscopic instrument adjacent to the sealing device from which air was evacuated. The fluid may then be removed from the interior portions of the endoscopic instrument, for example, by using a vacuum, injecting air into the interior portions, utilizing gravity, or using other forces.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In another embodiment of the method of the present invention, an endoscopic instrument having a sealing device, for example one of the sealing devices set forth above, is provided. A portion of the endoscopic instrument is connected to a pressurized fluid device, for example a device which expels gas or fluids at high pressure, such that the pressurized fluid device is in flow communication with the sealing device. The pressurized fluid device may then be used to force a gas or fluid through the endoscopic instrument at sufficiently high pressure to &#x201c;blow out&#x201d; and/or damage the sealing device. After the sealing device has been blown out or damaged, the endoscopic instrument may be connected to a fluid device which expels gas or fluids at lower pressure. This fluid device may be used to advance fluid through the now unsealed endoscopic instrument. After advancing the fluid, the sealing device may be reconstituted on or within the endoscopic instrument, or it may be left off and/or in its damaged state.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In various embodiments, any of the above methods of the present invention may be repeated to achieve the desired effect and/or result. In addition, any of the above methods may be used with any of the other methods so as to achieve the desired effect and/or result. For example, once a sealing device is removed from the endoscopic instrument and fluid has been advanced through the endoscopic instrument, another sealing device may be placed on the endoscopic instrument. The other sealing device may be of the same type as the previously removed sealing device, or it may be of a different type.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In various embodiments, the methods described above are used to advance fluid through the sealed medical instrument by bypassing the sealing device. Bypassing may also include advancing fluid up to the sealing device without necessarily flowing fluid past the sealing device.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In various embodiments, all aspects of the invention set forth herein may be used in conjunction with any medical device, instrument, or procedure, and/or any non-medical device, instrument, or procedure. Other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention disclosed herein. It is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope and spirit of the invention being indicated by the following claims.</p>
