<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Surface cleaning with liquid detergents poses an ongoing problem for consumers. Consumers utilizing liquid detergents as a light-duty liquid dishwashing detergent composition or as a hard surface cleaning composition frequently find surface imperfections such as soil residues, streaks, film and/or spots after washing. Hence, there remains a need for liquid cleaning compositions which not only clean hard surfaces, but also deliver improved shine.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It has surprisingly been found that the compositions of the present invention are not only effective in cleaning surfaces, but also provide an improved shine benefit when used for light-duty dishwashing or for hard surface cleaning.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present application relates to a liquid cleaning composition comprising a) from about 0.01% to about 1.5% by weight of the composition of a modified polyethyleneimine polymer comprising (1) a polyethyleneimine backbone; (2) a polyoxyethylene chain having an average of from about 1 to about 30 ethylene oxide units per unit of NH in the polyethyleneimine backbone; (3) a quaternization degree between about 50% and about 100%; and b) from about 0.5% to about 40% by weight of the composition of surfactant.</p>

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Unless otherwise indicated, weight percentage is in reference to weight percentage of the liquid detergent composition. All temperatures, unless otherwise indicated are in Celsius.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Modified Polyethyleneimine Polymer</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present composition may comprise from about 0.01 wt % to about 1.5 wt %, more preferably from about 0.05% to about 1.0% by weight of the composition of an alkoxylated polyethyleneimine polymer which is also quaternized. In one preferred embodiment, the alkoxylated polyethyleneimine polymer is an ethoxylated polyethyleneimine polymer which is also quaternized.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The alkoxylated polyethyleneimine polymer of the present composition has a polyethyleneimine backbone. Preferably, the polyethyleneimine backbone has a weight average molecular weight of from about 400 g/mol to about 10000 g/mol. In one embodiment, the weight average molecular weight is preferably from about 400 g/mol to about 2000 g/mol, more preferably from about 600 g/mol to about 1800 g/mol, most preferably about 600 or about 1800. Alternatively, in another embodiment, the polyethyleneimine backbone has a weight average molecular weight from about 3000 g/mol to about 7000 g/mol, preferably from about 4000 g/mol to about 6000 g/mol, and most preferably about 5000.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The modification of the polyethyleneimine backbone includes: (1) one or two alkoxylation modifications per nitrogen atom, dependent on whether the modification occurs at an internal nitrogen atom or at an terminal nitrogen atom, in the polyethyleneimine backbone, the alkoxylation modification consisting of the replacement of a hydrogen atom on a polyalkoxylene chain having an average of about 1 to about 30 alkoxy moieties per modification, wherein the terminal alkoxy moiety of the alkoxylation modification is capped with hydrogen, a C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4 </sub>alkyl or mixtures thereof; (2) quaternization of a tertiary nitrogen atom, bearing 0, 1, or 2 polyalkoxylene chains. The quaternization is achieved preferably by introducing C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>12 </sub>alkyl, aryl or alkylaryl groups and may be undertaken in a customary manner by reaction with corresponding alkyl-, alkylaryl-, halides and dialkylsulfates.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">For example, but not limited to, below is shown possible modifications to terminal nitrogen atoms in the polyethyleneimine backbone where R represents an ethylene spacer and E represents a C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>12 </sub>alkyl moiety and X<sup>&#x2212;</sup> represents a suitable water soluble counterion, such as chlorine, bromine or iodine, sulphate (i.e. &#x2212;O&#x2014;SO3H or &#x2014;O&#x2014;SO3-), alkylsulfonate such as methylsulfonate, arylsulfonate such as tolylsulfonate, and alkyl sulphate, such as methosulphate (i.e. &#x2014;O&#x2014;SO2-OMe).</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The alkoxylation modification of the polyethyleneimine backbone consists of the replacement of a hydrogen atom by a polyalkoxylene chain having an average of about 1 to about 30 alkoxy units, preferably about 2 to about 25 alkoxy units, and more preferably about 3 to about 20 alkoxy units.

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">These polyethyleneimines can be prepared, for example, by polymerizing ethyleneimine in the presence of a catalyst such as carbon dioxide, sodium bisulfite, sulfuric acid, hydrogen peroxide, hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, and the like as described in the Examples below.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The inventive alkoxylated polyethyleneimines may be prepared in a known manner by reaction of polyethyleneimines with alkylene oxides. Suitable alkylene oxides are C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>20 </sub>alkylene oxides like ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide, pentene oxide, hexene oxide, decene oxide, dodecene oxide etc. Polyethyleneimines are reacted with one single alkylene oxide or combinations of two or more different alkylene oxides. Using two or more different alkylene oxides, the resulting polymer can be obtained as a block-wise structure or a random structure.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">One preferred procedure consists in initially undertaking only an incipient alkoxylation of the polyethyleneimine in a first step. In this step, the polyethyleneimine is reacted only with a portion of the total amount of alkylene oxide used, which corresponds to about 1 mol of alkylene oxide per mole of NH moiety. This reaction is undertaken generally in the absence of a catalyst in an aqueous solution at a reaction temperature from about 70 to about 200&#xb0; C. and preferably from about 80 to about 160&#xb0; C. This reaction may be affected at a pressure of up to about 10 bar, and in particular up to about 8 bar.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a second step, the further alkoxylation is then effected by subsequent reaction with the remaining amount of alkylene oxide. The further alkoxylation is undertaken typically in the presence of a basic catalyst. Examples of suitable catalysts are alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide, alkali metal alkoxides, in particular sodium and potassium C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4</sub>-alkoxides, such as sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide and potassium tert-butoxide, alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydrides such as sodium hydride and calcium hydride, and alkali metal carbonates such as sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate. Preference is given to the alkali metal hydroxides and the alkali metal alkoxides, particular preference being given to potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide. Typical use amounts for the base are from 0.05 to 10% by weight, in particular from 0.5 to 2% by weight, based on the total amount of polyethyleneimine and alkylene oxide.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The further alkoxylation may be undertaken in substance (variant a)) or in an organic solvent (variant b)). In variant a), the aqueous solution of the incipiently alkoxylated polyalkylenimine obtained in the first step, after addition of the catalyst, is initially dewatered. This can be done in a simple manner by heating to from about 80 to about 150&#xb0; C. and distilling off the water under a reduced pressure of from about 0.01 to about 0.5 bar. The subsequent reaction with the alkylene oxide is effected typically at a reaction temperature from about 70 to about 200&#xb0; C. and preferably from about 100 to about 180&#xb0; C. The subsequent reaction with the alkylene oxide is effected typically at a pressure of up to about 1.0 bar and in particular up to 8 bar. The reaction time of the subsequent reaction with the alkylene oxide is generally about 0.5 to about 4 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Suitable organic solvents for variant b) are in particular nonpolar and polar aprotic organic solvents. Examples of particularly suitable nonpolar aprotic solvents include aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons such as hexane, cyclohexane, toluene and xylene. Examples of particularly suitable polar aprotic solvents are ethers, in particular cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxane, N,N-dialkylamides such as dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamide, and N-alkyllactams such as N-methylpyrrolidone. It is of course also possible to use mixtures of these organic solvents. Preferred organic solvents are xylene and toluene.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In variant b), the solution obtained in the first step, after addition of catalyst and solvent, is initially dewatered, which is advantageously done by separating out the water at a temperature of from about 120 to about 180&#xb0; C., preferably supported by a gentle nitrogen stream. The subsequent reaction with the alkylene oxide may be effected as in variant a). In variant a), the alkoxylated polyalkylenimine is obtained directly in substance and may be converted if desired to an aqueous solution. In variant b), the organic solvent is typically removed and replaced by water. The products may, of course, also be isolated in substance.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The quaternization of alkoxylated polyethyleneimines is achieved preferably by introducing C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>12 </sub>alkyl, aryl or alkylaryl groups and may be undertaken in a customary manner by reaction with corresponding alkyl-, alkylaryl-, halides and dialkylsulfates, as described for example in WO2009060059.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The quaternization of alkoxylated polyethyleneimines is achieved preferably by reacting the amines with at least one alkylating compound, which is selected from the compounds of the formula EX, wherein E is C1-C12 alkyl, aryl or alkyl and X is a leaving group, which is capable of being replaced by nitrogen (and C2-C6 alkylene oxide, especially ethylene oxide or propylene oxide).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Suitable leaving groups X are halogen, especially chlorine, bromine or iodine, sulphate (i.e. &#x2014;OSO3H or &#x2014;OSO3-), alkylsulfonate such as methylsulfonate, arylsulfonate such as tolylsulfonate, and alkyl sulphate, such as methosulphate (i.e. OSO2 OMe). Preferred alkylating agents EX are C1-C12 alkyl halides, bis(C1-C12-alkyl)sulfates, and benzyl halides. Examples of such alkylating agents are ethyl chloride, ethyl bromide, methyl chloride, methyl bromide, benzyl chloride, dimethyl sulphate, diethyl sulphate.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">SYNTHESIS EXAMPLES</heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The amount of alkylating agent determines the amount of quaternization of the amino groups in the polymer, i.e. the amount of quaternized moieties.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The amount of the quaternized moieties can be calculated from the difference of the amine number in the non-quaternized amine and the quaternized amine. The amine number can be determined according to the method described in DIN 16945.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The reaction can be carried out without any solvent, However, a solvent or diluent like water, acetonitrile, dimethylsulfoxide, N-Methylpyrrolidone, etc. may be used. The reaction temperature is usually in the range from 10&#xb0; C. to 150&#xb0; C. and is preferably from 50&#xb0; C. to 110&#xb0; C.</p>

<p id="h-0038" num="0000">Method of Use</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0142">In the method aspect of this invention, soiled dishes are contacted with an effective amount, typically from about 0.5 ml to about 20 ml (per 25 dishes being treated), preferably from about 3 ml to about 10 ml, of the liquid detergent composition of the present invention diluted in water. The actual amount of liquid detergent composition used will be based on the judgment of user, and will typically depend upon factors such as the particular product formulation of the composition, including the concentration of active ingredients in the composition, the number of soiled dishes to be cleaned, the degree of soiling on the dishes, and the like. The particular product formulation, in turn, will depend upon a number of factors, such as the intended market (i.e., U.S., Europe, Japan, etc.) for the composition product. Suitable examples may be seen in the Example compositions below.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0143">Generally, from about 0.01 ml to about 150 ml, preferably from about 3 ml to about 40 ml of a liquid detergent composition of the invention is combined with from about 2000 ml to about 20000 ml, more typically from about 5000 ml to about 15000 ml of water in a sink having a volumetric capacity in the range of from about 1000 ml to about 20000 ml, more typically from about 5000 ml to about 15000 ml. The soiled dishes are immersed in the sink containing the diluted compositions then obtained, where contacting the soiled surface of the dish with a cloth, sponge, or similar article cleans them. The cloth, sponge, or similar article may be immersed in the detergent composition and water mixture prior to being contacted with the dish surface, and is typically contacted with the dish surface for a period of time ranged from about 1 to about 10 seconds, although the actual time will vary with each application and user. The contacting of cloth, sponge, or similar article to the dish surface is preferably accompanied by a concurrent scrubbing of the dish surface.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0144">Another method of use will comprise immersing the soiled dishes into a water bath or held under running water without any liquid dishwashing detergent. A device for absorbing liquid dishwashing detergent, such as a sponge, is placed directly into a separate quantity of undiluted liquid dishwashing composition for a period of time typically ranging from about 1 to about 5 seconds. The absorbing device, and consequently the undiluted liquid dishwashing composition, is then contacted individually to the surface of each of the soiled dishes to remove said soiling. The absorbing device is typically contacted with each dish surface for a period of time range from about 1 to about 10 seconds, although the actual time of application will be dependent upon factors such as the degree of soiling of the dish. The contacting of the absorbing device to the dish surface is preferably accompanied by concurrent scrubbing.</p>

The method is calibrated with a Pullulan standard (MW 342-1660000 g/mol, obtained from PSS Polymer Standards Service GmbH, Mainz, Germany).</p>
<p id="h-0041" num="0000">Shine Test Method</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0146">The formulation to be tested is diluted with tap water (water hardness: 15 gpg, temperature: 40&#xb0; C.) in order to obtain a 10% solution of the original formulation. This solution is applied by a sponge to 3 drinking glasses, which are then rinsed for 10 seconds under running water (water hardness: 15 gpg; temperature: 40&#xb0; C.). The glasses are stored vertically after rinsing and allowed to dry at ambient temperature (20&#xb0; C.). After drying, the glasses are graded visually by two judges for shine on a 0 to 6 point scale (0=complete absence of streaks/spots; 6=extremely bad streaks/spots).</p>
<p id="h-0042" num="0000">Viscosity Test Method</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0147">The viscosity of the composition of the present invention is measured on a Brookfield viscometer model # LVDVII+ at 20&#xb0; C. The spindle used for these measurements is S31 with the appropriate speed to measure products of different viscosities; e.g., 12 rpm to measure products of viscosity greater than 1000 cps; 30 rpm to measure products with viscosities between 500 cps-1000 cps; 60 rpm to measure products with viscosities less than 500 cps.</p>
