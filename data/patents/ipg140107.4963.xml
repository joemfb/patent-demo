<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the invention relate to beacon signals for repeaters within a wireless communications system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Relevant Background</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Wireless communication systems have developed through various generations, including a first-generation analog wireless phone service (1G), a second-generation (2G) digital wireless phone service (including interim 2.5G and 2.75G networks) and a third-generation (3G) high speed data/Internet-capable wireless service. There are presently many different types of wireless communication systems in use, including Cellular and Personal Communications Service (PCS) systems. Examples of known cellular systems include the cellular Analog Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS), and digital cellular systems based on Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), the Global System for Mobile access (GSM) variation of TDMA, and newer hybrid digital communication systems using both TDMA and CDMA technologies.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The method for providing CDMA mobile communications was standardized in the United States by the Telecommunications Industry Association/Electronic Industries Association in TIA/EIA/IS-95-A entitled &#x201c;Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System,&#x201d; referred to herein as IS-95. Combined AMPS &#x26; CDMA systems are described in TIA/EIA Standard IS-98. Other communications systems are described in the IMT-2000/UM, or International Mobile Telecommunications System 2000/Universal Mobile Telecommunications System, standards covering what are referred to as wideband CDMA (W-CDMA), CDMA2000 (such as CDMA2000 1xEV-DO standards, for example) or TD-SCDMA.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In W-CDMA wireless communication systems, user equipments (UEs) receive signals from fixed position Node Bs (also referred to as cell sites or cells) that support communication links or service within particular geographic regions adjacent to or surrounding the base stations. Node Bs provide entry points to an access network (AN)/radio access network (RAN), which is generally a packet data network using standard Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) based protocols that support methods for differentiating traffic based on Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Therefore, the Node Bs generally interact with UEs through an over the air interface and with the RAN through Internet Protocol (IP) network data packets.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Wireless repeaters can be positioned within wireless communication systems in order to extend the range or coverage area of one or more Node Bs. In the uplink direction, the wireless repeaters receive signals from UEs and retransmit the received signals to a given Node B. In the downlink direction, the wireless repeaters receive signals from the given Node B and retransmit the received signals to UEs.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an embodiment, a first repeater configures a beacon signal that identifies the first repeater to one or more other repeaters. The first repeater transmits the configured beacon signal at a given transmission power level to the one or more other repeaters. The transmitted beacon signal is received at least by a second repeater. The second repeater reduces interference associated with other transmissions from the first repeater, such as retransmissions of donor signals, based on the received beacon signal.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Aspects of the invention are disclosed in the following description and related drawings directed to specific embodiments of the invention. Alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the scope of the invention. Additionally, well-known elements of the invention will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The words &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;example&#x201d; are used herein to mean &#x201c;serving as an example, instance, or illustration.&#x201d; Any embodiment described herein as &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;example&#x201d; is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. Likewise, the term &#x201c;embodiments of the invention&#x201d; does not require that all embodiments of the invention include the discussed feature, advantage or mode of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Further, many embodiments are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by, for example, elements of a computing device. It will be recognized that various actions described herein can be performed by specific circuits (e.g., application specific integrated circuits (ASICs)), by program instructions being executed by one or more processors, or by a combination of both. Additionally, these sequence of actions described herein can be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer readable storage medium having stored therein a corresponding set of computer instructions that upon execution would cause an associated processor to perform the functionality described herein. Thus, the various aspects of the invention may be embodied in a number of different forms, all of which have been contemplated to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. In addition, for each of the embodiments described herein, the corresponding form of any such embodiments may be described herein as, for example, &#x201c;logic configured to&#x201d; perform the described action.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A High Data Rate (HDR) subscriber station, referred to herein as a user equipment (UE), may be mobile or stationary, and may communicate with one or more access points (APs), which may be referred to as Node Bs. A UE transmits and receives data packets through one or more of the Node Bs to a Radio Network Controller (RNC). The Node Bs and RNC are parts of a network called a radio access network (RAN). A radio access network can transport voice and data packets between multiple access terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The radio access network may be further connected to additional networks outside the radio access network, such core network including specific carrier related servers and devices and connectivity to other networks such as a corporate intranet, the Internet, public switched telephone network (PSTN), a Serving General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) Support Node (SGSN), a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN), and may transport voice and data packets between each UE and such networks. A UE that has established an active traffic channel connection with one or more Node Bs may be referred to as an active UE, and can be referred to as being in a traffic state. A UE that is in the process of establishing an active traffic channel (TCH) connection with one or more Node Bs can be referred to as being in a connection setup state. A UE may be any data device that communicates through a wireless channel or through a wired channel. A UE may further be any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC card, compact flash device, external or internal modem, or wireless or wireline phone. The communication link through which the UE sends signals to the Node B(s) is called an uplink channel (e.g., a reverse traffic channel, a control channel, an access channel, etc.). The communication link through which Node B(s) send signals to a UE is called a downlink channel (e.g., a paging channel, a control channel, a broadcast channel, a forward traffic channel, etc.). As used herein the term traffic channel (TCH) can refer to either an uplink/reverse or downlink/forward traffic channel.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a block diagram of one exemplary embodiment of a wireless communications system <b>100</b> in accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention. System <b>100</b> can contain UEs, such as cellular telephone <b>102</b>, in communication across an air interface <b>104</b> with an access network or radio access network (RAN) <b>120</b> that can connect the access terminal <b>102</b> to network equipment providing data connectivity between a packet switched data network (e.g., an intranet, the Internet, and/or core network <b>126</b>) and the UEs <b>102</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>. As shown here, the UE can be a cellular telephone <b>102</b>, a personal digital assistant <b>108</b>, a pager <b>110</b>, which is shown here as a two-way text pager, or even a separate computer platform <b>112</b> that has a wireless communication portal. Embodiments of the invention can thus be realized on any form of access terminal including a wireless communication portal or having wireless communication capabilities, including without limitation, wireless modems, PCMCIA cards, personal computers, telephones, or any combination or sub-combination thereof. Further, as used herein, the term &#x201c;UE&#x201d; in other communication protocols (i.e., other than W-CDMA) may be referred to interchangeably as an &#x201c;access terminal&#x201d;, &#x201c;AT&#x201d;, &#x201c;wireless device&#x201d;, &#x201c;client device&#x201d;, &#x201c;mobile terminal&#x201d;, &#x201c;mobile station&#x201d; and variations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the components of the wireless communications system <b>100</b> and interrelation of the elements of the exemplary embodiments of the invention are not limited to the configuration illustrated. System <b>100</b> is merely exemplary and can include any system that allows remote UEs, such as wireless client computing devices <b>102</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> to communicate over-the-air between and among each other and/or between and among components connected via the air interface <b>104</b> and RAN <b>120</b>, including, without limitation, core network <b>126</b>, the Internet, PSTN, SGSN, GGSN and/or other remote servers.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The RAN <b>120</b> controls messages (typically sent as data packets) sent to a RNC <b>122</b>. The RNC <b>122</b> is responsible for signaling, establishing, and tearing down bearer channels (i.e., data channels) between a Serving General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) Support Node (SGSN) and the UEs <b>102</b>/<b>108</b>/<b>110</b>/<b>112</b>. If link layer encryption is enabled, the RNC <b>122</b> also encrypts the content before forwarding it over the air interface <b>104</b>. The function of the RNC <b>122</b> is well-known in the art and will not be discussed further for the sake of brevity. The core network <b>126</b> may communicate with the RNC <b>122</b> by a network, the Internet and/or a public switched telephone network (PSTN). Alternatively, the RNC <b>122</b> may connect directly to the Internet or external network. Typically, the network or Internet connection between the core network <b>126</b> and the RNC <b>122</b> transfers data, and the PSTN transfers voice information. The RNC <b>122</b> can be connected to multiple Node Bs <b>124</b>. In a similar manner to the core network <b>126</b>, the RNC <b>122</b> is typically connected to the Node Bs <b>124</b> by a network, the Internet and/or PSTN for data transfer and/or voice information. The Node Bs <b>124</b> can broadcast data messages wirelessly to the UEs, such as cellular telephone <b>102</b>. The Node Bs <b>124</b>, RNC <b>122</b> and other components may form the RAN <b>120</b>, as is known in the art. However, alternate configurations may also be used and the invention is not limited to the configuration illustrated. For example, in another embodiment the functionality of the RNC <b>122</b> and one or more of the Node Bs <b>124</b> may be collapsed into a single &#x201c;hybrid&#x201d; module having the functionality of both the RNC <b>122</b> and the Node B(s) <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates the core network <b>126</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates components of a General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) core network implemented within a W-CDMA system. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the core network <b>126</b> includes a Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) <b>160</b>, a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) <b>165</b> and an Internet <b>175</b>. However, it is appreciated that portions of the Internet <b>175</b> and/or other components may be located outside the core network in alternative embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Generally, GPRS is a protocol used by Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) phones for transmitting Internet Protocol (IP) packets. The GPRS Core Network (e.g., the GGSN <b>165</b> and one or more SGSNs <b>160</b>) is the centralized part of the GPRS system and also provides support for W-CDMA based 3G networks. The GPRS core network is an integrated part of the GSM core network, provides mobility management, session management and transport for IP packet services in GSM and W-CDMA networks.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) is the defining IP protocol of the GPRS core network. The GTP is the protocol which allows end users (e.g., access terminals) of a GSM or W-CDMA network to move from place to place while continuing to connect to the internet as if from one location at the GGSN <b>165</b>. This is achieved transferring the subscriber's data from the subscriber's current SSGN <b>160</b> to the GGSN <b>165</b>, which is handling the subscriber's session.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Three forms of GTP are used by the GPRS core network; namely, (i) GTP-U, (ii) GTP-C and (iii) GTP&#x2032; (GTP Prime). GTP-U is used for transfer of user data in separated tunnels for each packet data protocol (PDP) context. GTP-C is used for control signaling (e.g., setup and deletion of PDP contexts, verification of GSN reach-ability, updates or modifications such as when a subscriber moves from one SGSN to another, etc.). GTP&#x2032; is used for transfer of charging data from GSNs to a charging function.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the GGSN <b>165</b> acts as an interface between the GPRS backbone network (not shown) and the external packet data network <b>175</b>. The GGSN <b>165</b> extracts the packet data with associated packet data protocol (PDP) format (e.g., IP or PPP) from the GPRS packets coming from the SGSN <b>160</b>, and sends the packets out on a corresponding packet data network. In the other direction, the incoming data packets are directed by the GGSN <b>165</b> to the SGSN <b>160</b> which manages and controls the Radio Access Bearer (RAB) of the destination UE served by the RAN <b>120</b>. Thereby, the GGSN <b>165</b> stores the current SGSN address of the target UE and his/her profile in its location register (e.g., within a PDP context). The GGSN is responsible for IP address assignment and is the default router for the connected UE. The GGSN also performs authentication and charging functions.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The SGSN <b>160</b> is representative of one of many SGSNs within the core network <b>126</b>, in an example. Each SGSN is responsible for the delivery of data packets from and to the UEs within an associated geographical service area. The tasks of the SGSN <b>160</b> includes packet routing and transfer, mobility management (e.g., attach/detach and location management), logical link management, and authentication and charging functions. The location register of the SGSN stores location information (e.g., current cell, current VLR) and user profiles (e.g., IMSI, PDP address(es) used in the packet data network) of all GPRS users registered with the SGSN <b>160</b>, for example, within one or more PDP contexts for each user or UE. Thus, SGSNs are responsible for (i) de-tunneling downlink GTP packets from the GGSN <b>165</b>, (ii) uplink tunnel IP packets toward the GGSN <b>165</b>, (iii) carrying out mobility management as UEs move between SGSN service areas and (iv) billing mobile subscribers. As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, aside from (i)-(iv), SGSNs configured for GSM/EDGE networks have slightly different functionality as compared to SGSNs configured for W-CDMA networks.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The RAN <b>120</b> (e.g., or UTRAN, in Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) system architecture) communicates with the SGSN <b>160</b> via a Iu interface, with a transmission protocol such as Frame Relay or IP. The SGSN <b>160</b> communicates with the GGSN <b>165</b> via a Gn interface, which is an IP-based interface between SGSN <b>160</b> and other SGSNs (not shown) and internal GGSNs, and uses the GTP protocol defined above (e.g., GTP-U, GTP-C, GTP&#x2032;, etc.). While not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the Gn interface is also used by the Domain Name System (DNS). The GGSN <b>165</b> is connected to a Public Data Network (PDN) (not shown), and in turn to the Internet <b>175</b>, via a Gi interface with IP protocols either directly or through a Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) gateway.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The PDP context is a data structure present on both the SGSN <b>160</b> and the GGSN <b>165</b> which contains a particular UE's communication session information when the UE has an active GPRS session. When a UE wishes to initiate a GPRS communication session, the UE must first attach to the SGSN <b>160</b> and then activate a PDP context with the GGSN <b>165</b>. This allocates a PDP context data structure in the SGSN <b>160</b> that the subscriber is currently visiting and the GGSN <b>165</b> serving the UE's access point.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates an example of the wireless communications system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in more detail. In particular, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, UEs <b>1</b> . . . N are shown as connecting to the RAN <b>120</b> at locations serviced by different packet data network end-points. The illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is specific to W-CDMA systems and terminology, although it will be appreciated how <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> could be modified to confirm with a 1x EV-DO system. Accordingly, UEs <b>1</b> and <b>3</b> connect to the RAN <b>120</b> at a portion served by a first packet data network end-point <b>162</b> (e.g., which may correspond to SGSN, GGSN, PDSN, a home agent (HA), a foreign agent (FA), etc.). The first packet data network end-point <b>162</b> in turn connects, via the routing unit <b>188</b>, to the Internet <b>175</b> and/or to one or more of an authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) server <b>182</b>, a provisioning server <b>184</b>, an Internet Protocol (IP) Multimedia Subsystem (IMS)/Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Registration Server <b>186</b> and/or the application server <b>170</b>. UEs <b>2</b> and <b>5</b> . . . N connect to the RAN <b>120</b> at a portion served by a second packet data network end-point <b>164</b> (e.g., which may correspond to SGSN, GGSN, PDSN, FA, HA, etc.). Similar to the first packet data network end-point <b>162</b>, the second packet data network end-point <b>164</b> in turn connects, via the routing unit <b>188</b>, to the Internet <b>175</b> and/or to one or more of the AAA server <b>182</b>, a provisioning server <b>184</b>, an IMS/SIP Registration Server <b>186</b> and/or the application server <b>170</b>. UE <b>4</b> connects directly to the Internet <b>175</b>, and through the Internet <b>175</b> can then connect to any of the system components described above.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, UEs <b>1</b>, <b>3</b> and <b>5</b> . . . N are illustrated as wireless cell-phones, UE <b>2</b> is illustrated as a wireless tablet-PC and UE <b>4</b> is illustrated as a wired desktop station. However, in other embodiments, it will be appreciated that the wireless communication system <b>100</b> can connect to any type of UE, and the examples illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> are not intended to limit the types of UEs that may be implemented within the system. Also, while the AAA server <b>182</b>, the provisioning server <b>184</b>, the IMS/SIP registration server <b>186</b> and the application server <b>170</b> are each illustrated as structurally separate servers, one or more of these servers may be consolidated in at least one embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Further, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the application server <b>170</b> is illustrated as including a plurality of media control complexes (MCCs) <b>1</b> . . . N <b>170</b>B, and a plurality of regional dispatchers <b>1</b> . . . N <b>170</b>A. Collectively, the regional dispatchers <b>170</b>A and MCCs <b>170</b>B are included within the application server <b>170</b>, which in at least one embodiment can correspond to a distributed network of servers that collectively functions to arbitrate communication sessions (e.g., half-duplex group communication sessions via IP unicasting and/or IP multicasting protocols) within the wireless communication system <b>100</b>. For example, because the communication sessions arbitrated by the application server <b>170</b> can theoretically take place between UEs located anywhere within the system <b>100</b>, multiple regional dispatchers <b>170</b>A and MCCs are distributed to reduce latency for the arbitrated communication sessions (e.g., so that a MCC in North America is not relaying media back-and-forth between session participants located in China). Thus, when reference is made to the application server <b>170</b>, it will be appreciated that the associated functionality can be enforced by one or more of the regional dispatchers <b>170</b>A and/or one or more of the MCCs <b>170</b>B. The regional dispatchers <b>170</b>A are generally responsible for any functionality related to establishing a communication session (e.g., handling signaling messages between the UEs, scheduling and/or sending announce messages, etc.), whereas the MCCs <b>170</b>B are responsible for hosting the communication session for the duration of the call instance, including conducting an in-call signaling and an actual exchange of media during an arbitrated communication session.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a UE <b>200</b>, (here a wireless device), such as a cellular telephone, has a platform <b>202</b> that can receive and execute software applications, data and/or commands transmitted from the RAN <b>120</b> that may ultimately come from the core network <b>126</b>, the Internet and/or other remote servers and networks. The platform <b>202</b> can include a transceiver <b>206</b> operably coupled to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) <b>208</b>, or other processor, microprocessor, logic circuit, or other data processing device. The ASIC <b>208</b> or other processor executes the application programming interface (API) <b>210</b> layer that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory <b>212</b> of the wireless device. The memory <b>212</b> can be comprised of read-only or random-access memory (RAM and ROM), EEPROM, flash cards, or any memory common to computer platforms. The platform <b>202</b> also can include a local database <b>214</b> that can hold applications not actively used in memory <b>212</b>. The local database <b>214</b> is typically a flash memory cell, but can be any secondary storage device as known in the art, such as magnetic media, EEPROM, optical media, tape, soft or hard disk, or the like. The internal platform <b>202</b> components can also be operably coupled to external devices such as antenna <b>222</b>, display <b>224</b>, push-to-talk button <b>228</b> and keypad <b>226</b> among other components, as is known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Accordingly, an embodiment of the invention can include a UE including the ability to perform the functions described herein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the various logic elements can be embodied in discrete elements, software modules executed on a processor or any combination of software and hardware to achieve the functionality disclosed herein. For example, ASIC <b>208</b>, memory <b>212</b>, API <b>210</b> and local database <b>214</b> may all be used cooperatively to load, store and execute the various functions disclosed herein and thus the logic to perform these functions may be distributed over various elements. Alternatively, the functionality could be incorporated into one discrete component. Therefore, the features of the UE <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are to be considered merely illustrative and the invention is not limited to the illustrated features or arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The wireless communication between the UE <b>102</b> or <b>200</b> and the RAN <b>120</b> can be based on different technologies, such as code division multiple access (CDMA), W-CDMA, time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), or other protocols that may be used in a wireless communications network or a data communications network. For example, in W-CDMA, the data communication is typically between the client device <b>102</b>, Node B(s) <b>124</b>, and the RNC <b>122</b>. The RNC <b>122</b> can be connected to multiple data networks such as the core network <b>126</b>, PSTN, the Internet, a virtual private network, a SGSN, a GGSN and the like, thus allowing the UE <b>102</b> or <b>200</b> access to a broader communication network. As discussed in the foregoing and known in the art, voice transmission and/or data can be transmitted to the UEs from the RAN using a variety of networks and configurations. Accordingly, the illustrations provided herein are not intended to limit the embodiments of the invention and are merely to aid in the description of aspects of embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a portion of the wireless communications system <b>100</b> whereby a plurality of repeaters <b>402</b>, <b>404</b>, <b>406</b> and <b>408</b> are positioned so as to extend the coverage area of a particular Node B <b>124</b>. Accordingly, each of repeaters <b>402</b> through <b>408</b> are positioned in range of the Node B <b>124</b>'s wireless transmissions such that the respective repeaters can receive and retransmit the signals from the Node B <b>124</b>. Also, UE <b>200</b> is positioned out of the direct range or coverage area of the Node B <b>124</b>, but in range of the extended coverage area provided by the repeater <b>402</b>. Thus, via repeater <b>402</b>, the Node B <b>124</b> can transmit data to UE <b>200</b>, and UE <b>200</b> can likewise transmit data to the Node B <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In an example, the repeaters <b>402</b> through <b>408</b> can be implemented as on-frequency repeaters, such that communication between the repeaters <b>402</b> through <b>408</b> and the UEs in the Node B's <b>124</b> serving sector(s) occurs on a first frequency, and communication between the repeaters <b>402</b> through <b>408</b> and the Node B <b>124</b> occurs on the same first frequency. In this case, the repeaters <b>402</b> and <b>408</b> receive a donor signal (e.g., a downlink signal from Node B <b>124</b> or an uplink signal from UE <b>200</b>) on the first frequency, and then re-transmit an amplified version of the donor signal on the same first frequency. For convenience of explanation, the embodiments illustrated in the FIGS and described below are primarily directed to a single-carrier or on-frequency repeater implementation.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Alternatively, in another on-frequency repeater implementation, multiple donor signals can be received on a plurality of carriers or frequencies (e.g., in the uplink and/or downlink directions), with each donor signal amplified and repeated by repeaters <b>402</b> through <b>408</b> on the same respective frequency on which it was received.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In another alternative example, the repeaters <b>402</b> through <b>408</b> can be implemented as frequency-translating repeaters, such that communication between the repeaters <b>402</b> through <b>408</b> and the UEs in the Node B's <b>124</b> serving sector(s) occurs on a first frequency, and communication between the repeaters <b>402</b> through <b>408</b> and the Node B <b>124</b> occurs on a second frequency. In this case, the repeaters <b>402</b> and <b>408</b> receive a donor signal (e.g., a downlink signal from Node B <b>124</b> or an uplink signal from UE <b>200</b>) on one of the frequencies, translate the donor signal to the other frequency, and then transmit the translated signal on the other frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">While not shown explicitly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it will be appreciated that two or more of repeaters <b>402</b> through <b>408</b> can be positioned in close geographic proximity such that wireless transmissions from a given repeater can interfere with reception at one or more of the other repeaters.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a conventional manner by which repeaters <b>402</b> and <b>404</b> can repeat signals between UE <b>200</b> and Node B <b>124</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it is assumed repeaters <b>402</b> and <b>404</b> are close enough such that their respective transmissions each interfere with reception at the other repeater.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the Node B <b>124</b> transmits data to UE <b>200</b>, <b>500</b>. While not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the application server <b>170</b> can forward data to the Node B for transmission to UE <b>200</b>, resulting in the data transmission of <b>500</b>. As described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, UE <b>200</b> is not in direct wireless range of Node B <b>124</b>. Accordingly, the data transmission of <b>500</b> is received by repeaters <b>402</b> and <b>404</b>, and not by UE <b>200</b> at this point. While not shown explicitly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, repeaters <b>406</b> and <b>408</b> can also receive the data transmission of <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Upon receiving the downlink data transmission for UE <b>200</b> from the Node B <b>124</b> in <b>500</b>, repeater <b>402</b> retransmits the data to UE <b>200</b>, <b>505</b>. Although the target UE (i.e., UE <b>200</b>) is not in range of repeater <b>404</b>, repeater <b>404</b> also receives the downlink data transmission for UE <b>200</b> from the Node B <b>124</b> in <b>500</b>, and repeater <b>404</b> also retransmits the data, <b>510</b>. As shown via arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the retransmission of the downlink data from repeater <b>402</b> reaches the target UE (i.e., UE <b>200</b>), and also reaches the repeater <b>404</b>. Likewise, the retransmission of the downlink data from repeater <b>404</b> reaches the repeater <b>402</b>. These respective interfering signals cause performance degradation at both repeater <b>402</b>, <b>515</b>, and also at repeater <b>404</b>, <b>520</b> (see <b>535</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). For example, the respective retransmissions of the downlink data by repeaters <b>402</b> and <b>404</b> can interfere with the respective repeaters' ability to decode incoming data from the Node B <b>124</b>. In another example, the retransmissions from the respective repeaters can be again retransmitted, which can cause feedback in the system. As noted above, for convenience of explanation, it may be assumed that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is implemented via a single-frequency or on-frequency repeater implementation, such that the UE <b>200</b>, the Node B <b>124</b> and the repeaters <b>402</b> and <b>404</b> are each transmitting (and receiving) on the same frequency. It will be appreciated that, in other implementations, in-band interference can also occur whenever a transmitting entity (e.g., repeaters <b>402</b> and <b>404</b>, the UE <b>200</b> or Node B <b>124</b>) are transmitting upon the same frequency upon which a receiving entity is receiving other data.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, assume that UE <b>200</b> receives the retransmission of the downlink data from repeater <b>402</b>, <b>525</b>, and responds to the downlink data (e.g., an announce message for a communication session, a text message, etc.) with reverse-link or uplink data for transmission to the Node B <b>124</b>. Accordingly, because UE <b>200</b> is in range of repeater <b>402</b> (and not repeater <b>404</b>), repeater <b>402</b> receives and retransmits the uplink data from UE <b>200</b> to the Node B <b>124</b>, <b>530</b>. As shown via arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the retransmission of the uplink data from repeater <b>402</b> reaches the Node B <b>124</b>, and also reaches the repeater <b>404</b>. Thus, the retransmission from repeater <b>402</b> at <b>530</b> causes performance degradation at repeater <b>404</b>. For example, the retransmission of the uplink data from repeater <b>402</b> can interfere with the repeater <b>404</b>'s ability to receive uplink data from other UEs and/or the Node B <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Conventionally, the above-noted problems associated with interfering repeaters can be reduced by positioning repeaters far apart from each other geographically. However, this can also limit the coverage area extension provided by the repeaters, resulting in coverage gaps. Accordingly, embodiments of the invention are directed to implementing interference reduction mechanisms at repeaters in a wireless communications system. In particular, one or more repeaters deployed within the wireless communications systems are configured to transmit continuous (e.g., periodic) and/or intermittent (e.g., event-triggered) beacon signals. Other repeaters can then use the beacon signals to reduce interference associated with retransmissions from the beacon-transmitting repeater(s) in the uplink and/or downlink direction, as will be described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> illustrates a process of transmitting a beacon signal from a first repeater in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the first repeater (e.g., any of repeaters <b>402</b> through <b>408</b>) configures a beacon signal for transmission, <b>600</b>A. In an example, the beacon signal is configured to function as a signature signal that identifies the first repeater to other repeaters in relatively close physical proximity to the first repeater. In a further example, the configuration of the beacon signal by the first repeater in <b>600</b>A can include selecting a pseudo-noise (PN) sequence or offset from a given set of PN sequences. In an example, the selection of the PN sequence or offset can be performed in a pseudo-random manner. For example, the selection of the PN sequence or offset can be based on a hash function of a unique identifier (ID) (e.g., at least, unique within a given serving area of the wireless communications system, such as a sector) associated with the first repeater's to ensure that other repeaters co-located with the first repeater do not use the same PN sequence or offset. In a further example, the unique ID used in the hash function to select the PN sequence or offset can correspond to a media access control (MAC) ID of the first repeater.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">After configuring the beacon signal in <b>600</b>A, the first repeater transmits the configured beacon signal from the first repeater at a given transmission power level, <b>605</b>A. As will be appreciated, unlike other transmissions from the repeaters <b>402</b> through <b>408</b>, the transmission of <b>605</b>A is not a &#x2018;re&#x2019;-transmission because the configured beacon signal is internally generated at the beacon signal, and is not a retransmission of a donor signal provided from an external entity.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In an embodiment of the invention, the given transmission power level at which the beacon signal is transmitted need not be the same transmission power level at which retransmissions (e.g., in either the uplink or downlink direction) are performed. For example, the configured beacon signal in <b>605</b>A can be transmitted at a lower transmission power level than retransmissions made by the first repeater in the uplink and/or downlink directions in at least one embodiment of the invention. As will be appreciated, the beacon signal configured in <b>600</b>A is not part of the donor signals that the first repeater is responsible for amplifying and retransmitting. Therefore, the configured beacon signal, once transmitted, is associated with its own interference/noise and should be maintained in the lower transmission power level, while still being transmitted with sufficient strength at least reach the neighboring repeater(s) of the first repeater that are affected by the first repeater's donor signal retransmissions. For example, if a desired output signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the repeater is-15 dB, the average transmission power level for the transmitted beacon signal at <b>605</b>A can be at least 15 dB lower than the transmitted donor signal.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In another embodiment of the invention, with reference to <b>605</b>A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the transmission of the configured beacon signal can occur on a periodic or continuous basis. For example, the period at which the configured beacon signal is transmitted by the first repeater can be every 5 seconds, every 30 seconds, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">It will be appreciated that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is described-above with respect to the transmission of a beacon signal at one particular frequency (e.g., for a single-frequency or on-frequency repeater for reasons discussed above). In other embodiments, it will be appreciated that the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> can be performed for each frequency or carrier upon which the first repeater is re-transmitting donor signals. Thus, two (or more) frequency-distinct beacon signals can be transmitted by the first repeater in other embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> illustrates a process of reducing interference based on a transmitted beacon signal at a second repeater in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, assume that the first repeater is in relative close proximity to the second repeater, such that the second repeater receives the transmitted beacon signal from <b>605</b>A, <b>600</b>B. Because the transmitted beacon signal is configured to identify the first repeater, the second repeater is able to distinguish the transmitted beacon signal from donor signals (i.e., uplink and/or downlink signals to be repeated or retransmitted by the second repeater). For example, the beacon signal from the first repeater can be configured with a different PN offset or sequence as compared to beacon signals from other repeaters and/or a pilot signal from the Node B <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">After receiving the transmitted beacon signal at the second repeater, the second repeater uses the transmitted beacon signal to reduce interference associated with retransmissions from the first repeater, <b>605</b>B. For example, by identifying the transmitted beacon signal as being from a source that carries signals that are not intended for retransmission by the second repeater, the second repeater can refrain from retransmitting signals from the first repeater so as to reduce feedback in the system. In another example, the second repeater can analyze parameters associated with the transmitted beacon signal so as to nullify or avoid via beamforming and/or other interference reduction techniques, as is known in the art. Further, upon detecting the transmitted beacon signal from the first repeater in <b>600</b>B, the second repeater can reduce interference associated with transmissions to and/or from the first repeater either by reducing the retransmission power level of the second repeater and/or by steering its transmission and receiving antennas away from the direction in which the transmitted beacon signal is detected.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">It will be appreciated that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> is described-above with respect to reducing interference at the second repeater in association with transmitted beacon signals at one particular frequency (e.g., for a single-frequency or on-frequency repeater for reasons discussed above). In other embodiments, it will be appreciated that the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> can be performed for each frequency or carrier upon beacon signals are sent by the first repeater and received at the second repeater. Thus, two (or more) frequency-distinct beacon signals can be transmitted by the first repeater in other embodiments of the invention, and each of the respective beacon signals can be used by the second repeater for interference reduction.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a process by which repeaters <b>402</b> and <b>404</b> can repeat signals between UE <b>200</b> and Node B <b>124</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, it is assumed repeaters <b>402</b> and <b>404</b> are close enough such that their respective transmissions each interfere with reception at the other repeater.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, repeater <b>402</b> executes the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> in <b>700</b>, such that repeater <b>402</b> configures a first beacon signal and then transmits the configured first beacon signal at a given transmission power level, which is then received by repeater <b>404</b>. Likewise, repeater <b>404</b> also executes the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> in <b>705</b>, such that repeater <b>404</b> configures a second beacon signal and then transmits the configured second beacon signal at a given transmission power level (e.g., which can be the same or different as the transmission power level of the beacon signal from repeater <b>402</b>), which is then received by repeater <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">At some later point in time, assume that the Node B <b>124</b> transmits data to UE <b>200</b>, <b>710</b>. While not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the application server <b>170</b> can forward data to the Node B for transmission to UE <b>200</b>, resulting in the data transmission of <b>710</b>. As described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, UE <b>200</b> is not in direct wireless range of Node B <b>124</b>. Accordingly, the data transmission of <b>710</b> is received by repeaters <b>402</b> and <b>404</b>. While not shown explicitly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, repeaters <b>406</b> and <b>408</b> can also receive the data transmission of <b>710</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Upon receiving the downlink data transmission for UE <b>200</b> from the Node B <b>124</b> in <b>710</b>, repeater <b>402</b> retransmits the data to UE <b>200</b>, <b>715</b>. Although the target UE (i.e., UE <b>200</b>) is not in range of repeater <b>404</b>, repeater <b>404</b> also receives the downlink data transmission for UE <b>200</b> from the Node B <b>124</b> in <b>715</b>, and repeater <b>404</b> also retransmits the data, <b>720</b>. As shown via arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the retransmission of the downlink data from repeater <b>402</b> reaches the target UE (i.e., UE <b>200</b>), but also reaches the repeater <b>404</b>. Likewise, the retransmission of the downlink data from repeater <b>404</b> reaches the repeater <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, repeaters <b>402</b> and <b>404</b> also execute the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> upon receipt of the first and second beacon signal transmissions in <b>705</b> and <b>700</b>, respectively. Thus, each of repeaters <b>402</b> and <b>404</b> is prepared to reduce interference associated with the retransmissions of <b>730</b> and <b>725</b>, respectively, based in part on the earlier transmission of the beacon signals in <b>705</b> and <b>700</b>, respectively. Thereby, as in <b>605</b>B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, repeater <b>402</b> reduces interference associated with repeater <b>404</b>'s retransmission of <b>720</b> based on the beacon signal from <b>705</b>. Likewise, as in <b>605</b>B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, repeater <b>404</b> also reduces interference associated with repeater <b>402</b>'s retransmission of <b>715</b> based on the beacon signal from <b>700</b>. Thus, the operation of repeaters <b>402</b> and <b>404</b> need not be degraded by virtue of the transmission of their respective beacon signals.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, assume that UE <b>200</b> receives the retransmission of the downlink data from repeater <b>402</b>, <b>735</b>, and responds to the downlink data (e.g., an announce message for a communication session, a text message, etc.) with reverse-link or uplink data for transmission to the Node B <b>124</b>. Accordingly, because UE <b>200</b> is in range of repeater <b>402</b> (and not repeater <b>404</b>), repeater <b>402</b> receives and retransmits the uplink data from UE <b>200</b> to the Node B <b>124</b>, <b>740</b>. As shown via arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the retransmission of the uplink data from repeater <b>402</b> reaches the Node B <b>124</b>, but also reaches the repeater <b>404</b>. At this point, as described above with respect to <b>605</b>B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6B and 730</figref>, repeater <b>404</b> reduces interference associated with repeater <b>402</b>'s retransmission of <b>735</b> based on the beacon signal from <b>700</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As noted above, for convenience of explanation, it may be assumed that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is implemented via a single-frequency or on-frequency repeater implementation, such that the UE <b>200</b>, the Node B <b>124</b> and the repeaters <b>402</b> and <b>404</b> are each transmitting (and receiving) on the same frequency. However, it will be appreciated that, in other implementations, repeaters <b>402</b> and <b>404</b> can each transmit upon multiple different frequencies or carriers. In this case, the interference reduction shown above at <b>725</b>, <b>730</b> and/or <b>745</b> can be associated with the frequency or carrier upon which the retransmission donor signal is transmitted at <b>720</b>, <b>715</b> and <b>740</b>, respectively.</p>
