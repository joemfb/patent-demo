<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field:</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure relates generally to systems and methods for analyzing aerodynamic effects of features in the surface of a vehicle. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to systems and methods for designing, making, and verifying the reworking of inconsistencies in thermal protection systems for aerospace vehicles by calculating cross flows over the surfaces of such vehicles.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Background:</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Aerodynamic heating is the heating of a solid body produced by frictional interactions with the passage of fluid about the body. For example, aerodynamic heating occurs when air passes over an aerospace vehicle, such as a spacecraft or aircraft, during vehicle transit, ascent, descent, and reentry. In this case, aerodynamic heating of the vehicle is a function of various parameters, such as reentry angle, vehicle speed, air density, and vehicle configuration, among other parameters. Another parameter affecting aerodynamic heating of an aerospace vehicle is the thermal protection system materials that are used to protect the vehicle from aerodynamic and other heating. For example, depending on the vehicle configuration and thermal protection system material properties, aerodynamic heating typically increases as the air surrounding the vehicle increases in density and as the air passes more quickly over the vehicle. An increase in the speed at which air passes over a vehicle typically occurs as the speed of the vehicle increases.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Aerodynamic heating considerations may have many effects on aerospace vehicle design and operation. For example, aerodynamic heating may affect the performance of an aerospace vehicle. The thermal protection system configuration and materials that are needed for a vehicle may be based on the levels of aerodynamic heating expected to be experienced by the vehicle during operation. Aerodynamic heating actually experienced by an aerospace vehicle during operation may affect how often inspections and maintenance are needed. Levels and durations of aerodynamic heating experienced during vehicle operation may affect whether the vehicle should be reconfigured, reworked, or replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A vehicle thermal protection system may be used to reduce or control the effects of aerodynamic heating on an aerospace vehicle structure to within acceptable limits. For example, an aerospace vehicle may be a vehicle that travels at supersonic, hypersonic, exo-orbital, and exoatmospheric speeds, and a spacecraft that reenters the atmosphere. A thermal protection system for such an aerospace vehicle may include a barrier to protect the vehicle from aerodynamic heating when the vehicle renters the atmosphere. For example, the thermal protection system may include material that covers the surfaces of the vehicle that are exposed to air during reentry. Examples of materials that may be used for a vehicle thermal protection system include silica glass fiber materials, ceramic matrix composite (CMC) materials, polymeric matrix composite (PMC) materials, and other materials, as well as such materials that may be clad with ablative, high-temperature resistant, or other coating materials.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A space shuttle is an example of an aerospace vehicle. On a space shuttle, most of the thermal protection system takes the form of tiles that are attached to the surfaces of the vehicle that are exposed to aerodynamic heating during reentry. For example, these tiles may be located on the lower surface of the space shuttle, among other suitable places thereon. The tiles on the space shuttle are made of an insulating material known to those having knowledge in the relevant arts to be a silica glass fiber material. The insulating tiles absorb and radiate heat, while minimizing heat load conduction to the aluminum airframe of the space shuttle.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Inconsistencies may occur in the thermal protection system tiles of a space shuttle, in the materials used to attach the tiles to the shuttle surface, and in materials used to seal and fill gaps and channels between the tiles. Inconsistencies may include nicks, dings, scrapes, or what those skilled in the art may refer to generally as cavities, in the surface of the thermal protection system tiles. Inconsistencies also may include material that becomes lodged between tiles of the thermal protection system. Such inconsistencies may be referred to as gap fillers by those skilled in the art. Inconsistencies in a vehicle thermal protection system may arise or occur during pre-flight preparation, as well as during operation of an aerospace vehicle, such as the space shuttle. Such undesirable inconsistencies may affect the aerodynamic characteristics of the tiles and, therefore, may affect performance of the space shuttle thermal protection system. Similar issues may arise in other types of thermal protection systems that are used in other types of aerospace vehicles and in thermal protection systems that may employ other thermal protection system materials, such as ceramic matrix composite materials, polymeric matrix composite materials, or other materials.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, it would be advantageous to have a method and apparatus that takes into account one or more of the issues discussed above, as well as possibly other issues.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring more particularly to the drawings, embodiments of the disclosure may be described in the context of an aerospace vehicle manufacturing and service method <b>100</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and an aerospace vehicle <b>200</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Turning first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an illustration of the aerospace vehicle manufacturing and service method <b>100</b> is depicted in accordance with an advantageous embodiment. During pre-production, the aerospace vehicle manufacturing and service method <b>100</b> may include a specification and design <b>102</b> of the aerospace vehicle <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and material procurement <b>104</b>. During production, component and subassembly manufacturing <b>106</b> and system integration <b>108</b> of the aerospace vehicle <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> takes place. Thereafter, the aerospace vehicle <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may go through certification and delivery <b>110</b> in order to be placed in service <b>112</b>. While in service <b>112</b> by a customer, the aerospace vehicle <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is scheduled for routine maintenance and service <b>114</b>, which may include modification, repair, reconfiguration, refurbishment, and other maintenance or service.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Each of the processes of the aerospace vehicle manufacturing and service method <b>100</b> may be performed or carried out by a system integrator, a third party, and/or an operator. In these examples, the operator may be a customer. For the purposes of this description, a system integrator may include, without limitation, any number of aerospace vehicle manufacturers and major-system subcontractors; a third party may include, without limitation, any number of venders, subcontractors, and suppliers; and an operator may be a company, a military entity, a service organization, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an illustration of an aerospace vehicle is depicted in which an advantageous embodiment may be implemented. The aerospace vehicle <b>200</b> may be any vehicle for operation in the air, in space, or both. For example, the aerospace vehicle <b>200</b> may be an aircraft, a spacecraft, or a vehicle that operates as both an aircraft and a spacecraft. In this example, the aerospace vehicle <b>200</b> is produced by the aerospace vehicle manufacturing and service method <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The aerospace vehicle <b>200</b> may include a frame <b>202</b> with a plurality of systems <b>204</b> and an interior <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Examples of the systems <b>204</b> include one or more of a propulsion system <b>208</b>, an electrical system <b>210</b>, a hydraulic system <b>212</b>, an environmental system <b>214</b>, and a thermal protection system <b>216</b>. Although an aerospace example is shown, different advantageous embodiments may be applied to other industries, such as the automotive industry.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an illustration of a space shuttle is depicted in accordance with an advantageous embodiment. In this example, a space shuttle <b>300</b> is one example of the aerospace vehicle <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a lower surface <b>302</b> of the space shuttle <b>300</b>. In accordance with an advantageous embodiment, individual point locations on the lower surface <b>302</b> may be identified by points in a coordinate system <b>304</b>. The coordinate system <b>304</b> may be a three-dimensional coordinate system defined with reference to the space shuttle <b>300</b>. For example, an X-axis <b>306</b> of the coordinate system <b>304</b> may extend in the direction from a tail <b>308</b> to a nose <b>310</b> of the space shuttle <b>300</b>. A Y-axis <b>312</b> of the coordinate system <b>304</b> may extend perpendicular to the X-axis <b>306</b> in the direction across wings <b>314</b> of the space shuttle <b>300</b>. A Z-axis <b>318</b> of the coordinate system <b>304</b> may then extend perpendicular to both the X-axis <b>306</b> and the Y-axis <b>312</b> in the direction extending perpendicular to the page in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As will be known to those skilled in the art, individual point locations on a vehicle may be identified by points in coordinate systems other than the specific coordinate systems illustrated and described as examples herein.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an illustration showing in more detail a portion <b>400</b> of the lower surface <b>302</b> of the space shuttle <b>300</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is depicted in accordance with an advantageous embodiment. The lower surface <b>302</b> of the space shuttle <b>300</b> is covered by an arrangement of thermal insulating tiles. For example, the portion <b>400</b> of the lower surface <b>302</b> includes tiles <b>402</b>, <b>404</b>, and <b>406</b>. The tiles <b>402</b>, <b>404</b>, and <b>406</b> form a portion of a thermal protection system for the space shuttle <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is not meant to illustrate an actual arrangement of tiles for a space shuttle or to present an accurate illustration of the shapes and dimensions of tiles or of the gaps between tiles for a thermal protection system for any vehicle. Rather, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is provided to illustrate some of the terms and concepts that are used in the descriptions of advantageous embodiments provided herein.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">An impact of debris or other events may cause the formation of a feature on the tile <b>402</b>. An example of one such feature is a cavity <b>408</b> in the tile <b>402</b>. The cavity <b>408</b> also may be referred to as a nick, ding, or scrape in the tile <b>402</b>. The cavity <b>408</b> may affect air flow across the tile <b>402</b>. Therefore, the cavity <b>408</b> may affect aerodynamic heating of the tile <b>402</b> and, therefore, may affect performance of the thermal protection system for the space shuttle <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The location and orientation of the cavity <b>408</b> on the space shuttle <b>300</b> may be described using the locations of points <b>410</b> and <b>412</b>. For example, the points <b>410</b> and <b>412</b> may be selected as points located at opposite ends of the cavity <b>408</b>. In the example presented, the points <b>410</b> and <b>412</b> are selected such that an axis <b>413</b> extends between the points <b>410</b> and <b>412</b> across approximately the largest dimension of the cavity <b>408</b> at the surface of the tile <b>402</b>. The points <b>410</b> and <b>412</b> may be identified as points in the coordinate system <b>304</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, or as points in another coordinate system. An angle of the axis <b>413</b> may define the angle of the cavity <b>408</b> in the coordinate system <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Another example of a feature that may be formed by the impact of debris or another event is a gap filler <b>414</b>. For example, the gap filler <b>414</b> may be a piece of debris or other material that becomes lodged in a gap <b>416</b> between the tiles <b>404</b> and <b>406</b>. The gap filler <b>414</b> may at least partially fill the gap <b>416</b> between the tiles <b>404</b> and <b>406</b>. The gap filler <b>414</b> may protrude from the gap <b>416</b> beyond the surfaces of the adjacent tiles <b>404</b> and <b>406</b>. The gap filler <b>414</b> may affect air flow across the surfaces of the tiles <b>404</b> and <b>406</b>. Therefore, the gap filler <b>414</b> may affect aerodynamic heating of the space shuttle <b>300</b>. The location of the gap filler <b>414</b> on the space shuttle <b>300</b> may be identified by identifying a side <b>418</b> or a side <b>420</b> of the tiles <b>404</b> or <b>406</b> adjacent to the gap filler <b>414</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The cavity <b>408</b> and the gap filler <b>414</b> are examples of unintended features. Such unintended features may be referred to as inconsistencies. Inconsistencies may result from the impact of debris on an aerospace vehicle or from other causes during pre-flight preparation or during operation of the vehicle. Other features on the surface of a vehicle thermal protection system may not be unintended features or inconsistencies. However, such other features also may affect air flow across the vehicle thermal protection system and, thus, may affect aerodynamic heating of the aerospace vehicle. Examples of such other features may include features that are part of the vehicle thermal protection system design.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The different advantageous embodiments recognize and take into account a number of considerations. For example, the different advantageous embodiments recognize and take into account that it may be important to determine accurately the aerodynamic effects of various features, such as inconsistencies, on the thermal protection system of an aerospace vehicle. An accurate determination of such aerodynamic effects may be needed, for example, to determine accurately the effects of the features on aerodynamic heating so that appropriate action may be taken, if needed. An accurate determination of the effect of an inconsistency or other feature on aerodynamic heating of a thermal protection system may be needed, for example, to determine whether the thermal protection system will perform as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The different advantageous embodiments recognize and take into account that an accurate evaluation of a vehicle thermal protection system may be made using a simulation of aerodynamic heating. A simulation of aerodynamic heating may provide information on the heat that will be produced at the vehicle thermal protection system for a particular scenario, such as the reentry of an aerospace vehicle through the atmosphere. The effect of features in the thermal protection system on aerodynamic heating may be determined by including information on such features in a model of the thermal protection system that is used for the simulation. In this case, if the simulation indicates that heating of the thermal protection system is more than a desired amount, then maintenance, rework, or modification operations may be performed. For example, such operations may include rework or replacement of a portion of a thermal protection system that includes an inconsistency in the form of a cavity. As another example, such operations may include an operation to remove an inconsistency in the form of a gap filler from between tiles of a vehicle thermal protection system.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The different advantageous embodiments recognize and take into account that an accurate simulation of the effect on aerodynamic heating of a feature on a thermal protection system may require accurately determining the cross flow of air with respect to the feature. For example, an accurate determination of the effect of the cavity <b>408</b> or the gap filler <b>414</b> on aerodynamic heating of the space shuttle <b>300</b> during reentry may require an accurate determination of the cross flow angle of air at the cavity <b>408</b> or the gap filler <b>414</b> during reentry. The airflow across the lower surface <b>302</b> of the space shuttle <b>300</b> during reentry may be in the direction indicated by an arrow <b>422</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In this case, for example, the cross flow angle for the cavity <b>408</b> or the gap filler <b>414</b> may be calculated as the angle between the direction of air flow indicated by the arrow <b>422</b> across the cavity <b>408</b> or the gap filler <b>414</b> and the angle of the cavity <b>408</b> or the gap filler <b>414</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The different advantageous embodiments recognize and take into account that it would be advantageous to enable effective reworking of inconsistencies in a thermal protection system before, during, and after operation of an aerospace vehicle. It also would be advantageous to facilitate reworking of such inconsistencies in a way that minimizes the time required to assess various rework approaches and which maximizes the accuracy of the design for such rework. Another advantageous capability would be to increase the precision with which such rework can be designed and affected in short time periods. Increased precision and speed in reworking inconsistencies in a vehicle thermal protection system may be particularly important for aerospace vehicles that are in use on an operational mission.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">For example, consider the case of any type of aerospace vehicle that has ascended to orbit. While in orbit, inconsistencies in the vehicle thermal protection system may be discovered. Orbital missions of this type may have strict time limitations due to airframe limitations and limitations in fuel and crew provisions. Accordingly, it may be imperative that the effect of the inconsistency on aerodynamic heating during reentry be evaluated and that any necessary reworking be designed and effected while the vehicle is in orbit as quickly as possible, so as not to jeopardize the mission success.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Any necessary reworking of a vehicle thermal protection system may be made after an analysis of any discovered inconsistencies in the context of the operational environment, including the reentry environment. The different advantageous embodiments recognize and take into account that such an analysis preferably must include, among other considerations, a rapid and accurate determination of the cross flow angles of the reentry or other operational airstreams for the inconsistency. Information defining reentry or other operational airstreams for aerospace vehicles may be available from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) performance libraries and databases. The different advantageous embodiments recognize and take into account that rapid and effective evaluation and reworking of an inconsistency in the thermal protection system for such a vehicle may require quickly and accurately identifying the information in specific subsets of such performance libraries and databases for locations on the vehicle that are proximate to the identified inconsistencies.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The different advantageous embodiments provide a method and apparatus for determining cross flow angles for features in a surface of a structure. For example, the different advantageous embodiments provide a method and an apparatus for determining cross flow angles for features, such as inconsistencies, in a thermal protection system for an aerospace vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Advantageous embodiments may provide a method and apparatus for determining a cross flow angle for an inconsistency in the form of a cavity in a structure, such as a vehicle thermal protection system. In this example, a shear stress vector at the surface of the thermal protection system and a cavity angle may be used to determine automatically the cross flow angle for the cavity. A graphical output showing the computed cross flow angle along with a graphical representation of the cavity, the cavity angle, and air flow direction may be presented. The graphical output provides a graphical verification of the automated cross flow angle determination to a user.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Advantageous embodiments also may provide a method and apparatus for determining a cross flow angle for an inconsistency in the form of a protruding gap filler lodged between tiles of a vehicle thermal protection system. In this case, an angle between the side of a tile adjacent to the gap filler and a flow velocity vector at the location of the gap filler may be used to determine automatically the cross flow angle for the gap filler. An output showing the determined cross flow angle may be presented to a user in graphical form to provide a graphical verification of the cross flow angle determination to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The different advantageous embodiments recognize and take into account that an automated system and method for accurately determining cross flow angles for inconsistencies and other features in a vehicle thermal protection system may be implemented in a computer system. Such an automated system may generate and display cross flow angles in a more rapid, efficient, and user-friendly manner than current mostly manual methods for determining cross flow angles. Thus, the different advantageous embodiments provide systems and methods for rapidly and accurately analyzing inconsistencies and other features in a vehicle thermal protection system. The advantageous embodiments also provide systems and methods for more efficiently reworking such inconsistencies, if needed. This advantage is achieved by more efficiently determining the cross flow parameters needed to make the analysis required to ensure that such reworking will withstand the aerodynamic heating of thermal protection system structures, surfaces, tiles, gap fillers, cavities, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an illustration of a block diagram of an aerodynamic analysis environment is depicted in accordance with an advantageous embodiment. In this example, an aerodynamic analysis environment <b>500</b> may be used to perform an aerodynamic analysis for an aerospace vehicle, such as for the aerospace vehicle <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. For example, the aerodynamic analysis environment <b>500</b> may be used to perform an aerodynamic heating analysis <b>502</b> of the thermal protection system <b>216</b> for the aerospace vehicle <b>200</b>. In accordance with an advantageous embodiment, the aerodynamic analysis environment <b>500</b> may be an aerodynamic condition analyzer.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The aerodynamic analysis environment <b>500</b> may comprise a computer system <b>504</b>. The computer system <b>504</b> may include a number of computers <b>506</b> in this example. When more than one computer is present in the number of computers <b>506</b>, the number of computers <b>506</b> may be in communication with each other using wired or wireless communications links, or both. The number of computers <b>506</b> may be linked together by various communications links forming a network or other communications system.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In accordance with an advantageous embodiment, the aerodynamic analysis environment <b>500</b> may be implemented as a ground-based system, as a vehicle-based system, or as a system with the various functions thereof distributed between systems on the ground and systems in a vehicle. For example, without limitation, one or more functions of the aerodynamic analysis environment <b>500</b> may be implemented on board an aerospace vehicle, such as a spacecraft or aircraft. In any case, the aerodynamic analysis environment <b>500</b> may be used for aerodynamic analysis of a vehicle structure while the vehicle is in operation.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The aerodynamic heating analysis <b>502</b> may be performed using the number of computers <b>506</b>. Alternatively, the aerodynamic heating analysis <b>502</b> may be performed using an aerodynamic heating analyzer. The aerodynamic heating analysis <b>502</b> may employ a simulation <b>508</b>. The simulation <b>508</b> may comprise a simulation of aerodynamic heating of a structure <b>512</b>. The simulation <b>508</b> is run to obtain results <b>510</b>. The results <b>510</b> may comprise information describing the aerodynamic heating of the structure <b>512</b> for a particular scenario. The results <b>510</b> may be used to determine whether changes to the structure <b>512</b> are needed or desirable. For example, the results <b>510</b> may be used to determine whether maintenance, rework, or redesign of the structure <b>512</b> is needed or desirable. The simulation <b>508</b> may comprise any known computer implemented or other simulation of aerodynamic heating of a structure.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In one example, the structure <b>512</b> comprises a thermal protection system <b>516</b> or a portion <b>518</b> of a thermal protection system <b>516</b>. For example, the thermal protection system <b>216</b> of the aerospace vehicle <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may be one example of the thermal protection system <b>516</b> for the structure <b>512</b>. Locations on the structure <b>512</b> may be identified by coordinates in a coordinate system <b>519</b>. For example, the coordinate system <b>519</b> may be defined with respect to the structure <b>512</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In one embodiment, the thermal protection system <b>516</b> may be formed with a number of tiles. In this case, the portion <b>518</b> of the thermal protection system <b>516</b> may comprise, for example, a thermal insulating tile <b>520</b>. In other embodiments, the thermal protection system <b>516</b> may not be formed from tiles.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The portion <b>518</b> of the thermal protection system <b>516</b>, such as the thermal insulating tile <b>520</b>, may include one or more features <b>522</b>. For example, such features <b>522</b> may include a cavity <b>524</b> or a gap filler <b>526</b>. As discussed above, such features <b>522</b> may be caused by the impact of debris on the thermal protection system <b>516</b> or by other events.

Various parameters <b>530</b> may be used in running the simulation <b>508</b>. For determining the effects of the features <b>522</b> on the aerodynamic heating <b>514</b> of the structure <b>512</b>, one of the parameters <b>530</b> is a cross flow angle <b>532</b>.

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In accordance with an advantageous embodiment, the cross flow function <b>534</b> may generate the cross flow angle <b>532</b> at least in part from input information <b>536</b> provided by an information source <b>538</b>.

Alternatively, the determine cross flow function <b>550</b> may be implemented in a cross flow calculator in communication with the cross flow function <b>534</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In one example, the cavity or gap filler selection <b>548</b> may indicate that the cross flow angle <b>532</b> is to be calculated for the cavity <b>524</b>.

Preferably, the first point and the second point are selected to be approximately centered on the first side and the second side, respectively, of the cavity <b>524</b>. The first side and the second side of the cavity <b>524</b> preferably are opposite sides of the cavity <b>524</b> at the opposite ends of the longest dimension of the cavity <b>524</b> across the surface of the thermal insulating tile <b>520</b> or other portion <b>518</b> of the thermal protection system <b>516</b> or other structure <b>512</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The cavity angle <b>556</b> may identify the orientation of the longest dimension of the cavity <b>524</b> across the surface of the thermal insulating tile <b>520</b> or other portion <b>518</b> of the thermal protection system <b>516</b> or other structure <b>512</b>. As will be described in more detail below, the cavity angle <b>556</b> may be determined by the determine cross flow function <b>550</b> from the cavity coordinates <b>554</b>. Alternatively, the cavity angle <b>556</b> may be entered by the user <b>540</b> as part of the input information <b>536</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The shear stress <b>558</b> is the shear stress at the location of the cavity <b>524</b> on the thermal insulating tile <b>520</b> or other portion <b>518</b> of the thermal protection system <b>516</b> or other structure <b>512</b>. The shear stress <b>558</b> also may be referred to as flow velocity at the location of the cavity <b>524</b>.

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As another alternative, the shear stress <b>558</b> at the location of the cavity <b>524</b> may be obtained or derived from information stored in a shear stress database <b>564</b>. For example, without limitation, the shear stress database <b>564</b> may contain database entries for multiple point locations on the structure <b>512</b>. Each such database entry may comprise shear stress properties for a corresponding point location on the structure <b>512</b> as calculated for a particular scenario. In one example, without limitation, the shear stress database <b>564</b> may contain shear stress properties for point locations on the surface of a space shuttle as calculated for a space shuttle reentry scenario at Mach 18.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The cross flow function <b>534</b> may employ a determine closest point function <b>566</b> to identify which database entry <b>568</b> in the shear stress database <b>564</b> contains the shear stress information that is to be used to determine the cross flow angle <b>532</b> for a particular cavity <b>524</b>.

The determine closest point function <b>566</b> may identify the desired database entry <b>568</b> using the cavity coordinates <b>554</b>. For example, a cavity point location <b>569</b> may be determined to be the location of a center point between the two end points entered as the cavity coordinates <b>554</b>, as described above. Distances between the determined cavity point location <b>569</b> and point locations on the structure <b>512</b> for which entries are provided in the shear stress database <b>564</b> may be determined. Efficient implementation of this distance determination will depend upon how point locations are represented in the shear stress database <b>564</b>. The database entry <b>568</b> for a point location on the structure <b>512</b> having the shortest determined distance to the cavity point location <b>569</b> may be selected as the database entry <b>568</b> from which shear stress information for the cavity <b>524</b> is obtained. The shear angle <b>560</b> for the cavity <b>524</b> also may be determined from the shear stress information retrieved from the selected database entry <b>568</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The shear angle <b>560</b> is the angle of the shear stress <b>558</b> at the location of the cavity <b>524</b>.

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The cutoff angle <b>562</b> is an angle value under which cross flow is to be considered negligible. In accordance with an advantageous embodiment, a default value for the cutoff angle <b>562</b> may be provided. For example, without limitation, the default value for the cutoff angle <b>562</b> may be about 30 degrees. The user <b>540</b> may override the default cutoff angle value by entering a different value for the cutoff angle <b>562</b> as the input information <b>536</b>. In one advantageous embodiment, any value for the cutoff angle <b>562</b> up to about 45 degrees may be acceptable for entry by the user <b>540</b> as the input information <b>536</b>. A limit of about 45 degrees for the value of the cutoff angle <b>562</b> may be provided, for example, because the determine cross flow function <b>550</b> may employ a flip cavity function <b>563</b>. The flip cavity function <b>563</b> may operate to switch the cavity direction by about 90 degrees if the angle between the flow and the cavity centerline exceeds about 45 degrees.</p>

The gap filler information <b>570</b> may be used by the determine cross flow function <b>550</b> to determine the cross flow angle <b>532</b> for the gap filler <b>526</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Program code <b>618</b> is located in a functional form on computer readable media <b>620</b> that is selectively removable and may be loaded onto or transferred to the data processing system <b>600</b> for execution by the processor unit <b>604</b>. The program code <b>618</b> and the computer readable media <b>620</b> form a computer program product <b>622</b>. In one example, the computer readable media <b>620</b> may be computer readable storage media <b>624</b> or computer readable signal media <b>626</b>. The computer readable storage media <b>624</b> may include, for example, an optical or magnetic disk that is inserted or placed into a drive or other device that is part of the persistent storage <b>608</b> for transfer onto a storage device, such as a hard drive, that is part of the persistent storage <b>608</b>. The computer readable storage media <b>624</b> also may take the form of a persistent storage, such as a hard drive, a thumb drive, or a flash memory, that is connected to the data processing system <b>600</b>. In some instances, the computer readable storage media <b>624</b> may not be removable from the data processing system <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Alternatively, the program code <b>618</b> may be transferred to the data processing system <b>600</b> using the computer readable signal media <b>626</b>.

As one example, the data processing system <b>600</b> may include organic components integrated with inorganic components and/or may be comprised entirely of organic components excluding a human being. For example, a storage device may be comprised of an organic semiconductor.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In another advantageous example, the processor unit <b>604</b> may take the form of a hardware unit that has circuits that are manufactured or configured for a particular use. This type of hardware may perform operations without needing program code to be loaded into a memory from a storage device to be configured to perform the operations.</p>

<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Turning next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a cavity in a thermal insulating tile is depicted in accordance with an advantageous embodiment. A cavity <b>702</b> is an example of a feature for which a cross flow angle may be determined in accordance with an advantageous embodiment. In this example, a thermal tile <b>700</b> and the cavity <b>702</b> may be examples of the thermal insulating tile <b>520</b> and the cavity <b>524</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The thermal tile <b>700</b> and the cavity <b>702</b> are presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> as notional examples for illustrating advantageous embodiments. Neither the thermal tile <b>700</b> nor the cavity <b>702</b> is intended to represent an actual structure.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">A location and orientation of the cavity <b>702</b> may be identified by a first point <b>704</b> and a second point <b>706</b>. The first point <b>704</b> is located on a first side <b>705</b> of the cavity <b>702</b>. The second point <b>706</b> is located on a second side <b>707</b> of the cavity <b>702</b>. Preferably, the first point <b>704</b> is selected to be approximately centered on the first side <b>705</b>, and the second point <b>706</b> is selected to be approximately centered on the second side <b>707</b>. The first side <b>705</b> and the second side <b>707</b> preferably are opposite sides of the cavity <b>702</b> located at opposite ends of the longest dimension of the cavity <b>702</b> across the surface of the thermal tile <b>700</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Locations of the first point <b>704</b> and the second point <b>706</b> in physical space may be identified by coordinates of a three-dimensional coordinate system. For example, three-dimensional coordinates may be used to locate the first point <b>704</b> and the second point <b>706</b> in a three-dimensional coordinate system defined with respect to a structure to which the thermal tile <b>700</b> is attached. In this example, the location of the first point <b>704</b> is defined by coordinates (7, &#x2212;15, 24). The location of the second point <b>706</b> is defined by coordinates (8, &#x2212;13, 24).</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In accordance with an advantageous embodiment, the orientation of a line <b>708</b> extending between the first point <b>704</b> and the second point <b>706</b> defines an orientation of the cavity <b>702</b> in the coordinate space. In this disclosure, the orientation of the cavity <b>702</b> also may be referred to as the cavity angle or as the angle of the feature. The cavity angle for the cavity <b>702</b> may be determined from the locations of the first point <b>704</b> and the second point <b>706</b> using standard geometric calculations appropriate for the relevant coordinate system.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">A first vector <b>710</b> indicates sheer stress in an X direction in the coordinate system at the location of the cavity <b>702</b> in the coordinate system. In this example, the first vector <b>710</b> has a shear stress magnitude of 300 in the X direction. A second vector <b>712</b> indicates shear stress in a Y direction in the coordinate system at the location of the cavity <b>702</b> in the coordinate system. In this example, the second vector <b>712</b> has a shear stress magnitude of 250 in the Y direction. Shear stress may be referred to alternatively as flow velocity at the surface of the thermal tile <b>700</b> in the location of the cavity <b>702</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The orientation of a third vector <b>714</b> represents the shear angle at the location of the cavity <b>702</b> in the coordinate system. The shear angle may be referred to alternatively as the flow angle. The third vector <b>714</b> may be derived from the X and Y components of the shear stress represented by the first vector <b>710</b> and the second vector <b>712</b> in a known manner.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an example user interface in accordance with an advantageous embodiment is illustrated. In this example, a user interface <b>800</b> is an example of a user interface for obtaining cavity information from a user. The cavity information obtained from the user via the user interface <b>800</b> may be used for determining a cross flow angle for the cavity. In this example, the user interface <b>800</b> is one example of an implementation of the user interface <b>544</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The user interface <b>800</b> may prompt a user to select either a first radio button <b>802</b> or a second radio button <b>804</b>. If the first radio button <b>802</b> is selected, the user may enter three-dimensional coordinate information for a cavity. For example, without limitation, the user may be prompted to enter first three-dimensional coordinates <b>806</b> for the midpoint of one side of the cavity and second three-dimensional coordinates <b>808</b> for the midpoint of the opposite side of the cavity. In this example, the coordinates for the cavity <b>702</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> have been entered into the user interface <b>800</b> after the user selected the first radio button <b>802</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">If the second radio button <b>804</b> is selected, the user may enter a cavity angle <b>810</b>. As mentioned elsewhere in this disclosure, if the cavity angle <b>810</b> is not entered directly via the user interface <b>800</b>, the cavity angle for the cavity may be determined from the provided first three-dimensional coordinates <b>806</b> and the second three-dimensional coordinates <b>808</b> in a known manner.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The user interface <b>800</b> also may prompt the user to select alternatively a third radio button <b>812</b>, a fourth radio button <b>814</b>, or a fifth radio button <b>816</b>. If the third radio button <b>812</b> is selected, the user may enter magnitude values <b>818</b> for the shear stress in the X and Y directions at the location of the cavity. In this example, shear stress magnitudes for the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> have been entered into the user interface <b>800</b> after the user selected the third radio button <b>812</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">If the fourth radio button <b>814</b> is selected, a shear angle <b>820</b> at the cavity location may be entered. As mentioned elsewhere in this disclosure, if the shear angle <b>820</b> is not entered directly by the user via the user interface <b>800</b>, the shear angle for the cavity location may be determined from the X and Y component shear stress magnitude values <b>818</b> in a known manner.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">If the fifth radio button <b>816</b> is selected, the shear angle for the cavity location will be determined from shear stress information stored in a shear stress database. For example, without limitation, the shear stress database may comprise a number of database entries for a number of point locations on a structure. Each of the database entries may comprise shear stress information for the corresponding point location on the structure as determined for a particular scenario. In this example, the shear stress information in the shear stress database may comprise shear stress information determined for a space shuttle reentry scenario at Mach 18.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The database entry in the shear stress database from which the shear stress information will be obtained may be identified by first determining a point location for the cavity. For example, the point location for the cavity may be determined as the center point location between the locations of the points on the opposite sides of the cavity that were entered to identify the cavity location. Once the point location for the cavity is determined, the database entry in the shear stress database for the point location on the structure that is closest to the cavity point location may be identified. The shear stress information may then be obtained from this identified database entry to determine the shear angle for the cavity location.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The user interface <b>800</b> also may prompt the user to enter a cutoff angle <b>822</b>. The cutoff angle <b>822</b> is the angle under which cross flow is to be considered negligible. In accordance with an advantageous embodiment, a default value for the cutoff angle <b>822</b> may be provided in the user interface <b>800</b>. The user may use the user interface <b>800</b> to override the default cutoff angle value.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">After entering the information required by the user interface <b>800</b>, the user may be prompted to select a go button <b>824</b>. Selecting the go button <b>824</b> may initiate the automatic determination of a cross flow angle for the defined cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, an example output presentation is depicted in accordance with an advantageous embodiment. An example output presentation <b>900</b> displays a cavity cross flow angle. In this example, the output presentation <b>900</b> is one example of the cross flow angle output <b>592</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The output presentation <b>900</b> displays the results of a cross flow angle determination for a cavity in multiple forms. For example, the cavity cross flow angle may be presented in a textual form <b>902</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The shear or flow angle with respect to the structure coordinate system at the location of the cavity on the structure may be represented in graphical form in the output presentation <b>900</b> as a flow line <b>904</b>. In this example, the flow line <b>904</b> is overlaid on normalized axes <b>906</b>. The angle of the flow line <b>904</b> with respect to the axes <b>906</b> indicates the shear or flow angle.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">A cavity representation <b>908</b> also may be included in the output presentation <b>900</b>. In this example, the cavity representation <b>908</b> may be a rough representation of the cavity that is provided to indicate the cavity angle with respect to the structure coordinate system. For example, without limitation, the cavity representation <b>908</b> may be a rectangle centered on the axes <b>906</b> with the orientation of the long axis of the rectangle indicating the cavity angle. A cavity centerline <b>910</b> also may be displayed in the output presentation <b>900</b>. The cavity centerline <b>910</b> may be shown to run perpendicular to the long axis of the cavity representation <b>908</b>. The orientation of the cavity centerline <b>910</b> also indicates the cavity angle. The angle between the flow line <b>904</b> and the cavity centerline <b>910</b> provides a graphical indication of the cross flow angle. The combined display of the flow line <b>904</b>, the cavity representation <b>908</b>, and the cavity centerline <b>910</b> in the output presentation <b>900</b> thus may provide for easy visual verification by a user of the cross flow angle determination.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The cross flow angle output presentation <b>900</b> may include additional graphics or other information to assist a user in understanding or verifying the cross flow angle determination being presented. For example, without limitation, a structure representation <b>912</b> may be provided in the output presentation <b>900</b>. The structure representation <b>912</b> may be a representation of the structure on which the cavity is located. The structure representation <b>912</b> may be provided to illustrate the orientation of the axes <b>906</b> with respect to the structure. In this example, the structure representation <b>912</b> is a representation of a space shuttle orbiter.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Coordinates <b>914</b> and <b>916</b> and shear stress vectors <b>918</b> also may be displayed in the cavity cross flow angle output presentation <b>900</b>. The displayed coordinates <b>914</b> and <b>916</b> may be the coordinates for the cavity that were entered by the user. The displayed shear stress vectors <b>918</b> may represent graphically and numerically the direction and magnitude of the shear stress that was used to determine the cross flow angle.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, another example of a user interface is depicted in accordance with an advantageous embodiment. In this example, a user interface <b>1000</b> is an example of a user interface for obtaining a tile identification from a user. The tile identification may be used for determining a cross flow angle for a gap filler lodged in a gap adjacent to the tile. In this example, the user interface <b>1000</b> is another example of the user interface <b>544</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The user interface <b>1000</b> may prompt the user to enter the identification of a tile adjacent to a gap filler for which a cross flow angle is to be determined. For example, without limitation, the user interface <b>1000</b> may prompt the user to enter a tile identification number <b>1002</b> to identify the tile. The entered tile identification number <b>1002</b> may be used to retrieve tile information for the identified tile from a tile database. The retrieved tile information may be used to generate the next user interface to be described herein. After the tile identification number <b>1002</b> is entered, the user may be prompted to select a map it button <b>1004</b> to proceed to the next user interface.</p>

<p id="p-0136" num="0135">A pull-down menu <b>1112</b> or other interface may prompt the user to make a side selection by selecting one of the sides of the represented tile that is adjacent to the gap filler for which a cross flow angle is to be calculated. After a side selection is made, the side of the graphical representation <b>1102</b> corresponding to the side of the tile that was selected may be highlighted. For example, without limitation, the side of the graphical representation <b>1102</b> corresponding to the side of the tile selected may be displayed with a different color or line width. The side selection made using the pull-down menu <b>1112</b> may be locked by the user by selecting a lock selection button <b>1114</b>. As discussed above, the side selection may be used to determine the angle of the gap filler. For example, the angle of the gap filler may be determined to be the angle of the selected side of the tile adjacent to the gap filler. The angle of the selected side of the tile may be determined from the tile information for the tile in the tile database.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The user interface <b>1100</b> also may prompt the user to enter edge velocity values <b>1116</b> for the location of the gap filler.

The representation <b>1204</b> may represent the shape of the tile and the orientation of the tile with respect to the structure on which the tile is located. In this example, the represented tile is triangular in shape. The coordinate grid <b>1206</b> may show a part of the coordinate system for the structure on which the tile is located. Coordinates <b>1214</b>, <b>1216</b>, and <b>1218</b> for the corners of the tile in this coordinate system also may be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">A flow line <b>1208</b> also may be displayed on the output presentation <b>1200</b>. The flow line <b>1208</b> may be displayed overlaid on the representation <b>1204</b> of the tile and the coordinate grid <b>1206</b>. For example, the flow line <b>1208</b> may intersect a side <b>1210</b> of the representation <b>1204</b> of the tile corresponding to the selected side of the tile adjacent to the gap filler. The flow line <b>1208</b> may intersect the side <b>1210</b> of the representation <b>1204</b> of the tile at the midpoint thereof. As discussed above, the center of the side of the tile adjacent to the gap filler may correspond to the determined point location of the gap filler. Thus, the intersection point of the flow line <b>1208</b> and the side <b>1210</b> may indicate the location of the gap filler for which the cross flow angle is determined.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">As discussed above, the orientation of the side <b>1210</b> corresponds to the gap filler angle. The orientation of the flow line <b>1208</b> may indicate the flow angle for the location of the gap filler. The flow angle for the location of the gap filler may be determined from the edge velocity for the location of the gap filler in a known manner. The angle between the flow line <b>1208</b> and the side <b>1210</b> provides a visual indication of the cross flow angle. The combined display of the flow line <b>1208</b> and the representation <b>1204</b> of the tile in the output presentation <b>1200</b> may thus provide for easy visual verification of the cross flow angle determination by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">The output presentation <b>1200</b> may include additional graphics or information to assist understanding or verification of the cross flow angle determination presented. For example, a structure representation <b>1212</b> may be displayed on output presentation <b>1200</b>. The structure representation <b>1212</b> may be a representation of the structure on which the tile and the gap filler is located. The structure representation <b>1212</b> may be displayed to illustrate the orientation of the coordinate grid <b>1206</b> with respect to the structure. In this example, the structure representation <b>1212</b> is a representation of a space shuttle orbiter.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Velocity vectors <b>1220</b> also may be displayed in the output presentation <b>1200</b>. For example, the velocity vectors <b>1220</b> may present graphically and numerically the direction and magnitude of the edge velocity at the location of the gap filler that was used to determine the displayed cross flow angle.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, an illustration of a flowchart of a process for determining a cross flow angle is depicted in accordance with an advantageous embodiment. The process illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> may be implemented, for example, in the aerodynamic analysis environment <b>500</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">A process for determining a cross flow angle in accordance with an advantageous embodiment may begin by receiving location information identifying a location of a feature on a structure (operation <b>1300</b>). For example, the feature may be a cavity, gap filler, or other inconsistency or other feature that may affect the aerodynamic characteristics of the structure. The location information may be received, for example, by a computer system from a user via a user interface. The location information may comprise, for example, without limitation, coordinate information or information identifying a tile in a thermal protection system associated with the feature.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">An angle of the feature is then determined (operation <b>1302</b>). The angle of the feature may be determined with respect to a coordinate system that is defined with respect to the structure on which the feature is located. For example, the angle of the feature may be determined using the location information received in the operation <b>1300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">A database entry for the location is identified in a database comprising flow information for a plurality of points on the structure (operation <b>1304</b>). The flow information may describe a flow of fluid across the structure. The operation <b>1304</b> may include determining a point location for the feature. The database entry may then be identified as the database entry for the point on the structure that is closest to the point location. The flow information for the identified database entry may then be retrieved (operation <b>1306</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">A flow angle is then determined using the retrieved flow information (operation <b>1308</b>). The flow angle may comprise an angle of the flow of fluid across the structure for the location of the feature. The cross flow angle for the feature may then be determined from the flow angle and the angle of the feature (operation <b>1310</b>). The determined cross flow angle may then be presented to a user (operation <b>1312</b>). For example, the operation <b>1312</b> may comprise presenting the cross flow angle to the user in multiple formats as part of a presentation displayed on a display device. After the cross flow angle is presented to the user, the process may terminate.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref>, illustrations of a flowchart of another process for determining cross flow angles is depicted in accordance with an advantageous embodiment. The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref> also may be implemented, for example, in the aerodynamic analysis environment <b>500</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">A user may initially select whether a cross flow angle determination is to be performed for a cavity or for a gap filler (operation <b>1400</b>). The operation <b>1400</b> may include presenting a mechanism on a user interface for the user to select either a cross flow angle determination for a cavity or a cross flow angle determination for a gap filler.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Responsive to selecting a cross flow angle determination for a cavity at the operation <b>1400</b>, a user interface for collecting cavity and flow information may be displayed (operation <b>1402</b>). The user then enters the requested cavity and flow information via the user interface (operation <b>1404</b>). Cavity information provided by the user at the operation <b>1404</b> may comprise cavity coordinate information or cavity angle information.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Cavity coordinate information may include the coordinates of midpoints of opposite sides of the cavity. Flow information provided by the user at the operation <b>1404</b> may comprise shear stress information for the location of the cavity, shear angle information for the cavity location, or an indication to retrieve flow information for the location of the cavity from a database.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The operation <b>1404</b> also may include the user entering a cutoff angle or modifying a default cutoff angle provided on the user interface. After entering the required information at the operation <b>1404</b>, the user may initiate the cross flow angle determination (operation <b>1406</b>). The operation <b>1406</b> may include selecting a button in the graphical user interface provided in the operation <b>1402</b> to initiate the determination.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">After initiating the cross flow angle determination, it may be determined whether the user entered or modified cutoff angle is less than 45 degrees (operation <b>1408</b>). Only cutoff angles of less than 45 degrees make sense in the cross flow angle determination to be performed. Therefore, if the user entered or modified cutoff angle is not less than 45 degrees, the process terminates.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">If the user entered or modified cutoff angle is less than 45 degrees, it may be determined whether a cavity angle was entered directly at the operation <b>1404</b> (operation <b>1410</b>). If it is determined that a cavity angle was entered directly, the cavity angle is set to the entered angle (operation <b>1412</b>). If it is determined that a cavity angle was not entered directly, the cavity angle is calculated (operation <b>1416</b>). The operation <b>1416</b> may comprise determining the cavity angle from the cavity coordinate information entered at the operation <b>1404</b>. For example, the operation <b>1416</b> may include determining the cavity angle as the orientation of a line extending through the midpoints of the opposite sides of the cavity for which coordinates were entered in the operation <b>1404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">After the cavity angle is determined by the operation <b>1412</b> or the operation <b>1416</b>, it may be determined whether a shear angle was entered directly in the operation <b>1404</b> (operation <b>1418</b>). If a shear angle was entered directly, the flow angle is set to the entered angle (operation <b>1420</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">If a flow angle was not entered directly, it may be determined whether the user indicated that the flow angle should be determined from flow information for the cavity location that is obtained from a database (operation <b>1422</b>). If it is determined that the flow information is to be retrieved from a database, the flow information for the location of the cavity is retrieved from a database (operation <b>1424</b>). The operation <b>1424</b> may include identifying the database entry for a point on the structure that is closest to a point location of the cavity (operation <b>1426</b>) and then retrieving the flow information for the database entry for the closest point (operation <b>1428</b>). The operation <b>1426</b> may include determining the point location for the cavity as the location of the midpoint between the midpoints of the opposite sides of the cavity for which coordinates were entered in the operation <b>1404</b>. The flow angle for the location of the cavity then may be determined from the flow information retrieved from the database in the operation <b>1424</b> (operation <b>1430</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">If it is determined at the operation <b>1422</b> that flow information from a database will not be used to determine the flow angle, then the flow angle may be determined at step <b>1430</b> from the shear stress information entered at the operation <b>1404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">After determining the flow angle at the operation <b>1420</b> or the operation <b>1430</b>, the cross flow angle for the cavity may be determined (operation <b>1434</b>). The cross flow angle may be determined as the angle between the cavity angle and the flow angle. It may be determined whether the cross flow angle is greater than 45 degrees (operation <b>1436</b>). If it is determined that the cross flow angle is not greater than 45 degrees, the cross flow angle may be displayed (operation <b>1438</b>), with the process terminating thereafter. The operation <b>1438</b> may include generating and presenting textual and graphical representations of the cross flow angle on a user display device.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">If the cross flow angle is determined to be greater than 45 degrees, the orientation of the cavity angle used to determine the cross flow angle may be flipped by 90 degrees (operation <b>1440</b>). For example, the orientation of the cavity angle may be flipped by flipping the X and Y axes in the coordinate system in which the cavity angle is represented. Thus, if the cross flow angle is greater than 45 degrees, the long edge of the cavity may be moved from more parallel to the X axis to more perpendicular to the X axis. For example, if the cross flow angle determined in the operation <b>1434</b> is 80 degrees, the operation <b>1440</b> would make the short edge of the cavity more parallel to the X axis, and the new cross flow angle would be 10 degrees. The cross flow angle may then be displayed in the operation <b>1438</b>, with the process terminating thereafter. The operation <b>1440</b> makes it so the cross flow angle displayed in the operation <b>1438</b> never exceeds 45 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Returning now to the operation <b>1400</b>, in response to a user selecting a cross flow angle calculation for a gap filler at the operation <b>1400</b>, a user interface for the user to identify a tile may displayed (operation <b>1442</b>). The user may enter the requested tile identification via the interface (operation <b>1444</b>). For example, the operation <b>1444</b> may include the user entering a tile number or other identification of a tile adjacent to the gap filler.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">After the user identifies a tile, a tile database is searched for tile information for the identified tile (operation <b>1446</b>). It may be determined whether tile information for the tile is found in the tile database (operation <b>1448</b>). If information for the tile identified in the operation <b>1444</b> is not found in the tile database, an error may be indicated (operation <b>1450</b>). The process then may return to the operation <b>1442</b>, where the user may enter another tile identification. If tile information for the identified tile is found in the operation <b>1448</b>, the tile information for the identified tile may be retrieved (operation <b>1452</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">A user interface for making side and edge velocity selections may then be displayed to the user (operation <b>1454</b>). The operation <b>1454</b> may include generating the user interface using the tile information retrieved in the operation <b>1452</b>. For example, user interface displayed in the operation <b>1454</b> may include a graphical representation of the identified tile. The graphical representation of the tile may be generated based on shape and orientation information for the tile in the tile information retrieved from the tile database.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">The user then may select a side of the tile and may enter edge velocity information for the location of the gap filler using the provided interface (operation <b>1456</b>). For example, the user may select the side of the tile adjacent to the gap filler for which the cross flow angle is to be determined. The user may make this side selection by selecting the appropriate side of the representation of the tile displayed in the user interface. The operation <b>1456</b> also may include entering X and Y component edge velocity values for the location of the gap filler. Alternatively, the operation <b>1456</b> may include selecting by the user an option to retrieve edge velocity information stored in an edge velocity database.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">A point location of the gap filler may then be determined (operation <b>1458</b>). For example, the operation <b>1458</b> may include determining the point location of the gap filler as the midpoint of the tile side selected by the user in the operation <b>1456</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">It may then be determined whether the user indicated at the operation <b>1456</b> that edge velocity information for the location of the gap filler is to be retrieved from a database (operation <b>1460</b>). If it is determined that edge velocity information is to be retrieved from a database, the edge velocity information is retrieved from the database (operation <b>1462</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">The operation <b>1462</b> may include identifying the database entry in the edge velocity database for a point on the structure that is closest to the point location of the gap filler (operation <b>1464</b>). The operation <b>1464</b> may include identifying the database entry for the closest point to the point location of the gap filler using the point location of the gap filler determined in the operation <b>1458</b>. The edge velocity information may then be retrieved from the database entry for the point closest to the location of the gap filler (operation <b>1466</b>). A flow angle may then be determined in a known manner from the edge velocity information retrieved from the database (operation <b>1468</b>). If the user did not indicate at the operation <b>1460</b> that edge velocity information is to be retrieved from an edge velocity database to determine the flow angle, the X and Y component edge velocity values entered at the operation <b>1456</b> may be used to determine the flow angle in a known manner in the operation <b>1468</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">The cross flow angle for the gap filler then may be determined (operation <b>1470</b>). The operation <b>1470</b> may include determining the cross flow angle as the dot product of the flow angle determined in the operation <b>1468</b> and the angle of the selected tile side as determined from the tile information retrieved from the tile database in the operation <b>1452</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">The cross flow angle may then be displayed (operation <b>1472</b>), with the process terminating thereafter. The operation <b>1472</b> may include generating and presenting a textual and graphical display of the cross flow angle on a user display device.</p>
