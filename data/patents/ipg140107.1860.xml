<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Various embodiments are directed to a surgical instrument comprising a handle, a shaft coupled to the handle and extending along a longitudinal axis, an end effector, and a cable. The end effector may comprise a first jaw member, a second jaw member and a reciprocating member. The cable may extend distally from the handle through the shaft to a first pulley of the first jaw member. From the first pulley, the cable may extend proximally to the reciprocating member, such that proximally directed motion of the cable exerts a distally directed force on the reciprocating member.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Various embodiments are directed to cable actuated end effectors for surgical instruments and surgical instruments having cable-actuated end effectors.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Minimally invasive procedures are desirable because such procedures can reduce pain and provide relatively quick recovery times as compared to conventional open medical procedures. Many minimally invasive procedures are performed with an endoscope (including without limitation laparoscopes). Such procedures permit a physician to position, manipulate, and view medical instruments and accessories inside the patient through a small access opening in the patient's body. Laparoscopy is a term used to describe such an &#x201c;endosurgical&#x201d; approach using an endoscope (often a rigid laparoscope). In this type of procedure, accessory devices (such as end effectors for creating energy-induced tissue welds) are inserted into a patient through trocars placed through the body wall. Still less invasive treatments include those that are performed through insertion of an endoscope through a natural body orifice to a treatment region. Examples of this approach include, but are not limited to, cystoscopy, hysteroscopy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and colonoscopy.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many of these procedures employ a flexible endoscope during the procedure. Flexible endoscopes often have a flexible, steerable articulating section near the distal end that can be controlled by the clinician by utilizing controls at the proximal end. Some flexible endoscopes are relatively small (1 mm to 3 mm in diameter), and may have no integral accessory channel (also called biopsy channels or working channels). Other flexible endoscopes, including gastroscopes and colonoscopes, have integral working channels having a diameter of about 2.0 to 3.7 mm for the purpose of introducing and removing medical devices and other accessory devices to perform diagnosis or therapy within the patient. For example, end effectors for creating an energy-induced weld or seal. Certain specialized endoscopes or steerable overtubes are available, such as large working channel endoscopes having a working channel of 5 mm, or larger, in diameter, which can be used to pass relatively large accessories, or to provide capability to suction large blood clots. Other specialized endoscopes include those having two or more working channels.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A common task both in minimally invasive and open surgical environments is to grasp, cut and fasten tissue while leaving the cut ends hemostatic (e.g., not bleeding). For example, it is often desirable to cut and seal bodily lumens, such as individual blood vessels or tissue including various vasculature. When sealing a fluid-carrying bodily lumen, it is often necessary for the seal to have sufficient strength to prevent leakage of the fluid, which may exert considerable fluid pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Instruments exist for simultaneously making a longitudinal incision in tissue and fastening the tissue on opposing sides of the incision. Such instruments commonly include an end effector having a pair of cooperating jaw members that, if the instrument is intended for minimally invasive applications, are capable of passing through a cannula passageway or endoscopic working channel. In use, the clinician is able to close the jaw members to clamp the tissue to be cut. A reciprocating cutting instrument (or knife) is drawn distally along the jaw members to transect the clamped tissue. Simultaneously, a fastening mechanism fastens the cut ends of the tissue on opposing sides of the incision. Known fastening mechanisms include staples, sutures or various instruments utilizing energy sources. For example, various energy sources such as radiofrequency (RF) sources, ultrasound sources and lasers have been developed to coagulate, seal or join together tissue volumes.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Various embodiments are directed to cable actuated end effectors and surgical instruments comprising cable actuated end effectors. According to various embodiments, an end effector may comprise a pair of jaw members. One or both of the jaw members may be pivotable relative to one another such that the jaw members may transition from an open position to a closed position (or vice versa). A first cable may be routed from a handle of the surgical instrument through a shaft of the surgical instrumet to a pulley position within at least one of the jaw members. From the pulley, the cable may be routed proximally to a reciprocating member. A second cable may be routed from the reciprocating member to the handle via a shaft. To close the jaw members, a proximally directed force may be applied to the first cable. This may, in turn, cause the reciprocating member to be translated distally through slots in the jaw members. Flanges of the reciprocating member may ride above the slots tending to close the jaw members with a compressive force. To open the jaw members, a proximally directed force may be applied to the second cable, which may pull the reciprocating member proximally, allowing the jaw members to open.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a transection and sealing instrument <b>100</b>. The instrument <b>100</b> may be used with an endoscope, laparoscope, or any other suitable introduction device. According to various embodiments, the transection and sealing instrument <b>100</b> may comprise a handle assembly <b>102</b>, a shaft <b>104</b> and an end effector <b>106</b>. The shaft <b>104</b> may be rigid (e.g., for laparoscopic application and/or open surgical application) or flexible, as shown, (e.g., for endoscopic application). In various embodiments, the shaft <b>104</b> may comprise one or more articulation points. The end effector <b>106</b> may comprise a first jaw member <b>108</b> and a second jaw member <b>110</b>. The first jaw member <b>108</b> and second jaw member <b>110</b> may be connected to a clevis <b>112</b>, which, in turn, may be coupled to the shaft <b>104</b>. In various embodiments, as illustrated below, the jaw members <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> may be directly coupled to the shaft <b>104</b> and the clevis <b>112</b> may be omitted. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the end effector <b>106</b> is shown with the jaw members <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> in an open position. A reciprocating member <b>340</b> is illustrated between the jaw members <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to various embodiments, one or both of the jaw members <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> may include, or serve as electrodes in monopolar or bi-polar electrosurgical applications including, for example, cutting, coagulation and welding. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates one embodiment of the transection and sealing instrument <b>100</b> for use in electrosurgical applications. The jaw members <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> of the end effector <b>106</b> may comprise respective electrodes <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>. The electrodes <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> may be connected to an electrosurgical generator <b>124</b> via wires (not shown) extending from the end effector <b>106</b> through the shaft <b>104</b> and handle <b>102</b>. The generator <b>124</b> may generate any suitable type of signal for electrosurgical applications. For example, the generator <b>124</b> may make various alternating current (A/C) and/or direct current (D/C) signals at suitable voltages, currents, frequencies and wave patterns. According to various embodiments, the transection and sealing instrument <b>100</b> may be configured for monopolar operation. In this case, the end effector <b>106</b> may comprise a single electrode, rather than two. According to various embodiments, all or a portion of the end effector <b>106</b> may serve as the single electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A translating member <b>116</b> may extend within the shaft <b>104</b> from the end effector <b>106</b> to the handle <b>102</b>. The translating member <b>116</b> may be made from any suitable material. For example, the translating member <b>116</b> may be, a metal wire (e.g., a tri-layered steel cable), a plastic or metal shaft, etc. In some embodiments, one or more additional translating members (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) may be included to control the motion of the end effector <b>106</b> and/or the shaft <b>104</b>. In various embodiments, the instrument <b>100</b> may comprise multiple translating members <b>116</b>, for example, as described below. At the handle <b>102</b>, the shaft <b>104</b> may be directly or indirectly coupled to an actuator <b>113</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In use, a clinician may cause the actuator <b>113</b> to pivot along arrow <b>118</b> from a first position to a second position. When the actuator moves from the first position to the second position, it may translate the translating member <b>116</b> distally or proximally. Distal or proximal motion of the translating member <b>116</b> may, in turn, cause the end effector <b>106</b> to transition from an open position to a closed position (or vice versa) and/or to perform various other surgical activities such as, for example, severing and/or joining or welding. According to various embodiments, the handle <b>102</b> may comprise multiple actuators <b>113</b>. When multiple actuators <b>113</b> are present, each actuator <b>113</b> may be used by a clinician to cause the end effector <b>106</b> to perform different surgical activities. In various embodiments a single actuator <b>113</b> may cause the end effector <b>106</b> to perform more than one activity. For example, a clinician may activate a single actuator <b>113</b> to force a reciprocating member <b>340</b> distally. This may, as described, both close the jaw members <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> and transect any tissue between the jaw members <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> illustrate one embodiment of an end effector <b>106</b> of the instrument <b>100</b> adapted for transecting captured tissue and contemporaneous sealing of the captured tissue with RF energy delivery. The end effector <b>106</b> is carried at the distal end <b>304</b> of the shaft <b>104</b> that can be rigid, articulatable or deflectable in any suitable diameter. For example, the shaft <b>104</b> can have a diameter ranging from about 2 mm to 20 mm to cooperate with cannulae in endoscopic/laparoscopic surgeries or for use in open surgical procedures. The shaft <b>104</b> extends from a proximal handle, such as the handle <b>102</b>. The handle <b>102</b> can be any type of pistol-grip or other type of handle known in the art that carries actuator levers, triggers or sliders for moving the translating member <b>116</b> or members distally and proximally to actuate the jaws as will be disclosed below. The shaft <b>104</b> has a bore <b>308</b> extending therethrough for carrying actuator mechanisms (e.g., translating member <b>116</b>) for actuating the jaws and for carrying electrical leads <b>309</b><i>a</i>-<b>309</b><i>b </i>for the electrosurgical components of the end effector <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> show details of the end effector <b>106</b>, including the (upper) jaw element <b>108</b> and (lower) jaw element <b>110</b> that are adapted to close or approximate along an axis <b>315</b>. The jaw elements <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> may both be moveable or a single jaw may rotate to provide the open and closed positions. In the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, both the lower and upper jaws <b>110</b>, <b>108</b> are moveable relative to a rolling pivot location <b>316</b> defined further below.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">An opening-closing mechanism of the end effector <b>106</b> operates on the basis of cam mechanisms that provide a positive engagement of camming surfaces both distal and proximal to a pivoting location (i) for moving the jaw assembly to the (second) closed position to engage tissue under very high compressive forces, and (ii) for moving the jaws toward the (first) open position to apply substantially high opening forces for &#x201c;dissecting&#x201d; tissue. This feature allows the surgeon to insert the tip of the closed jaws into a dissectable tissue plane&#x2014;and thereafter open the jaws to apply such dissecting forces against the tissues.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to various embodiments, the lower and upper jaws <b>110</b>, <b>108</b> may have a first end <b>318</b>, in the open position, that defines first (proximally-facing) arcuate outer surface portions indicated at <b>320</b><i>a </i>and <b>320</b><i>b </i>that are engaged by a first surface portions <b>322</b><i>a </i>and <b>322</b><i>b </i>of a reciprocatable I-beam member <b>340</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) that is adapted to slide over the jaw elements <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> to thereby move the jaws toward closed position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> show views that illustrate the cam surfaces of reciprocating member <b>340</b> de-mated from jaws <b>110</b> and <b>108</b>. The first end portion <b>318</b> of the lower and upper jaws, in the open position, further defines second (distally-facing) arcuate surface portions indicated at <b>330</b><i>a </i>and <b>330</b><i>b </i>that are engaged by second surface portions <b>332</b><i>a </i>and <b>332</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) of the reciprocatable member <b>340</b> for moving the jaw elements to the open position. The effective point of jaw rotation may lie between the first and second arcuate cam surfaces of the jaws. The distal (second) end region <b>333</b> of the paired jaws is rounded with a lip <b>334</b> that can serve as an electrode for surface coagulation as will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In this embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, the reciprocating member <b>340</b> may be actuatable from the handle of the instrument by any suitable mechanism, such as actuator <b>113</b>, which may be coupled to a proximal end <b>341</b> of member <b>340</b>. The proximal end <b>341</b> and medial portion <b>341</b>&#x2032; of member <b>340</b> are dimensioned to reciprocate within bore <b>308</b> of the shaft <b>104</b>. The distal portion <b>342</b> of reciprocating member <b>340</b> carries first (lower) and second (upper) laterally-extending flanges or shoulder elements <b>344</b>A and <b>344</b>B that are coupled by an intermediate transverse element <b>345</b>. The transverse element <b>345</b> further is adapted to transect tissue captured between the jaws with a leading edge <b>346</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) that can be a blade or a cutting electrode. The transverse element <b>345</b> is adapted to slide within channels <b>348</b><i>a </i>and <b>348</b><i>b </i>in the paired first and second jaws <b>110</b>, <b>108</b>. As can be seen best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the laterally-extending shoulder elements <b>344</b>A and <b>344</b>B define the surfaces <b>322</b><i>a</i>, <b>322</b><i>b</i>, <b>332</b><i>a</i>, <b>332</b><i>b </i>that slidably engage the arcuate cam surfaces of the jaws and that apply high compressive forces to the jaws in the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to various embodiments, the first and second jaws <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> may define tissue-engaging surfaces or planes <b>350</b><i>a </i>and <b>350</b><i>b </i>that contact and deliver energy to engaged tissues, in part, from RF electrodes <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>. The engagement plane <b>350</b><i>a </i>of the lower jaw <b>110</b> may be adapted to deliver energy to tissue, and the tissue-contacting surface <b>350</b>B of upper jaw <b>108</b> may be electrosurgically active or passive as will be described below. Alternatively, the engagement surfaces <b>350</b><i>a</i>, <b>350</b><i>b </i>of the jaws can carry any suitable electrode arrangement known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The jaws <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> may have teeth or serrations <b>356</b> in any location for gripping tissue. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> depicts such serrations <b>356</b> at an inner portion of the jaws along channels <b>348</b><i>a </i>and <b>348</b><i>b </i>thus leaving engagement planes <b>350</b><i>a </i>and <b>350</b><i>b </i>laterally outward of the tissue-gripping elements. The serrations <b>356</b> may be of any suitable symmetric or asymmetric shape or combination of shapes including, for example, triangular, rounded, sinusoidal, etc. In the embodiments described below, the engagement planes <b>350</b><i>a </i>and <b>350</b><i>b </i>and electrode(s) <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> generally are shown with a non-serrated surface for clarity of explanation, but such engagement planes and electrodes themselves can be any non-smooth gripping surface. The axial length of jaws <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> indicated at L can be any suitable length depending on the anatomic structure targeted for transection and sealing. In various embodiments, the length L may be between 10 mm and 50 mm. In some embodiments, the length L may be longer. For example, one embodiment of an end effector <b>106</b> for resecting and sealing organs such as a lung or liver may have a length L of about 200 mm. Also, for example, for some surgical tasks, the jaws having a shorter length L may be used, including, for example, jaws having a length L of about 5.0 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates an end view of one embodiment of the reciprocating member <b>340</b> with the jaws <b>110</b> and <b>108</b> in phantom view. The view shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a head-on view with the distally positioned blade surface <b>346</b> pointed out of the page. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> along a cross-section taken at a position proximally located from the end view shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The transverse element <b>345</b> of the reciprocating member <b>340</b> may define a transverse dimension d between innermost surfaces <b>358</b><i>a </i>and <b>358</b><i>b </i>of the flanges <b>344</b>A, <b>344</b>B of the reciprocating member <b>340</b> and cooperating medial and distal outer surfaces <b>360</b>A and <b>360</b>B of the jaws. The selected transverse dimension d between the flanges or shoulders <b>344</b>A and <b>344</b>B thus further defines the engagement gap g between the engagement planes <b>350</b><i>a </i>and <b>350</b><i>b </i>of the jaws in the closed position. It has been found that very high compression of tissue combined with controlled RF energy delivery is optimal for welding the engaged tissue volume contemporaneous with transection of the tissue. According to various embodiments, the engagement gap g between the engagement planes <b>350</b><i>a</i>, <b>350</b><i>b </i>may range from about 0.001&#x2033; to about 0.050&#x2033;. For example, the gap g between the engagement planes ranges from about 0.001&#x2033; to about 0.010&#x2033;. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 10</figref>, the medial portion <b>341</b>&#x2032; of the reciprocating member <b>340</b> may have an &#x201c;I&#x201d;-beam shape with inner surface portions <b>363</b><i>a </i>and <b>363</b><i>b </i>that engage the cooperating medial outer surfaces of the jaws. Thus, in various embodiments, the entire length L of the jaws can be maintained in a fixed spaced-apart relationship to define a consistent engagement gap g. According to various embodiments, the engagement gap g may be selected to be large enough to prevent tissue engaged between the jaws <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> from being sheared and to prevent electrical shorts between the electrodes <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> illustrate one embodiment of the actuation of the reciprocating member <b>340</b> from a first retracted position to a second extended position to move the jaws <b>110</b> and <b>108</b> from an open position to a closed position. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, it can be seen that the translatable member <b>340</b> is being moved in the proximal direction so that the proximal-facing surfaces <b>332</b><i>a </i>and <b>332</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) of reciprocating member <b>340</b> about the outer surfaces <b>330</b><i>a </i>and <b>330</b><i>b </i>of the jaws thus forcing the jaws apart, for example to apply dissecting forces to tissues or to open jaws <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> to engage targeted tissues for hemostasis and transection. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the reciprocating member <b>340</b> after having been fully extended in the distal direction so that the distal-facing surfaces <b>322</b><i>a </i>and <b>322</b><i>b </i>of reciprocating member <b>340</b> have ridden up and over the proximal arcuate surfaces <b>320</b><i>a </i>and <b>320</b><i>b </i>of the jaws (and medial outer surfaces <b>360</b>A and <b>360</b>B) thus forcing the jaws together thereby producing a compressive force between jaws <b>108</b> and <b>110</b>. According to various embodiments, the orientation of surfaces <b>322</b><i>a</i>, <b>322</b><i>b </i>of the reciprocating member <b>340</b> and/or the arcuate surfaces <b>320</b><i>a</i>, <b>320</b><i>b </i>may be modified to modify the compression rate provided by the reciprocating member <b>340</b>. For example, the orientation of the <b>322</b><i>a</i>, <b>322</b><i>b </i>of the reciprocating member <b>340</b> and/or the arcuate surfaces <b>320</b><i>a</i>, <b>320</b><i>b </i>may vary from one embodiment to another, or may vary within a single embodiment in order to cause variable compression rates within a single stroke of the reciprocating member <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to various embodiments, the jaws <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> may rollably contact one another along the interface <b>370</b> between inner surfaces <b>372</b> of the first end <b>318</b> of the jaws. As jaws <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> articulate, the pivot point is moving as the point of contact changes at the interface between surfaces <b>370</b> and <b>372</b>. Thus, the jaw assembly may not need to define a true single pivot point as is typical of hinge-type jaws known in the art. The pivotable action of the jaws along interface <b>370</b> may be described as a rolling pivot that optionally can allow for a degree of dynamic adjustment of the engagement gap g at the proximal end of the jaws. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates one embodiment of the jaw <b>108</b> de-mated from the end effector <b>106</b>.

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The opening-closing mechanism of end effector <b>1200</b> may provide cam surfaces for positive engagement between reciprocating member <b>340</b> and the jaws (i) for moving the jaws to a closed position to engage tissue under high compressive forces, and (ii) for moving the jaws toward the (first) open position thereby providing high opening forces to dissect tissue with outer surfaces of the jaw tips. The reciprocating member <b>340</b> operates as described previously to reciprocate within bore <b>308</b> of the shaft <b>104</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the distal end portion <b>342</b> of reciprocating member <b>340</b> carries distal first and second laterally-extending flange portions <b>344</b>A and <b>344</b>B with the blade-carrying transverse element <b>345</b> extending therebetween. The blade-carrying member slides within channels <b>348</b><i>a </i>and <b>348</b><i>b </i>in the jaws.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the example embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, the first and second jaw members <b>1210</b> and <b>1208</b> again define engagement surfaces or planes <b>1250</b><i>a </i>and <b>1250</b><i>b </i>that deliver energy to engaged tissue. The engagement planes may carry one or more conductor/electrodes <b>1255</b> and, in various embodiments, may comprise a PTC matrix <b>1285</b> in at least one of the jaws' engagement surfaces <b>1250</b><i>a </i>and <b>1250</b><i>b</i>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, the upper jaw <b>1208</b> has a proximate end region <b>1258</b> that, in the open position, defines a first (proximally-facing) arcuate cam surface indicated at <b>1260</b> that is engaged by a first surface portion <b>1562</b> of the reciprocating member <b>340</b>. The first (proximal) end region <b>1258</b> of the upper jaw, in the open position, further defines second (distally-facing) surface portions indicated at <b>1270</b><i>a </i>and <b>1270</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; that are engaged by second surface <b>1272</b> of reciprocating member <b>340</b> for moving the jaw assembly to an open position.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As can be seen best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the cam surfaces <b>1270</b><i>a </i>and <b>1270</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; may be formed into pins or projecting elements <b>1274</b> and <b>1274</b>&#x2032; that may serve multiple purposes.

The lower portions <b>1278</b> (collectively) of the pins <b>1274</b> and <b>1274</b>&#x2032; thus can retain upper jaw <b>1208</b> and prevent it from moving axially or laterally relative to the jaw axis <b>1215</b> while still allowing the jaw's rotation for opening and closing. The pin mechanism further allows for greatly simplified assembly of the instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The pins <b>1274</b> and <b>1274</b>&#x2032; may provide additional functionality by providing a degree of &#x201c;vertical&#x201d; freedom of movement within the first (proximal) end portion <b>1258</b> of the jaw.

<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-18</figref> illustrate another embodiment of an end effector <b>1500</b> that provides both electrosurgical functionality and improved grasping and dissecting functionality for endoscopic surgeries. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-18</figref>, both the upper and lower jaws are shown in cut-away views to show internal cam surfaces of the upper jaw <b>1510</b> and the reciprocating member <b>340</b>. The jaw assembly <b>1500</b> may carry engagement surfaces for applying electrosurgical energy to tissue as in the previously described embodiments, as well as cutting means for transecting the engaged tissue volume. The jaw assembly <b>1500</b> relates to the ability of the jaw structure, in one mode of operation, to be used for general grasping and dissecting purposes wherein the distalmost tips <b>1513</b> of the jaws can close tightly on tissue with little movement of the actuator lever <b>113</b> in the handle of the instrument. At the same time, in another mode of operation, the jaw assembly <b>1500</b> can close to apply very high compressive forces on the tissue to enable welding. Thus, the jaw structure may provide (i) a first non-parallel jaw-closed position for grasping tissue with the distal jaws tips (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>), and (ii) a second parallel jaw-closed position for high compression of tissue for the application of electrosurgical energy (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the end effector <b>1500</b> again has a shaft <b>104</b> that is similar to the shaft <b>104</b> as used by the end effector <b>1200</b> with first (lower) jaw <b>1510</b> comprising a fixed extending portion <b>1514</b> of the shaft <b>104</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the second (upper) jaw <b>1508</b> is adapted to close or approximate about longitudinal axis <b>1515</b>. The opening-closing mechanism of jaw assembly <b>1500</b> provides cam elements and cooperating jaw surfaces for positive engagement between the reciprocating member <b>340</b> as described previously (i) for moving the jaws to a closed position to engage tissue, and (ii) for moving the jaws toward the open position thereby providing high opening forces to dissect tissue with outer surfaces of the jaw tips <b>313</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The reciprocating member <b>340</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) operates as described previously to reciprocate within bore <b>308</b> of the shaft <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the distal end <b>342</b> of the reciprocating member <b>340</b> again carries distal flange portions <b>344</b>A and <b>344</b>B with a blade-carrying transverse portion <b>345</b> therebetween. The transverse portion <b>345</b> slides within channels <b>348</b><i>a </i>and <b>348</b><i>b </i>in the paired jaws. In the example embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the first and second jaws <b>1510</b> and <b>1508</b> again define engagement surfaces <b>1550</b><i>a </i>and <b>1550</b><i>b </i>that can deliver electrosurgical energy to engaged tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the upper jaw <b>1508</b> has a proximal end <b>1558</b> that defines a first (proximally-facing) arcuate jaw surface <b>1560</b> that is engaged by a first cam surface element <b>1562</b> of reciprocating member <b>340</b> for opening the jaw. The proximal end <b>1558</b> of the upper jaw further defines second (distally-facing) jaw surface portions indicated at <b>1570</b><i>a </i>and <b>1570</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; that are engaged by second cam element <b>1572</b> of reciprocating member <b>340</b> for moving the jaw assembly to an open position.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows that the upper jaw <b>1508</b> has a floating primary pivot location indicated at P<sub>1 </sub>that is provided by the projecting elements or rectangular pins <b>1574</b> (collectively) on either side of the channel portions <b>348</b><i>a </i>that slidably extend into bores <b>1577</b> (collectively) in the lower jaw body (cf. Figure Z<b>3</b>). The lower portions of the pins <b>1574</b> thus allow upper jaw <b>1508</b> to rotate while at the same time the pin-and-bore mechanism allows the upper jaw to move upwardly away from the lower jaw.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">For example, the degree of &#x201c;vertical&#x201d; freedom of movement of the upper jaw allows for the system to &#x201c;tilt&#x201d; the distal tip <b>1513</b> of upper jaw <b>1508</b> toward the axis <b>1515</b> to thereby allow the distal jaw tips <b>1513</b> to grasp tissue. This is termed a non-parallel closed position herein. The tilting of the jaw is accomplished by providing a plurality of cam surfaces in the upper jaw <b>1508</b> and the reciprocating member <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 19</figref>, the lower and upper laterally-extending flange portions <b>344</b>A and <b>344</b>B of the reciprocating member <b>340</b> define a transverse dimension d that determines the dimension of gap g between the engagement surface of the jaws in the fully jaw-closed position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). The transverse dimension d equals the dimension between inner surfaces of flange portions <b>344</b>A and <b>344</b>B that slidably contact the outer surfaces of both jaws.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates one embodiment of the reciprocating member <b>340</b> configured with separate elevated step or cam surfaces <b>1590</b> in the lower flange portions <b>344</b>A that are adapted to slidably engage the ends <b>1595</b> of the rectangular pins <b>1574</b> on either side of upper jaw <b>1508</b>. The elevated cam surfaces <b>1590</b> of reciprocating member <b>340</b> thus create another transverse dimension d&#x2032; between inner surfaces of the flange portions <b>344</b>A and <b>344</b>B that move the jaws toward either the first jaw-closed position or the second jaw-closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Now turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-18</figref>, the sequence of cut-away views illustrate how the multiple cam surfaces cause the jaws to move between a first &#x201c;tilted&#x201d; jaw-closed position to a second &#x201c;high-compression&#x201d; jaw-closed position. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the jaws are in an open position. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the reciprocating member <b>340</b> is moved distally and its cam surface element <b>1562</b> pushes on jaw surfaces <b>1560</b> to move the jaws toward a closed position wherein the jaws rotate about primary pivot location P<sub>1</sub>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, it can be seen that the elevated cam surfaces <b>1590</b> in the lower flange <b>344</b>A have not yet engaged the ends <b>1595</b> of the rectangular pins <b>1574</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Now turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the reciprocating member <b>340</b> is moved further distally wherein the elevated cam surfaces <b>1590</b> of lower flange <b>344</b>A have now engaged and elevated the ends <b>1595</b> of rectangular pins <b>1574</b> thereby tilting the upper jaw. The upper jaw <b>1508</b> is tilted slightly by forces in the direction of the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> as the upper flange <b>1544</b>B holds the upper jaw <b>1508</b> at a secondary pivoting location indicated at P<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;at the same time that the step of the cam surface element <b>1590</b> lifts the pins <b>1574</b> and the proximal portion <b>1558</b> of the upper jaw <b>1508</b> upward.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Thus, the system functions by providing a slidable cam mechanism for lifting the proximal end of the jaw while maintaining the medial jaw portion in a fixed position to thereby tilt the distal jaw to the second jaw-closed position, with the pivot occurring generally about secondary pivot P<sub>2 </sub>which is distal from the primary pivot location P<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> next shows the reciprocating member <b>340</b> moved further distally wherein the elevated cam surfaces <b>1590</b> of lower flange <b>344</b>A slides distally beyond the ends <b>1595</b> of rectangular pins <b>1574</b> thus causing the flanges <b>344</b>A and <b>344</b>B together with the trailing edge portions <b>1575</b> of the &#x201c;I&#x201d;-beam portion (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) of the member <b>340</b> to apply very high compression forces over the entire length of the jaws as indicated by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. This position is termed a parallel jaw-closed position herein. Another advantage is that the jaw structure is in a &#x201c;locked&#x201d; position when the reciprocating member <b>340</b> is fully advanced.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20-22</figref> illustrates a cable-actuated embodiment of the end effector <b>2000</b>.

In addition, the leading edge <b>346</b>&#x2032; of the member <b>340</b>&#x2032; may transect the tissue, as described. To open the jaw members, a proximally directed force may be exerted on cable <b>2002</b>. This may cause the member <b>340</b>&#x2032; to translate proximally within the jaw members <b>2302</b>, <b>2304</b>, returning to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. The jaw members <b>2302</b>, <b>2304</b> may then be opened according to any suitable manner. For example, the jaw members <b>2302</b>, <b>2304</b> may be biased to the open position by a spring (not shown). Also, for example, the member <b>340</b>&#x2032;, as it translates proximally, may exert a force on the moving jaw member <b>2302</b> tending to cause it to pivot open. This may occur in a manner similar to that described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref> and <b>7</b>-<b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">According to various embodiments, the cable-driven end effectors <b>2000</b> and <b>2300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20-25</figref> may provide certain advantages. For example, as illustrated, the respective jaw members are both opened and closed by a proximally directed force. This may make it easier for the shaft <b>104</b> to be flexible and/or articulatable. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> illustrates one embodiment of the end effector <b>2300</b> installed on a shaft <b>104</b> comprising an articulation pivot <b>2602</b>. The articulation pivot <b>2602</b> may be actuated in any suitable manner known in the art. As illustrated, the articulation pivot <b>2602</b> may comprise a pulley and/or routing post <b>2604</b> that may route one or both of the cables <b>2002</b>, <b>2004</b> through the pivot <b>2602</b>. Because the jaw members are both opened and closed by a proximally directed force, the cables <b>2002</b>, <b>2004</b> may be placed in tension, rather than compression. This may avoid mechanical problems associated with trying to direct a compressive force around a pivot.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25</figref><i>a</i>-<b>25</b><i>b </i>illustrate one embodiment of an end effector <b>2500</b> with separately actuatable closure and cutting. The end effector <b>2500</b> may comprise a pair of rotatable jaw members <b>2502</b>, <b>2504</b>. It will be appreciated, however, that in various embodiments, only one of the jaws may be rotatable, for example, similar to the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23-25</figref>. Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref><i>a</i>, the end effector <b>2500</b> may comprise a slidable collar <b>2516</b>, which may translate distally to close the jaw members <b>2502</b>, <b>2504</b> and provide a compressive force tending to hold the jaw members <b>2502</b>, <b>2504</b> closed. The collar <b>2516</b> is shown in cross-section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25</figref><i>a </i>and <b>25</b><i>b</i>. According to various embodiments, the collar <b>2516</b> may be advanced distally from the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref><i>a </i>to transition the jaw members <b>2502</b>, <b>2504</b> to the closed position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref><i>b </i>with a cable <b>2508</b>. The cable <b>2508</b> may break into two branches <b>2508</b><i>a</i>, <b>2508</b><i>b </i>at junction <b>2518</b>. The respective branches <b>2508</b><i>a</i>, <b>2508</b><i>b </i>of the cable <b>2508</b> may be routed by pulleys <b>2512</b><i>a</i>, <b>2512</b><i>b </i>and <b>2514</b><i>a</i>, <b>2514</b><i>b </i>and may, ultimately, be coupled the collar <b>2516</b>. When the cable <b>2508</b> is translated proximally, for example, in response to the motion of an actuator <b>113</b> or other trigger mechanism, the collar <b>2516</b> may be pulled distally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">To open the end effector <b>2500</b> (e.g., to transition from the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref><i>b </i>to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref><i>a</i>), a second cable <b>2506</b> may be pulled proximally. Again, the cable <b>2506</b> may be pulled proximally by the motion of an actuator <b>113</b> or other trigger mechanism. Similar to the cable <b>2508</b>, the cable <b>2506</b> may be split into branches <b>2506</b><i>a </i>and <b>2506</b><i>b </i>at junction <b>2520</b>. The branches <b>2506</b><i>a</i>, <b>2506</b><i>b </i>may be coupled to a proximal portion of the collar <b>2516</b>. Proximal motion of the cable <b>2506</b>, for example, as the result of the motion of an actuator <b>113</b>, may pull the collar proximally from the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref><i>b </i>to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref><i>a</i>. In the end effector <b>2500</b>, the reciprocating member <b>340</b>&#x2033; may extend proximally to the shaft <b>104</b> to an actuator, such as the actuator <b>113</b>. The reciprocating member may be actuatable separately from the collar <b>2516</b>. For example, the reciprocating member <b>340</b>&#x2033; and its cutting edge <b>346</b>&#x2032; may be extended distally to cut tissue either at the same time that the collar <b>2516</b> is advancing to close the jaw members <b>2502</b>, <b>2504</b>, or at a later time.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">According to various embodiments, the end effectors <b>106</b>, <b>1200</b>, <b>2000</b> and <b>2300</b> may be used to cut and fasten tissue utilizing electrical energy. The examples described below are illustrated with the end effector <b>106</b>. It will be appreciated, however, that similar configurations and techniques may be used with the end effectors <b>2000</b> and <b>2300</b> described above. Referring to the end effector <b>106</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref> and <b>7</b>-<b>8</b>, the electrodes <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> of the end effector <b>106</b> may be arranged in any suitable configuration. In use, for example, tissue (not shown) may be captured between the jaw members <b>2008</b>, <b>110</b>. RF current may flow across the captured tissue between the opposing polarity electrodes <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>. This may serve to join the tissue by coagulation, welding, etc. The RF current may be activated according to any suitable control method. For example, according to various embodiments, the electrodes <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> may be used to implement a &#x201c;power adjustment&#x201d; approach, a &#x201c;current-path directing&#x201d; approach or an approach referred to herein as a &#x201c;weld&#x201d; or &#x201c;fusion&#x201d; approach. These various approaches are illustrated herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27-30</figref>, which show the walls of an example blood vessel acted upon by various RF end effectors including those using the power adjustment and current-path directing approaches from above.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> shows an example embodiment of a vessel having opposing wall portions <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> is a graphic illustration of one embodiment of the opposing vessel walls portions <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b </i>with the tissue divided into a grid with arbitrary micron dimensions. For example, the grid may represent 5 microns on each side of the targeted tissue. In order to coagulate or weld tissue, collagen and other protein molecules within an engaged tissue volume may be denatured by breaking the inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bonds. When heat or other energy is removed (e.g., thermal relaxation), the molecules are re-crosslinked to create a fused-together tissue mass. It is desirable that each micron-dimensioned volume of tissue be elevated to the temperature needed to denature the proteins therein in a substantially uniform manner.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Failing to heat tissue portions in a uniform manner can lead to ohmic heating, which can create portions of tissue that are not effectively joined and reduce the strength of the joint. Non-uniformly denatured tissue volume may still be &#x201c;coagulated&#x201d; and can prevent blood flow in small vasculature that contains little pressure. However, such non-uniformly denatured tissue may not create a seal with significant strength, for example in 2 mm to 10 mm arteries that contain high pressures. It is often difficult to achieve substantially uniform heating with a bipolar RF device in tissue, whether the tissue is thin or thick. For example, as RF energy density in tissue increases, the tissue surface tends to become desiccated and resistant to additional ohmic heating. Localized tissue desiccation and charring can sometimes occur almost instantly as tissue impedance rises, which then can result in a non-uniform seal in the tissue. Also, many RF jaws cause further undesirable effects by propagating RF density laterally from the engaged tissue thus causing unwanted collateral thermal damage.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">To achieve substantially uniform coagulation, various embodiments described herein may utilize a &#x201c;power adjustment&#x201d; approach, a &#x201c;current-path directing&#x201d; approach and/or an approach referred to herein as a &#x201c;weld&#x201d; or &#x201c;fusion&#x201d; approach. According to the &#x201c;power adjustment&#x201d; approach, the RF generator <b>124</b> can rapidly adjust the level of total power delivered to the jaws' engagement surfaces in response to feedback circuitry, which may be present within the generator <b>124</b> and/or at the end effector <b>106</b>, and may be electrically coupled to the active electrodes. The feedback circuitry may measure tissue impedance or electrode temperature. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> illustrates one embodiment of the blood vessel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> acted upon by a device implementing a &#x201c;power adjustment&#x201d; approach to energy delivery. Opposing vessel walls <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b </i>are shown compressed with cut-away phantom views of opposing polarity electrodes <b>2902</b>, <b>2904</b> on either side of the tissue. For example, the electrode <b>2902</b> may be positioned on one jaw member <b>2008</b>, <b>110</b>, while the electrode <b>2904</b> may be positioned on the opposite jaw member. One advantage of such an electrode arrangement is that 100% of each jaw engagement surface comprises an &#x201c;active&#x201d; conductor of electrical current&#x2014;thus no tissue is engaged by an insulator which theoretically would cause a dead spot (no ohmic heating) proximate to the insulator.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> also graphically depicts current paths p in the tissue at an arbitrary time interval that can be microseconds (&#x3bc;s) apart. Such current paths p would be random and constantly in flux&#x2014;along transient most conductive pathways through the tissue between the opposing polarity electrodes. The thickness of the paths is intended to represent the constantly adjusting power levels. Typically, the duration of energy density along any current path p is on the order of microseconds and the thermal relaxation time of tissue is on the order of milliseconds. Instruments using the power adjustment approach may be useful for sealing relatively small vessels with relatively low fluid pressure. This is because, given the spatial distribution of the current paths and the dynamic adjustment of their power levels, it is unlikely that enough random current paths will revisit and maintain each discrete micron-scale tissue volume at the targeted temperature before thermal relaxation. Also, because the hydration of tissue is constantly reduced during ohmic heating&#x2014;any region of more desiccated tissue will lose its ohmic heating, rendering it unable to be &#x201c;welded&#x201d; to adjacent tissue volumes.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In a second &#x201c;current-path directing&#x201d; approach, the end effector jaws carry an electrode arrangement in which opposing polarity electrodes are spaced apart by an insulator material, which may cause current to flow within an extended path through captured tissue rather than simply between surfaces of the first and second jaws. &#x201c;Current-path directing&#x201d; techniques are also used to improve the quality of energy-delivered seals. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> illustrates one embodiment of the blood vessel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> acted upon by a device implementing a current-path directing approach to energy delivery. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, vessel walls <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b </i>are engaged between opposing jaws surfaces with cut-away phantom views of electrodes <b>3002</b>, <b>3004</b>, <b>3006</b>, <b>3008</b>, with opposing polarity (+) and (&#x2212;) electrodes (<b>3002</b>, <b>3004</b> and <b>3006</b>, <b>3008</b>) on each side of the engaged tissue. For example, electrodes <b>3002</b> and <b>3004</b> may be positioned on one of the jaw members <b>2008</b>, <b>110</b> while electrodes <b>3006</b> and <b>3008</b> maybe positioned on the opposite electrode. An insulator <b>3010</b> is shown in cut-away view that electrically isolates the electrodes in the jaw. The tissue that directly contacts the insulator <b>3010</b> will only be ohmically heated when a current path p extends through the tissue between the spaced apart electrodes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> graphically depicts current paths p at any arbitrary time interval, for example in the &#x3bc;s range. Again, such current paths p will be random and in constant flux along transient conductive pathways.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">A third approach, according to various embodiments, may be referred to as a &#x201c;weld&#x201d; or &#x201c;fusion&#x201d; approach. The alternative terms of tissue &#x201c;welding&#x201d; and tissue &#x201c;fusion&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein to describe thermal treatments of a targeted tissue volume that result in a substantially uniform fused-together tissue mass, for example in welding blood vessels that exhibit substantial burst strength immediately post-treatment. Such welds may be used in various surgical applications including, for example, (i) permanently sealing blood vessels in vessel transection procedures; (ii) welding organ margins in resection procedures; (iii) welding other anatomic ducts or lumens where permanent closure is desired; and also (iv) for performing vessel anastomosis, vessel closure or other procedures that join together anatomic structures or portions thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The welding or fusion of tissue as disclosed herein may be distinguished from &#x201c;coagulation&#x201d;, &#x201c;hemostasis&#x201d; and other similar descriptive terms that generally relate to the collapse and occlusion of blood flow within small blood vessels or vascularized tissue. For example, any surface application of thermal energy can cause coagulation or hemostasis&#x2014;but does not fall into the category of &#x201c;welding&#x201d; as the term is used herein. Such surface coagulation does not create a weld that provides any substantial strength in the treated tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">A &#x201c;weld,&#x201d; for example, may result from the thermally-induced denaturation of collagen and other protein molecules in a targeted tissue volume to create a transient liquid or gel-like proteinaceous amalgam. A selected energy density may be provided in the targeted tissue to cause hydrothermal breakdown of intra- and intermolecular hydrogen crosslinks in collagen and other proteins. The denatured amalgam is maintained at a selected level of hydration&#x2014;without desiccation&#x2014;for a selected time interval, which may be very brief. The targeted tissue volume may be maintained under a selected very high level of mechanical compression to insure that the unwound strands of the denatured proteins are in close proximity to allow their intertwining and entanglement. Upon thermal relaxation, the intermixed amalgam results in protein entanglement as re-crosslinking or renaturation occurs to thereby cause a uniform fused-together mass.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">To implement the welding described above, the electrodes <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> (or electrodes that are part of the other end effector embodiments described herein) may, one or both, comprise an electrically conductive portion and a portion comprising a positive temperature coefficient (PTC) material having a selected increased resistance that differs at selected increased temperatures thereof. The PTC material may be positioned between the electrically conductive portion and any tissue to be acted upon by the end effector <b>106</b>. One type of PTC material is a ceramic that can be engineered to exhibit a selected positively slope curve of temperature-resistance over a temperature range of about 37&#xb0; C. to 100&#xb0; C. Another type of PCT material may comprise a polymer having similar properties. The region at the higher end of such a temperature range brackets a targeted &#x201c;thermal treatment range&#x201d; at which tissue can be effectively welded. The selected resistance of the PTC matrix at the upper end of the temperature range may substantially terminate current flow therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In operation, it can be understood that the electrode <b>120</b> or <b>122</b> will apply active RF energy (ohmic heating within) to the engaged tissue until the point in time that the PTC matrix is heated to exceed the maximum of the thermal treatment range. Thereafter, RF current flow from the engagement surface will be lessened&#x2014;depending on the relative surface areas of the first and second electrodes <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>. This instant and automatic reduction of RF energy application may prevent any substantial dehydration of tissue proximate to the engagement plane. By thus maintaining an optimal level of moisture around the engagement plane, the working end can more effectively apply energy to the tissue&#x2014;and provide a weld thicker tissues with limited collateral thermal effects.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In various embodiments, surgical instruments utilizing various embodiments of the transection and sealing instrument <b>100</b>, with the various end effectors and actuating mechanisms described herein may be employed in conjunction with a flexible endoscope. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> illustrates one embodiment of an endoscope <b>3114</b> (illustrated here as a gastroscope) inserted into the upper gastrointestinal tract of a patient. The endoscope <b>3114</b> may be any suitable endoscope including, for example, the GIF-100 model available from Olympus Corporation. The endoscope <b>3114</b> has a distal end <b>3116</b> that may include various optical channels, illumination channels, and working channels. According to various embodiments, the endoscope <b>3114</b> may be a flexible endoscope.</p>

The example endoscope <b>3114</b> shown comprises a distal face <b>3104</b>, which defines the distal ends of illumination channels <b>3108</b>, an optical channel <b>3106</b> and a working channel <b>3110</b>. The illumination channels <b>3108</b> may comprise one or more optical fibers or other suitable waveguides for directing light from a proximally positioned light source (not shown) to the surgical site. The optical channel <b>3106</b> may comprise one or more optical fibers or other suitable waveguides for receiving and transmitting an image of the surgical site proximally to a position where the image may be viewed by the clinician operating the endoscope <b>3114</b>. As described above, the working channel <b>3110</b> may allow the clinician to introduce one or more surgical tools to the surgical site. Examples of such surgical tools include scissors, cautery knives, suturing devices, and dissectors. It will be appreciated that the endoscope <b>3114</b> is but one example of an endoscope that may be used in accordance with various embodiments. Endoscopes having alternate configurations of optical channels <b>3106</b>, illumination channels <b>3108</b> and/or working channels <b>3110</b> may also be used. According to various embodiments, the endoscope <b>3114</b> may be, or may be used in conjunction with, steerable devices such as traditional flexible endoscopes or steerable overtubes as described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2010/0010299, incorporated herein by reference. Combinations of flexible endoscopes and steerable overtubes may also be used in some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In at least one such embodiment, the endoscope <b>3114</b>, a laparoscope, or a thoracoscope, for example, may be introduced into the patient trans-anally through the colon, the abdomen via an incision or keyhole and a trocar, or trans-orally through the esophagus or trans-vaginally through the cervix, for example. These devices may assist the clinician to guide and position the transection and sealing instrument <b>100</b> near the tissue treatment region to treat diseased tissue on organs such as the liver, for example.</p>

A natural opening may be the mouth, anus, and/or vagina. Medical implantable instruments may be introduced into the patient to the target area via the natural opening. In a NOTES&#x2122; technique, a clinician inserts a flexible endoscope into one or more natural openings of the patient to view the target area, for example, using a camera. During endoscopic surgery, the clinician inserts surgical devices through one or more lumens or working channels of the endoscope <b>3114</b> to perform various key surgical activities (KSA). These KSAs include forming an anastomosis between organs, performing dissections, repairing ulcers and other wounds. Although the devices and methods described herein may be used with NOTES&#x2122; techniques, it will be appreciated that they may also be used with other surgical techniques including, for example, other endoscopic techniques, and laparoscopic techniques.</p>
