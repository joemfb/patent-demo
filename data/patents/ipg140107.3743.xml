<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This specification is related generally to user interfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A computer can include one or more indicators (e.g., lights, light emitting diodes, etc) for providing a status of the computer. A computer can have, for example, a light for conveying information related to the power on/off status, a light for indicating hard disk drive activity, and a light for indicating whether the computer is in &#x201c;sleep&#x201d; mode. Generally, the light is operated such that it conveys binary information: power is on or off, there is hard disk drive activity or not; the computer is in sleep mode or not, for example.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of detecting an event that includes an associated sensory output, and, in response to the detected event, emitting a light effect that simulates the sensory output. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, computer program products, and computer readable media.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of detecting an event, and, in response to the detected event, emitting a light effect that simulates the detected event. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, computer program products, and computer readable media.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented to realize one or more of the following advantages. Information can be communicated to a user using a light-emitting device. A light-emitting device can emit a visually pleasing light effect when particular events or sensory outputs occur. A device with only light-emitting indicator devices can share user interface features with devices that utilize displays for ease of use mnemonics and branding. A light-emitting device can provide at-a-glance information that is less likely to distract a user than detailed information displayed on a display (e.g., when the light-emitting device is used on an automobile dashboard).</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of a computer system <b>100</b> operable to communicate using light effects (e.g., blinking light, a light with varying intensity (i.e., brightness) over time, etc.). In some implementations, the system <b>100</b> includes a personal computer (&#x201c;computer&#x201d;) <b>102</b>. The computer <b>102</b> is optionally communicatively coupled to a remote server <b>107</b> or other computer system using a network interface <b>116</b> and a network <b>108</b> (e.g., local area network, wireless network, Internet, intranet, etc.). The computer <b>102</b> includes a processor <b>103</b> and memory <b>105</b>. In some implementations, the computer <b>102</b> includes one or more input devices <b>114</b> (e.g., keyboard, mouse, buttons, etc.) and one or more output devices <b>115</b> (e.g., a display device). A user can interact with the computer system <b>100</b> using the input and output devices <b>114</b> and <b>115</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some implementations, the computer <b>102</b> also includes a local storage device <b>106</b> and a graphics module <b>113</b> (e.g., graphics card) for storing information and generating graphics for display on a display device, respectively. The local storage device <b>106</b> can be a computer-readable medium. The term &#x201c;computer-readable medium&#x201d; refers to any medium that includes data and/or participates in providing instructions to a processor for execution, including without limitation, non-volatile media (e.g., optical or magnetic disks), volatile media (e.g., memory) and transmission media. Transmission media includes, without limitation, coaxial cables, copper wire, fiber optics, and computer buses. Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic, light or radio frequency waves.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The computer <b>102</b> includes one or more light emission modules <b>117</b> and optionally a sound module <b>118</b>. In some implementations, a light emission module <b>117</b> includes one or more light emission devices (e.g., a light-emitting diode (LED)) and associated circuitry for generating various light effects by affecting the emission of light through the LED. The sound module <b>118</b> (e.g., a sound card, a sound chip, sound output circuitry) outputs audio to a speaker, headphones, amplifier, or the like (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some implementations, the light emission module <b>117</b> is located on a device that is external to, and coupled to, the computer <b>102</b>. For example, the light emission module <b>117</b> can be located on a Universal Serial Bus (USB) Flash drive or memory stick, which can be connected to the computer <b>102</b> through an interface port (not shown). As another example, the light emission module <b>117</b> can be located on a wireless router or access point communicatively coupled to the computer <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">While communication using light emission is described in this specification with respect to a personal computer <b>102</b>, it should be apparent that the disclosed implementations can be incorporated in, or integrated with, any electronic device that has a light emission device, including without limitation, portable and desktop computers, servers, electronics, media players, game devices, mobile phones, smart phones, email devices, personal digital assistants (PDAs), embedded devices, televisions, other consumer electronic devices, set top boxes, storage devices, medical or health devices, on-board systems in automobiles, appliances, etc. In some implementations, the system <b>100</b> or electronic device can omit a sound module <b>118</b> and/or a display device.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the engines, methods, processes and the like that are described can themselves be an individual process or application, part of an operating system, a plug-in, an application, or the like. In some implementations, the system and methods can be implemented as one or more plug-ins that are installed and run on the personal computer <b>102</b>. The plug-ins are configured to interact with an operating system (e.g., MAC OS X, WINDOWS XP, WINDOWS VISTA, LINUX, etc.) and to perform the various functions, as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-6</figref>. A system and method for communication using a light emission module can also be implemented as one or more software applications running on the computer <b>102</b> and controlling a light emission module <b>117</b>. Such a system and method can be characterized as a framework or model that can be implemented on various platforms and/or networks (e.g., client/server networks, wireless networks, stand-alone computers, portable electronic devices, mobile phones, etc.), and/or embedded or bundled with one or more software applications or the operating system.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The computer <b>102</b> can store data items, such as files and other data objects, in the local storage device <b>106</b>, for example. Examples of data items include documents, images or graphics, video clips, audio clips, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example system architecture <b>200</b> for communication using a light emission module. In some implementations, the system architecture <b>200</b> is implemented in a computer <b>102</b>. In some implementations, the system architecture <b>200</b> includes the processor <b>103</b> and one or more light emission modules <b>117</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some implementations, the light emission module <b>117</b> includes a pulse width modulator <b>202</b>, a current regulator <b>204</b>, and a light-emitting diode (LED) <b>206</b>. The LED <b>206</b> can emit light. The current regulator <b>204</b> regulates the amount of current supplied to the LED <b>206</b>; the intensity of the light emitted by the LED <b>206</b> is based, generally, on the amount of current supplied to the LED <b>206</b>. The pulse width modulator <b>202</b> receives signals from the processor <b>103</b> and modulates the electrical pulses flowing to the current regulator <b>204</b>. Thus, the processor controls the emission of light by the LED <b>206</b> through the pulse width modulator <b>202</b> and the current regulator <b>204</b>. An example of using a pulse width modulator to affect the intensity of the light emitted by the LED is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,658,577, titled &#x201c;Breathing Status LED Indicator,&#x201d; issued Dec. 2, 2003, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The processor <b>103</b> controls the light emission module <b>117</b>. For example, the processor <b>103</b> can control the light emission module <b>117</b> to emit a light that can change intensity at different rates or whose intensity remains steady. In some implementations, the processor <b>103</b> provides control signals to the light emission module <b>117</b> when particular events on the computer <b>102</b> are detected and/or when particular visual or audio outputs occur. For example, when a user is attempting to send an email message from the computer <b>102</b> (by selecting the send button in an email application) and a sending progress indication (e.g., a progress bar) is displayed on a display device of the computer <b>102</b>, the processor <b>103</b> can signal the light emission module <b>117</b> to emit a light that gradually increases in intensity as the sending progresses until the email is successfully sent, when a light is to be emitted at a steady intensity.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some implementations, the processor <b>103</b> signals the light emission module <b>117</b> to emit light such that the intensity of the emitted light varies with some event or sensory (e.g., visual, audio) output. In some implementations, intensity values can be predetermined and stored in the local storage <b>106</b> or memory <b>105</b> for retrieval. For example, the architecture <b>200</b> can include one or more look-up tables <b>210</b> and/or math and function data <b>212</b>. In some implementations, the look-up table <b>210</b> and the math/function data <b>212</b> are stored in the local storage <b>106</b> or memory <b>105</b>. The look-up table <b>210</b> and the math/function data <b>212</b> can be stored in its own dedicated storage or memory, or stored with shared storage or memory with other data. The look-up table <b>210</b> can include intensity values for various states in events or visual/audio outputs. The math/function data <b>212</b> can include information on one or more mathematical functions that can be used to calculate intensity over time for various events or visual/audio outputs. The processor <b>103</b> can use the look-up table <b>210</b> and the math/function data <b>212</b> to determine a light intensity at a particular time and signal the light emitting module <b>117</b> to emit the light at the determined intensity.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some implementations, the architecture <b>200</b> includes a timer <b>208</b>. The timer <b>208</b> can be used to determine elapsed time for the processor <b>103</b>. The processor <b>103</b> can use the elapsed time to determine the proper intensity for the emitted light. In some implementations, the timer <b>208</b> can be integrated into the processor <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some implementations, the processor <b>103</b> can include a trigger start signal input <b>214</b> and the look-up table <b>210</b> and math/function data <b>212</b> include inputs for a selection signal <b>216</b>. The trigger start signal <b>214</b> signals the processor <b>103</b> to begin signaling the light emission module <b>117</b> to emit light whose intensity follows a function or a set of values. The selection signal <b>216</b> selects the look-up table values or function to be used by the processor <b>103</b> to determine the proper intensity.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some implementations, the architecture <b>200</b> includes multiple light emission modules <b>117</b>. The processor <b>103</b> can control each of the light emission modules <b>117</b> and coordinate the emission of light from the multiple light emission modules <b>117</b> in order to emit light patterns and effects using multiple LEDs.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some implementations, the light emission module <b>117</b> can be controlled by an external device or respond to inputs from an external device. For example, a computer <b>102</b> can control the light emission module of a USB Flash drive connected to the computer <b>102</b> through an interface port (e.g., a USB port).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow diagram for an example process <b>300</b> for communicating using a light emission module. For convenience, the process <b>300</b> will be described in reference to a system (e.g., system <b>100</b>) that performs the process.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A light emitting module is operated in normal mode (<b>302</b>). In normal operation, the light emission module <b>117</b> can be used by the system <b>100</b> to convey basic information, such as power status and hard drive activity. Alternatively, the light emission module <b>117</b> can be dormant until a particular associated activity is initiated.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some implementations, the system <b>100</b> includes multiple light emission modules <b>117</b>. Each of the light emission modules <b>117</b> can be assigned to convey particular information in normal mode. For example, one light emission module can be assigned to be the power on/off indicator, another light emission module can be assigned to be the hard drive activity indicator, and yet another light emission module can be assigned to be the sleep status indicator.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A triggering event is detected by the system <b>100</b> (<b>304</b>). A triggering event can be any of a variety of particular events that can occur on the system <b>100</b>. A triggering event can be a user event (i.e., an event initiated by a user or an event that occurs in response to a user input) or a system event, for example. Examples of triggering events include changing of compact disks (CD), Digital Versatile Disks (DVD), or other optical disk media in a multi-disk changer; initiation by the user of a task (e.g., system boot-up, initiation of a backup operation, insertion of an optical disk, initiation of a synchronization operation, insertion of a Universal Serial Bus (USB) drive into an interface port, loading an application, a file transfer (e.g., copy, move, synchronization, download, upload), sending of an email message, search in a search engine, wireless network discovery, attempted entry of a password, etc.); the opening of a door of an automobile; shuddering of anti-lock brakes of an automobile; and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some implementations, the triggering event includes an associated sensory output. The sensory output can include a visual output displayed on a display device of the computer <b>102</b> (e.g., an on-screen dynamic or animation associated with the triggering event) and/or an audio output (e.g., a sound effect or pattern associated with the triggering event). As used in this specification, an on-screen dynamic is a set of variations or changes in what is displayed on a display device. For example, if the triggering event is a loading of an application by the user clicking on an icon corresponding to the application, the on-screen dynamic can be the icon bouncing up and down. As another example, if the triggering event is a file search, the on-screen dynamic can be a bar swaying back and forth to indicate that the search is ongoing.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">If a triggering event is not detected (<b>304</b>-No), the light emission module continues to be operated in normal mode.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">If a triggering event is detected (<b>304</b>-Yes), the normal mode of the light emission module is interrupted (<b>306</b>) and the light emission module is operated in event mode (<b>308</b>). While in event mode, the light emission module is operated to emit a light effect that simulates or is otherwise related to the detected triggering event and/or the sensory output (e.g., an on-screen dynamic; a sound effect) associated with the triggering event; the emitted light effect has characteristics (e.g., relative amplitude of intensity, rate of change in intensity, period of oscillation in intensity, etc.) that are similar to characteristics of the triggering event or sensory output. For example, the light effect can change intensity in an oscillating manner with a period that is the same as some oscillatory period of the triggering event or sensory output. The similarity between the characteristics of the light effect and characteristics of the triggering event/sensory output can give a user viewing the light effect hints of what the triggering event or sensory output is, facilitating identification of the triggering event or sensory output by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some implementations, while the triggering event and/or the sensory output are in progress (<b>310</b>-No), the light emission module continues to operate in event mode. When the triggering event and/or the sensory output end (<b>310</b>-Yes), the light emission module is operated in normal mode. Alternatively, the light emission modules can be active for a predetermined amount of time or as long as proscribed by data provided by the system.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">During event mode, a light emission module <b>117</b> is operated to emit a light effect that simulates a sensory output associated with the triggering event or is otherwise related to the triggering event. The light effect includes an emission of light that is emitted with changes in the intensity of the light and other effects (e.g., change in the color of the light). In some implementations, the intensity of the light over time, the rate of change in intensity over time, the color of the light, and other characteristics of the emitted light are patterned to simulate characteristics of the sensory output or the triggering event. For example, if the sensory output or the triggering event involves some sort of oscillation, the intensity of the light effect changes to simulate the oscillation. Thus, while the light emission module <b>117</b> operates in event mode, the emitted light can exhibit varying behavior (e.g., changes in intensity or color, blinking, varying speeds of blinking or changes in intensity, etc.) depending on the particular triggering event or sensory output.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">For example, if the triggering event is the sending of an email, accompanied by a progress bar displayed on a display, the light emission module can begin emitting light when the user hits the send button in the email application. The intensity of the light increases with the progress shown in the progress bar until the sending is completed, when the intensity of the light reaches peak intensity and can remain on for some time (e.g., 3 seconds). As another example, if the triggering event is an incorrect password entered into a password dialog box, accompanied by a jiggle or shaking animation of the password dialog box, the light emission module can emit a light that blinks in a manner that simulates the jiggle/shaking animation.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As a further example, on an automobile, a sound effect can be emitted when a door of the automobile is a jar. A light emission module on the automobile can emit a light effect whose intensity simulates the sound effect.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some implementations, the emitted light effect simulates a triggering event that does not have an associated visual output displayed on a display or an audio output from a sound module. For example, an automobile can have an on-board system that monitors the brakes on the automobile and which includes a light emission module <b>117</b>. If the brakes shudder, the automobile on-board system detects the shuddering, and the light emission module <b>117</b> can be instructed by the automobile on-board system to emit a light effect whose intensity changes with the shuddering. As another example, a light emission module on a wireless router can emit a light effect that simulates the handshaking communication (e.g., data transmissions, the processing between data transmissions, etc.) between a wireless device and the router as the wireless device attempts to gain access to a wireless network through the router.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some implementations, the triggering event and/or sensory output occurs on one device and the light effect simulating the sensory output is emitted from another device. For example, when a USB Flash drive is coupled to the system <b>100</b> through a USB port and a file is transferred between the USB drive, the USB drive can emit a light effect that simulates the on-screen dynamic of a progress bar indicating the progress of the transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an example graph of intensity versus time for a light effect where the triggering event is a user-initiated email transmission. In graph <b>400</b>, the intensity begins a monotonic increase when a user-initiated email transmission is detected (e.g., when the user hits a send button in an email application, as illustrated by a selected &#x201c;send&#x201d; button <b>401</b>A) and a progress bar <b>401</b>B is displayed. The progress bar can include multiple segments. In some implementations, the light effect simulates the progress bar; the light increases in intensity with each additional segment displayed in the progress bar, as illustrated by graph segment <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">When the email transmission is complete (as illustrated by an &#x201c;email sent&#x201d; prompt <b>401</b>C), the light intensity is steady for a period of time, as illustrated by segment <b>404</b>. After the period of time has elapsed, the light emission module can return to normal mode of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5C</figref> illustrate example light intensity versus time graphs of light effects where the triggering event is a data search (e.g., a search for files in local storage <b>106</b> that match particular criteria) or a discovery of in-range wireless networks. Graph <b>500</b> shows intensity versus time with segments <b>502</b>, <b>506</b> of fluttering intensity and a segment <b>504</b> of zero intensity (i.e., the light is off). Graph <b>508</b> shows intensity versus time with segments <b>510</b>, <b>514</b> of fluttering intensity and a segment <b>512</b> of steady intensity. In some implementations, the fluttering can be based on a mathematical function (e.g., e<sup>&#x2212;t </sup>sin t+1) of time. In some implementations, two fluttering segments in the light effect can be the same (e.g., segments <b>502</b> and <b>506</b>) or different (e.g., segments <b>510</b>, <b>514</b> flutter about different intensity levels). The segment of steady intensity can be one of zero intensity (e.g., segment <b>504</b>) or a non-zero intensity (e.g., segment <b>512</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some implementations, the fluttering segments can occur during parts of the data search where there is file access activity as a result of performing the search. In some other implementations, the fluttering segments can occur where there is attempted communication with a wireless network as part of the wireless network discovery process.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some other implementations, the intensity versus time graph of the light effect for a data search or network discovery can include segments of different, but steady intensities, as illustrated by graph <b>516</b>. The changing intensities can indicate the periods when the data search or the network discovery is in progress.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some implementations, the light effect can simulate an audio output corresponding to the detected triggering event. For example, the relative intensity, rate of change in the intensity, color, etc. of the light emitted by the light emission module can be similar to the amplitude, volume, and/or frequency of the audio output from the sound module. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an example graph of volume versus time and an example graph of light intensity versus time. Graph <b>600</b> illustrates a graph of volume versus time. Graph <b>600</b> includes a segment <b>602</b> of monotonically increasing volume and a segment <b>604</b> of steady volume. Graph <b>606</b> illustrates a graph of intensity versus time in which the rate of change in intensity mimics the rate of change in volume in graph <b>600</b>. Graph <b>606</b> includes a segment <b>608</b> of monotonically increasing intensity and a segment <b>610</b> of steady intensity. The intensity increases as the volume increases and remains steady as the volume remains steady.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some implementations, multiple light emission modules can be operated in event mode. When multiple light emission modules are operated in event mode, the emission of light from the individual light emission modules can be coordinated to generate a patterned light effect that simulates or is otherwise related to the triggering event or sensory output in a way that provides hints as to what the event or sensory output is. For example, a computer <b>102</b> can have multiple LEDs lined up in a row. When a discovery for in-range wireless networks is initiated, the LEDs can emit light in sequence until the discovery is completed, at which point all of the multiple LEDs are to emit light. For example, if there are 5 LEDs A, B, C, D, and E, the sequence of the LED that is emitting light can be A, then B, then C, then D, then E, then D, then C, then B, then A, then B, and so on. When the network discovery is complete, all five LEDs A, B, C, D, and E are on and emitting light.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7C</figref> illustrates an example desktop user interface <b>700</b> and an example intensity graph of a light effect, where the intensity of the light simulates the bouncing of an application icon. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> shows a portion of a desktop user interface <b>700</b>. The desktop user interface <b>700</b> can include one or more graphical objects or icons <b>702</b> corresponding to respective applications. For example, the desktop <b>700</b> includes an icon for a web browser application, an icon for an email application, and an icon for a calendar application. When a user selects an icon <b>702</b> to load a corresponding application, the icon can be displayed with a bouncing dynamic on a display. For example, when the user selects the calendar application icon <b>704</b>, the calendar application icon can bounce up and down, as indicated by the bi-directional arrow <b>706</b>. A light effect emitted by the light emission module can simulate the bouncing dynamic, changing intensity with the bounce, as illustrated by intensity graph <b>708</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. The intensity reaches a peak when the icon reaches the peak of the bounce, and the intensity reaches a crest when the icon reaches the crest of the bounce. The intensity continues oscillating between the peak and crest until the bouncing dynamic stops. In some implementations, the maximum height of the icon bounce decreases as time elapses since the selection of the icon. This can be simulated by the light effect that has a damped oscillating intensity, as illustrated by intensity graph <b>710</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>.</p>
