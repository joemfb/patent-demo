<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A steel structure including pre-stressing brackets for improving load-carrying capacity and serviceability comprises: a steel girder; a plurality of connecting brackets connected to the bottom surface of the steel girder spaced and apart from one; and a cover plate connected to the bottom surfaces of the connecting brackets. Since the cover plate is installed regardless of the connecting portion of the steel girder, pre-stressing section can be consecutively formed therefore pre-stress effect is improved. Moreover, since the connecting brackets space the cover plate a constant distance from the steel girder, the moment of inertia is increased so the span of a bridge might be increased.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a steel structure including pre-stressing brackets for improving load-carrying capacity and serviceability thereof, and more particularly, to a steel structure including pre-stressing brackets for improving load-bearing capacity and use performance thereof wherein the connecting brackets are spaced apart from each other between a steel girder and a cover plate to prevent the installation of the cover plate from being limited by the connection portions of the neighboring steel girders, thereby allowing prestressing ranges to be continuously introduced to increase the prestressing effects, and the steel girder and the cover plate are spaced apart from each other by means of the formation of the connecting brackets, thereby increasing moment of inertia of section and optimizing section efficiency to provide a bridge for long span.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Generally, a steel girder is formed of an H-beam or I-beam and is adapted to be connected to piers or abutments of a bridge to constitute the upper structure of the bridge. In this case, the steel girder is made to a standard given size, that is, to a size of roughly 13 m to 15 m for the easiness of the manufacturing, carrying, and installing work thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">So as to allow the steel girders made to a given standard size to be used for long span, they are connected to each other, and thus, a connection portion should be formed on the end portions of the neighboring steel girders.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In this case, a steel plate is provided on the web and flanges formed on the end portion of each steel girder to allow the steel girders to be coupled to each other, and to do this, the steel plate and the web and flanges have the corresponding coupling holes to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, high tension bolts are inserted into their coupling holes and are fastened with nuts, thereby coupling the web and the steel plate and also coupling the flanges and the steel plate.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, a thermal prestressing cover plate is covered fixedly on the connection portion of the steel girders used for long span, especially on the underside surface of the flange of each steel girder.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Because of the connection portion where the high tension bolts are fastened to connect the flange and the steel plate, at this time, it is hard to continuously cover the cover plates onto the steel girders.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The connection portion between the neighboring steel girders restricts and limits the continuous installation of the cover plates to cause the prestressing range caused by the cover plate to be limited to a size of 13 m to 15 m, so that the prestressing ranges are intermittently introduced to reduce the prestressing effects generated from the cover plate.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Furthermore, if the cover plate is connected directly to the steel girder in the conventional practice, the stiffness of the section caused by the moment of inertia of section is limited to the height of the steel girder, which causes the load-bearing capacity to be undesirably lowered, thereby making it impossible to be applicable to the bridge for long span.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Hereinafter, an explanation on A steel structure including pre-stressing brackets for improving load-carrying capacity and serviceability according to the present invention will be given with reference to the attached drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to the present invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>b</i>, a steel structure including pre-stressing brackets for improving load-carrying capacity and serviceability thereof, includes: a steel girder <b>10</b>; a plurality of connecting brackets <b>20</b> connected to the bottom surface of the steel girder <b>10</b> and spaced apart from one another; and a cover plate <b>30</b> connected to the bottom surfaces of the connecting brackets <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the steel structure including pre-stressing brackets for improving load-carrying capacity and serviceability thereof according to the present invention, the steel girder <b>10</b> is connected to piers or abutments of a bridge to form the upper structure of the bridge, and generally, H-beam or I-beam, which is used as the steel girder <b>10</b>, is made to a standard given size, that is roughly 13 m to 15 m for the convenience of the manufacturing, carrying, and installing work thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">To make a long span bride with those standard sized girder, the steel girder <b>10</b> should be connected to other steel girders <b>10</b>, and thus, each end region of steel girder <b>10</b> has a connecting portion.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this case a steel plate <b>3</b> is applied to webs <b>11</b> and flanges <b>13</b> of the end portions of the steel girders <b>10</b> and a plurality of coupling holes <b>17</b> are formed correspondingly on the webs <b>11</b> and flanges <b>13</b> and the steel plate <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A high tension bolt <b>1</b> is inserted into each coupling hole <b>17</b> and is fastened to a nut, thereby coupling the webs <b>11</b> and the steel plate <b>3</b>, the flanges <b>13</b> and the steel plate <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">It is hard to continuously locate the thermal pre-stressing cover plates <b>30</b> under the bottom surface of the steel girders <b>10</b> due to the connecting portions where the high tension bolts <b>1</b> are fastened to connect the flanges <b>13</b> and the steel plate <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The connecting portion between the neighboring steel girders <b>10</b> restricts the installation position of the cover plate <b>30</b> and causes the prestressing ranges to be limited to a size of 13 m to 15 m, so that the pre-stressing ranges couldn't be continuous therefore the pre-stressing effects is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Hereinafter, to solve those problems, an explanation of the connecting brackets <b>20</b> which is capable of continuous pre-stressing ranges without limit and improve the stiffness of cross section of the steel structure will be given in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the steel structure including pre-stressing brackets for improving load-carrying capacity and serviceability thereof according to the present invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>to <b>3</b><i>b</i>, the connecting brackets <b>20</b> are connected to the underside surface of the steel girder <b>10</b> and spaced apart from one another, while allowing the steel girder <b>10</b> and the cover plate <b>30</b> to be spaced apart from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Each connecting bracket <b>20</b> of the present invention includes an upper plate <b>21</b> connected to the bottom surface of the steel girder <b>10</b> along the longitudinal direction of the steel girder <b>10</b>, a lower plate <b>23</b> connected to the cover plate <b>30</b>, side plates <b>25</b> connected to both sides of the upper plate and the lower plate <b>23</b>, and a reinforcement plate <b>27</b> connected to each inner surface of the upper plate <b>21</b>, the lower plate <b>23</b> and the side plates <b>25</b>, parallel to the longitudinal direction of the steel girder <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">That is, the connecting bracket <b>20</b> of the present invention has a shape of a block or box, and has a plurality of fastening holes <b>29</b> formed on the upper plate <b>21</b> and the lower plate <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further, a plurality of fastening holes <b>15</b> and <b>31</b> is formed on the corresponding positions of the flange <b>13</b> and the cover plate <b>30</b> to the fastening holes <b>29</b> of the upper plate <b>21</b> and the lower plate <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Accordingly, high tension bolts <b>1</b> are inserted into the fastening holes <b>29</b> of the upper plate <b>21</b> and into the fastening holes <b>15</b> of the flange <b>13</b> and are then fastened with nuts, thereby coupling the upper plate <b>21</b> of the connecting bracket <b>20</b> to the flange <b>13</b> of the steel girder <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Then, the high tension bolts <b>1</b> are inserted into the fastening holes <b>29</b> of the lower plate <b>23</b> and into the fastening holes <b>31</b> of the cover plate <b>30</b> and are then fastened with nuts, thereby coupling the lower plate <b>23</b> of the connecting bracket <b>20</b> to the cover plate <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In this case, the upper plate <b>21</b> of the connecting bracket <b>20</b> is coupled to the bottom surface of the steel girder <b>10</b> in the longitudinal direction of the steel girder <b>10</b>, and then, the cover plate <b>30</b> is coupled to the lower plate <b>23</b> of the connecting bracket <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Alternatively, in the state where the cover plate <b>30</b> is coupled to the lower plate <b>23</b> of the connecting bracket <b>20</b>, the upper plate <b>21</b> of the connecting bracket <b>20</b> to which the cover plate <b>30</b> has been coupled is coupled to the bottom surface of the steel girder <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The order of the installation work for the steel girder <b>10</b>, the connecting brackets <b>20</b>, and the cover plate <b>30</b> is just determined in consideration of the convenience and rapidness of the installation work.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Furthermore, as both side walls of the connecting bracket <b>20</b>, the side plates <b>25</b> make the connecting brackets <b>20</b> to have a given height.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">At this time, the heights of the side plates <b>25</b> should be sufficient to increase the moment of inertia of section of the steel structure, thereby strengthening the stiffness of cross section of the steel structure and enhancing the load-carrying capacity thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Moreover, the reinforcement plate <b>27</b> of the connecting bracket <b>20</b> is provided inside of the connecting bracket <b>20</b> and is located parallel to the longitudinal direction of the steel girder <b>10</b>, thereby strengthening the stiffness of the connecting bracket <b>20</b> and improving the structural stability thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i>, in case where the connecting brackets <b>20</b> do not have side plate <b>25</b>, the portions where the side plate <b>25</b> is not provided face each other, that is, the connected portions formed by connecting the upper plates <b>21</b>, the reinforcement plates <b>27</b> and the lower plates <b>23</b> are coupled to the steel plate <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">That is, the plurality of fastening holes <b>29</b> is formed on the reinforcement plate <b>27</b> of each connecting bracket <b>20</b>, and the fastening holes are formed on the steel plate <b>3</b> correspondingly to the plurality of fastening holes <b>29</b>, so that the high tension bolts <b>1</b> are inserted into the fastening holes <b>29</b> of the reinforcement plate <b>27</b> and the steel plate <b>3</b> and are then fastened with nuts, thereby coupling the neighboring connecting brackets <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">On the other hand, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b </i>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>b</i>, the connecting brackets <b>20</b> of the present invention have different heights from each other to allow the cover plate <b>30</b> connected to the bottom surfaces thereof to form a downward slope toward the center portion thereof, thereby effectively obtaining the prestressing effects.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Accordingly, the heights of the connecting brackets <b>20</b> are gradually increased from both end portions of the cover plate <b>30</b> toward the center portion thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In this case, the cover plate <b>30</b> has a given slope formed from both end portions thereof toward the center portion thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Therefore, the center portion side plate <b>25</b> of each connecting bracket <b>20</b> has a longer length than the other side plate <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The lower plates <b>23</b> connected to the bottom of side plates <b>25</b> of the connecting brackets <b>20</b> having different lengths have the same inclinations as the slope of the cover plate <b>30</b>, so that the cover plate <b>30</b> connected to the underside of the connecting brackets <b>20</b> having given slopes at their corresponding positions has a downward slope toward the center portion thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">This is operated as the prestress against the compression force caused by dead load or live load, thereby increasing the uplifting force of the steel structure and obtaining the prestressing effects in a more effective manner.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Since the steel girder <b>10</b> and the cover plate <b>30</b> are being connected directly to each other, that is, the connecting brackets <b>20</b> of the present invention are capable of continuously providing the prestressing effects, without having any structural limit.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Further, the steel girder <b>10</b> and the cover plate <b>30</b> are spaced apart from each other to increase the stiffness of cross section through the moment of inertia of the expanded section and thus to improve the load-bearing capacity of the steel structure.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Also, the uplifting force of the steel structure is enhanced to provide the prestressing effects in a more effective manner.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to a method for making the connecting bracket <b>20</b>, first, the H-beam or I-beam is cut to a given size, and the flanges of the H-beam or I-beam form the upper plate <b>21</b> and the lower plate <b>23</b>, and the web thereof forms the reinforcement plate <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Then, the side plates <b>25</b> are welded to both sides of the upper plate <b>21</b> and the lower plate <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Even though not shown in the drawings, moreover, the connecting bracket <b>20</b> may be made by just cutting the H-beam or I-beam to a given size, without having the side plates <b>25</b> connected to the upper plate <b>21</b> and the lower plate <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b</i>, furthermore, the connecting brackets <b>20</b> of the present invention are provided in the longitudinal direction of the steel girder <b>10</b>, and in this case, the connecting brackets <b>20</b> positioned at both sides to support both end portions of the cover plate <b>30</b> have inclined portions <b>28</b> formed on the outside surfaces thereof in such a manner as to have given inclination from an external direction toward the internal direction thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">That is, the inclined portion <b>28</b> of the connecting bracket <b>20</b> has the upper plate <b>21</b> longer than the lower plate <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The side plate <b>25</b> positioned at the inside surface thereof is vertically connected, and the side plate <b>25</b> positioned at the outside surface thereof and forming the inclined portion <b>28</b> is slantly welded to the upper plate <b>21</b> and the lower plate <b>23</b> in such a manner as to have the given inclination.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In case where the sections of the connecting brackets <b>20</b> positioned at both side portions of the steel structure are drastically varied, stress is locally collected to the drastically varied portions to cause the material to be destructed and cracked, which results in the reduction of the durability of the connecting brackets <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Accordingly, the inclined portions <b>28</b> are formed on the connecting brackets <b>20</b> positioned at both side portions of the steel structure to minimize the variation of the sections thereof, thereby preventing the stress collecting phenomenon from occurring and thus ensuring the excellent durability of the connecting brackets <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the steel structure having the pre-stressing brackets for improving load-bearing capacity and use performance thereof according to the present invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>b</i>, the cover plate <b>30</b> is connected to the underside surfaces of the connecting brackets <b>20</b> and applies prestressing against the stress caused by the dead load or live load to the steel structure.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The cover plate <b>30</b> of the present invention is made of a steel material and is connected to the lower plates <b>23</b> of the connecting brackets <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The cover plate <b>30</b> has the plurality of fastening holes <b>31</b> formed on the corresponding positions thereof to the fastening holes <b>29</b> of the lower plates <b>23</b>. Thus, the high tension bolts <b>1</b> are inserted into the fastening holes <b>29</b> of the lower plates <b>23</b> and the fastening holes <b>31</b> of the cover plate <b>30</b> and then fastened with the nuts, thereby fixedly coupling the cover plate <b>30</b> to the connecting brackets <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">That is, the cover plate <b>30</b> is heated to a given temperature before mounted onto the connecting brackets <b>20</b>, and the heated cover plate <b>30</b> is fixed to the connecting brackets <b>20</b>. Then, the cover plate <b>30</b> is cooled and contracted at a room temperature to previously apply the compression stress to the steel girder <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The cover plate <b>30</b> from which prestressing is applied resists the tension stress applied to the steel girder <b>10</b> through the load of the steel structure itself, that is, dead load or live load, and the stiffness of section thereof is increased by the heights of the connecting brackets <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Further, the prestressing applied from the cover plate <b>30</b> is introduced continuously, without any stop at the connection portions of the steel girders <b>10</b>, thereby more improving the load-bearing capacity and use performance of the steel structure.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>to <b>4</b><i>b</i>, the steel structure of the present invention further includes a plurality of reinforcement members <b>40</b> connected to the portions of the steel girder <b>10</b> where the connecting brackets <b>20</b> are located.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The reinforcement members <b>40</b> are located just on the side plates <b>25</b> of the connecting brackets <b>20</b> in parallel relation to the side plates <b>25</b> in such a manner as to be welded integrally with the steel girder <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">That is, the reinforcement members <b>40</b> serve to reinforce the stiffness of the portions of the steel girder <b>10</b> to which the connecting brackets <b>20</b> are located, and thus resist the stress applied to the connecting brackets <b>20</b> connected to the cover plate <b>30</b> at the time of introducing the prestressing through the cover plate <b>30</b>, thereby increasing the stiffness at the portions where the connecting brackets are located</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">At the time when the prestressing is introduced by means of the cover plate <b>30</b>, the reinforcement members <b>40</b> resist the stress applied to the connecting brackets <b>20</b> to which the cover plate <b>30</b> is connected, so that the stiffness at the portions where the connecting brackets <b>20</b> are located can be increased to provide the structural stability in more efficient manner.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Hereinafter, an explanation on the steel beams modeled using a general purpose structure analysis program (LUCAS 14.0) will be given so as to analyze the effects of a thermal prestressing method to which the connecting brackets according to the present invention are introduced.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In this case, the steel girder, the cover plate and the connecting brackets make use of cell elements, and the models have general steel dimensions.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 9</figref>, three types of comparison models are determined, and the analysis values are compared with each other through the load-displacement curves as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Comparison Models</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Type 1: general H-beam (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Type 2: existing thermal prestressing method (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Type 3: thermal restressing method using the connecting brackets <b>20</b> of the present invention (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The girders of the comparison models had a dimension of H-588&#xd7;300&#xd7;12&#xd7;20, and the types 2 and 3 had the cover plate having the same thickness (12 mm) as each other and introduced multi-stage thermal prestressing (5&#xb0; C.-15&#xb0; C.-5&#xb0; C.).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">It was checked that the thermal prestressing method using the connecting brackets of the present invention had the highest stiffness of the elastic region of the beam and the highest yield load in the three types of comparison models.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">This was because the cover plate to which the connecting brackets are connected lowered a neutral axis to increase the efficiency of the section.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In the yield load (about 280 KN), the type 1 of general H-beam had the deflection of 45 mm, the type 2 the deflection of 38 mm, and the type 3 the deflection of 21 mm, so that the thermal prestressing method using the connecting brackets of the present invention increased the yield load and decreased the deflection. Accordingly, if the thermal prestressing method using the connecting brackets of the present invention is applied to a temporary structure having a limitation in the allowable deflection, it increases the load-bearing capacity and decreases the deflection to expect more economical design.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Next, an explanation on the structure analysis result obtained using a general purpose finite element analysis program (MIDAS CIVIL) will be given so as to check the thermal prestressing effects in accordance with the heights of the connecting brackets.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">First, the steel girder and the cover plate made use of frame elements, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, models had the following dimensions.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The girders were the rolled beam having a dimension of H-300&#xd7;150&#xd7;6.5&#xd7;9 of SS400 steel, and the connecting brackets were the rolled beam having dimensions of H-194&#xd7;150&#xd7;6&#xd7;9 and H-150&#xd7;150&#xd7;7&#xd7;10.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">A first model had the connecting brackets having the same dimensions (H-194&#xd7;150&#xd7;6&#xd7;9), and a second model had the connecting brackets located at the supports side having the lower heights (H-150&#xd7;150&#xd7;7&#xd7;10) than the other connecting brackets.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Since the tension stress was applied to the cover plate from which the thermal prestressing is introduced, the cover plate was SM520 steel having a thickness of 22 mm and a higher nominal allowable stress than the steel of the girder.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In the structural analysis, support points were considered as fixed ends, and the concentrated load of 50 tonf was applied to the center of the span.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> show the models of the structure analysis of the present invention, wherein the connecting brackets have the same heights as each other in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> and they have the different heights from each other in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Analysis Results</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">So as to test the use performance of the steel structure in accordance with the heights of the connecting brackets, a temperature of 80&#xb0; C. was applied to the cover plate for the introduction of the prestressing, and after that, the degrees of deflection of the steel girders were checked using the connecting brackets having the same heights as each other and having the different heights from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows the analysis results obtained in accordance with the heights of the connecting brackets, wherein in case of the steel girder having the connecting brackets having the same heights as each other, a degree of deflection was 15.003 mm, and in case of the steel girder having the connecting brackets having different heights from each other, a degree of deflection was 14.576 mm, such that it was checked that the degree of deflection was reduced by 0.427 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">As the connecting brackets have different heights from each other, advantageously, the prestressing causes uplifting force as well as axial force.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Further, a temperature of 80&#xb0; C. was applied to the cover plate of the steel girder using the connecting brackets having the same heights as each other, and a temperature of 72&#xb0; C. was applied to the cover plate of the steel girder using the connecting brackets having the different heights from each other, so that the degrees of deflection therebetween were compared with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows the analysis results obtained in accordance with the differences of the temperatures introduced to the cover plate, wherein in case of the steel girder having the connecting brackets having the same heights as each other, a degree of deflection was 15.003 mm, and in case of the steel girder having the connecting brackets having different heights from each other, a degree of deflection was 14.996 mm, such that even though the difference of the temperatures is just 8&#xb0; C., the degrees of deflection therebetween are similar to each other, and therefore, if the same effects are generated, the time for the temperature introduction and the period of construction are all saved and the additional expense for the temperature introduction is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">While the present invention has been described with reference to the particular illustrative embodiments, it is not to be restricted by the embodiments but only by the appended claims. It is to be appreciated that those skilled in the art can change or modify the embodiments without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">According to the present invention, there is provided the prestressed steel structure for improving the load-bearing capacity and use performance thereof wherein the connecting brackets are spaced apart from each other between the steel girder and the cover plate to prevent the installation of the cover plate from being restricted by the connection portion between the neighboring steel girders, thereby allowing prestressing ranges to be continuously introduced to increase the prestressing effects.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Further, the steel girder and the cover plate are spaced apart from each other by means of the formation of the connecting brackets, thereby increasing moment of inertia of section and optimizing the efficiency of section to provide a bridge for long span.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Furthermore, the connecting brackets are gradually increased in heights from both end portions of the cover plate toward the center portion thereof, thereby strengthening the stiffness of the section at the center portion of the cover plate to optimize the prestressing effects, thus offsetting the stress generated by the dead load (fixed load) of the steel structure, and further increasing the section of the structure by the cover plate to provide economical effects.</p>
