<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention generally relates to methods and apparatus for enhanced resolution of a ball detent type retainer for use with parameter adjustment mechanisms. More specifically, embodiments generally relate to methods and apparatus for use with suspension system dampers. In particular, embodiments relate to a variable damping adjuster for adjusting characteristics of a vehicle suspension system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Many vehicles today have suspension systems that are configured to let the vehicle wheels move up and down to absorb the shock when encountering uneven terrain, while keeping the wheels in contact with the ground. Suspension systems generally contain two elements, a spring and a damper. These two components are sometimes collectively referred to as a shock absorber. In some configurations, the damper alone is referred to as a &#x201c;shock absorber.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is often desirable to have a suspension system that is adjustable, so that the operator of the vehicle can have an optimum riding experience on different types of terrain. Since there are numerous types of terrain over which the vehicle may be driven, it may be difficult to provide such a suspension system that can be easily tunable to each environment. Therefore, there is a continuous need for suspension systems that are easily adjustable and can provide an optimum range of shock absorption for any given terrain.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment, a parameter adjuster indexing mechanism having enhanced resolution is provided. In one embodiment, a vehicle suspension damper for providing a variable damping rate may comprise an adjuster having a first detent at a first axial location and a second detent at a second axial location; and a housing having a keeper for engaging the first and second detents.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment, an adjustment assembly may comprise a shaft having a first detent disposed at a first axial location on an outer surface of the shaft, and a second detent disposed at a second axial location on the outer surface of the shaft. The assembly may further comprise a retaining member for engaging the first and second detents and a biasing member operable to bias the retaining member into engagement with at least one of the first and second detents.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, a method for altering the damping rate of a vehicle suspension damper may comprise rotating a damping adjuster, within a housing; engaging a keeper with a first detent at a first axial location on the adjuster; further rotating the damping adjuster within the housing; and engaging the keeper with a second detent at a second axial location on the adjuster.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The embodiments described herein may be used with the embodiments described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/083,478, filed Jul. 24, 2008, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/509,258, filed Jul. 24, 2009, and each of those applications is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">One embodiment hereof comprises an adjuster for a vehicle shock absorber damper. In one embodiment the vehicle is a bicycle. The shock absorber is advantageous because it includes a damper having a manually adjustable damping resistance. In one embodiment, the manually adjustable damping function allows a user to adjust a &#x201c;platform&#x201d; or &#x201c;blow off&#x201d; threshold which must be exceeded before the shock absorber can experience significant compression travel. It allows the user to establish a level, in one embodiment, for compression damping whereby such damping is increased or decreased selectively. A bicycle rider for example may choose to set a fairly high threshold for the function of compression damping thereby reducing pedal induced suspension bob. In one embodiment the adjuster is for a bicycle or motorcycle fork.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">U.S. Pat. No. 6,135,434, which patent is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, shows certain variations of positive and negative spring mechanisms. Another selectively variable damping mechanism is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,360,857, which patent is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Optionally, any of the foregoing mechanisms may be integrated, or used in combination, with any other features disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,415,895, 6,296,092, 6,978,872 and 7,308,976, each of which patents is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, show certain variations of position sensitive damping mechanisms. Another position sensitive damping mechanism is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 7,374,028, which patent is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Another position sensitive damping mechanism is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,190,126, which patent is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Optionally, any of the foregoing mechanisms may be integrated, or used in combination, with any other features disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,581,948, 7,273,137, 7,261,194, 7,128,192, and 6,604,751, each of which patents is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, show certain variations of inertia valve mechanisms for controlling aspects of compression damping. Additionally, U.S. Published Patent Application Nos. 2008/0053768 A1, 2008/0053767 A1, 2008/0035439 A1, 200810007017 A1, 2007/0296163 A1, 2007/0262555 A1, 2007/0228691A1, 2007/0228690 A1, 2007/0227845 A1, 2007/0227844 A1, 2007/0158927 A1, 2007/0119670 A1, 2007/0068751A1, 2007/0012531A1, 2006/0065496 A1, each of which patent applications is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, show certain variations of inertia valve mechanisms for controlling aspects of compression damping. Optionally, any of the foregoing inertia valve mechanisms or other features may be integrated, or used in combination, with any other features disclosed herein. A shock absorber or fork may be equipped, for example, with an inertia valve for controlling an aspect of damping and a position sensitive valve for controlling another aspect of damping.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one embodiment, both compression and rebound damping are selectively adjustable by the user. Optionally, any of the features described herein may be adapted for integration into a bicycle or motorcycle fork. For example, FIGS. 14 through 25, of U.S. Pat. No. 7,273,137 (incorporated herein by reference) show an embodiment of a vehicle suspension fork that may be integrated with features hereof. Additionally, U.S. Pat.

No. 6,360,857, which patent is entirely incorporated herein by reference, shows an embodiment of an adjuster assembly with which the present improvements may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an embodiment of the shock absorber <b>100</b>. The shock absorber <b>100</b> includes the housing assembly <b>10</b>, and a body <b>40</b> slidably (axially) disposed in a sleeve assembly <b>20</b>. The sleeve assembly <b>20</b> is connected, by helical threads, to the housing assembly <b>10</b> and forms a seal therewith by a seal <b>19</b>. A bearing assembly <b>30</b> is connected to an end of the body <b>40</b> by threads and is fluid sealed in relation thereto by a seal <b>32</b>, and is also fluid sealed to shaft <b>22</b> via seal <b>31</b> and sleeve assembly <b>20</b> via seal <b>33</b>. An inner compression rod <b>26</b> is disposed approximately concentrically within a rebound metering rod <b>24</b>, and a seal <b>18</b> is provided therebetween. The rods <b>26</b>, <b>24</b> are disposed approximately concentrically within a shaft <b>22</b>, and a seal <b>16</b> is also provided between the rod <b>24</b> and the shaft <b>22</b>. The shaft <b>22</b> is threaded at a first end in sealing engagement, via seal <b>17</b>, into housing assembly <b>10</b>. A piston assembly <b>60</b> is threaded into a second end of the shaft <b>22</b> by means of a piston bolt <b>66</b>. A floating piston assembly <b>50</b> and a seal <b>51</b> (e.g. &#x201c;a movable barrier&#x201d;) are disposed within and axially movable in relation to the body <b>40</b>. The floating piston assembly <b>50</b> divides an interior of the body <b>40</b> into a damping fluid chamber <b>45</b> and a compressible chamber <b>55</b>. A plug member <b>53</b> may be used to open and close a fluid port to fill the compressible chamber <b>55</b>. Eyelets <b>11</b> and <b>52</b> may be formed at the ends of the shock absorber for connection to a vehicle. A spring chamber <b>25</b> is formed by the housing assembly <b>10</b>, the sleeve assembly <b>20</b>, and the bearing assembly <b>30</b>. In one embodiment, an example of a shock absorber <b>100</b> that may be used with the embodiments described herein is provided in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/083,478, filed Jul. 24, 2008, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/509,258, filed Jul. 24, 2009, each of which applications is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In operation, an axial compressive force exerted on the shock absorber <b>100</b> causes the body <b>40</b> and attached bearing assembly <b>30</b> to move axially further into the interior of the sleeve assembly <b>20</b>. In so moving, the body <b>40</b> and the bearing assembly <b>30</b> also move axially relative to the piston assembly <b>60</b>, the shaft <b>22</b>, the rods <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, and the housing assembly <b>10</b>. During that movement, gas in the spring chamber <b>25</b> is compressed and thereby stores energy for release during rebound. Compression damping occurs as damping fluid in the damping fluid chamber <b>45</b> is forced to move from a first side of the piston assembly <b>60</b> to a second side of the piston assembly <b>60</b> through one or more flow paths, typically disposed through the piston assembly <b>60</b> and having varying degrees of designed resistance to flow through. Rebound damping occurs as the damping fluid then returns from the second side of the piston assembly <b>60</b> to the first side through one or more flow paths, typically disposed through the piston assembly <b>60</b> and having varying degrees of designed resistance to flow through.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment, the piston assembly <b>60</b> determines the operational fluid flow paths through which the damping fluid may flow and thereby dictates the degree of damping available. In one embodiment, the piston assembly <b>60</b> is configured so that certain fluid flow paths are open for compression damping and certain other flow paths are open for rebound damping, thereby allowing for differing degrees of damping during shock compression versus shock rebound. In one embodiment, an example of a piston assembly <b>60</b> that may be used with the embodiments described herein is provided in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/083,478, filed Jul. 24, 2008, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/509,258, filed Jul. 24, 2009, each of which applications is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As the body <b>40</b> moves further into the sleeve assembly <b>20</b> during compression, the shaft <b>22</b> further enters the volume of the damping fluid chamber <b>45</b> and occupies and thereby reduces available fluid volume therein. In one embodiment, the compressible chamber <b>55</b> is filled with a compressible fluid such as a gas and/or is preloaded at an elevated pressure. In one embodiment, the damping fluid chamber <b>45</b> is filled with a liquid damping fluid that is relatively incompressible. As the shaft <b>22</b> enters the damping fluid chamber <b>45</b> and reduces the fluid volume therein, the relatively incompressible damping fluid is displaced. The volume of the damping fluid chamber <b>45</b> is therefore correspondingly increased to compensate for the reduction, due to the incursion of the shaft <b>22</b>, by movement of the floating piston assembly <b>50</b> such that the gas in the compressible chamber <b>55</b> is compressed or further compressed. The floating piston assembly <b>55</b> is configured for transferring pressure from the damping fluid chamber <b>45</b> to the compressible chamber <b>55</b>. The floating piston assembly <b>50</b> moves to reduce the volume of the compressible chamber <b>55</b> (and compressing the fluid therein) while increasing (i.e. compensating) the volume of the damping fluid chamber <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one embodiment, as the shaft <b>22</b> moves into the damping fluid chamber <b>45</b> and towards the compressible chamber <b>55</b>, the inner compression rod <b>26</b> may be biased at one end by a damping adjustment spring <b>62</b>, which also biases a damping adjustment valve <b>65</b>. At the same time, pressure within the damping fluid chamber <b>45</b> increases. This increased pressure pushes against the damping adjustment valve <b>65</b> against the bias of the damping adjustment spring <b>62</b>. If the pressure overcomes the seating force of the damping adjustment valve <b>65</b>, then an aperture <b>68</b> opens up and allows damping fluid to flow through to the opposite side of the piston assembly <b>60</b>. The damping fluid may flow through one or more channels <b>67</b> to the other side of the piston assembly <b>60</b>. Adjusting the amount of preload on the damping adjustment spring <b>62</b> by axially moving the compression rod <b>26</b> toward and away from the piston assembly <b>60</b>, thereby adjusts the damping rate of the shock absorber <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one embodiment, as the shaft <b>22</b> moves out of the damping fluid chamber <b>45</b> and away from the compressible chamber <b>55</b>, a rebound metering spring <b>28</b> is pushing the rebound metering rod <b>24</b> away from the piston assembly <b>60</b>. The rebound metering spring <b>28</b> is disposed between an inner shoulder of the shaft <b>22</b> and an outer shoulder of the rebound metering rod <b>24</b>. At the same time, the rebound metering rod <b>24</b> and the piston assembly <b>60</b> allow the damping fluid to flow from the opposite side of the piston assembly <b>60</b> back into the damping fluid chamber <b>45</b>. The damping fluid may flow through one or more channels that are metered by the rebound metering rod <b>24</b> depending on its axial position relative to the piston assembly <b>60</b>. Adjusting the axial position of the rebound metering rod <b>24</b>, e.g. moving the rebound metering rod <b>24</b> toward and away from the piston assembly <b>60</b>, thereby adjusts the rebound rate of the shock absorber <b>100</b>. For example, when the rebound metering rod <b>24</b> is in a first position relative to the piston assembly <b>60</b>, the rebound damping fluid may flow more freely from above the piston assembly <b>60</b> to below the piston assembly <b>60</b> during extension of the body <b>40</b> from the sleeve assembly <b>20</b>. Therefore the shock absorber <b>100</b> extends more rapidly. And when the rebound metering rod <b>24</b> is moved axially to a second position, the rebound damping fluid may flow less freely from above the piston assembly <b>60</b> to below the piston assembly <b>60</b>. Therefore the shock absorber <b>100</b> extends more slowly.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The axial positions of the rebound metering rod <b>24</b> and the compression rod <b>26</b> may be selectively adjusted by rotation of a first damper adjuster, such as a rebound metering cam shaft <b>90</b>, and a second damper adjuster, such as a compression cam shaft <b>76</b>, respectively, that are each rotatably mounted within a recess <b>71</b> of the housing assembly <b>10</b>. The compression cam shaft <b>76</b> may include one or more lobes <b>77</b> of varying height that engage an upper end of the compression rod <b>26</b> via a ball member <b>78</b> to axially move the compression rod <b>26</b> toward and away from the damping adjustment spring <b>62</b>. Rotation of compression cam shaft <b>76</b> moves the lobes <b>77</b> into engagement with the compression rod <b>26</b> to cause axial displacement thereof and correspondingly alter the damper adjustment spring <b>26</b> preload to adjust damping rates. A connecting rod <b>73</b> may be disposed through the compression cam shaft <b>76</b>, and may engage a spring <b>72</b> disposed within an end of the compression cam shaft <b>76</b> at one end and coupled to a knob <b>70</b> at the opposite end. A lever <b>75</b> may also be coupled to the compression cam shaft <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Similarly, the rebound metering cam shaft <b>90</b> may include a varying outer diameter surface <b>96</b> that engages an upper end of the rebound metering rod <b>24</b> to axially move the rod <b>24</b> toward and away from the piston assembly <b>60</b> against the bias of the rebound metering spring <b>28</b>. Rotation of the rebound metering cam shaft <b>90</b> causes rotation of the outer diameter surface <b>96</b>, which surface abuts a portion of an upper end of the rebound metering rod <b>24</b>, and corresponding axial movement of the rebound metering rod <b>24</b>. Axial movement of the rod <b>24</b> allows or obstructs rebound damping fluid flow through the piston assembly <b>60</b>. A ball and spring assembly <b>80</b> may be disposed within the housing assembly <b>10</b> to engage one or more detents that are formed on the outer surface of the rebound metering cam shaft <b>90</b>. The ball and detent mechanism as further discussed below is configured to assist with selective adjustment and maintenance of the axial position of the rebound metering rod <b>24</b> by rotation of the rebound metering cam shaft <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> illustrate a first and second axial position of the rebound metering rod <b>24</b> corresponding to contact with the varying outer &#x201c;diameter&#x201d; surface <b>96</b> of the rebound metering cam shaft <b>90</b>. The rotational position of the rebound metering cam shaft <b>90</b> is supported by a retaining member or a keeper, such as ball <b>85</b>, that is biased by a spring <b>87</b> into engagement with one or more small recesses or &#x201c;detents&#x201d; <b>92</b>, <b>93</b> disposed in an annular recess <b>91</b> on the outer surface of the rebound metering cam shaft <b>90</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The ball <b>85</b> and spring <b>87</b> are held within the housing assembly <b>10</b> by a support member <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one embodiment the ball <b>85</b>, the spring <b>87</b>, and the detents <b>92</b>, <b>93</b> can be used to form an incremental adjuster to control resolution of rotation of the rebound metering cam shaft <b>90</b> and thus the axial displacement of the rebound metering rod <b>24</b>. As a knob portion of the shaft <b>90</b> is turned, there is a noticeable (to the user by &#x201c;clicking&#x201d; feel for example) detent engagement and the shaft <b>90</b> is held in rotational position by the ball engaged detent. The knob portion of the shaft <b>90</b> may be positioned adjacent to the knob <b>70</b> for ease of access and operation and is rotatable relative to the housing assembly <b>10</b>. The knob portion, in the shown embodiment, is formed integrally with the rebound metering cam shaft <b>90</b>, but may be formed as a separate member that is coupled to the shaft in other embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In general, for a given diameter ball and detent depth the number of detent positions at any one axially located circumference is limited by the diameter of the adjuster. In order to increase the number of potential detent positions and hence the adjuster resolution, the shaft <b>90</b> is provided with a first row or set of detents <b>92</b> and a second row or set of detents <b>93</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The second row of detents <b>93</b> is offset axially from the first row of detents <b>92</b>, and is also shifted by half of the rotational angle between same row detents. This pattern creates a &#x201c;zig-zag&#x201d; path for the ball <b>85</b> to follow as the cam shaft <b>90</b> is rotated. The geometry of the detents may be adjusted so that the detents <b>92</b>, <b>93</b> intersect and share a portion of their outer boundary. In one embodiment, the ball <b>85</b> may move from one detent <b>92</b> to an adjacent detent <b>93</b> through the intersection formed between the detents <b>92</b>, <b>93</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, and <b>8</b>, the detents <b>92</b>, <b>93</b> or other suitable recesses/depressions (or protrusions to interface with a cup instead of the shown ball <b>85</b>) are situated at locations circumferentially around the shaft <b>90</b>. The detents <b>92</b>, <b>93</b> engage with the ball and spring assembly <b>80</b> that operates to axially impinge the ball <b>85</b> into the detents <b>92</b>, <b>93</b> as the detents pass under the ball <b>85</b> during rotation of the shaft <b>90</b>. As the shaft <b>90</b> is rotated, the ball <b>85</b> alternatingly plunges into the passing detents <b>92</b>, <b>93</b> and is pushed out by compression of the spring <b>87</b> as the detent passes by. Subsequently, the ball <b>85</b> will plunge into the next sequentially passing detent. Such engagement of the ball <b>85</b> with the detents <b>92</b>, <b>93</b> creates a &#x201c;resolution&#x201d; that can be felt when turning the knob portion of the shaft <b>90</b>, whereby the knob portion will tend to come to, and stay in, rest at a ball engaged detent rotational position.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">It follows from the preceding that the fineness of resolution of the shaft <b>90</b> depends on the circumferential density of the detents <b>92</b>, <b>93</b> (or protrusions as the case may be). In one embodiment, the ball and spring assembly <b>80</b> has some latitude for movement in an axial direction fore to aft, within a recess <b>88</b> of the housing assembly <b>10</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</figref>), which is a direction substantially parallel to the axis of the shaft <b>90</b>. In one embodiment, the detents <b>92</b>, <b>93</b> are positioned in a first circumference <b>94</b> about the shaft <b>90</b> and also in a second circumference <b>95</b> about the shaft <b>90</b> such that the first and second circumferences <b>94</b>, <b>95</b> are axially close (within a detent radius, for example). The first and second circumferences <b>94</b>, <b>95</b> may also coincide with the central axes of the respective row of detents <b>92</b>, <b>93</b>. As such, there are two &#x201c;rows&#x201d; of detents around the shaft <b>90</b>. In one embodiment, the detents <b>92</b>, <b>93</b> of the rows may be arranged such that the detents <b>92</b>, <b>93</b> as seen on the shaft <b>90</b> alternate from one &#x201c;row&#x201d; to the next &#x201c;row&#x201d; and back again through a shaft rotation. In one embodiment, the ball and spring assembly <b>80</b> has latitude to move side to side sufficiently to impress the ball <b>85</b> in each alternating detent row as the detents <b>92</b>, <b>93</b> pass under the ball <b>85</b>. As such, the fineness of shaft <b>90</b> resolution is now dependent on the combination of the two rows of detents <b>92</b>, <b>93</b>. In one embodiment, there are three detent rows having staggered detents and a ball spring having sufficient latitude to engage all three. In one embodiment the natural &#x201c;ridge&#x201d; between adjacent detents is reduced (creating a sort of &#x201c;detented&#x201d; zig zag &#x201c;channel&#x201d; for example) so that the ball is &#x201c;guided&#x201d; in its movement between axially spaced detents.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In this manner, the resolution of the shaft <b>90</b> formed by the detent <b>92</b>, <b>93</b> arrangement provides for a more fine tuned adjustment or movement of the varying outer diameter surface <b>96</b> of the shaft <b>90</b> to incrementally axially displace and retain the rebound metering rod <b>24</b>, which thereby incrementally adjusts the damping rate of the shock absorber <b>100</b>. In one embodiment, a shape of the detents <b>92</b>, <b>93</b> may be in the form of partial spherical depressions. Other shapes of detents may be used with the embodiments described herein.</p>
