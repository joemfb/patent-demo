<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates generally to lighter-than-air systems, methods, and kits. More particularly, the invention relates to lighter-than-air systems, methods, and kits for obtaining one or more aerial images.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Satellites and heavier-than-air aircraft, both manned and unmanned, have been used for many years to perform tasks associated with gathering aerial images. However, these techniques generally obtain the images from relatively high altitudes, which presents several disadvantages such as precluding optimal look angles for the imaging device and introducing the potential for cloud cover to occlude the imaging device. In addition, these techniques generally include on-board continuous propulsion and steering systems, which increase the weight of the overall system, and increase the costs in obtaining the images. Furthermore, the continuous propulsion and steering systems tend to interfere with the quality of the images collected.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition to satellites and heavier-than-air aircraft, lighter-than-air aircraft (e.g., balloons, airships, dirigibles) have been used to obtain aerial images. However, these devices have disadvantages associated with the use of on-board propulsion systems as the sole means of lateral movement and being able to maintain a particular altitude during flight to obtain images at a desired look angle.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, there is a need for lighter-than-air systems, methods, and kits for gathering aerial images.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> illustrate an exemplary lighter-than-air system <b>100</b> for obtaining one or more aerial images (e.g., aerial photography system). The system <b>100</b> comprises an airship <b>102</b> and an instrument case <b>200</b> attached to the airship <b>102</b>. The airship <b>102</b> comprises a first end <b>103</b>, a second end <b>104</b>, a balloon <b>105</b>, and one or more fins <b>106</b>. The balloon <b>105</b> comprises a wall <b>107</b> defining a reserve chamber <b>120</b>, cruise chamber <b>140</b>, and a spill chamber <b>160</b>. Each of the reserve chamber <b>120</b>, cruise chamber <b>140</b>, and spill chamber <b>160</b> is an independent chamber, separate from, and not in fluid communication, with the other chambers. The one or more fins <b>106</b> can be formed from the wall <b>107</b> of the balloon <b>105</b>, or be separate elements attached to the wall <b>107</b> of the balloon <b>105</b>. The one or more fins <b>106</b> are illustrated as attached to the second end <b>104</b> of the balloon <b>105</b>, however, the fins <b>106</b> may be positioned at any suitable location on the of the wall <b>107</b>, and skilled artisans will select an appropriate position for the one or more fins based on various considerations, such as the desired stability of the system <b>100</b> during flight.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The balloon <b>105</b> is formed of a transparent fabric (e.g., polyester films (e.g., biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate (Mylar&#xae;), latex), synthetic fabrics, non-metallic materials, lightweight materials). The balloon <b>105</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> is shown in an inflated configuration. While the balloon <b>105</b> has been described as formed of a particular material, other materials having any suitable degree of transparency, translucency, or opaqueness, or any suitable degree of flexibility, are considered suitable, and skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable material for a particular embodiment based on various considerations, including the desired visibility of the system while in flight, and/or the desired flexibility of the balloon.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In addition, while the wall <b>107</b> of the balloon <b>105</b> is described as defining the reserve chamber <b>120</b>, cruise chamber <b>140</b>, and spill chamber <b>160</b>, one or more of the chambers can alternatively be formed from one or more separate identical, substantially identical, or different, balloons attached to one another, and/or a frame, in various configurations and defining each of the reserve chamber, cruise chamber, and/or spill chamber. Thus, one or more balloons having a wall defining a chamber can define, or be combined (e.g., summed), to define one or more of the reserve chamber, cruise chamber, and/or spill chamber. In a further alternative, one or more of the chambers can alternatively be formed from multiple separate chambers and/or balloons. Example methods of attachment considered suitable between one or more balloons forming the reserve chamber, cruise chamber, and/or spill chamber, or a frame, include, but are not limited to, using one or more hook-and-loop fasteners (e.g., Velcro&#xae;), mechanical fasteners, straps, wire, string, adhesive, sonic welds, and any other suitable form of attachment. Example inflated balloon diameters considered suitable for inclusion in any system described herein, include, but are not limited to, diameters in the range from about 1 foot (0.3048 meters) to about 5 feet (1.524 meters). Other examples of inflated balloon diameters considered suitable for inclusion in any system described herein, include, but are not limited to, diameters in the range from about 1 foot (0.3048 meters) to about 10 feet (3.048 meters). Further examples of inflated balloon diameters considered suitable for inclusion in any system described herein, include, but are not limited to, diameters in the range from about 2 feet (0.6096 meters) to about 7 feet (2.1336 meters). While a particular range has been described, other inflated balloon diameters and/or ranges are considered suitable, and skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable inflated diameter and/or range based on various considerations, such as the desired cruising altitude of a system. Example balloons considered suitable include, but are not limited to, off the shelf balloons, and custom balloons.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The reserve chamber <b>120</b> is movable between a deflated configuration and an inflated configuration. The reserve chamber <b>120</b> comprises a wall <b>122</b> and a bi-directional valve <b>124</b> disposed in the wall <b>122</b>. The bi-directional valve <b>124</b> is adapted to introduce fluid into, hold fluid within, and remove fluid from the reserve chamber <b>120</b>. The reserve chamber <b>120</b> is configured to receive and contain a volume of fluid sufficient to offset about 50% to 90% of the weight of the system <b>100</b>. Stated otherwise, the reserve chamber <b>120</b> is configured to receive and contain a volume of fluid sufficient to provide about 50% to 90% of the neutral buoyancy of the system <b>100</b>. Example volumes of fluid considered suitable include volumes of fluid that offset about 70% of the weight of the system <b>100</b>. Further example volumes of fluid considered suitable include volumes of fluid that offset about 1% to about 100% of the weight of the system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the illustrated embodiment, the fluid is contained within the reserve chamber <b>120</b> throughout the flight of the system and at least advantageously allows for the system <b>100</b> to slowly descend when the cruise chamber <b>140</b> and the spill chamber <b>160</b> have been moved from an inflated configuration to a deflated configuration and have released a portion, or the entirety, of the volume of fluid contained within the cruise chamber <b>140</b> and spill chamber <b>160</b>. The reserve chamber <b>120</b> can optionally include a one-way flow valve disposed in the wall <b>122</b> of the reserve chamber <b>120</b> that is adapted to release the fluid contained within the reserve chamber <b>120</b>, or a portion thereof, upon receipt of a signal, as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The cruise chamber <b>140</b> is movable between a deflated configuration and an inflated configuration. The cruise chamber <b>140</b> comprises a wall <b>142</b>, bi-directional valve <b>144</b>, and a one-way flow valve <b>146</b>. The bi-directional valve <b>144</b> is disposed in the wall <b>142</b> of the cruise chamber <b>140</b> and is adapted to introduce fluid into, hold fluid within, and remove fluid from the cruise chamber <b>140</b>. The one-way flow valve <b>146</b> is disposed in the wall <b>142</b> of the cruise chamber <b>140</b> and is adapted to release the fluid contained within the cruise chamber <b>140</b>, or a portion thereof, upon receipt of a signal, as described below. The cruise chamber <b>140</b> is configured to receive and contain a volume of fluid sufficient to offset about 100% of the weight of the system <b>100</b> when taking into account the volume of fluid disposed within the reserve chamber <b>120</b> (e.g., buoyancy provided by the volume of fluid contained in the reserve chamber <b>120</b>). Stated otherwise, the cruise chamber <b>140</b> is configured to receive and contain a volume of fluid sufficient to provide about 100% neutral buoyancy of the system <b>100</b> when the volume of fluid within the cruise chamber <b>140</b> is summed with the volume of fluid disposed within the reserve chamber <b>120</b>. Example volumes of fluid considered suitable include volumes of fluid that offset about 10% to 50% of the weight of the system. Further example volumes of fluid considered suitable include volumes of fluid that offset about 30% of the weight of the system <b>100</b>. Even further example volumes of fluid considered suitable include volumes of fluid that offset about 1% to about 100% of the weight of the system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The spill chamber <b>160</b> is movable between a deflated configuration and an inflated configuration. The spill chamber <b>160</b> comprises a wall <b>162</b>, bi-directional valve <b>164</b>, one-way valve <b>166</b>, one or more apertures <b>168</b>, and one or more plugs <b>170</b>. The bi-directional valve <b>164</b> is disposed in the wall <b>162</b> of the spill chamber <b>160</b> and is adapted to introduce fluid into, hold fluid within, and remove fluid from the spill chamber <b>160</b>. The one-way valve <b>166</b> is disposed in the wall <b>162</b> of the spill chamber <b>160</b> is adapted to release the fluid, or a portion thereof, contained within the cruise chamber <b>160</b> upon receipt of a signal, as described below. The wall <b>162</b> of the spill chamber <b>160</b> defines the one or more apertures <b>168</b> which extend through the wall <b>162</b> of the spill chamber <b>160</b> and allow fluid to pass through the wall <b>162</b> of the spill chamber <b>160</b>. Alternative to including both the one-way valve <b>166</b> and the one or more apertures <b>168</b>, the wall <b>162</b> of the spill chamber <b>160</b> can include either a one-way valve <b>166</b> or one or more apertures <b>168</b> and one or more plugs <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Each of the one or more plugs <b>170</b> comprises a length and diameter configured to engage with one of the one or more apertures. Each of the one or more plugs <b>170</b> is adapted to be received by the wall <b>162</b> of the spill chamber <b>160</b> and within an aperture <b>168</b> to provide a sealing engagement between the plug <b>170</b> and aperture <b>168</b> to prevent fluid from passing through the aperture <b>168</b>. Optionally, each of the one or more plugs <b>170</b> can be attached to the wall <b>162</b> of the spill chamber <b>160</b> to prevent loss (e.g., through the use of a lanyard). Each of the one or more plugs <b>170</b> has a first configuration and a second configuration. In the first configuration, each of the one or more plugs <b>170</b> is disposed within an aperture <b>168</b>, thereby preventing fluid from being released from the spill chamber <b>160</b>. In the second configuration, one or more of the plugs <b>170</b> is free from the aperture <b>168</b>, thereby allowing fluid to be released from the spill chamber <b>160</b>. Each of the one or more plugs <b>170</b> is movable from the first configuration to the second configuration, and vice versa, by a user inserting a portion, or the entirety, of one of the one or more plugs <b>170</b> into one of the one or more apertures <b>168</b>, or removing one of the one or more plugs <b>170</b> from one of the one or more apertures <b>168</b>. The number of plugs <b>170</b> considered suitable to move from the first configuration to the second configuration can vary according to the planned ascent, cruising altitude, and/or descent of the system <b>100</b>, as described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The spill chamber <b>160</b> is configured to receive and contain a volume of fluid sufficient to provide positive buoyancy to the system <b>100</b>, and to allow for a timed ascent of the system <b>100</b> by releasing of a portion of the fluid contained within the spill chamber <b>160</b> throughout the ascent of the system <b>100</b> via one or more of the one or more apertures <b>168</b>, the bi-directional valve <b>164</b>, and/or the one-way valve <b>166</b>. The gradual release of the fluid contained within the spill chamber <b>160</b> eventually brings the system <b>100</b> to a cruising altitude (e.g., when the spill chamber has released all of the fluid contained therein), wherein neutral buoyancy is achieved, or substantially achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The spill chamber <b>160</b> can have multiple structural arrangements to accomplish planned drift and/or a cruising altitude. In one exemplary structural arrangement, the number and/or diameter of the one or more apertures <b>168</b> defined by the wall <b>162</b> of the spill chamber <b>160</b> can vary, and thus, various spill rates can be achieved by calculating the number and diameter of apertures <b>168</b> required for a particular ascent rate and desired altitude. For example, at least two of the one or more apertures <b>168</b> and at least two of the one or more plugs <b>170</b> can vary in diameter. Skilled artisans will be able to select an appropriate number of apertures <b>168</b>, and diameters thereof, according to a particular embodiment based on various considerations, such as the desired ascent velocity of the system <b>100</b>. Examples of suitable numbers of apertures <b>168</b> include one, two, three, four, five, six, seven and any other number considered suitable for a particular application. Alternative to providing one or more apertures <b>168</b>, bi-directional valve <b>164</b> and/or the one-way valve <b>166</b> can be adapted to release a portion, or the entirety, of the volume of fluid contained within the spill chamber <b>160</b> during ascent, upon receipt of a signal, as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The spill chamber <b>160</b> can be configured to contain a volume of fluid that offsets about 30% of the weight of the system <b>100</b>, thereby providing a lift force to the system <b>100</b> when the volumes of fluid contained in the reserve chamber <b>120</b>, cruise chamber <b>140</b>, and spill chamber <b>160</b> are used in combination. Other example volumes of fluid considered suitable include volumes of fluid that offset about 1% to about 100% of the original weight of the system <b>100</b>. Another example volume of fluid considered suitable includes a volume of fluid that offsets about 10% of the original weight of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The configurations of each of the reserve chamber <b>120</b>, cruise chamber <b>140</b>, and spill chamber <b>160</b> can vary, and skilled artisans will be able to select an appropriate configuration based on various considerations (e.g., the desired drag of the system). For example, the reserve chamber <b>120</b> and the cruise chamber <b>140</b> can be disposed adjacent one another, and the spill chamber <b>160</b> can be disposed on an exterior portion of the wall <b>142</b> of the cruise chamber <b>140</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. It is considered advantageous to configure chambers <b>120</b>, <b>140</b>, and <b>160</b> aerodynamically, such as by adapting the outer wall of the one or more balloons in the inflated configuration to capture wind and the pull associated with low pressure to generate thrust and cause the system to travel in a planned direction. This advantageously reduces the need for the interaction of a propulsion system. For example, the system <b>100</b> can optionally include one or more straps (not illustrated) positioned along the cruise chamber <b>140</b> and/or spill chamber <b>160</b> adapted to configure the cruise chamber <b>140</b> and/or spill chamber <b>160</b> as a parachutes and/or a sail when in the deflated configuration to assist with the descent of the system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The system <b>100</b> can optionally include a retrieval connector <b>108</b> formed of a rigid, or semi-rigid, material disposed on any portion of the wall <b>107</b> of the balloon <b>105</b>. The retrieval connector <b>108</b> can be configured to receive a length of retrieval line (e.g., tether) in instances where the system is tethered to a ground retrieval device. Alternatively, the retrieval connector <b>108</b> can be formed in the wall <b>107</b> of the balloon <b>105</b>. In a further alternative, a tether can be attached to any suitable portion of the instrument case <b>200</b>, or other portions of the system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Each of the bi-directional valves <b>124</b>, <b>144</b>, and <b>164</b> described above can comprise any suitable valve that is configured to have a first configuration where fluid can be introduced into the one or more chambers, a second configuration where the bi-directional valve holds fluid within the one or more chambers, and a third configuration where the bi-directional valve allows for fluid to be removed from the one or more chambers (e.g., <b>120</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>160</b>). These configurations can be utilized separately, or in combination with one another, and can be selected and activated upon receipt of a signal from a user, ground control software, and/or on-board software, as described in more detail herein. Example valves considered suitable include French valves (e.g., Presta&#xae; valves), automotive-style air valves (e.g., Schrader&#xae; valves), and/or Dunlop valves (e.g., Woods valves). Alternatively, the bi-directional valves can comprise one-way valves that are configured to introduce fluid into one or more of the chambers, and retain the fluid within the one or more chambers.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Each of the one-way valves (e.g., <b>146</b>, <b>166</b>, optional one-way valve in wall <b>122</b> of reserve chamber <b>120</b>) described above can comprise any suitable valve that is configured to have a first configuration where the one-way valve holds fluid within the respective chamber, and a second configuration where the one-way valve releases the entirety, or a portion, of the fluid contained within the respective chamber upon receipt of a signal from a user, ground control software, and/or on-board software, as described in more detail herein. For example, the one-way valves can comprise any valve that can be remotely actuated, including miniature electrically-controlled actuation mechanisms. In another example, the one-way valves comprise a spring-loaded lid and/or electrified magnetic rim, which, upon switched demagnetization, or battery depletion, or other signal, opens and releases the entirety, or a portion, of the fluid contained within the chamber. Alternative to including a one-way valve, the bi-directional valve described above (e.g., <b>124</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>164</b>) can include a means of releasing the fluid contained within the chamber, such as those described above, or otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In embodiments that include one or more balloons forming the reserve chamber, cruise chamber, and/or spill chamber, each of the walls defining the reserve chamber, cruise chamber, and/or spill chamber can comprise one or more bi-directional valves, one-way valves, apertures, and/or plugs as described herein. Each of the bi-directional valves, one-way valves, apertures, and/or plugs provide a mechanism for introducing, retaining, and/or releasing fluid contained within the balloon and/or a mechanism to provide thrust to the system. For example, the bi-directional valves and/or one-way valves can be positioned along any portion of the one or more balloons and at any angle to allow for maneuverability, stabilization, ascent, and/or descent of the system.</p>

The instrument case <b>200</b> is attached to the balloon <b>105</b> by any suitable means of connection <b>201</b> (e.g., fishing line, steel wire, nylon rope). It is considered advantageous to attach the instrument case at, or near, the first end <b>103</b> of the balloon <b>105</b> to provide aerodynamic distribution of weight. Alternatively, the instrument case <b>200</b> can be attached directly to the balloon <b>105</b> to prevent oscillation of the devices contained within the instrument case <b>200</b> (e.g., observation devices <b>220</b>) during flight.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The housing <b>202</b> comprises one or more downward facing windows <b>204</b> allowing for the one or more observation devices <b>220</b> and/or one or more sensing devices <b>230</b> to be directed towards a point of interest during flight. The housing <b>202</b> can be formed of any suitable material, and the housing <b>202</b> can comprise any suitable geometric shape for housing the devices stored therein. For example, the housing <b>202</b> can be formed of closed-cell extruded polystyrene foam (e.g., Styrofoam&#xae;) to protect the devices stored within the housing <b>202</b>.

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">It is considered advantageous to form the instrument case <b>200</b> of a miniaturized housing <b>202</b> that houses one or more miniaturized devices (e.g., circuit board <b>210</b>, observation devices <b>220</b>, sensing devices <b>230</b>, location devices <b>240</b>, computational devices <b>250</b>, communication devices <b>260</b>, storage devices <b>270</b>, energy storage devices <b>280</b>) within the housing <b>202</b> to at least reduce the weight and size of the instrument case <b>200</b>. By including miniaturized devices in the instrument case <b>200</b>, the system <b>100</b> can advantageously be launched and/or landed in locations that do not require a launching and/or landing platform (e.g., airstrip, helipad).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In addition, it is considered advantageous to provide a housing <b>202</b> that allows for a user to access the devices housed therein for repair, or replacement. For example, the housing <b>202</b> can have one or more portions that are hingedly connected to one another (e.g., top and bottom portion), attached to one another using one or more threaded components (e.g., screws), and/or snap fit to one another (e.g., top and bottom portions).</p>

<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The cap <b>346</b> is disposed on a portion of the servo <b>344</b> such that it can be moved between a first position and a second position. In the first position, the aperture <b>347</b> of the cap <b>346</b> is in communication with the aperture <b>351</b> defined by the first tubular member <b>348</b>. In the second position, the aperture <b>347</b> of the cap <b>346</b> is not in communication with the aperture <b>351</b> defined by the first tubular member <b>348</b>. Thus, when the second tubular member <b>354</b> and the cap <b>346</b> are each in the first position, fluid can be passed through the aperture <b>347</b> of the cap <b>346</b>, the aperture <b>351</b> of the first tubular member <b>348</b>, and the passageway <b>355</b> of the second tubular member <b>354</b> into and/or out of the chamber <b>360</b> of the balloon <b>359</b>. If either of the second tubular member <b>354</b> or the cap <b>346</b> is in the second position, fluid is retained within the chamber <b>360</b> of the balloon <b>359</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Alternatively, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the second tubular member can be omitted, and an alternative valve <b>362</b> can comprise a base <b>363</b>, servo <b>364</b>, cap <b>365</b>, and a first tubular member <b>366</b>. The valve <b>362</b> is similar to valve <b>340</b>, except as described herein. The cap <b>365</b> is attached to a portion of the servo <b>364</b> such that with activation of the servo <b>364</b> the cap <b>365</b> can rotate. The cap <b>365</b> defines an aperture <b>367</b> that extends through a thickness of the cap <b>365</b>. The first tubular member <b>366</b> comprises a first end <b>368</b> and a second end <b>369</b> and defines a first passageway <b>370</b> and a second passageway <b>371</b>. The first passageway <b>370</b> extends between an opening on the first end <b>368</b> and an opening the second end <b>369</b> of the first tubular member <b>366</b>. The second passageway <b>371</b> extends between an opening on the first end <b>368</b> and an opening on the second end <b>369</b> of the first tubular member <b>366</b>. The second end <b>369</b> is adapted to be attached to an opening defined by a wall of a balloon such that the first passageway <b>370</b> and the second passageway <b>371</b> are in communication with a chamber defined by the wall of the balloon. The second passageway <b>371</b> comprises a one-way valve <b>375</b> that allows fluid to be passed through the second passageway <b>371</b> and into the chamber defined by the balloon, but prevents fluid from flowing out of the chamber of the balloon through the second passageway <b>371</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The cap <b>365</b> is disposed on a portion of the servo <b>364</b> such that it can be moved between a first position, a second position, and a third position. In the first position, the aperture <b>367</b> of the cap <b>365</b> is in communication with the first passageway <b>370</b> defined by the first tubular member <b>366</b>, allowing for fluid to be passed into and/or released from the chamber defined by the balloon. In the second position, the aperture <b>367</b> of the cap <b>365</b> is in communication with the second passageway <b>371</b> defined by the first tubular member <b>366</b>, allowing for fluid to be introduced into the chamber defined by the balloon and preventing fluid from being released through the second passageway <b>371</b>. In the third position, the aperture <b>367</b> defined by the cap <b>365</b> is not in communication with either of the first passageway <b>370</b> or the second passageway <b>371</b>, preventing fluid from entering or escaping from the chamber of the balloon.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Each of the valves <b>340</b> and <b>362</b> described herein can comprise one or more gaskets to prevent fluid from leaking between the various elements described. For example, valve <b>340</b> can comprise one or more gaskets disposed between the cap <b>346</b> and the first tubular member <b>348</b>, disposed between the first tubular member <b>348</b> and the second tubular member <b>354</b>, and/or disposed between the second tubular member <b>354</b> and the balloon <b>359</b>. In another example, the valve <b>362</b> can comprise one or more gaskets disposed between the cap <b>365</b> and the first tubular member <b>366</b>, and/or disposed between the first tubular member <b>366</b> and an attached balloon.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In another example, each of the one or more balloons defining the one or more chambers can comprise a neck that provides access to the chamber of the balloon. A tubular member can be disposed and attached within the neck of the balloon and in communication with a servomechanism. For example, the servomechanism can comprise a servo arm having an aperture and a portion of the tubular member can extend through the aperture of the servo arm. The tubular member has a first configuration and a second configuration. In the first configuration, the tubular member allows for fluid within the chamber to be released from the chamber into the atmosphere. In the second configuration, the servomechanism rotates the servo arm to kink the tubular member preventing fluid from the chamber from flowing into the atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Alternatively, the neck of the balloon defining an opening that provides access to the chamber defined by the wall of the balloon can be inserted through the aperture of the servo arm and have a first configuration and a second configuration. In the first configuration, the neck of the balloon allows for fluid within the chamber to be released from the chamber into the atmosphere. In the second configuration, the servomechanism rotates the servo arm to kink the neck of the balloon preventing fluid from the chamber from flowing into the atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The bi-directional valves (e.g., <b>124</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>164</b>) and/or one-way valves (e.g., <b>146</b>, <b>166</b>, optional one-way valve in wall <b>162</b> of reserve chamber <b>160</b>) described herein can comprise any suitable valve for accomplishing the introduction, retention, and/or release of fluid contained within the one or more chambers. Examples of valves considered suitable include, but are not limited to, ball valves, butterfly valves, globe valves, gate valves, diaphragm valves, and/or other valves described herein. While particular valves have been describe, skilled artisans will be able to select an appropriate valve according to a particular embodiment based on various considerations, such as the weight of the valve, the weight of the system, and/or the volume of fluid to be retained within the one or more chambers.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an exemplary method <b>450</b> of obtaining aerial images using a lighter-than-air system (e.g., system <b>100</b>, system <b>800</b>, system <b>900</b>, system <b>1100</b>, system <b>1400</b>, system <b>2100</b>, system <b>2200</b>). An initial step <b>452</b> comprises determining one or more images to obtain. Another step <b>454</b> comprises inputting data into ground control software. Another step <b>456</b> comprises obtaining data from the ground control software. Another step <b>458</b> comprises proceeding to a launch site. Another step <b>460</b> comprises placing the system on a scale. Another step <b>462</b> comprises introducing a volume of fluid into one or more of the chambers. Another step <b>464</b> comprises removing one or more plugs from the wall of the spill chamber. Another step <b>466</b> comprises launching the system. Another step <b>468</b> comprises tracking the system. Another step <b>470</b> comprises adjusting the flight path of the system. Another step <b>472</b> comprises initiating the descent of the system. Another step <b>474</b> comprises proceeding to the landing site of the system. Another step <b>476</b> comprises retrieving the system.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The step <b>452</b> of determining one or more images to obtain can be accomplished by determining the location, and amount, of images to be acquired. For example, this can be accomplished by selecting a project area that contains one or more ground and/or aerial points of interest for which a user wishes to obtain images. Alternatively, or in combination with one or more points of interest, the selected locations can include regional coverage of an area.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The step <b>454</b> of inputting data into ground control software can be accomplished by providing a computer system, or other device, containing a software program (e.g., ground control software program) that is configured to calculate at least one or more of a planned ascent, cruising altitude, drift, and/or descent of the system. The data input into the ground control software program can include, but is not limited to, the weight of the system, the location of images to be obtained (e.g., preselected points of interest), the number of images to be obtained, the length of time for the flight, the desired launch site, the number of systems being launched, the desired landing site, the desired flight path, the desired planned drift, and/or other data as described herein. The data can be input into the ground control software program through a variety of input means (e.g., keyboard, voice command, keypad, text message, file upload).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">When available, the ground control software program is configured to utilize any suitable data, such as internet data (e.g., whether launch site and/or landing site is on private property, height above sea level, whether a launch site and/or landing site is in a water mass), field data (e.g., topographical, geographical, land use, forces caused by buildings and/or mountains), meteorological data (e.g., wind speed, updrafts caused by heat, pressure changes caused by geographic conditions, pressure changes caused by sun positions, temperature, time of day, historic meteorological data, on shore and/or off sore sea side breezes), and mathematical methods to determine at least the planned ascent, drift, and descent of the system and output data associated with at least one or more of the volume of fluid required in each chamber (e.g., <b>120</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>1144</b>, <b>1154</b>, <b>1164</b>, <b>1444</b>, <b>1454</b>, <b>1566</b>), the location of the launch site, the optimal launch time, the number of plugs to remove from the wall of the spill chamber, the timing of the release of fluid from the cruise chamber, and/or the location of the end of the landing site. Examples of mathematical methods considered suitable to determine the above factors include, but are not limited to: van der Hoven's spectrum (e.g., predicting the angle and force of geostrophic and local winds), Weibull's distribution (e.g., estimating probability of wind speed), and Prandtl's logarithmic law (e.g., estimating ground friction effects and wind sheer effects). These formulae and data can be utilized to generate a histogram for a particular project.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The ground control software program is configured to calculate one or more of planned ascent, drift, descent, and/or aerial points and/or paths to travel to allow the one or more devices housed within the instrument case to obtain images requested by the user using the above data, based on user input of a launch point, landing site, desired flight path, and/or cruising altitude. Alternatively, with respect to obtaining images relating to a particular location, the ground control software can output data relating to an optimal launch site or launch time, if the user indicates that one or the other is more important. For example, where obtaining images of a particular location is necessary as soon as possible (e.g., public safety or national security is at issue), a user can indicate to the ground control software that launch will be immediate, or at a designated time, such that the ground control software optimizes the launch site for prevailing conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The ground control software is configured to store information relating to past and/or present flights to generate optimal planned ascents, drift, and descent. For example, the ground control software can store data relating to past and/or present flights to increase the predictability of future and/or current planned ascents, drifts, descents, and/or launches. This data can be plotted using any suitable technique. For example, the data can be plotted on any suitable existing map, geo-referenced map (e.g., geo-referenced electronic map), image set, and/or any other suitable form of reference. Example forms of data considered suitable to compile, store, and/or use to plot on an existing map, geo-referenced map (e.g., geo-referenced electronic map), and/or on an image set include, but are not limited to, data associated with wind speeds at one or more intervals of time (e.g., seconds, minutes, hours, days), temperatures, atmospheric pressures, data described herein, and any other data considered suitable for a particular application. In addition, the ground control software is configured to provide an optimal landing site of the system. For example, if it is determined that the expected landing site of the system is inconvenient (e.g., a roof top, within a lake), the ground control software can calculate an alternative landing site and output data relating to the volume of fluid required in the chambers, the launch site, among others, as described herein. Alternatively, if it is determined that the expected landing site of the system is inconvenient, the user can select a nearby site and the ground control software can calculate the necessary data to be used for launch, ascent, and descent of the system. The ground control software can provide one or more secondary landing sites in all directions around the coordinates of the primary landing site. Calculating secondary landing sites is considered advantageous to allow a user to select the secondary landing site should the system be forced off an originally planned drift path.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The ground control software can include password protection capabilities, for example, which require a user to provide a user ID and/or password to interact with the software. A user can input a starting point and/or ending point for a particular flight using geographical coordinates, and/or by clicking on a point on an electronic map. The ground control software is configured to accept the starting and ending coordinates of the flight, unless a restriction is associated with the starting and/or ending coordinates (e.g., no public access, undesirable location due to geographical conditions). If a restriction is associated with a coordinate, the ground control software can return a message to a user indicated such (e.g., &#x201c;Trespassing&#x201d; point is legally inaccessible, &#x201c;No Pass&#x201d;&#x2014;point is physically undesirable because of geographical conditions: wet, dry, low, high). A user can override the rejection of a coordinate and require the ground control software to use the points initially entered rather than alternatively generated coordinates. Alternatively, the user can select alternative coordinates.</p>

<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The computer system <b>502</b> also includes a communication interface <b>520</b> coupled to bus <b>504</b>. Communication interface <b>520</b> provides a two-way data communication coupling to a network link <b>522</b> that may be connected to, for example, a local network <b>524</b>.

<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The step <b>456</b> of obtaining data from the ground control software program can be accomplished by a user reviewing data displayed on a monitor (e.g., GUI) and/or on a printout. The data obtained from the ground control software program comprises data relating to the planned ascent, drift, and/or descent of the system, the volume of fluid required in each chamber (e.g., <b>120</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>1144</b>, <b>1154</b>, <b>1164</b>), the location of the launch site, the number of plugs to remove from the spill chamber, the timing of the launch, the timing of the release of fluid from the cruise chamber and/or spill chamber, the length of flight, and/or the location of the landing site of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Once the launch site has been determined, the step <b>458</b> of proceeding to the launch site can be accomplished by relocating to the launch site provided by the ground control software program. It is to be noted, however, that the launch site can be calculated by the ground control software program, and/or on-board software program, or be designated by a user. In the example where the ground control software program determines the launch site, the user may have to relocate from a current location to an alternate located to launch the system according to the data computed by the ground control software program. In the example where the user inputs the desired launch site, the ground control software program can determine data relating to the planned ascent, drift, and descent of the system, the volume of fluid required in each chamber (e.g., <b>120</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>1144</b>, <b>1154</b>, <b>1164</b>), the number of plugs to remove from the spill chamber, the timing of the launch, the timing of the release of fluid from the cruise chamber and/or spill chamber, length of the flight, and/or the location of the landing site of the system based on the input of the launch site by the user. Optionally, if the user(s) is currently located at the launch site, the step <b>458</b> of proceeding to the launch site can be omitted from the methodology <b>450</b> and the user can maintain his/her current location.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">It is considered advantageous to determine the volume of fluid required for the planned ascent, drift, and descent prior to traveling to the launch site to confirm that the proper volume of fluid is on hand for the flight. Alternatively, a stock of fluid can be stored and utilized at a launch site that has been designated by the user. For example, predetermined volumes of fluid can be provided in premeasured canisters, as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The step <b>460</b> of placing the system on a scale can be accomplished by providing a scale and attaching the system to the scale. The scale is configured to measure the weight of the system prior to, during, and subsequent to a volume of fluid being introduced into one or more of the chambers (e.g., <b>120</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>1144</b>, <b>1154</b>, <b>1164</b>). The scale can comprise any form of measuring device, such as a digital scale, balance scale, lift-hook scale, tension meter, and/or spring scale. For example, when a balloon is attached to a device, such as a tension meter, via a tether, the tension on the tether can be used to determine the buoyancy of the balloon, and/or the amount of weight offset by the fluid within the chamber defined by the balloon.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Alternative to placing the system on a scale, or in combination with this step, an optional step comprises attaching the system, and/or each of the one or more chambers, to a gauge. This optional step can be accomplished by attaching a gauge to a bi-directional valve, one-way valve, a hose, tank, or at any position along a length of material used to introduce fluid into the one or more chambers.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The step <b>462</b> of introducing a measured volume of fluid into the chambers can be accomplished by attaching a first end of a hose to a container containing fluid (e.g., portable canister), and the second end to a valve disposed in the wall of one or more of the chambers. Each of the chambers can then be moved from the deflated configuration to the inflated configuration. By having the system attached to a scale, when the chambers are filled with fluid, the buoyancy of the system can be determined. For example, after placing the system on the scale and obtaining the data from the ground control software program relating to the volume of fluid to be introduced into each of the chambers, the chambers can be moved from their deflated configurations to their inflated configurations. The scale can be utilized to determine if the combined volume of fluid introduced into the reserve chamber (e.g., <b>120</b>, <b>1154</b>) and cruise chamber (e.g., <b>140</b>, <b>1144</b>) is sufficient to offset about 100% of the weight of the system to provide neutral buoyancy of the system. For example, the reserve chamber can be filled with a volume of fluid sufficient to offset about 50% to 80% of the weight of the system. The volume of fluid can be measured as it is introduced into the reserve chamber by a gauge and/or the total weight of the system can be examined on the scale. To determine if the volume of fluid has offset about 50% to 80% of the weight of the system, the user reviews the gauge and/or scale. It is considered advantageous to introduce the fluid into the one or more chambers in an enclosed area, or some other location outside of natural weather conditions (e.g., wind), to at least reduce the likelihood of the natural weather conditions manipulating the scale reading.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">After filling the reserve chamber with a volume of fluid, the user can then introduce a volume of fluid into the cruise chamber. The volume of fluid can be measured as it is introduced into the cruise chamber by a gauge and/or the total weight of the system can be examined on the scale. To determine if the volume of fluid has offset the remainder of the weight of the system to provide about 100% neutral buoyancy, the user reviews the gauge and/or scale.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">After filling the cruise chamber, the user can then introduce fluid into the spill chamber. When the spill chamber comprises one or more apertures and plugs, in a first configuration the plugs are all disposed within a corresponding aperture of wall of the spill chamber. This allows for the spill chamber to be moved from a deflated configuration to an inflated configuration by the introduction of fluid into the spill chamber. The volume of fluid can be measured as it is introduced into the spill chamber by a gauge and/or the total weight of the system can be examined on the scale. To determine if the volume of fluid introduced into the spill chamber is equal to the volume of fluid to provide planned ascent and/or drift of the system the user reviews the gauge and/or scale as the volume of fluid is introduced into the spill chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">While the chambers have been described as inflated in a particular order, the chambers can be filled in any order. For example, the chambers can be filled in combination with one another, or separately from one another. Furthermore, while particular volumes of fluid have been described with respect to each chamber, various other volumes of fluid are considered suitable, and skilled artisans will be able to select an appropriate volume of fluid based on various considerations, such as the desired cruising altitude of the system, among others.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Alternative to introducing a volume of fluid into the one or more chambers at the launch site using a scale and/or gauge, the volume of fluid to be introduced into each of the one or more balloons defining the one or more chambers can be predetermined and compressed into one or more canisters. The one or more canisters can be configured to releasably attach to an opening defined by the wall of the one or more balloons, one or more bi-directional valves, and/or one-way valves disposed within the wall of the one or more balloons, to introduce a volume of fluid into the one or more chambers.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">For example, the weight of the overall system can be a known characteristic (e.g., 2.15 lbs.). Therefore, the volume of fluid required for each of the one or more balloons defining the one or more chambers can be determined for a particular flight, altitude, ascent, planned drift, and/or descent. For example, to provide neutral buoyancy to a system having an overall weight of about 2.15 lbs., 10 total balloons, each having a full pressure containing a volume of fluid (e.g., helium) of about 7,513 cubic inches, 6 balloons defining the reserve chamber, 2 balloons defining the cruise chamber, and 2 balloons defining the spill chamber can be used to accomplish one or more steps described herein. In this example, about 985 liters, or 60,012 cubic inches, of fluid (e.g., helium) is required to provide neutral buoyancy to the system, and each of the one or more balloons can contain about 123.1 liters of fluid (e.g., helium). Each of the one or more canisters can contain a predetermined measured volume (e.g., 123.1 liters) of fluid for each of the chambers and/or balloons and can be used to introduce the measured amount of fluid into the one or more balloons. Thus, a user is able to introduce a measured volume of fluid into each of the one or more balloons defining the one or more chambers at the launch site, without having to measure the fluid at the launch site. While a particular example has been provided, other weights, volumes, capacities, and/or fluids are considered suitable for providing neutral buoyancy to a lighter-than-air system, and skilled artisans will be able to select a particular weight, volume, capacity, and/or fluid based on various factors, such as the overall weight of the system. For example, if the overall weight of the system is known, the neutral buoyancy of the system can be determined, and the volume of fluid required in the cruise chamber and/or reserve chamber can be determined, and the cruising altitude can be determined by the volume of fluid contained within the spill chamber and the rate at which it is released during ascent.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">An optional step comprises stretching each balloon prior to introducing a fluid (e.g., lighter-than-air fluid) into the chamber defined by the balloon. This can be accomplished by inflating each balloon to about 75% of its total capacity. Alternatively, each balloon can be inflated between about 25% and about 90% of its total capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Another optional step comprises reviewing the outer surface of each balloon for defects that may cause the balloon to rupture and deflate during flight.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Another optional step comprises deflating each balloon.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The step <b>464</b> of removing one or more of the plugs from the wall of the spill chamber can be accomplished by removing the number of plugs designated by the ground control software program, and/or on-board software program. For example, the ground control software program will calculate, and provide to a user, the number and/or diameter of the one or more plug(s) to be removed from the wall of the spill chamber, based on factors including, but not limited to, the plug(s) diameter and rate at which the volume of fluid contained within the spill chamber will be spilled into the atmosphere. The ground control software program calculates the number of plugs to remove from the wall of the spill chamber based on factors including, but not limited to, the desired cruising altitude of the system as input by the user, or determined by the ground control software and/or on-board software, and the time of ascent. Optionally, this step can be omitted if the one or more apertures and one or more plugs are omitted from the wall of the spill chamber, and a one-way valve, two-way valve, and/or thruster can be used to release a volume of fluid from the spill chamber and/or cruise chamber, for example, by a remote signal, as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The step <b>466</b> of launching the system can be accomplished by removing the system from the scale and releasing the system at the time designated by the ground control software program, on-board software, and/or user. This step can be accomplished in combination with the step <b>464</b> of removing one or more of the plugs from the wall of the spill chamber. Alternatively, this step can be accomplished by removing the one or more canisters from the one or more balloons and releasing the system at the time designated by the ground control software, on-board software, and/or user.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The step <b>468</b> of tracking the system can be accomplished by viewing data supplied by the ground control software program, and/or on-board software, on a display (e.g., GUI), a GPS unit, and/or by direct visualization. When the system is tracked by the ground control software program, and/or on-board software, the planned drift of the system is confirmed and recalculated as necessary. For example, the system can be aerodynamically shaped to capture wind to generate thrust and cause the system to travel in a planned direction. Alternatively, when more than one lighter-than-air system has been launched, the step of tracking the system can comprise tracking the one or more systems, and can be accomplished as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The step <b>470</b> of adjusting the flight path can be accomplished by the ground control software program, on-board software, and/or a user calculating alternative planned drifts based on variables that may be introduced during the flight of the system. For example, if unexpected winds, or other forces begin to interact with the system, the ground control software program, on-board software, and/or user will become aware of these variables via one or more devices housed within the instrument case <b>200</b> (e.g., communication devices <b>260</b>, sensing devices <b>230</b>) and an alternate landing site and/or flight path can be calculated, for example, by using the trajectory of the horizontal force and/or vertical force being applied to the system. After computing any necessary adjustments to continue to provide a planned-drift, the ground control software program, on-board software, and/or a user can communicate with the system to either release a portion of fluid contained within a chamber (e.g., spill chamber, cruise chamber, reserve chamber, first balloon chamber, second balloon chamber, container chamber) and/or initiate use of the one or more thrusters.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The step <b>472</b> of initiating the descent of the system is accomplished by the ground control software program, on-board software, and/or a user communicating a signal to the system to open one or more of the one-way valves, and/or bi-directional valves disposed in the wall of the cruise chamber and/or reserve chamber. The volume of fluid contained in the reserve chamber <b>120</b>, which offsets about 50% to 90% of the weight of the system, allows for a reduced speed descent of the system, for example, when the volume of fluid contained within the cruise chamber has been released into the atmosphere. The ground control software program, on-board software, and/or user can then track the descent of the system by reviewing data communicated by one or more devices housed within the instrument case, and/or by direct visualization of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">It is considered advantageous to initiate descent when the projected landing site is within tolerable limits as determined by a user, ground control software, and/or on-board software. The projected landing site can be calculated using any suitable method and skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable method based on various considerations, such as the structural configuration of the system. For example, a projected landing site can be based on a parabolic trajectory using the systems current location, the vector of current external forces (e.g., calculated from history), and the descent rate (e.g., based on deflation volume and time).</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Optionally, if the system (e.g., one or more of the devices housed within instrument case <b>200</b>, on-board software) does not receive a signal from a user and/or ground control software for an interval of time, the system can be configured to initiate descent independent of receiving a signal from a user and/or ground control software. If descent is initiated independent of receiving a signal from a user and/or ground control software, the coordinates of the system at any point of time during the ascent, flight, and/or descent (e.g., beginning of descent, during descent, at landing point) can be transmitted to the user, ground control software, and/or on-board software. This is considered advantageous at least because it provides a mechanism for retrieving the system should a communications failure occur. The interval of time can be based on an input supplied by a user and/or be predefined by ground control software or on-board software. Any suitable interval of time is considered suitable and skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable interval of time according to a particular embodiment based on various considerations, including the desired flight time of the system. Example intervals of time considered suitable include, but are not limited to, one second, one minute, between about one minute and about one hour, one hour, more than one hour, and any other interval of time considered suitable for a particular application.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Optionally, if the projected landing site of the system is not within tolerable limits, then a user, ground control software, and/or on-board software can select an alternative landing site. A radius containing potential new landing sites can be determined based on the potential thrust available to the system (e.g., by releasing fluid through a thruster (e.g., by perforating a membrane)) and the vectors of external forces on the system. This information can be provided to a user, ground control software, and/or on-board software such that a new landing site can be selected (e.g., via graphic user interface). In addition to this information, a user, ground control software, and/or on-board software can utilize the one or more observation devices, information provided by the internet, or otherwise (e.g., maps, imagery), and/or land use records to determine a potential landing site.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Once a landing site has been determined, the trajectory of the system will be calculated with known thrust and/or vectors of external force values. This information is used by a user, ground control software, and/or on-board software to determine the order, and timing, in which to activate one or more valves and/or one or more membranes to land the system at a particular landing site.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Alternatively, when a thruster (e.g., <b>700</b>, <b>870</b>, <b>970</b>, <b>1200</b>, <b>1300</b>) is being used, the step of initiating the descent of the system can be accomplished by the ground control software program, on-board software, and/or a user communicating a signal to the system to perforate one or more of the membranes disposed over an opening defined by a thruster.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The step <b>474</b> of proceeding to the landing site of the system can be accomplished by traveling to the landing site provided by the ground control software program, on-board software, and/or user. For example, the ground control software program can provide data to a user relating to the expected landing site of the system, which can be plotted on existing electronic maps and/or land images. Alternatively, if the user is already located at the landing site, this step can be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The step <b>478</b> of retrieving the system can be accomplished by locating the system and gaining possession of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The data obtained prior to, during, and/or subsequent to the flight of the system can be compiled to create a data store of information that can be utilized by various industries (e.g., wind turbine industry), and/or for future flights of one or more systems. The compiled data can be provided via any suitable medium (e.g., Internet web site, magazine, book, server) to anyone seeking the information.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">An optional step comprises activating sleep mode which can be accomplished by a user and/or ground control software sending a signal, which can be user activated, a timed event, surveillance match (e.g., digital, analog) to a point of interest, and/or other event, to one or more of the devices within the instrument case to either lower power consumption, or turn off one or more of the devices entirely. A further optional step comprises activating hover mode which can be accomplished by a user and/or ground control software sending a signal, which can be user activated, a timed event, surveillance match (e.g., digital, analog) to a point of interest, and/or other event, to one or more of the devices within the instrument case to close all valves currently opened and terminate all signals to any thrust devices that are providing thrust to the system, thereby allowing the system to drift. It is considered advantageous to allow for sleep mode and/or hover mode to allow for the system to cover broad areas for long periods of time.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">While various steps, alternative steps, and optional steps have been described above with respect to obtaining aerial images, these steps, alternative steps, and optional steps can be included in, accomplished concurrently with, and/or accomplished in the alternative to, the methodologies, steps, alternative steps, and/or optional steps described above, and/or below with respect to method <b>600</b> and/or method <b>2300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a second exemplary method <b>600</b> of obtaining aerial images using a lighter-than-air system (e.g., system <b>100</b>, system <b>800</b>, system <b>900</b>, system <b>1100</b>, system <b>1400</b>, system <b>2100</b>, system <b>2200</b>). The method <b>600</b> is similar to that described above with respect to method <b>450</b>, except as described below. An initial step <b>602</b> comprises determining one or more images to obtain. Another step <b>604</b> comprises inputting data into ground control software program. Another step <b>606</b> comprises obtaining data from the ground control software program. Another step <b>608</b> comprises proceeding to a launch site. Another step <b>610</b> comprises placing the system on a scale. Another step <b>612</b> comprises introducing a measured volume of fluid into the chambers. Another step <b>614</b> comprises removing one or more plugs from the wall of the spill chamber. Another step <b>616</b> comprises launching the system. Another step <b>618</b> comprises tracking the system. Another step <b>620</b> comprises sending low-resolution images. Another step <b>622</b> comprises storing high-resolution images. Another step <b>624</b> comprises adjusting the flight path. Another step <b>626</b> comprises initiating the descent of the system. Another step <b>628</b> comprises proceeding to the landing site of the system. Another step <b>630</b> comprises retrieving the system.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">The step <b>620</b> of sending low-resolution images is accomplished by the one or more observation devices <b>220</b> obtaining low-resolution images of one or more points of interest and communicating those one or more images to the ground control software, a user, and/or one or more storage devices <b>270</b>. It is considered advantageous to provide real-time low-resolution images to the ground control software and/or a user to reduce the energy and/or time required to communicate these images.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In addition, because the cruising altitude of the system can be adjusted by the ground control software program, on-board software, and/or a user, low altitude and low revealing angles of georeferenced oblique images can be obtained which provide greater detail of the points of interest being imaged. By providing closer proximity to points of interest, the georeferencing of images and other data are less prone to geometric errors.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">The step <b>622</b> of storing high-resolution images is accomplished by the one or more observation devices <b>220</b> obtaining high-resolution images of one or more points of interest and communicating those one or more images to the one or more storage devices <b>270</b>. It is considered advantageous to store high-resolution images to the one or more storage devices <b>270</b> to reduce the energy required to communicate these images to the ground control software program, and/or a user.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Alternatively, a user can manipulate which images (e.g., low-resolution, high-resolution) are stored in the one or more storage devices <b>270</b> and/or communicated to the user and/or ground control software. For example, the ground control software program can be configured to allow a user to select which images to view, high-resolution images or low-resolution images. Optionally, one or more images can be viewed in real time. The type of image not being viewed can be stored in the storage devices <b>270</b>. Alternatively, both types of images can be stored in the storage device <b>270</b>, and/or communicated to the ground control software program, storage contained within computer having ground control software thereon, and/or user, regardless of whether or not the images are being viewed in real-time.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">An optional step comprises obtaining one or more images once a user, ground control software, and/or on-board software determines that a point of interest has been reached, or the system is near a point of interest. For example, once the system approaches, or arrives, within a range of a defined x, y, and/or z coordinate of a desired point of interest, the system can initiate obtaining one or more images.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">An optional step comprises launching one or more systems in combination with an initially launched system, or launching one or more systems separately and subsequent to an initially launched system, to gather aerial images at multiple locations, or of the same location. This optional step can be included not only in methodology <b>600</b>, but also in methodology <b>450</b> and/or methodology <b>2300</b>, and any other variation of these methodologies. For example, the ground control software program, on-board software, and/or user can determine a number of systems to launch to obtain the desired images of one or more points of interest. The ground control software program, and/or on-board software, can be configured to network the information between the one or more systems prior to, during, or subsequent to launch, ascent, drift, descent, and/or landing.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">For example, the ground control software program can be configured to provide data relating to strategic sequencing of launches for more than one system to accomplish coverage over one or more particular locations and/or points of interest. A first &#x201c;scout&#x201d; system at an upwind perimeter of the coverage area can be launched and communicate data, as described herein (e.g., low-resolution images, location data), which can be used by the ground control software program, on-board software, and/or a user to determine the traveled course of the system and its speed over the ground. This data can then be used to determine the launch location of one or more subsequent systems, which in turn provide data for further subsequently launched systems. All data points can be combined to provide optimal launch sites and planned ascent, drift, and/or descent for one or more additional systems (e.g., fleet of systems). Each of the systems can be delivered to its launch site by all terrain ground vehicles, or other vehicles, equipped with GPS, so that the time between the ground vehicle is dispatched and the system is launched is minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">The systems and methods described herein advantageously provide for obtaining aerial images at lower altitudes with greater detail and viewing angles. The data obtained during the flight of the system by the one or more devices housed within the instrument case can provide coordinates for points within an image, which can be corrected by software, if necessary, that compares the location of the system when the image was obtained and dimension data associated with the image of a known monument placed at the known launch site, or otherwise, to the actual location and dimensional data. For example, image data (e.g., triaxial lens inclination, declination, angular measurements) can be readjusted in postproduction according to images obtained of a monument of known dimension placed at the launch site, or other location. This information can be used with other data provided by the devices within the instrument case (e.g., sensing devices <b>230</b>) to calculate look angles and focal axes of the lenses when the images were obtained. The system can provide an initial image of a monument at the launch site, or other location, to the ground control software program, on-board software, and/or a user that can used to recalibrate georeferencing algorithms. Depending on the accuracy requirements required for a project, the image data can be combined with other data from preexisting coordinate monuments on the ground. This results in obtaining data for positional calculations currently in use to deduce the geo-reference or ground coordinates of image portions or pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">For example, the set angle and focal length of the lenses is combined with the inclinometric readings derived from triaxial angle sensors within the instrument case and are transmitted to the ground control software program, on-board software, and/or a user. This information can then be utilized to quilt pixels into georeferenced image arrays, which can be supplied to users via the Internet or otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">An optional step comprises transmitting the information (e.g., data, images) obtained by the system (e.g., one or more devices housed within instrument case) to the Internet or other device. For example, a server, client, and/or web site can be configured to receive data from a user, ground control software, on-board software, and/or one or more communication devices, relating to past, present, and future system flights and publish this data on a web page. In addition, the server, client, and/or website can be configured to receive and publish a real-time stream to allow Internet users to view the information (e.g., images, data) being captured during flight by receiving data received by a user, ground control software, on-board software, and/or one or more communication devices.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">While various steps, alternative steps, and optional steps have been described above with respect to obtaining aerial images, these steps, alternative steps, and optional steps can be included in, accomplished concurrently with, and/or accomplished in the alternative to, the methodologies, steps, alternative steps, and/or optional steps described above with respect to method <b>450</b> and/or below with respect to method <b>2300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Optionally, any of the systems (e.g., system <b>100</b>, system <b>800</b>, system <b>900</b>, system <b>1100</b>, system <b>1400</b>, system <b>2100</b>, system <b>2200</b>) described herein can comprise one or more thrusters (e.g., CO<sub>2 </sub>cartridges, pressurized cartridges). The one or more thrusters can be attached to any portion of the systems described herein to provide maneuverability and/or stabilization of the system. For example, with respect to the system <b>100</b>, one or more thrusters can be attached to the balloon <b>105</b>, instrument case <b>200</b>, and/or any portion of the system <b>100</b>. In another example, with respect to system <b>800</b>, system <b>900</b>, and/or system <b>1100</b>, one or more thrusters can be disposed on any portion of the system (e.g., first balloon, second balloon, third balloon, thruster, instrument case). The thrusters can be adapted to provide thrust in a single direction and/or in multiple directions.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a structural arrangement of an exemplary thruster <b>700</b> that can be utilized by any of the systems described herein to provide thrust.

<p id="p-0154" num="0153">The first end <b>720</b> of the fifth tubular member <b>705</b> is adapted to be attached to within an opening <b>722</b> defined by a wall of a balloon <b>723</b> such that passageway <b>719</b> is in fluid communication with the chamber of the balloon <b>723</b>. It is considered advantageous to configure the first tubular member <b>701</b> at a right angle to the second tubular member <b>702</b> and the fourth tubular member <b>704</b> in a first plane, the second tubular member <b>702</b> at a right angle to the third tubular member <b>703</b> in the first plane, and the fourth tubular member <b>704</b> at a right angle to the third tubular member <b>703</b> and the first tubular member <b>701</b> in the first plane. In addition, it is considered advantageous to configure the fifth tubular member <b>705</b> at an angle substantially perpendicular, or perpendicular, to the first plane containing the first tubular member <b>701</b>, second tubular member <b>702</b>, third tubular member <b>703</b>, and the fourth tubular member <b>704</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Each of the second ends <b>709</b>, <b>712</b>, <b>715</b>, <b>718</b>, and <b>721</b> are attached to one another to allow for each of the passageways <b>707</b>, <b>710</b>, <b>713</b>, <b>716</b>, and <b>719</b> to be in fluid communication with one another. Each of the first tubular member <b>701</b>, second tubular member <b>702</b>, third tubular member <b>703</b>, and fourth tubular member <b>704</b> comprise a membrane <b>706</b> disposed on each first end <b>708</b>, <b>711</b>, <b>714</b>, <b>717</b>. A membrane <b>706</b> can be stretched around the outer perimeter of the tubular member and attached to each first end <b>708</b>, <b>711</b>, <b>714</b>, <b>717</b> using an adhesive, O-ring, weld, or a threaded cap that mates with a threaded first end. The membrane <b>706</b> can be formed of any suitable material (e.g., polyester films (e.g., biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate (Mylar&#xae;), latex) that allows for sealing the tubular member and which can be perforated to release fluid under pressure. A perforator housed within one or more of the first tubular member <b>701</b>, second tubular member <b>702</b>, third tubular member <b>703</b>, fourth tubular member <b>704</b>, and/or fifth tubular member <b>705</b>, or on the exterior of the thruster <b>700</b>, and in communication with one or more devices within the instrument case, provides a means for perforating membrane <b>706</b> and releasing pressurized fluid. The perforator can comprise any suitable means of performing perforation of the membrane, such as a mechanical device (e.g., a servo having a needle, and/or hot wire, disposed on a portion thereof), a thermal device (e.g., heated coil, heated conductor), an optical device (e.g., laser), and/or a shape memory actuator (e.g., muscle wire) which moves from a first curved configuration to a second straight configuration upon receipt of a signal to cause penetration of the membrane. Thus, upon receipt of a signal from one or more devices within the instrument case, a user, on-board software, and/or ground control software, the perforator can be activated to perforate one or more of the membranes <b>706</b> disposed on the first end of each of the first tubular member <b>701</b>, second tubular member <b>702</b>, third tubular member <b>703</b>, and/or fourth tubular member <b>704</b> to provide thrust and/or descent.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The tubular members can comprise any suitable length, diameter, and cross-section. Cross-sections considered suitable include, but are not limited to, triangular, square, hexagonal, and any other suitable geometric shape. Examples of suitable diameters and/or lengths for the tubular members include, but are not limited to, a fifth tubular member having a 2&#x2033; outer diameter and each of the first tubular member, second tubular member, third tubular member, and fourth tubular member having a 1.0-inch (2.54 cm) outer diameter and a length of 1.0-inch (2.54 cm) from the first end to the second end. While a particular structural arrangement for a tubular member has been described, other structural arrangements (e.g., length, diameters) are considered suitable, and skilled artisans will be able to select a particular structural arrangement based on various considerations, such as the desired thrust of the system. For example, a first tubular member and a third tubular member can be stacked on a second tubular member and a fourth tubular member and lay in a plane parallel to a plane containing the second tubular member and fourth tubular member.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In use, when the balloon <b>723</b> is under pressure, descent of the system and/or thrust can be achieved in a variety of ways using thruster <b>700</b>, depending on the number of membranes <b>706</b> that are opened. For example, each membrane <b>706</b> attached to the first tubular member <b>701</b>, second tubular member <b>702</b>, third tubular member <b>703</b>, and fourth tubular member <b>704</b> can be opened independent of one another to provide thrust in a single direction. Alternatively, multiple membranes <b>706</b> can be opened simultaneously to provide thrust in a variety of different directions. For example, the membrane <b>706</b> disposed on the first end <b>708</b> of the first tubular member <b>701</b> can be opened simultaneously with the membrane <b>706</b> disposed on the first end <b>711</b> of the second tubular member <b>702</b>, the membrane <b>706</b> disposed on the first end <b>708</b> of the first tubular member <b>701</b> can be opened simultaneously with the membrane <b>706</b> disposed on the first end <b>717</b> of the fourth tubular member <b>704</b>, the membrane <b>706</b> disposed on the first end <b>714</b> of the third tubular member <b>703</b> can be opened simultaneously with the membrane <b>706</b> disposed on the first end <b>711</b> of the second tubular member <b>702</b>, and/or the membrane <b>706</b> disposed on the first end <b>714</b> of the third tubular member <b>703</b> can be opened simultaneously with the membrane <b>706</b> disposed on the first end <b>717</b> of the fourth tubular member <b>704</b>. While various examples of opening the membranes <b>706</b> have been described, other variations are considered suitable, and skilled artisans will be able to select a particular variation based on various considerations, such as the desired directionality of the system. Alternatively, the first end <b>720</b> of the fifth tubular member <b>705</b> can be attached to a pressurized container (e.g., CO<sub>2 </sub>cartridge) to provide thrust.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Alternative to providing membranes <b>706</b>, any suitable valve described herein that can be activated by a signal from one or more devices within the instrument case, a user, on-board software, and/or ground control software, to allow for fluid to pass through the valve can be disposed on a tubular member.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">It is considered advantageous to include an internal measurement unit (IMU) in the instrument case, and in communication with one or more of the devices housed within the instrument case, when one or more thrusters (e.g., thruster <b>700</b>) are being utilized. The IMU can comprise any suitable device configured to provide one or more data points (e.g., orientation of system, orientation of tubular members of thruster, orientation of thruster) to a user, ground control software, on-board software, and/or one or more lighter-than-air units. The information provided by the IMU can be utilized by a user, ground control software, and/or on-board software to determine the lighter-than-air systems current orientation and use this information to determine what number of thrusters are required to be opened, and/or what order to open the thruster valves, to provide a planned descent.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Examples of suitable IMUs include, but are not limited to, IMUs that comprise a triple-axis accelerometer, triple-axis gyroscope, and/or a triple-axis magnetometer. While a particular IMU has been described, other IMUs are considered suitable, and skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable IMU for a particular embodiment based on various considerations, such as the type of thruster being utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Optionally, a spring-loaded lid can be disposed within passageway <b>719</b>, which has a first closed configuration and a second open configuration. The lid can be adapted to move from the first configuration to the second configuration when at least one membrane <b>706</b> is perforated. In addition, the lid can be adapted to move from the second configuration to the first configuration when a desired amount of fluid (e.g., 25%) remains in the chamber of balloon <b>723</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates another lighter-than-air system <b>800</b> that is similar to lighter-than-air system <b>100</b>, except as described herein. Therefore, all of the various elements, components, devices, structural arrangements, and/or configurations described above with respect to the system <b>100</b> are applicable to system <b>800</b>, unless the context indicates otherwise. The system <b>800</b> comprises an airship <b>802</b>, thruster <b>870</b> (e.g., thruster <b>700</b>), and an instrument case <b>890</b>. The airship <b>802</b> comprises one or more fins <b>803</b>, a first balloon <b>840</b>, a second balloon <b>850</b>, and a third balloon <b>860</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">The first balloon <b>840</b> has a wall that defines a cruise chamber, as described herein. The second balloon <b>850</b> has a wall that defines a reserve chamber, as described herein. The third balloon <b>860</b> has a wall that defines a spill chamber, as described herein. The second end <b>871</b> of the fifth tubular member <b>872</b> of the thruster <b>870</b> is attached within an opening defined by the first balloon <b>840</b>. The instrument case <b>890</b> is attached to a portion of the exterior surface of the thruster <b>870</b>, such that it is disposed below the thruster <b>870</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">The second balloon <b>850</b> comprises a structural arrangement (e.g., circular) that defines an opening <b>851</b> through which the first balloon <b>840</b> is disposed. A friction fit between the first balloon <b>840</b> and the second balloon <b>850</b> can be accomplished by inserting the first balloon <b>840</b> into the opening <b>851</b> of the second balloon and inflating the first balloon <b>840</b> and the second balloon <b>850</b>. During ascent, drift, and/or descent, as the fluid within the first balloon <b>840</b> is expelled through thruster <b>870</b>, or otherwise, the overall size of the first balloon <b>840</b> will decrease, thereby decreasing the friction fit between the first balloon <b>840</b> and the second balloon <b>850</b> and eventually releasing the second balloon <b>850</b> from the first balloon <b>840</b>. This advantageously softens the landing of the system <b>800</b> by allowing the first balloon <b>840</b> to provide the landing platform. In addition, this creates a larger target in the event that the third balloon <b>860</b> needs to be utilized to capture and/or retrieve the system <b>800</b>. For example, when the first balloon <b>840</b> moves to a deflated, or substantially deflated, configuration, the second balloon <b>850</b> having the first end <b>852</b> of tether <b>854</b> attached to the base of the instrument case <b>890</b> and the second end <b>853</b> of tether <b>854</b> attached to the second balloon <b>850</b>, provides lift to the first balloon <b>840</b>, thruster <b>870</b>, and instrument case <b>890</b>. When deflation of the first balloon <b>840</b> occurs, the first balloon <b>840</b> becomes detached from the second balloon <b>850</b> and the first balloon <b>840</b>, thruster <b>870</b>, and instrument case <b>890</b> invert and allow the first balloon <b>840</b> to act as a landing platform.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">The third balloon <b>860</b> is attached to the first balloon <b>840</b> using a release system <b>1000</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Any suitable release system can be utilized to releasably attach the third balloon <b>860</b> to the first balloon <b>840</b> and/or second balloon <b>850</b> and needs only to provide a mechanism to allow for ascent of the system and for providing releasable attachment between the third balloon <b>860</b> and the remainder of the system <b>800</b> during flight. An example system considered suitable includes, but is not limited to, using a release system similar, or identical to, those used on parachutes for deployment. It is considered advantageous to include a third balloon <b>860</b> that can be releasably attached to the airship <b>802</b> to optionally eliminate the need for including one or more one-way and/or bi-directional valves disposed within the wall of the third balloon <b>860</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">The thruster <b>870</b> is similar to that described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, except as described below. The second end <b>871</b> of the fifth tubular member <b>872</b> is attached to the first balloon <b>840</b> such that fluid contained within the chamber of the first balloon <b>840</b> is in fluid communication with the passageways defined by the first tubular member, second tubular member, third tubular member, fourth tubular member, and fifth tubular member of the thruster <b>870</b>. Attachment of the second end <b>871</b> of the fifth tubular member <b>872</b> to the first balloon <b>840</b> can be accomplished in a variety of manners. Examples of methods of attaching a tubular member to a balloon include, but are not limited to, using an adhesive, a threaded component, mechanical fasteners, an O-ring, and/or welding.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">The instrument case <b>890</b> is attached to the thruster <b>870</b>. Examples of methods of attaching the instrument case <b>890</b> to the thruster <b>870</b> include, but are not limited to, using an adhesive, a threaded component, mechanical fasteners, welding, and/or molding the components as an integral unit.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Any of the balloons cruise balloon, reserve balloon, spill balloon) can optionally include one or more color-coded sections (e.g., quadrants). The material forming the balloon can comprise a specified color or a color may be added to each section using any suitable method (e.g., painting). Each section can comprise a different color (e.g., quadrant), or two colors can be provided in adjacent sections. Each section (e.g., quadrant) can be aligned with the directionality of an opening of a thruster (e.g., thruster <b>700</b>, thruster <b>870</b>, thruster <b>970</b>, thruster <b>1200</b>, thruster <b>1300</b>, thruster <b>1500</b>, thruster module <b>1800</b>) to provide a user with the ability to discern the orientation of each thruster opening. This is considered advantageous at least because it allows a user to determine which opening needs to be activated (e.g., perforating a membrane) to provide desired directionality thrust to a system.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Alternative, or in addition, to including color-coded sections (e.g., quadrants), any at the balloons (e.g., cruise balloon, reserve balloon, spill balloon) can include one or more airfoils positioned along one or more sections of the balloon. Each of the airfoils can be color-coded and be positioned on a balloon in a section that is aligned with an opening of a thruster. For example, an airfoil cart be positioned on each quadrant of a balloon such that it is aligned with the directionality of an opening of a thruster (e.g., thruster <b>700</b>, thruster <b>870</b>, thruster <b>970</b>, thruster <b>1200</b>, thruster <b>1300</b>, thruster <b>1500</b>, thruster module <b>1800</b>). The airfoil can have any suitable color coding and structural configuration. For example, each airfoil can comprise a different color (e.g., quadrant), or two colors can be used for adjacent airfoils (e.g., quadrants). For example, an airfoil can have a first end attached to the top of the balloon, or a portion near the top of the balloon, and a second end attached to the bottom of the balloon, or a portion near the bottom of the balloon. Other example structural configurations for an airfoil considered suitable include but are not limited to, airfoils that are flat, or become flat upon the deflation of a balloon, airfoils that billow, or billow upon the deflation of a balloon, or airfoils disposed at the top, middle, or bottom of a balloon.</p>

The first hoop <b>1006</b> and the second hoop <b>1008</b> are attached to the first balloon <b>840</b> by shaft <b>1010</b>. The shaft <b>1010</b> defines an aperture that extends through the thickness of the shaft <b>1010</b> that is adapted to receive a length of release pin <b>1004</b>. The third hoop <b>1012</b> is attached to the third balloon <b>860</b> and is adapted to receive the second hoop <b>1008</b>. In use, the second hoop <b>1008</b> is passed through the third hoop <b>1012</b> and the first hoop <b>1006</b> is passed through the second hoop <b>1008</b>. The release pin <b>1004</b> is inserted through the aperture of the shaft <b>1010</b> and over or around a portion, or the entirety, of the first hoop <b>1006</b>.

In another example, the third balloon <b>860</b> attached to tether <b>861</b> and retrieval device <b>862</b>, can ascend to cross tether <b>861</b> and tether <b>854</b> attached at one end to the second balloon <b>850</b> and at another end to a portion the instrument case <b>890</b>, and/or any other component of the system <b>800</b> (e.g., thruster <b>870</b>). To accomplish retrieving the system <b>800</b> the third balloon <b>860</b> can be launched upwind so that, for example, tether <b>861</b> and tether <b>854</b> can cross.

Example number of signal carriers and contacts considered suitable include but are not limited to one, two, three, four, five, six, and any other suitable number. An example alternative method considered suitable to send a signal to a perforator and activating a perforator includes, but is not limited to, omitting the inclusion of a first and second contact and including a single signal carrier that provides a signal from one or more device housed within an instrument case to a perforator. Another example method considered suitable comprises wirelessly sending a signal to a perforator and activating the perforator.</p>

For example, a remotely activated switch harness can be provided which creates circuits to each of the perforators causing each perforator to send a current through a length of conductive material upon receipt of a signal. This structural arrangement advantageously provides a mechanism for providing releasable attachment between the thruster <b>1200</b> and instrument case <b>1190</b> such that the first contact <b>1264</b> and the second contact <b>1266</b> provide communication between the plurality of perforators <b>1252</b> and one or more of the devices housed within the instrument case <b>1190</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0191" num="0190">Thruster <b>1200</b> can be formed using any suitable method and can define one or more tubular members with any suitable length, and skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable method to form thruster and suitable lengths for one or more tubular members according to a particular embodiment based on various considerations, such as the structural arrangement of an airship. Example methods considered suitable to form a thruster include, but are not limited to, forming a thruster out of a singular piece of material using any suitable production method (e.g., injection molding, rapid molding) and forming a thruster out of multiple pieces of material. Example lengths considered suitable for one or more tubular members includes, but is not limited to, a tubular member (e.g., <b>1230</b>) that has a first end (e.g., <b>1236</b>) that extends beyond the first end (e.g., <b>1220</b>) of another tubular member (e.g., <b>1205</b>). Alternatively, each of the tubular members can be formed out of one or more tubular member segments attached to one another and in fluid communication.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">In the illustrated embodiment, third balloon <b>1160</b> has a tubular member <b>1168</b> with a first end disposed within opening <b>1166</b> and a second end that has an attached valve <b>1170</b>. Valve <b>1170</b> has a first configuration in which the valve <b>1170</b> is closed and prevents, or substantially prevents, fluid flow through the valve and a second configuration in which the valve <b>1170</b> is open and allows fluid to flow through the valve <b>1170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">Attachment of the tubular members within the openings defined by each of the first balloon <b>1140</b>, second balloon <b>1150</b>, and third balloon <b>1160</b> can be accomplished using any suitable method of attachment, and skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable method of attachment based on various considerations, including the type of material that forms each of the balloons. Example methods of attachment that are considered suitable to attached a tubular member to a balloon include, but are not limited to, using an adhesive, and welding.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">While the balloons have been illustrated and described as being attached to a tubular member, each of the balloons can be attached to any suitable device, component, and/or feature using any suitable method of attachment (e.g., releasable, fixed, permanent) such that fluid communication between a balloon (e.g., chamber defined by the wall of a balloon), tubular member, and/or a valve is accomplished. Skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable device, component, and/or feature and a suitable method of attachment according to a particular embodiment based on various considerations, such as the structural arrangement of the airship and/or thruster. For example, alternative to attaching the tubular members within an opening defined by the wall of a balloon, one or more of the balloons can have a threaded tubular member disposed in an opening defined by the wall of the balloon which provides a mechanism for attaching a balloon to a tubular member, such as those described herein, having a complimentary threaded tubular member adapted to receive, or connect to, the threaded tubular member disposed in the opening defined by the balloon. Example methods of attachment considered suitable between a balloon and a tubular member, device, component, and/or feature includes, but is not limited to, any of those described herein, adhesive, a threaded component, mechanical fasteners, an O-ring, welding, and/or a friction fit. For example, a tubular member can define one or more ridges, tapered ridges, and/or protuberances that are adapted to attached a balloon to the tubular member by sliding the portion of the balloon defining the opening over the one or more ridges, tapered ridges, and/or protuberances.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">While brackets <b>1232</b> and tracks <b>1191</b> have been described as providing releasable attachment between the thruster <b>1200</b> and instrument case <b>1190</b>, any suitable method of attachment between a thruster and an instrument case is considered suitable. Skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable method of attachment between a thruster and an instrument case based on various considerations, such as the structural arrangement of the airship. An example method of attachment includes, but is not limited to, threaded components (e.g., screws formed of any suitable material (e.g., plastic, metal)).</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">In the illustrated embodiment, the lower surface of the instrument case <b>1190</b> defines a ring <b>1192</b> that advantageously provides a mechanism for attaching system <b>1100</b> to a ground retrieval device <b>1194</b> and anchor <b>1195</b> in instances were a tethered flight is desired. A length of tether <b>1193</b> is passed through ring <b>1192</b> and a first end of tether <b>1193</b> is attached to ground retrieval device <b>1194</b> and a second end of tether <b>1193</b> is attached to anchor <b>1195</b>. Ground retrieval device <b>1194</b> can be any suitable device capable of dispensing and retrieving tether <b>1193</b>. Example ground retrieval devices considered suitable include, but are not limited to, those that are adapted to measure the amount of tether paid out to airship <b>1102</b> and the angle at which the tether <b>1193</b> is disposed to determine the altitude of airship <b>1102</b>. When a length of tether <b>1193</b> is dispensed by ground retrieval device <b>1194</b> the system <b>1100</b> will ascend, if the system <b>1100</b> has positive buoyancy, at an angle from anchor <b>1195</b>. When a length of tether <b>1193</b> is retrieved by ground retrieval device <b>1194</b> the system <b>1100</b> will descend at an angle from the anchor <b>1195</b>. The altitude of the system <b>1000</b> can be altered based on the distance between the ground retrieval device <b>1194</b> and anchor <b>1195</b>. For example, if a first distance is defined between the ground retrieval device <b>1194</b> and the anchor <b>1195</b>, the system <b>1100</b> will have a first altitude. If a second distance, which is less than the first distance, is defined between the ground retrieval device <b>1194</b> and the anchor <b>1195</b>, the system <b>1100</b> will have a second altitude, which is greater than the first altitude, and vice versa. It is considered advantageous to utilize a ground retrieval device <b>1194</b> and anchor <b>1195</b> to allow the system <b>1100</b> to ascend and avoid low lying objects and to provide a beginning ground truth (e.g., initial altitude). Optionally, one or more ground retrieval devices that are in communication with a user, ground control software, and/or on-board software can be attached to a lighter-than-air system and utilized to position a lighter-than-air system over a point of interest such that one or more images can be obtained. Such positioning can be predetermined based upon the desired image intended to be obtained. The placement of each of the ground retrieval devices (e.g., on four rooftops) provides a mechanism for the lighter-than-air system to be limited to a particular area, or zone, and the air current and weather conditions provide a mechanism for providing different points of view during flight.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">Optionally, ground retrieval device <b>1194</b> can include a tension meter to calculate the buoyancy and/or forces being placed on the system. Optionally, system <b>1100</b> can include a skeg attached to the base of instrument case <b>1190</b> or airship <b>1102</b> to provide a mechanism for improving directional stability of system <b>1000</b> during flight, and to absorb and/or deflect landing forces.</p>

Thus, a mechanism for retrieving and releasing anchor <b>2018</b> is described.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">While a particular structural arrangement has been illustrated and described as providing a mechanism for retrieving and releasing an anchor, any suitable structural arrangement is considered suitable. Skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable structural arrangement to retrieve and release an anchor according to a particular embodiment based on various considerations, including the structural arrangement of an instrument case.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">Wire member <b>2016</b> can have any suitable length and be formed of any suitable material, and skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable length and material to form a wire member according to a particular embodiment based on various considerations, including the desired hovering height of a lighter-than-air system when a portion of the lighter-than-air system is in contact with a surface. Example lengths for a wire member considered suitable include, but are not limited to, lengths greater than 50 feet (15.24 meters), lengths less than 50 feet (15.24 meters), lengths between about 1 foot (0.3048) to about 50 feet (15.24 meters), lengths between about 10 feet (3.048 meters) and about 20 feet (6.096 meters), and any other length considered suitable for a particular application.

<p id="p-0249" num="0248">Anchor <b>2018</b> can have any suitable weight and structural configuration, and skilled artisans will be able to select a suitable weight and structural configuration for an anchor according to a particular embodiment based on various considerations, including the desired flight path and/or time. Example structural configurations considered suitable include, but are not limited to, geometric structural configurations, spherical structural configurations (e.g., tennis ball), rectangular structural configurations, fluke structural configurations, and any other structural configuration considered suitable for a particular application. Example weights considered suitable for an anchor include, but are not limited to, about 1 gram to about 100 grams, about 25 grams to about 80 grams, about 50 grams to about 60 grams, and any other weight considered suitable for a particular application. It is considered advantageous for anchor <b>2018</b> to be buoyant, or formed of a buoyant material.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">It is considered advantageous for the weight of wire member <b>2016</b> and/or anchor <b>2018</b> to offset, or substantially offset, the amount lift force provided by the fluid disposed within second balloon chamber <b>1454</b>. Thus, when the lighter-than-air system <b>1400</b> has a total weight and is neutrally buoyant and first servo <b>1518</b> is activated and opens cap <b>1570</b>, fluid stored within second balloon chamber <b>1454</b> is released and lighter-than-air system <b>1400</b> descends. In addition, servo <b>2004</b> can be activated to release wire member <b>2016</b> such that anchor <b>2018</b> descends from instrument case <b>1900</b>. The downward force in this example is equal to, or substantially equal to, the weight of wire member <b>2016</b> and/or anchor <b>2018</b> less the drag of the lighter-than-air system <b>1400</b>. Once anchor <b>2018</b> contacts a landing surface, its weight is subtracted from the total weight of lighter-than-air system <b>1400</b> such that neutral buoyancy of lighter-than-air system <b>1400</b> is achieved (e.g., lighter-than-air system <b>1400</b> hovers over landing surface). This is considered advantageous at least because it prevents, or substantially prevents, lighter-than-air system <b>1400</b> from contacting the landing surface and becoming damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">Optionally, anchor <b>2018</b> can be released from lighter-than-air system <b>1400</b> upon first valve <b>1510</b> being moved to its open configuration. This is considered advantageous at least because it provides a mechanism for preventing, or substantially preventing, damage to lighter-than-air system <b>1400</b> upon descent. Optionally, if descent of lighter-than-air system <b>1400</b> is activated due to the lighter-than-air system <b>1400</b> not receiving a signal from a user and/or ground control software, as described herein, first servo <b>1518</b> and servo <b>2004</b> can be activated separately, or together, such that first valve <b>1510</b> is moved to its open configuration and/or anchor <b>2018</b> descends from instrument case <b>1900</b>.</p>

For example, a servo that comprises a blade, pin, or other object can be activated to puncture the wall of one or more balloons to deflate the balloon can be attached to a portion of any balloon and be in communication with one or more of the devices within the instrument case. Upon receipt of a signal, the servo can be activated to puncture the wall of a balloon to cause deflation. Alternatively, a user can deflate the balloon using a source from the ground (e.g., air rifle).</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">In a further alternative, should retrieval of a lighter-than-air system be desired, a tether having one end attached to a balloon separate from the lighter-than-air system and another end attached to a retrieval device can be utilized to retrieve the lighter-than-air system. In this alternative, the balloon and/or tether comprise one or more magnets attached to a portion thereof and the lighter-than-air system comprises one or more magnets attached to a portion thereof. To retrieve the system the separate balloon/tether are launched at, or near, the coordinates of the lighter-than-air system desired to be retrieved, and the one or more magnets attached to a portion thereof attaches to one or more of the one or more magnets attached to a portion of the lighter-than-air system, thereby allowing for the retrieval device.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">The use of an ascent tether attached to a portion of the lighter-than-air system (e.g., retrieval connector <b>108</b>, a portion of the instrument case) by a mechanical fastener having a first closed position and a second open position can be used during ascent of the system. When a desired altitude is reached, the mechanical fastener, which is in communication with one or more devices within the instrument case, is moved from the first closed position to the second open position to release the lighter-than-air system from the tether. In a further example, the instrument case can be attached to the system using a mechanical fastener having a first closed position and a second open position. The instrument case can be attached to the airship by a length of tether. When desired, the mechanical fastener, which is in communication with one or more devices within the instrument case, is moved from the first closed position to the second open position to release the instrument case from attachment to the airship and allows for the instrument case to be suspended below the airship the length of the tether. This advantageously adds stability to the landing process and allows for an easier target to grasp and guide the landing of the system.</p>
