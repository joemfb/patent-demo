<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type I motifs) proteins are a family of metalloproteinases containing number of conserved domains, including a zinc-dependant catalytic domain, a cystein-rich domain, a disintegrin-like domain, and at least one, and in most cases multiple, thrombospondin type I repeats (for review, see Nicholson et al., BMC Evol Biol. 2005 Feb. 4; 5(1):11). These proteins, which are evolutionarily related to the ADAM and MMP families of metalloproteinases (Jones G C, Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2006 February; 7(1):25-31), are secreted enzymes that have been linked to a number of diseases and conditions including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) (Moake J L, Semin Hematol. 2004 January; 41(1):4-14), connective tissue disorders, cancers, inflammation (Nicholson et al.), and severe plasmodium falciparum malaria (Larkin et al., PLoS Pathog. 2009 March; 5(3):e1000349). Because of these associations, the ADAMTS enzymes have been recognized as potential therapeutic targets for a number of pathologies (Jones G C, Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2006 February; 7(1):25-31).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One ADAMTS family member, ADAMTS13, cleaves von Willebrand factor (vWF) between residues Tyr 1605 and Met 1606. Loss of ADAMTS13 activity has been linked to a number of conditions, such as TTP (Moake J L, Semin Hematol. 2004 January; 41(1):4-14), acute and chronic inflammation (Chauhan et al., J Exp Med. 2008 Sep. 1; 205(9):2065-74), and most recently, severe plasmodium falciparum malaria (Larkin et al., PLoS Pathog. 2009 March; 5(3):e1000349).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a disorder characterized by thrombotic microangiopathy, thrombocytopenia and microvascular thrombosis that can cause various degrees of tissue ischemia and infarction. Clinically, TTP patients are diagnosed by symptoms such as thrombocytopenia, schistocytes (fragments of erythrocytes) and elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (Moake J L. Thrombotic microangiopathies. N Engl J Med. 2002; 347:589-600; Moake J L. von Willebrand factor, ADAMTS-13, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

New concepts in von Willebrand disease. Annu Rev Med. 2005; 56:173-191).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In 1982, Moake et al. found unusually large von Willebrand factor (UL-vWF) multimers in the plasma of the patients with chronic relapsing TTP (Moake J L, Rudy C K, Troll J H, Weinstein M J, Colannino N M, Azocar J, Seder R H, Hong S L, Deykin D. Unusually large plasma factor VIII:von Willebrand factor multimers in chronic relapsing thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. N Engl J Med. 1982; 307:1432-1435). The link between UL-vWF and TTP gained support with independent findings by Furlan et al. and Tsai and Lian that most patients suffering from TTP are deficient in a plasma metalloprotease, now known to be ADAMTS13, that cleaves vWF (Furlan M, Robles R, Solenthaler M, Wassmer M, Sandoz P, Laemmle B. Deficient activity of von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease in chronic relapsing thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

Antibodies to von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease in acute thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. N Engl J Med. 1998; 339:1585-1594).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The ADAMTS13 protease is a 190 kDa glycosylated protein produced predominantly by the liver (Levy G G, Nichols W C, Lian E C, Foroud T, McClintick J N, McGee B M, Yang A Y, Siemieniak D R, Stark K R, Gruppo R, Sarode R, Shurin S B, Chandrasekaran V, Stabler S P, Sabio H, Bouhassira E E, Upshaw J D, Jr., Ginsburg D, Tsai H M.

Partial amino acid sequence of purified von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease. Blood. 2001; 98:1654-1661).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene have been shown to cause TTP (Levy G G, Nichols W C, Lian E C, Foroud T, McClintick J N, McGee B M, Yang A Y, Siemieniak D R, Stark K R, Gruppo R, Sarode R, Shurin S B, Chandrasekaran V, Stabler S P, Sabio H, Bouhassira E E, Upshaw J D, Jr., Ginsburg D, Tsai H M. Mutations in a member of the ADAMTS gene family cause thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Nature. 2001; 413:488-494). Idiopathic TTP, often caused by autoantibodies inhibiting ADAMTS-13 activity, is a more common disorder that occurs in adults and older children and can recur at regular intervals in 11-36% of patients (Tsai H M, Lian E C. Antibodies to von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease in acute thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. N Engl J Med. 1998; 339:1585-1594; Furlan M, Lammle B. Deficiency of von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease in familial and acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Baillieres Clin Haematol. 1998; 11:509-514).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Non neutralizing autoantibodies could also inhibit ADAMTS activity by inducing clearance from circulation (Scheiflinger F, Knobl P, Trattner B, Plaimauer B, Mohr G, Dockal M, Dorner F, Rieger M. Nonneutralizing IgM and IgG antibodies to von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease (ADAMTS-13) in a patient with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Blood. 2003; 102:3241-3243). Plasma ADAMTS13 activity in healthy adults ranges from 50% to 178% (Moake J L. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and the hemolytic uremic syndrome. Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2002; 126:1430-1433). In most patients with familial or acquired TTP, plasma ADAMTS13 activity is absent or less than 5% of the normal. Without treatment the mortality rate exceeds 90%, but plasma therapy has reduced mortality to about 20% (Moake J L. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and the hemolytic uremic syndrome. Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2002; 126:1430-1433).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">vWF synthesized in megakaryocytes and endothelial cells is stored in platelet&#x2014;granules and Weibel-Palade bodies, respectively, as ultra large vWF (UL-vWF) (Moake J L, Rudy C K, Troll J H, Weinstein M J, Colannino N M, Azocar J, Seder R H, Hong S L, Deykin D. Unusually large plasma factor VIII:von Willebrand factor multimers in chronic relapsing thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. N Engl J Med. 1982; 307:1432-1435; Wagner D D, Olmsted J B, Marder V J. Immunolocalization of von Willebrand protein in Weibel-Palade bodies of human endothelial cells. J Cell Biol. 1982; 95:355-360; Wagner D D, Bonfanti R. von Willebrand factor and the endothelium. Mayo Clin Proc. 1991; 66:621-627; Sporn L A, Marder V J, Wagner D D. von Willebrand factor released from Weibel-Palade bodies binds more avidly to extracellular matrix than that secreted constitutively. Blood. 1987; 69:1531-1534; Tsai H M, Nagel R L, Hatcher V B, Sussman, I I. Endothelial cell-derived high molecular weight von Willebrand factor is converted into the plasma multimer pattern by granulocyte proteases. Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1989; 158:980-985; Tsai H M, Nagel R L, Hatcher V B, Sussman, I I. Multimeric composition of endothelial cell-derived von Willebrand factor. Blood. 1989; 73:2074-2076). Once secreted from endothelial cells, these UL-vWF multimers are cleaved by ADAMTS13 in circulation into a series of smaller multimers at specific cleavage sites within the vWF molecule (Tsai H M, Nagel R L, Hatcher V B, Sussman, I I. Endothelial cell-derived high molecular weight von Willebrand factor is converted into the plasma multimer pattern by granulocyte proteases. Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1989; 158:980-985; Dent J A, Galbusera M, Ruggeri Z M. Heterogeneity of plasma von Willebrand factor multimers resulting from proteolysis of the constituent subunit. J Clin Invest. 1991; 88:774-782; Furlan M, Robles R, Affolter D, Meyer D, Baillod P, Lammle B. Triplet structure of von Willebrand factor reflects proteolytic degradation of high molecular weight multimers. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 1993; 90:7503-7507).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">ADAMTS13 cleaves at the Tyr842-Met843 bond in the central A2 domain of the mature vWF subunit and requires zinc or calcium for activity (Dent J A, Berkowitz S D, Ware J, Kasper C K, Ruggeri Z M. Identification of a cleavage site directing the immunochemical detection of molecular abnormalities in type IIA von Willebrand factor. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 1990; 87:6306-6310). vWF exists in &#x201c;ball-of-yarn&#x201d; and filamentous form as seen by electron microscopy (Slayter H, Loscalzo J, Bockenstedt P, Handin R I. Native conformation of human von Willebrand protein. Analysis by electron microscopy and quasi-elastic light scattering. J Biol. Chem. 1985; 260:8559-8563). Furthermore, atomic force microscopy confirms that vWF exits in a globular conformation under static conditions and an unfolded filamentous state after exposure to shear stress (Siedlecki C A, Lestini B J, Kottke-Marchant K K, Eppell S J, Wilson D L, Marchant R E. Shear-dependent changes in the three-dimensional structure of human von Willebrand factor. Blood. 1996; 88:2939-2950). This could occur also in vivo when one end of the vWF filament is anchored to a surface.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Thrombi of TTP patients consist of little fibrin and mainly of vWF and platelets, suggesting vWF-mediated platelet aggregation as a cause of thrombosis (Asada Y, Sumiyoshi A, Hayashi T, Suzumiya J, Kaketani K. Immunohistochemistry of vascular lesion in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, with special reference to factor VIII related antigen. Thromb Res. 1985; 38:469-479). Patients with relapsing TTP have ultra-large multimers in the plasma. The UL-vWF multimers accumulate over time because the persistence of the inhibitor (Anti-ADAMTS 13 Ab) decreases ADAMTS13 activity. The UL-vWF multimers are hyperactive and unfold as a result of shear stress causing platelet aggregation, resulting in intravascular thrombosis (Tsai H M. Von Willebrand factor, ADAMTS13, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. J Mol Med. 2002; 80:639-647; Tsai H M. Deficiency of ADAMTS-13 in thrombotic and thrombocytopenic purpura. J Thromb Haemost. 2003; 1:2038-2040; discussion 2040-2035).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is believed that the presence of hyper-reactive UL-vWF multimers in the plasma due to ADAMTS13 deficiency could be associated with an increased risk of arterial thrombosis linked to coronary heart disease.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Accordingly, there is a need in the art for pharmaceutical formulations of ADAMTS13 proteins suitable for the treatment of various diseases and conditions associated with ADAMTS13 and VWF dysfunction.

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">I. Introduction</heading>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">ADAMTS13 is a plasma metalloprotease which cleaves von Willebrand factor (VWF) mulitmers and down regulates their activity in platelet aggregation. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a severe disease associated with unusually large, hemostatically hyperactive von Willebrand factor (VWF) and severe deficiency in ADAMTS-13. A recombinant ADAMTS13 product candidate has been developed as a recombinant protein substitution therapy for the treatment of ADAMTS13 deficiency caused TTP (Plaimauer and Scheiflinger, <i>Semin Hematol. </i>2004 January; 41(1):24-33; Plaimauer B et al., <i>F. Blood. </i>2002 Nov. 15; 100(10):3626-32. Epub 2002 Jul. 12; and Bruno K et al., J Thromb Haemost. 2005 May; 3(5):1064-73, the disclosures of which are all expressly incorporated by reference herein in their entireties for all purposes.)</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The present invention is based in part on the discovery of liquid and lyophilized formulations of purified ADAMTS proteins with increased stability that meet the requirements set forth by the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH Guideline, PHARMACEUTICAL DEVELOPMENT Q8(R2), 2005).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The hemostatic activity of VWF is highly dependent on the size of the multimers. The plasma metalloprotease ADAMTS13 is the main protease identified that physiologically regulates the mulitmeric size of VWF. ADAMTS13 cleaves between Tyr 1605 and Met 1606 in the A2 domain of VWF yielding the typical cleavage fragments of 176 kDa and 140 kDa and smaller VWF multimers found in the circulation. The human ADAMTS13 gene contains 29 exons and spans approximately 37 kb on chromosome 9q34. The 4.7 kb transcript is predominantly synthesized in hepatic stellate cells, but also in vascular endothelial cells and platelets and encodes a primary translation product of 1427 amino acid residues. The precursor ADAMTS13 polypeptide consists of a signal peptide and a propeptide that C-terminally ends in a potential furin site for cleavage, followed by the sequence of the mature VWF-cleaving protease. The mature ADAMTS13 polypeptide (1353 amino acid residues) comprises the structural features characteristic of all ADAMTS family members: a reprolysin-like metalloprotease domain, a disintegrin-like domain, a central thrombospondin type 1 (TSP1) repeat, a cysteine-rich domain harboring a RGD motif possibly important for integrin interactions, and a spacer domain, thereafter followed by an unique combination of 7 consecutive TSP1 repeats (TSP1/#2-8) and two CUB domains (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The mature ADAMTS13 has a calculated molecular mass of about 145 kDa whereas purified plasma-derived ADAMTS13 has an apparent molecular mass of about 180 kDa probably due to post-translational modifications consisting with present consensus sequences for 10 potential N-glycosylation sites, and several O-glycosylation sites and one C-mannosylation site in the TSP1 repeats. The VWF-proteolytic activity of ADAMTS13 is highly dependent on divalent cations. The active site motif in the metalloprotease domain contains the highly conserved HEXXHXXGXXHD motif with three histidine residues that coordinate a catalytic Zn2+ ion and a predicted Calcium binding site proposed to be coordinated by Glu 83, Asp 173, Cys 281 and Asp 284. The functional roles of the ADAMTS13 domains have been studied mainly using in vitro assay systems, showing that the N-terminal regions from the metalloprotease to the spacer domain are crucial for VWF-cleavage. C-terminal TSP1 repeats and the CUB domains seem to be important for VWF substrate recognition and binding to potential surface receptors like CD36 on endothelial cells.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">One major output of protein formulation development is the identification of inactivation pathways and aggregation or degradation pathways of the respective protein. Complete time-dependent inactivation of recombinant human ADAMTS13 protein within 1 week was observed at 40&#xb0; C. in liquid formulation by FRETS activity assay. As disclosed herein, it was found that this inactivation could be reduced in the presence of 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>. At 25&#xb0; C., FRETS activity did not decrease anymore in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. At 4&#xb0; C., liquid formulations of ADAMTS13 activity were stable for 24 weeks in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Further, it was found that in identical lyophilized formulations that only slight or no inactivation occurred when the formulation was stored at 40&#xb0; C. in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The addition of 2 mM or 4 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> did not influence stability at 40&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Accordingly, the inventors have found that time-dependent aggregation of ADAMTS13 proteins in liquid formulation (e.g., stored at 40&#xb0; C.) is a major contributor to the degradation and/or loss of enzymatic activity. Importantly, as provided by the present invention, this aggregation can be substantially reduced by lyophilization and/or by the addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to liquid formulations. Additionally, it has been found that the addition of a non-ionic surfactant (e.g., 0.05% Tween 80) reduces the formation of ADAMTS13 aggregates in lyophilized formulations. Furthermore, it was found that the presence of one or more sugars and/or sugar alcohols significantly stabilized ADAMTS13 during lyophilization and assists in the formation of an improved lyocake.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">II. Definitions</heading>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As used herein, &#x201c;ADAMTS13&#x201d; or &#x201c;A13&#x201d; refer to a metalloprotease of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type I motifs) family that cleaves von Willebrand factor (vWF) between residues Tyr 1605 and Met 1606. In the context of the present invention, an ADAMTS13 protein embraces any ADAMTS13 protein, for example, ADAMTS13 from a mammal such as a primate, human (NP<sub>&#x2014;</sub>620594), monkey, rabbit, pig, bovine (XP<sub>&#x2014;</sub>610784), rodent, mouse (NP<sub>&#x2014;</sub>001001322), rat (XP<sub>&#x2014;</sub>342396), hamster, gerbil, canine, feline, frog (NP<sub>&#x2014;</sub>001083331), chicken (XP<sub>&#x2014;</sub>415435), and biologically active derivatives thereof. Mutant and variant ADAMTS13 proteins having activity are also embraced, as are functional fragments and fusion proteins of the ADAMTS13 proteins. Furthermore, the ADAMTS13 proteins of the invention may further comprise tags that facilitate purification, detection, or both. The ADAMTS13 proteins described herein may further be modified with a therapeutic moiety or a moiety suitable imaging in vitro or in vivo.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Human ADAMTS13 proteins include, without limitation, polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of GenBank accession number NP<sub>&#x2014;</sub>620594 or a processed polypeptide thereof, for example a polypeptide in which the signal peptide (amino acids 1 to 29) and/or propeptide (amino acids 30-74) have been removed. Many natural variants of human ADAMTS13 are known in the art, and are embraced by the formulations of the present invention, some of which include mutations selected from R7W, V88M, H96D, R102C, R193W, T196I, H234Q, A250V, R268P, W390C, R398H, Q448E, Q456H, P457L, P475S, C508Y, R528G, P618A, R625H, I673F, R692C, A732V, E740K, A900V, S903L, C908Y, C951G, G982R, C1024G, A1033T, R1095W, R1095W, R1123C, C1213Y, T12261, G1239V, and R1336W. Additionally, ADAMTS13 proteins include natural and recombinant proteins that have been mutated, for example, by one or more conservative mutations at a non-essential amino acid. Preferably, amino acids essential to the enzymatic activity of ADAMTS13 will not be mutated. These include, for example, residues known or presumed to be essential for metal binding such as residues 83, 173, 224, 228, 234, 281, and 284, and residues found in the active site of the enzyme, e.g., residue 225. Similarly, in the context of the present invention, ADAMTS13 proteins include alternate isoforms, for example, isoforms lacking amino acids 275 to 305 and/or 1135 to 1190 of the full-length human protein.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As used herein, the term &#x201c;biologically active derivative&#x201d; refers to any polypeptide with substantially the same biological function as ADAMTS13. The polypeptide sequences of the biologically active derivatives may comprise deletions, additions and/or substitution of one or more amino acids whose absence, presence and/or substitution, respectively, do not have any substantial negative impact on the biological activity of polypeptide. The biological activity of said polypeptides may be measured, for example, by the reduction or delay of platelet adhesion to the endothelium, the reduction or delay of platelet aggregation, the reduction or delay of the formation of platelet strings, the reduction or delay of thrombus formation, the reduction or delay of thrombus growth, the reduction or delay of vessel occlusion, the proteolytic cleavage of vWF, the disintegration of thrombi, or by cleavage of a peptide substrate, for example a FRETS-VWF73 peptide (Kokame et al., Br J Haematol. 2005 April; 129(1):93-100) or variant thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Likewise, ADAMTS13 proteins may be further modified, for example, by post-translational modifications (e.g., glycosylation at one or more amino acids selected from human residues 142, 146, 552, 579, 614, 667, 707, 828, 1235, 1354, or any other natural or engineered modification site) or by ex vivo chemical or enzymatic modification, including without limitation, glycosylation, modification by water soluble polymer (e.g., PEGylation, sialylation, HESylation, etc.), tagging, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As used herein, &#x201c;one unit of ADAMTS13 activity&#x201d; is defined as the amount of activity in 1 ml of pooled normal human plasma, regardless of the assay being used. For example, one unit of ADAMTS13 FRETS-VWF73 activity is the amount of activity needed to cleave the same amount of FRETS-VWF73 substrate (Kokame et al., Br J Haematol. 2005 April; 129(1):93-100) as is cleaved by one ml of pooled normal human plasma.</p>

One specific example is disclosed in WO 02/42441 which is incorporated herein by reference with respect to the method of producing recombinant ADAMTS13. This may include any method known in the art for (i) the production of recombinant DNA by genetic engineering, e.g. via reverse transcription of RNA and/or amplification of DNA, (ii) introducing recombinant DNA into prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells by transfection, i.e. via electroporation or microinjection, (iii) cultivating said transformed cells, e.g. in a continuous or batchwise manner, (iv) expressing ADAMTS13, e.g. constitutively or upon induction, and (v) isolating said ADAMTS13, e.g. from the culture medium or by harvesting the transformed cells, in order to (vi) obtain substantially purified recombinant ADAMTS13, e.g. via anion exchange chromatography or affinity chromatography. The term &#x201c;biologically active derivative&#x201d; includes also chimeric molecules such as, e.g. ADAMTS13 (or a biologically active derivative thereof) in combination with Ig, in order to improve the biological/pharmacological properties such as, e.g. half life of ADAMTS13 in the circulation system of a mammal, particularly human. The Ig could have also the site of binding to an optionally mutated Fc receptor.</p>

<p id="p-0089" num="0088">An &#x201c;expression vector&#x201d; is a nucleic acid construct, generated recombinantly or synthetically, with a series of specified nucleic acid elements that permit transcription of a particular nucleic acid in a host cell. The expression vector can be part of a plasmid, virus, or nucleic acid fragment. Typically, the expression vector includes a nucleic acid to be transcribed operably linked to a promoter.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The term &#x201c;heterologous&#x201d; when used with reference to portions of a nucleic acid indicates that the nucleic acid comprises two or more subsequences that are not found in the same relationship to each other in nature. For instance, the nucleic acid is typically recombinantly produced, having two or more sequences from unrelated genes arranged to make a new functional nucleic acid, e.g., a promoter from one source and a coding region from another source. Similarly, a heterologous protein indicates that the protein comprises two or more subsequences that are not found in the same relationship to each other in nature (e.g., a fusion protein).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">A &#x201c;promoter&#x201d; is defined as an array of nucleic acid control sequences that direct transcription of a nucleic acid. As used herein, a promoter includes necessary nucleic acid sequences near the start site of transcription, such as, in the case of a polymerase II type promoter, a TATA element. A promoter also optionally includes distal enhancer or repressor elements, which can be located as much as several thousand base pairs from the start site of transcription. A &#x201c;constitutive&#x201d; promoter is a promoter that is active under most environmental and developmental conditions. An &#x201c;inducible&#x201d; promoter is a promoter that is active under environmental or developmental regulation. The term &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; refers to a functional linkage between a nucleic acid expression control sequence (such as a promoter, or array of transcription factor binding sites) and a second nucleic acid sequence, wherein the expression control sequence directs transcription of the nucleic acid corresponding to the second sequence.</p>

<p id="p-0167" num="0166">A. Host Cells and Vectors</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Recombinant ADAMTS proteins can be produced by expression in any suitable prokaryotic or eukaryotic host system. Examples of eukaryotic cells include, without limitation, mammalian cells, such as CHO, COS, HEK 293, BHK, SK-Hep, and HepG2; insect cells, for example SF9 cells, SF21 cells, S2 cells, and High Five cells; and yeast cells, for example <i>Saccharomyces </i>or <i>Schizosaccharomyces </i>cells. In one embodiment, the ADAMTS proteins can be expressed in bacterial cells, yeast cells, insect cells, avian cells, mammalian cells, and the like. For example, in a human cell line, a hamster cell line, or a murine cell line. In one particular embodiment, the cell line is a CHO, BHK, or HEK cell line. In a preferred embodiment, the cell line is a CHO cell line.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">In one embodiment, the cells may be any mammalian cell that can be cultured, preferably in a manufacturing process (i.e., at least 1 liter), to produce a desired ADAMTS protein such as ADAMTS13. Examples include the monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 (COS-7, ATCC CRL 1651); human embryonic kidney line (293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture, Graham et al., J. Gen Virol., 36:59 (1977)); baby hamster kidney cells (BHK, ATCC CCL 10); Chinese hamster ovary cells/-DHFR, such as the DUKX-B11 subclone (CHO, Uriaub and Chasin, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 77:4216 (1980)); mouse Sertoli cells (TM4, Mather, Biol. Reprod, 23:243-251 (1980)); monkey kidney cells (CV1 ATCC CCL 70); African green monkey kidney cells (VERO-76, ATCC CRL-1587); human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa, ATCC CCL 2); canine kidney cells (MDCK, ATCC CCL 34); buffalo rat liver cells (BRL 3A, ATCC CRL 1442); human lung cells (W138, ATCC CCL 75); human liver cells (Hep G2, HB 8065); mouse mammary tumor (MMT 060562, ATCC CCL51); TRI cells (Mather et al., Annals N. Y. Acad. Sci., 383:44-68 (1982)); MRC 5 cells; FS4 cells; and the human hepatoma line (Hep G2). Preferably, the cell line is a rodent cell line, especially a hamster cell line such as CHO or BHK.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">A wide variety of vectors can be used for the expression of an ADAMTS protein (e.g., ADAMTS13) and can be selected from eukaryotic and prokaryotic expression vectors. In certain embodiments, a plasmid vector is contemplated for use in expressing an ADAMTS protein (e.g., ADAMTS13). In general, plasmid vectors containing replicon and control sequences which are derived from species compatible with the host cell are used in connection with these hosts. The vector can carry a replication site, as well as marking sequences which are capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells. The plasmid will comprise a nucleotide sequence encoding an ADAMTS protein (e.g., ADAMTS13) operable linked to one or more control sequences, for example, a promoter.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">A preferred method of preparing stable CHO cell clones expressing a recombinant ADAMTS protein is as follows. A DHFR deficient CHO cell line DUKX-B11 is transfected with a DHFR expression vector to allow for expression of the relevant recombinant protein, essentially as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,250,421 (Kaufman et al., Genetics Institute, Inc.). Selection is carried out by growth in Hypoxanthine/Thymidine (HT) free media and amplification of the relevant region coding for expression of the recombinant ADAMTS protein and DHFR gene is achieved by propagation of the cells in increasing concentrations of methotrexate. Where appropriate, CHO cell lines may be adapted for growth in serum and/or protein free medium, essentially as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,100,061 (Reiter et al, Immuno Aktiengesellschaft).</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">In another preferred embodiment, stable HEK293 cells are prepared by transfecting with a construct containing a hygromycin selectable marker and selecting transformants by antibiotic resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">The ability of certain viruses to infect cells or enter cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis, and to integrate into host cell genome and express viral genes stably and efficiently have made them attractive candidates for the transfer of foreign nucleic acids into cells (e.g., mammalian cells). Accordingly, in certain embodiments, a viral vector is used to introduce a nucleotide sequence encoding an ADAMTS protein (e.g., ADAMTS13) into a host cell for expression. The viral vector will comprise a nucleotide sequence encoding an ADAMTS protein (e.g., ADAMTS13) operable linked to one or more control sequences, for example, a promoter. Alternatively, the viral vector may not contain a control sequence and will instead rely on a control sequence within the host cell to drive expression of the ADAMTS protein. Non-limiting examples of virus vectors that may be used to deliver a nucleic acid include Adenoviral vectors, AAV vectors, and Retroviral vectors.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">In one embodiment, an Adenovirus expression vector include those constructs containing adenovirus sequences sufficient to support packaging of the construct and to ultimately express an ADAMTS construct that has been cloned therein. Adenoviral vectors allow for the introduction of foreign sequences up to 7 kb (Grunhaus et al., Seminar in Virology, 200(2):535-546, 1992)).</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">In another embodiment, an adeno-associated virus (AAV) can be used to introduce a nucleotide sequence encoding an ADAMTS protein (e.g., ADAMTS13) into a host cell for expression. AAV systems have been described previously and are generally well known in the art (Kelleher and Vos, Biotechniques, 17(6):1110-7, 1994; Cotten et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 89(13):6094-6098, 1992; Curiel, Nat Immun, 13(2-3):141-64, 1994; Muzyczka, Curr Top Microbiol Immunol, 158:97-129, 1992). Details concerning the generation and use of rAAV vectors are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,139,941 and 4,797,368, each incorporated herein by reference in their entireties for all purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">In one embodiment, a retroviral expression vector can be used to introduce a nucleotide sequence encoding an ADAMTS protein (e.g., ADAMTS13) into a host cell for expression. These systems have been described previously and are generally well known in the art (Mann et al., Cell, 33:153-159, 1983; Nicolas and Rubinstein, In: Vectors: A survey of molecular cloning vectors and their uses, Rodriguez and Denhardt, eds., Stoneham: Butterworth, pp. 494-513, 1988; Temin, In: Gene Transfer, Kucherlapati (ed.), New York: Plenum Press, pp. 149-188, 1986). In a specific embodiment, the retroviral vector is a lentiviral vector (see, for example, Naldini et al., Science, 272(5259):263-267, 1996; Zufferey et al., Nat Biotechnol, 15(9):871-875, 1997; Blomer et al., J Virol., 71(9):6641-6649, 1997; U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,013,516 and 5,994,136).</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Non-limiting examples of vectors for prokaryotic expression include plasmids such as pRSET, pET, pBAD, etc., wherein the promoters used in prokaryotic expression vectors include lac, trc, trp, recA, araBAD, etc. Examples of vectors for eukaryotic expression include: (i) for expression in yeast, vectors such as pAO, pPIC, pYES, pMET, using promoters such as AOX1, GAP, GAL1, AUG1, etc.; (ii) for expression in insect cells, vectors such as pMT, pAc5, pIB, pMIB, pBAC, etc., using promoters such as PH, p10, MT, Ac5, OpIE2, gp64, polh, etc., and (iii) for expression in mammalian cells, vectors such as pSVL, pCMV, pRc/RSV, pcDNA3, pBPV, etc., and vectors derived form viral systems such as vaccinia virus, adeno-associated viruses, herpes viruses, retroviruses, etc., using promoters such as CMV, SV40, EF-1, UbC, RSV, ADV, BPV, and &#x3b2;-actin.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">In certain embodiments, the cell-culture expression of ADAMTS13 may comprise the use of a microcarrier. The present invention provides, among other aspect, methods of large-scale ADAMTS protein expression. In some embodiments, the cell-cultures of the embodiments can be performed in large bioreactors under conditions suitable for providing high volume-specific culture surface areas to achieve high cell densities and protein expression. One means for providing such growth conditions is to use microcarriers for cell-culture in stirred tank bioreactors. In another embodiment, these growth requirements are met via the use of a suspension cell culture.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">B. Cultivation Methods</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">In certain embodiments, ADAMTS13 expression can comprise the use of a cell culture system operated under a batch or continuous mode of operation. For example, when batch cell cultures are utilized, they may be operated under single batch, fed-batch, or repeated-batch mode. Likewise, continuous cell cultures may be operated under, for example, perfusion, turbidostat or chemostat mode. Batch and continuous cell cultivation may be performed under either suspension or adherence conditions. When operated under suspension conditions, the cells will be freely suspended and mixed within the culture medium. Alternatively, under adherence conditions, the cells will be bound to a solid phase, for example, a microcarrier, a porous microcarrier, disk carrier, ceramic cartridge, hollow fiber, flat sheet, gel matrix, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">A batch culture is typically a large scale cell culture in which a cell inoculum is cultured to a maximum density in a tank or fermenter, and harvested and processed as a single batch. A fed-batch culture it typically a batch culture which is supplied with either fresh nutrients (e.g., growth-limiting substrates) or additives (e.g., precursors to products). The feed solution is usually highly concentrated to avoid dilution of the bioreactor. In a repeated-batch culture, the cells are placed in a culture medium and grown to a desired cell density. To avoid the onset of a decline phase and cell death, the culture is then diluted with complete growth medium before the cells reach their maximum concentration. The amount and frequency of dilution varies widely and depends on the growth characteristics of the cell line and convenience of the culture process. The process can be repeated as many times as required and, unless cells and medium are discarded at subculture, the volume of culture will increase stepwise as each dilution is made. The increasing volume may be handled by having a reactor of sufficient size to allow dilutions within the vessel or by dividing the diluted culture into several vessels. The rationale of this type of culture is to maintain the cells in an exponentially growing state. Serial subculture is characterized in that the volume of culture is always increasing stepwise, there can be multiple harvests, the cells continue to grow and the process can continue for as long as desired. In certain embodiments, an ADAMTS protein (e.g., ADAMTS13) may be recovered after harvesting the supernatant of a batch culture.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">A continuous culture can be a suspension culture that is continuously supplied with nutrients by the inflow of fresh medium, wherein the culture volume is usually kept constant by the concomitant removal of spent medium. In chemostat and turbidostat methods, the extracted medium contains cells. Thus, the cells remaining in the cell culture vessel must grow to maintain a steady state. In the chemostat method, the growth rate is typically controlled by controlling the dilution rate, i.e., the rate at which fresh medium is added. The growth rate of the cells in the culture may be controlled, for example, at a sub-maximal growth rate, by alteration of the dilution rate. In contrast, in the turbidostat method, the dilution rate is set to permit the maximum growth rate that the cells can achieve at the given operating conditions, such as pH and temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">In a perfusion culture, the extracted medium is depleted of cells, which are retained in the culture vessel, for example, by filtration or by centrifugal methods that lead to the reintroduction of the cells into the culture. However, typically membranes used for filtration do not retain 100% of cells, and so a proportion are removed when the medium is extracted. It may not be crucial to operate perfusion cultures at very high growth rates, as the majority of the cells are retained in the culture vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Stirred-tank reactor system can be used for batch and continuous cell cultures operated under suspension or adherent modes. Generally, the stirred-tank reactor system can be operated as any conventional stirred-tank reactor with any type of agitator such as a Rushton, hydrofoil, pitched blade, or marine.</p>

<heading id="h-0017" level="1">Expression of Recombinant ADAMTS13 (rA13)</heading>
<p id="p-0333" num="0332">A Chemostat cell-culture of the recombinant CHO cell line #640-2 expressing human ADAMTS13, was grown in chemically defined BACD-A13 medium supplemented with additional zinc and vitamin B3. The 10 L culture was maintained for 53 days and rA13 protein and activity production was monitored over time.</p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0333">Recombinant CHO cells expressing human ADAMTS13 were adapted to a chemically defined proprietary medium (BCS medium). A DWCB was thawed and cell inoculum was prepared in BCS medium. Cells propagated from the rA13 expression clone #640-2 were transferred to a 10 L bioreactor with Rushton type impellers and cultivated in repeated batch cultures with proprietary BACD-A13 medium under an inline controlled pH of 7.15-7.20 at 37&#xb0; C. with a dissolved oxygen concentration of 20% air saturation. After 2 batch cultures were grown to the final working volume of 10 L, the bioreactor was switched to continuous medium feed on day 5 and operated for an additional 48 days in a chemostat mode.</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0334">Samples of the supernatant from the bioreactors were taken weekly and analyzed for rA13 protein production by ELISA and rA13 activity by FRETS-VWF73 assay. Cell counts were determined by Nucleocounter technology. Dilution rates were measured and used for calculation of growth rates and volumetric productivities.</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0335">Under continuous culture conditions using chemically defined BACD-A13 medium supplemented with zinc and nicotinamide at a final concentration of 1.432 mg/L ZnSO<sub>4</sub>7H<sub>2</sub>O and 7.02 mg/L nicotinamide, high levels of rA13 protein production, between 0.9 and 1.3 mg/L/D, and specific activities, between about 800 and 1100 mU/&#x3bc;g rA13, were achieved (Table 1). Notably, volumetric and cell specific productivities increased over time in the long term culture, likely due to increasing growth and dilution rates over time. The high specific activity of the expressed rA13 could be at least maintained at a constantly high level over at least entire 7 weeks the culture was grown under chemostatic conditions. In fact, the specific activity of the rA13 produced in the culture actually increased from about 800 mU/&#x3bc;g A13 at week 2 to about 1100 mU/&#x3bc;g A13 at week 7.</p>

<heading id="h-0019" level="1">Formulation of Purified Recombinant ADAMTS13 (rA13)</heading>
<p id="p-0338" num="0337">Recombinant ADAMTS13 was expressed in recombinant CHO cells and purified by anion exchange chromatography. The purified rA13 had a final concentration of approximately 750 &#x3bc;g/ml with a specific activity of approximately 850 mU/&#x3bc;g. rA13 was formulated in buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 2% sucrose, 0.05% polysorbate 80, at a pH of 7.0 with 20 mM of a buffering agent selected from (1) histidine, (2) phosphate buffer, or (3) sodium citrate. Samples were then divided evenly and half the samples were lyophilized.</p>
<p id="p-0339" num="0338">Lyophilized samples were reconstituted with sterile water to a final volume equal to that of the pre-lyophilized formulation. A single aliquot of each liquid and lyophilized formulation was then characterized by gel filtration by loading the sample onto a Superose 6 GL column (GE Healthcare). As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, all of the formulations resulted in ADAMTS13 samples that ran as a single peak corresponding to monomeric rA13 protein by gel filtration.</p>

<heading id="h-0021" level="1">Characterization of Activity Retention of rA13 Formulations Stored at 4&#xb0; C. and 37&#xb0; C.</heading>
<p id="p-0340" num="0339">rA13 samples formulated and aliquoted as in example 2 were stored at either 4&#xb0; C. or 37&#xb0; C. for up to 6 months time. Solution formulations were analyzed for rA13 protein concentration, as determined by ELISA, and rA13 activity by FRETS-VWF73 assay at 0, 1, 2, 3, 12, and 24 weeks (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Lyophilized samples were reconstituted with sterile water to a final volume equal to that of the pre-lyophilized formulation and analyzed similarly at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0340">rA13 liquid formulations stored at 4&#xb0; C. showed no loss in either antigen content, i.e. protein concentration, or FRETS-VWF73 activity at time points out to 6 months. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, this was the case for all three formulations, buffered with histidine, phosphate, and sodium citrate, respectively. Conversely, liquid formulations, buffered with histidine or sodium citrate, displayed nearly complete loss of activity after one week at 37&#xb0; C. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>; &#x22c4;=histidine, &#x25a1;=sodium citrate). This loss in activity was accompanied with a spike in the antigen content at one week for these samples, suggesting that the rA13 proteins were being denatured. The histidine liquid formulation of rA13 displayed drastically reduced antigen content at 3 and 6 months, suggesting that the protein was being degraded. Notably, liquid rA13 formulated with phosphate buffer showed significant activity at three weeks when stored at 37&#xb0; C. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>; &#x25ef;=phosphate buffer). Consistently, the antigen content of this formulation increased at a slower rate, suggesting that rA13 denaturation is retarded when formulated with phosphate buffer.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0341">rA13 lyophilized formulations appeared to be stable for at least 6 months when stored at either 4&#xb0; C. or 37&#xb0; C. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Lyophilized rA13 formulated with phosphate buffer displayed a gradual loss of activity (30% at 6 months) when stored at 37&#xb0; C., but not at 4&#xb0; C., however, this loss of activity was not accompanied by an increase in antigen availability by ELISA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>; &#x25ef;=phosphate buffer). No other lyophilized formulation showed a loss of activity or increase in antigen availability when stored at 4&#xb0; C. or 37&#xb0; C.</p>

<heading id="h-0023" level="1">Conformational Stability of rA13 in Formulations Stored at 4&#xb0; C. and 37&#xb0; C.</heading>
<p id="p-0343" num="0342">rA13 samples formulated and aliquoted as in example 2 were stored at either 4&#xb0; C. or 37&#xb0; C. for up to 6 months time. The global conformations of rA13 formulated and stored in solution and lyophilized states was characterized by gel filtration at the time points described in example 3. Results of gel filtration experiments performed with the histidine formulated rA13 at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 24 weeks for the liquid formulations (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks for the lyophilized formulations (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) are shown.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0343">Liquid formulations with histidine, stored at 4&#xb0; C. for up to 6 months, ran primarily as a monomer over gel filtration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>), suggesting that the protein is very stable in solution at 4&#xb0; C. This result is consistent with those described in example 3, which showed that rA13 formulated with histidine and stored in solution at 4&#xb0; C. for up to 6 months did not lose any FRETS-VWF73 activity. Conversely, rA13 formulated with histidine and stored at 37&#xb0; C., ran as higher order/partially or wholly denatured species, as indicated by the reduced elution volumes/retention times (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). Consistent with the results seen in example 3, histidine formulated A13 stored at 37&#xb0; C. for 6 months appeared to be mostly degraded.</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0344">Gel filtration experiments were repeated for each formulation, stored at 4&#xb0; C. and 37&#xb0; C., and relative areas under the eluted peaks were integrated in order to determine the relative populations of monomer rA13 (3), dimer rA13 (2), and aggregated/denatured rA13 (1) in the formulations. Results of the gel filtration experiments performed on the three lyophilized formulations stored at 4&#xb0; C. and 37&#xb0; C. for six months are given in Table 2. Lyophilized samples were reconstituted with sterile water to a final volume equal to that of the pre-lyophilized formulation prior to analysis via gel filtration.</p>

<p id="p-0347" num="0346">Consistent with the results seen in example 3, lyophilized rA13 formulations displayed no increase in the amount of dimer or aggregate/denatured species after storage at 4&#xb0; C. for at least 6 months. Similarly, rA13 formulated and lyophilized with histidine or sodium citrate showed only minor levels of dimerization when stored at 37&#xb0; C. for at least 6 months. Furthermore, there was no indication that either of these formulations resulted increased levels of aggregation and/or denaturation. Conversely, rA13 formulated and lyophilized with phosphate buffer displayed significant levels of dimerization and aggregation and/or denaturation, when stored at 37&#xb0; C. for at least 6 months.</p>

<heading id="h-0025" level="1">Biophysical Characterization of rA13 Formulations Stored at 4&#xb0; C. and 37&#xb0; C.</heading>
<p id="p-0348" num="0347">rA13 samples formulated and aliquoted as in example 2 were stored at either 4&#xb0; C. or 37&#xb0; C. for up to 6 months time. As a measure of the conformational stability of rA13 protein formulated as described above, stokes radii were determined by dynamic light scattering for the solution (A) and lyophilized (B) rA13 formulations with histidine (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), phosphate buffer (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), and sodium citrate (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), at each of the indicated time points.</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0348">Furthermore, derived count rates for each of the liquid formulation, before storage, were determined by dynamic light scattering. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, there is a discontinuity in the change of the stokes radii, and thus rA13 stability, above about 35&#xb0; C. for the histidine and sodium citrate formulations, and above about 40&#xb0; C. for the phosphate formulation. Furthermore, although the phosphate formulation has a larger stokes radius than the histidine or sodium citrate formulations at temperatures below about 37&#xb0; C., the phosphate formulation appears to be slightly more stable at temperatures between about 40&#xb0; C. and 50&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0349">Lyophilized samples formulated with histidine were stored at 4&#xb0; C. or 37&#xb0; C. for 3 months, and then reconstituted in sterile water. In order to characterize whether or not local or global conformational changes occurred in reconstituted rA13, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was performed for the samples stored at 4&#xb0; C. and 37&#xb0; C. for 3 months, and compared to freshly formulated and lyophilized A13. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the absorbance spectrums for all three samples overlay nearly perfectly, suggesting that no conformational transitions are occurring in rA13 stored as a lyophilized formulation in histidine at 4&#xb0; C. or 37&#xb0; C. for 3 months.</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0350">rA13 formulations stored at 4&#xb0; C. or 37&#xb0; C. for 6 months were also characterized by reverse phase-high-performance liquid chromatography (rp-HPLC). rp-HPLC allows for the separation of closely related protein molecules and thus in many instances can differentiate between modified versions of the same polypeptide, e.g. charge-modified, partially-degraded, or partially-unfolded. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, all rA13 formulations appear to be stable for at least 6 months at 4&#xb0; C., consistent with several results seen above.</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0351">rA13 samples formulated as in example 2 were next analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry to further characterize the stability of the rA13 protein in the various formulations. The bimodal nature of the heat capacity curve generated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, suggests that two domains of the protein may unfold separate of each other, with the first unfolding transition occurring at a temperature between about 54&#xb0; C. and 55&#xb0; C. The unfolding temperatures for rA13 are similar for the various formulations. However, the increased enthalpy of transition, as indicated by the larger area beneath the endotherm, for the phosphate formulation, and to a lesser extent the citrate formulation, suggest slightly stabilized formulations of A13.</p>

<heading id="h-0027" level="1">Characterization of Dimer Formation in rA13 Formulations</heading>
<p id="p-0353" num="0352">In order to determine the effect of stabilizing agents on the oligomeric state of rA13 in solution, rA13 was formulated in 20 mM histidine (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% polysorbate 80 with different combinations of sucrose (0% to 2%), mannitol (0% to 3%), and calcium (0 mM or 2 mM). The various formulations were then analyzed by gel filtration over a Sepharose 6 GL column (GE Healthcare). As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, various combinations of the stabilizing agents were able to reduce the amount of A13 dimer formation by about 50%. The percentages of aggregates, dimers/oligos, and monomers for each formulation is provided in Table 14.</p>

<heading id="h-0031" level="1">Effect of Low Levels of CaCl<sub>2 </sub>on ADAMTS13 Formulation Stability</heading>
<p id="p-0358" num="0357">In order to determine the effect of low levels of CaCl<sub>2 </sub>on the stability of rA13 in solution, rA13 was formulated in buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 2% sucrose, 0.05% polysorbate 80, and 20 mM histidine at pH 7.0 with (12B and D) and without (12A and C) 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. The liquid formulations were stored at either 25&#xb0; C. or 37&#xb0; C. for three weeks. Stability of the formulation was then assessed by determining the relative FRETS-VWF73 activity at 0, 1, 2, and 3 weeks. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the addition of 2 mM CaCl<sub>2 </sub>stabilized liquid rADAMTS13 formulations stored at both 25&#xb0; C. and 37&#xb0; C., to varying degrees. Notably, addition of low levels of CaCl<sub>2 </sub>to rADAMTS13 liquid formulations stored at 25&#xb0; C. conferred about 95% enzyme activity stability for three weeks, as compared to an 80% loss of activity seen in formulations without CaCl<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<heading id="h-0032" level="1">I. Example 9</heading>
<heading id="h-0033" level="1">FRETS-VWF73 Activity of Oligomeric Species of Recombinant ADAMTS13</heading>
<p id="p-0359" num="0358">In order to determine the enzymatic activity of the different oligomeric species of ADAMTS13 protein isolated during purification, rA13 was loaded onto a Superose 6 GL gel filtration column equilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4 </sub>(pH 7.5) and 500 mM NaCl. ADAMTS13 molecular species were then separated by size and shape. Fractions eluting from the column were pooled according to their apparent oligomeric state, e.g. aggregated A13 (Pool 1), dimeric A13 (Pool 2), and monomeric A13 (Pool 3) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>). Further confirmation of the oligomeric state of ADAMTS13 was obtained by determining the average stokes radius of the protein in each pool by dynamic light scattering (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0360" num="0359">The enzymatic activity of each pool was then determined by FRETS-VWF73 assay. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the volumetric activity of the aggregated A13 species was about 218 mU/ml, the activity of dimeric A13 was about 1.435 U/ml, and the activity of the monomeric A13 was about 97.905 U/ml. After standardizing the activities for the volume of the pools, greater than 99% of the total activity is found in the elution pool corresponding to the monomeric protein. When the activities are then standardized for the total amount of protein, it can be seen that the monomeric protein pool has a higher specific activity than both the dimeric protein pool and the aggregated protein pool.</p>
<heading id="h-0034" level="1">J. Example 10</heading>
<heading id="h-0035" level="1">Effect of NaCl Concentration on the Lyophilization of ADAMTS13 Formulations</heading>
<p id="p-0361" num="0360">In order to determine the effect of NaCl concentration on the production of lyocakes, recombinant ADAMTS13 was formulated in buffer containing 2% sucrose, 0.05% polysorbate 80, and 20 mM histidine (pH 7.0) with varying amounts of NaCl (0 to 150 mM). The ADAMTS13 formulations were then lyophilized under standard conditions and visually inspected for the quality of the resulting lyocakes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>). Lyocakes produced from ADAMTS13 formulations containing lower salt concentrations (0 to 60 mM; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A-C</figref>) had compact structures with smooth surfaces, while lyocakes produced from high salt formulations (120 mM and 150 mM NaCl; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17E</figref> and F) were porous and not compact, with a string-like or cracked appearance. ADAMTS13 formulations containing intermediate levels of NaCl (90 mM; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17D</figref>) were partially compact with a semi-porous or crater-like surface.</p>
<p id="p-0362" num="0361">A porous, non-compact lyocake indicates melting during the lyophilization process. Generally, high salt concentrations are used to decrease the collapse temperature (or glass temperature) that can result in the partial melting of the frozen material during the primary drying process. This can have a negative impact on protein aggregation levels and/or the recovery of enzymatic activity. Therefore, a good lyocake appearance usually correlates with better recovery of activity and less aggregation of the respective formulated protein. Advantageously, the present invention provides ADAMTS13 formulations which allow for the production of high quality lyocakes. In certain embodiments, the inventive formulations provided herein allow for low salt formulations of ADAMTS13, that are particularly stable during lyophilization, resulting in the formation of high quality lyocakes.</p>
<p id="p-0363" num="0362">One concern with the use of low salt protein formulations is that increased protein aggregation may occur. To determine if this was the case for the low salt ADAMTS13 formulations, the lyocakes produced above were reconstituted in de-ionized water and the aggregation states of the reconstituted ADAMTS13 proteins were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the salt concentration of the lyophilized formulations had no effect on the aggregation state of reconstituted ADAMTS13 protein (compare 0 mM NaCl with 150 mM NaCl).</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0363">To further validate the use of low salt ADAMTS13 formulations, the FRETS-VWF73 activity of various formulations ranging from 0 to 150 mM NaCl was determined. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the salt concentration, as well as the sucrose concentration, of the ADAMTS13 formulations did not influence the activity of the recombinant ADAMTS13 protein. These results suggest that low salt (i.e. 0 to 100 mM NaCl) formulations of liquid and lyophilized recombinant ADAMTS13 proteins are well suited for pharmaceutical use.</p>

<heading id="h-0037" level="1">Lyophilized Formulation of ADAMTS13 in High Salt and Low Salt Buffers</heading>
<p id="p-0365" num="0364">To compare lyophilized formulations of recombinant ADAMTS13, high salt (150 mM NaCl) and low salt (30 mM NaCl) formulations were prepared. Both the high salt and low salt formulations contained 20 mM histidine (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% polysorbate 80, and 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. The high salt formulation further contained 2% sucrose and 150 mM NaCl, while the low salt formulation further contained 1% sucrose, 3% mannitol, and 30 mM NaCl. The two formulations were then lyophilized under standard conditions. The resulting lyocake produced from the high salt ADAMTS13 formulation was not compact, non-uniform, clumpy, and porous (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref>), while the lyocake produced from the low salt ADAMTS13 formulation was compact, fairly uniform, and had a smooth surface (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref>). These results suggest that low salt formulations of lyophilized ADAMTS13 are well suited for pharmaceutical use.</p>

<heading id="h-0039" level="1">Purification of rADAMTS13 for Lyophilized Formulations</heading>
<p id="p-0366" num="0365">Recombinant ADAMTS13 was expressed in recombinant CHO cells and purified from the resulting conditioned media by POROS HS cation exchange chromatography. Collected fractions of rADAMTS13 eluted off of the HS column were then analyzed, by size exclusion chromatography using a superose 6 GL: TC10/30 column, for dimerization and aggregation prior to and after gel filtration, by size exclusion chromatography (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A</figref> and B, respectively) and dynamic light scattering (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A</figref> and B, respectively). As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref>, nearly 20% of the total rADAMTS13 in the HS-eluted fractions, prior to gel filtration, were in undesirable dimeric, monomeric, or aggregated states. In contrast, almost all of the rADAMTS13 pooled from the gel filtration step is monomeric (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref>). Similarly, the average hydrodynamic radius of the HS-eluted rADAMS 13 (about 20.5 nm; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref>) was nearly twice that of the rADAMTS recovered after size exclusion chromatography (about 12-13 nm; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref>)</p>

<p id="p-0367" num="0366">In order to compare lyophilization of rADAMTS13 formulations containing variable low salt (30 mM and 60 mM NaCl), calcium (2 mM and 4 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>), and sugar (1% sucrose and 1% trehalose) concentrations, rADAMTS13 was purified by cation exchange chromatography and size exclusion chromatography, as above, and formulated in 20 mM histidine, 3% mannitol, 0.05% polysorbate 80, with all eight combinations of salt, calcium, and sugar given above. All vials had the same concentration of ADAMTS13 (190 &#x3bc;g/mL antigen). rA13 formulations 1 to 8 (Tables 5 and 6) were then lyophilized using either a standard (3 days; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref>) or extended (11 days; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref>) lyophilization protocol. After lyophilization, the lyocakes were visually inspected for desirable qualities (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>).</p>

<p id="p-0370" num="0369">To determine the multimeric state of ADAMTS13 in each of the formulations, lyophilized protein was reconstituted in deionized water and analyzed by dynamic light scattering. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, lyophilized formulations prepared by using both standard and extended lyophilization protocols, yielded primarily monomeric ADAMTS13 molecules (peak at about 12-13 nm) after reconstitution. Although the ADAMTS13 peak corresponding to aggregated protein (between 100 and 110 nm) appears to be about half as high as the monomer peak, one of ordinary skill will recognize that the y-axis is measuring intensity, rather than total mass, and as such the graph greatly exaggerates the percentage of ADAMTS13 species that are aggregated. It is also seen that formulations prepared with extended lyophilization protocols (dashed lines) contain less aggregated ADAMTS13 than formulations prepared with standard lyophilization protocols (unbroken lines), after reconstitution in deionized water.</p>
<p id="p-0371" num="0370">In order evaluate the stability of the lyophilized rADAMTS13 in each of the formulations presented above, the lyocakes produced by the standard and extended protocols were used to prepare a series of vials for storage under various temperatures for up to 36 months. As outlined in Table 7, vials containing either 5 mg or 10 mg lyophilized rADAMTS13 were prepared for storage at +2-+8&#xb0; C. (i.e. under standard refrigeration conditions), 30&#xb0; C. (room temperature), and 40&#xb0; C. All vials were tested by FTIR, SE-HPLC and DLS. Also FRETS activity and ADAMTS13 antigen were tested for all samples. Lyophilized ADAMTS13 formulations can then be tested for FRETS-VWF73 activity and antigen stability, as outlined above, at the indicated time points to determine the stability of the protein in the various lyophilized formulations. Tables 8 and 9 provide the results of FRETS-VWF73 activity assays of reconstituted ADAMTS13 formulations generated by the standard and extended lyophilization protocols, respectively. Similarly, antigen recovery is given in tables 10 and 11, for samples generated with the standard and extended lyophilization protocols, respectively.</p>

<heading id="h-0043" level="1">Expression and Purification of Recombinant Human ADAMTS13</heading>
<p id="p-0382" num="0381">Recombinant ADAMTS-13 is generated by a recombinant Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell clone in a fermentation process in suspension culture. The growth medium, developed by Baxter and is both free of human or animal derived substances and recombinant proteins. Examples of these types of growth mediums useful for the expression of ADAMTS13 can be found: for example, in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/847,999. The manufacturing process utilizes a continuous (chemostat) cell culture method. The purification process starts with an initial cell removal step by filtration. The cell free product of up to 4 subsequent days is combined to produce one downstream batch. The pooled, filtered harvests are concentrated by an ultra/diafiltration and then subjected to a solvent detergent virus inactivation step. Further purification includes a chromatographic capture step (Anion Exchange), a nanofiltration step (second virus reduction step), a negative chromatography step (hydroxyapatite) followed by a mixed mode chromatography (Capto MMC) and a final chromatographic concentration and pre-formulation step (Cation Exchange). The pre-formulated bulk drug substance (BDS) is frozen at &#x2212;60&#xb0; C. in a temperature-controlled freezer.</p>

<p id="p-0383" num="0382">The proteolytic activity of ADAMTS13 was measured against a fluorescence-quenching substrate (FRETS-VWF73, Peptides Institute, Inc; Osaka, Japan) according to the assay description of the manufacturer. Briefly, rADAMTS13 samples were diluted (in 100 &#x3bc;L total volume) in buffer containing 5 mM Bis-Tris, 25 mM CaCl2, and 0.005% Tween20 and transferred into a black microtiter plate. Samples were measured against a reference curve of diluted human plasma samples (from 80 to 5 mU/mL plasma). The reaction was started by adding the substrate (100 &#x3bc;L, FRETS-VWF73; 2 &#x3bc;M final concentration) and fluorescence was measured every two minutes for 45 minutes in a fluorescence spectrophotometer with lex=360 nm and lem=460 at 30&#xb0; C. (FLx800, Bio Tek). The activity results were read off a reference curve of human plasma. Data are expressed as Unit/mL. Normal human plasma was regarded as 1 Unit/mL.</p>

<p id="p-0384" num="0383">ADAMTS13 containing samples are analyzed in an ELISA assay using polyclonal rabbit IgG directed against human ADAMTS13 both as capture and in its labeled form as detection antibody. ADAMTS13 antigen present in the sample is captured by the ADAMTS13-specific antibody coated on a 96-well microtiter plate. Samples were diluted in buffer (250 mM Tris, 350 mM NaCl, 0.5% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20) and transferred to the coated microtiter wells. Bound ADAMTS13 antigen is detected with HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-ADAMTS13 IgG using TMB as substrate (Thermo Art: #34021). Absorbance was measured in a spectrophotometer (TECAN SpectraFluorPlus, Tecan Sales Austria, Gr&#xf6;ding, Austria) at 1=450 nm. ADAMTS13 antigen concentrations (expressed in &#x3bc;g/mL) were calculated from a reference standard using dilutions ranging from 250 to 7.81 ng/mL of recombinant ADAMTS13 that was purified from stably transfected HEK293 cell culture harvests.</p>

The system was equipped with a Superose 12 GL column (GE Healthcare, TC10/30) which was run at a constant flow rate of 0.3 mL per minute at room temperature. As running buffer 20 mM Tris, 100 mM sodium acetate, 500 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.4 was used. The sample was centrifuged (Centrifuge 5415C, Eppendorf, Vienna, Austria) for 5 min at 10,000 rpm and 100 &#x3bc;L were applied automatically by an autosampler. The absorbance of the column effluent was measured continuously at 280 nm.</p>

WR14 1XZ) and a Haake Rheostress 1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Karlsruhe, Germany) equipped with a cone with 60 mm diameter/0.5&#xb0; angle for buffer viscosity measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0387" num="0386">All samples were centrifuged (Centrifuge 5415C, Eppendorf, Vienna, Austria) for 5 min at 10.000 rpm to determine the hydrodynamic diameter of a protein. 60 &#x3bc;L of sample were filled into a ZEN0040 disposable micro cuvette and viscosity of buffer was determined by Rheostress 1. This parameter is used for analyzing effective size of proteins by DLS. Operation temperature was 25&#xb0; C. with an equilibration time of 2 minutes. The proteins angle was set to 173&#xb0; backscatter to measure the size of and 3 runs per sample were performed to average the results.</p>
<p id="p-0388" num="0387">Samples were measured by increasing temperature mode to monitor the influence of temperature on a protein. Measurement procedure was similar to a normal size measurement, except for different temperatures with an increasing value of 1&#xb0; C./min from 15&#xb0; C. to 80&#xb0; C. and an equilibration time of 2 min. A DTS2145 low volume glass cuvette was used for these temperature ramps.</p>

<p id="p-0391" num="0390">Photostability testing was performed using the Atlas Suntest CPS+ Photostability Chamber (Chicago, Ill., USA), according to SOP VN-09-45058TB. The CPS+ monitors and controls irradiance, black standard temperature and chamber air temperature. Photostability was tested in the same formulation as was used for shear and freeze-thaw experiments (Table 12). The samples and controls were tested by DLS and SE-HPLC. The results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>. Both formulations (liquid and Lyo) showed the same results by SE-HPLC. The monomer ADAMTS13 peak decreased and the dimer peak increased with irradiation time. Hydrodynamic diameter of liquid and lyophilized formulation also slightly increased with time (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>). The lyophilized formulation irradiated for 10 h (as recommended by ICH Q1B) did not show any difference to the light-protected control. FRETS activity monitored during photo-irradiation rapidly decreased in liquid but less in lyophilized formulations as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>. Even after four-fold photoirradiation dose, as recommended by ICH guideline Q1B which corresponds to 4.8M lux hours, more than 50% of FRETS activity remained.</p>
<p id="p-0392" num="0391">The &#x201c;control&#x201d; vials were wrapped in aluminium foil to eliminate exposure to light and placed in the photostability chamber along with the test samples. All samples were placed horizontally. An irradiation time of 10 h corresponded to 1.2 to 1.8 million lux h and 765 W/m<sup>2 </sup>UV light. Samples were removed from the photostability chamber after 10 h and the spectrum (190-800 nm) and pH value were measured.</p>

<heading id="h-0061" level="1">Freeze-Thaw Analysis of ADAMTS13 Stability</heading>
<p id="p-0398" num="0397">The same formulation (Table 12) as used for shear stress experiments was again used to investigate the behavior of the protein during freeze-thaw stress. Two freeze-thaw conditions &#x2212;20&#xb0; C./RT and &#x2212;80&#xb0; C./+37&#xb0; C. were chosen. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> summarizes the results of the FRETS activity measurements. All samples are stable within the range of the assay's variation (25% relative standard deviation). No FRETS activity loss was seen even after a 5-fold freeze-thaw cycle. The stability of BAX930 in this liquid formulation is confirmed by the results of the DLS and SE-HPLC measurements. No increase in the intensity of the aggregation peaks (between 100 and 1000 nm) by DLS was observed independent of freeze-thaw conditions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>). Similarly, SE-HPLC did not show an increase of the aggregation level after repeated freeze thaw cycles at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C./+37&#xb0; C. but some increase at &#x2212;20&#xb0; C./RT (data not shown).</p>

<heading id="h-0063" level="1">Effect of Calcium and Zinc on the FRETS Activity of ADAMTS13</heading>
<p id="p-0399" num="0398">Recombinant human ADAMTS13, prepared as described above, was treated with 10 mM EDTA and then dialyzed against buffer containing 20 mM histidine and 190 mM NaCl (pH 7.5). After dialysis, CaCl<sub>2 </sub>and ZnCl<sub>2 </sub>were added back to the formulations at different concentrations. The activity of ADAMTS13 formulations containing different concentrations of calcium and zinc were then tested for FRET activity as described above. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, increasing levels of calcium increased the recovery of FRETS activity. Near maximum activity was achieved with the inclusion of 4 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, both in the presence and absence of zinc. At intermediate concentrations of calcium (2 mM and 4 mM), the addition of zinc provided a modest increase in FRETS activity.</p>

<heading id="h-0065" level="1">Influence of Salt and Sugar Concentration on Aggregation in Lyophilized ADAMTS13 Formulations</heading>
<p id="p-0400" num="0399">To further investigate the effect that salt and sugar concentrations have on lyophilized formulations of ADAMTS13, the oligomeric state of several lyophilized formulations was determined after reconstitution with deionized water. Briefly, recombinant human ADAMTS13 was produced as described above. Protein samples were then formulated with 20 mM histidine (pH 7.0), 2 mM calcium chloride, and 0.05% polysorbate 80 with the sodium chloride and sucrose levels given in Table 15. The formulations were then lyophilized, as described above, and reconstituted with deionized water. Oligomeric characteristics were then determined by SE-HPLC analysis, the results of which are shown in Table 15 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>. As can been seen in formulations containing low sugar concentrations, high salt levels (150 mM) increase ADAMTS13 aggregation and reduce the monomeric content of the formulation.</p>

<heading id="h-0067" level="1">Long Term Temperature Stress Test</heading>
<p id="p-0404" num="0403">To further characterize the stability of lyophilized formulations of ADAMTS13, a second long term stress test was initiated. For this test, recombinant human ADAMTS13 was formulated at three final protein concentrations according to Table 19. A second sugar (mannitol) was included in the formulation as it was found to stabilize the protein during lyophilization and provided a compact lyocake with a smooth surface. All stress test samples were characterized by DLS (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>), SE-HPLC (Table 20), and FTIR. FRETS activity (Table 21) and A13 antigen ELISA (Table 22) were also measured over time for all of the formulations.</p>
