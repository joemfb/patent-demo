<p id="p-0001" num="0000">When a login request in which a network terminal serves as a login destination is received from an administrator terminal, a login request receiving unit of a login administration server causes the administrator terminal to transmit a shared account and fingerprint information. A search engine unit performs a search in an authentication table by using the account and the user fingerprint information as a key, and, when the authentication succeeds, acquires association data including a right upon successful authentication and a login permitted terminal from an association data table. A login request transmitting unit transmits a login request to the network terminal of the login destination so as to achieve login and imparts the right upon successful authentication. Furthermore, the login request transmitting unit transmits a login request to the unprocessed network terminal so as to achieve login and imparts the right upon successful authentication.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a priority based on prior application No. JP 2006-211826, filed Aug. 3, 2006, in Japan.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a login administration method and a server which achieve remote login from an administrator terminal or the like to a terminal which is present on a network via the server through an authentication process using user biometric information such as fingerprints, and particularly relates to a login administration method and a server for subjecting a plurality of terminals to login processes at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Arts</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, in a computer network system, a wide area network is built not only by connecting a large number of personal computers or workstations on a network, but also by connecting networks, WANs, etc. which are placed at geographically distant locations outside the same building or facility. When distributed administration is performed for such a computer network system, determination upon failure occurrence is difficult, and massive operational cost is taken; therefore, centralized administration utilizing SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) installed in many network devices is performed. Administration items of network administration can be generally divided into, for example, constitution administration in which the state of the devices constituting a network is monitored and the operation thereof is controlled, performance administration in which the performance of the devices constituting the network is measured, secret administration in which utilization of information, devices, etc. in the network to resources is limited so as to control utilization of the resources to be correctly performed, and billing administration in which the usage state of the resources in the network is recorded for each user. By acquiring such administration items from the network, a network administrator can always seize the latest network configuration and can appropriately carry out network administration services of checking if unauthorized packets are not transmitted by monitoring the traffic state of the devices, finding unauthorized users from access records so as to prevent intrusion, and seizing the resource utilization state of users so as to advise them about appropriate resource utilization. Furthermore, as a method in which a network administrator remotely connects to and administers network devices, sometimes, they are arranged so that remote connection from an administrator terminal to the network devices can be established by using the TCP/IP Telenet protocol, and, when the network devices are to be subjected to maintenance, required operations are performed by remotely performing login from the administrator terminal to the network devices.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an example of a conventional computer network system, wherein an administrator terminal <b>102</b> and terminals <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>104</b>-<b>4</b> serving as network devices to be administered are connected to a network <b>100</b> of Ethernet or the like. In a conventional login process, when login is requested from the administrator terminal <b>102</b> serving as a login origin to, for example, the terminal <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> serving as a login destination, a login prompt is sent back from the terminal <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> to the administrator terminal <b>102</b>, and therefore a shared account and a shared password the administrator has are transmitted to the terminal <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>. The terminal <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> of the login destination performs a search in an authentication table by using the pair of the received shared account and the shared password as an entry; and, when a matched entry is found, the terminal determines successful authentication, performs a login process, imparts an administrator right registered in the table corresponding to the successful authentication thereto, and permits access from the login origin administrator terminal <b>102</b>. However, in the login administration method by authentication using the shared account and the shared password, the logged-in user cannot be specified, and the log that, for example, who logged in and did what operations cannot be left. Moreover, file access authority and program execution authority are uniformly and similarly imparted to all the users who know the shared account, and administration troubles such as leakage of the administration authority and forgetting of passwords may occur. In order to solve such problems, as a conceivable login administration method, an authentication method (JP 2006-178897) which uses a shared account and user fingerprint information when imparting file access authority or program execution authority can be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, in such a conventional login administration method, when a network administrator is to log in to a plurality of devices present on a network to perform required administration processes, for example, maintenance, the plurality of network devices serving as login targets have to be checked, and a login operation has to be performed for each one of the network devices; thus, there is a problem that login to the plurality of network devices takes labor hours and time. More specifically, in the login administration method using the shared account and the user fingerprint information, as login operations, a login request operation specifying the address of a network device, an input operation of a shared password and a fingerprint input operation using a fingerprint sensor with respect to a login prompt sent from a login destination terminal in response to the login request operation have to be repeated; thus, the login operations take labor hours and time. Moreover, in the fingerprint input operation using the fingerprint sensor, if, for example, a stain is adhered on the sensor, fingerprint information cannot be correctly read/reproduced, authentication fails since it is not matched with the registered fingerprint information in an authentication table, and the fingerprint input has to be repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Furthermore, sometimes, when the number of times of authentication failure of fingerprint matching exceeds a predetermined threshold value, it is determined as unauthorized login so as to lock it. Thus, there is a problem that considerable labor hours and time is taken when login to a large number of network devices is to be performed at the same time.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an explanatory diagram of a computer network system to which an embodiment of a login administration method of the present invention is applied, wherein a simple system is used as an example in order to simplify explanation. In the computer network system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a login administration server <b>10</b>, an administrator terminal <b>12</b>, and network terminals <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>16</b>-<b>6</b> are disposed on a network, the administrator terminal <b>12</b> and the network terminals <b>16</b>-<b>5</b> and <b>16</b>-<b>6</b> are connected to a L<b>2</b> switch (layer <b>2</b> switch) <b>18</b>-<b>1</b>, the network terminals <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>16</b>-<b>4</b> are connected to a L<b>2</b> switch <b>18</b>-<b>2</b>, and the login administration server <b>10</b> is connected between the L<b>2</b> switch <b>18</b>-<b>1</b> and the L<b>2</b> switch <b>18</b>-<b>2</b>. The L<b>2</b> switch <b>18</b>-<b>1</b> is a line connector having a bridging function for accommodating twisted pair cables used in 10-BASE-T or 100B-BASE-TX, analyzes destination MAC addresses of received packets, and operates as a multi-port bridge which transmits the packets at a high speed merely to the ports that are connected to corresponding terminals. As a matter of course, the computer network system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an example. In practice, for example, L<b>2</b> switches, routers, hubs, and L<b>3</b> switches including L<b>2</b> switches with router functions are used to build a network, for example, which connects network terminal devices as many as several hundreds, connects to networks which are not only in a particular building or facility but also at other locations via WANs, and connects to the Internet via a proxy server. In such a computer network system, sometimes, maintenance operations are performed for the network terminals <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>16</b>-<b>6</b>, which are present on the network, by remote operations from the administrator terminal <b>12</b> during operation of the network; and, in this case, remote login is performed from the administrator terminal <b>12</b> to the network devices serving as targets. In the present embodiment, the login processing from the administrator terminal <b>12</b> to the network terminals <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>16</b>-<b>6</b> is performed via the login administration server <b>10</b>. For example, when login from the administrator terminal <b>12</b> to the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> is to be performed, the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> is specified as a login destination, and login is requested to the login administration server <b>10</b>. When a response is made to a login prompt which is transmitted in response to the login request from the login administration server <b>10</b> to the administrator terminal <b>12</b>, by inputting a login ID which is a shared account the administrator has and a fingerprint of her/his own by using a fingerprint sensor <b>14</b>, an authentication process based on the login ID from the administrator terminal <b>12</b> and the fingerprint information detected from the fingerprint sensor <b>14</b> is executed. When the authentication succeeds, the login administration server <b>10</b> requests login to the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> so as to log into it and permits the administrator terminal <b>12</b> to access it with an administrator authority based on the successful authentication. In this course, when other network terminals which are desired to be logged in at the same time as the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b>, for example, the network terminals <b>16</b>-<b>2</b> to <b>16</b>-<b>4</b> are registered in advance in the login administration server <b>10</b> side, login to the registered remaining network terminals <b>16</b>-<b>2</b> to <b>16</b>-<b>4</b> can be performed at the same time by a process in the login administration server <b>10</b> side merely by requesting login to the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> from the administrator terminal <b>12</b>. The administrator of the administrator terminal <b>12</b> can log into the network terminals <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>16</b>-<b>4</b>, which are grouped as simultaneous login permitted targets, at the same time merely by giving the login request to the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b>. In order to enable remote login from the administrator terminal <b>12</b> to the network terminals <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>16</b>-<b>6</b>, in the administrator terminal <b>12</b> and the network terminals <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>16</b>-<b>6</b> in the present embodiment, functions as Telnet terminals which perform communication processing by the TCP/IP Telnet protocol are implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a functional configuration block diagram of the login administration server <b>10</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in the login administration server <b>10</b>, a login request receiving unit <b>22</b>, a connection administration table <b>24</b>, a search engine unit <b>26</b> which functions as an authentication processing unit, an authentication table <b>28</b>, an association data table <b>30</b> which is a specific example of a data table, and a login request transmitting unit <b>32</b> are provided. On the other hand, in the administrator terminal <b>12</b> which functions as a first information processing apparatus connected to the login administration server <b>10</b> via a network <b>20</b> of Ethernet or the like, a login origin processing unit <b>36</b> and the fingerprint sensor <b>14</b> which inputs fingerprints of the administrator are provided. In each of the network terminals <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>16</b>-<b>6</b> which are connected via the network <b>20</b> and function as second information processing apparatuses, a login destination processing unit <b>38</b> having an authentication table <b>62</b> is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an explanatory diagram of the connection administration table <b>24</b> provided in the login administration server <b>10</b>. The connection administration table <b>24</b> is composed of entry Nos. and login substitute response terminals. In the present embodiment, corresponding to the entry Nos. <b>0</b> to <b>3</b>, the addresses of the network terminals <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>16</b>-<b>4</b> serving as the login substitute response terminals, for example, IP addresses bbbb, cccc, dddd, and eeee are registered. Meanwhile, since the network terminals <b>16</b>-<b>5</b> and <b>16</b>-<b>6</b> are not used as the login substitute response terminals, they are not registered in the connection administration table <b>24</b>. Note that the IP address of the administration terminal <b>12</b> serving as a login origin is assumed to be aaaa. When a login request including an IP address which is terminal information of a login destination is received from the administrator terminal <b>12</b> serving as a login origin terminal, the login request receiving unit <b>22</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> requests input of a login ID as a shared account and, in the present embodiment, fingerprint information as user biometric information to the login origin terminal and causes it to transmit them. Herein, the login request receiving unit <b>22</b> performs a search in the connection administration table <b>24</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> by using the address of the terminal of the login request destination as an entry, recognizes that the login destination is a substitute response terminal when a matched login substitute terminal is found, and transmits a login prompt to the administrator terminal <b>12</b> of the login origin so as to request input of the account ID as a shared account and user fingerprint information. The search engine unit <b>26</b> functions as a search processing unit; and, when the login request receiving unit <b>22</b> receives the login ID serving as a shared account and user fingerprint information from the administrator terminal <b>12</b>, the search engine unit performs a search in the authentication table <b>28</b> by using the login ID and the user fingerprint information as a key, determines successful authentication when an entry which matches the search key is found, and acquires association data including a right upon authentication and login-permitted terminals corresponding to the user of the matched entry from the association data table <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an explanatory diagram of the authentication table <b>28</b> provided in the login administration server <b>10</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the authentication table <b>28</b> is composed of entry Nos., login terminals, login IDs, and authentication information. In the present embodiment, the entry Nos. are eight entries of 0 to 7, the case in which the address &#x201c;bbbb&#x201d; of the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> is registered as the login terminals is employed as an example, and, also, the case in which two login IDs &#x201c;root&#x201d; and &#x201c;admin&#x201d; are registered is employed as an example. Furthermore, as the authentication information, fingerprint information of the user names &#x201c;koike&#x201d;, &#x201c;aoki&#x201d;, and &#x201c;tamura&#x201d; of three people is registered for the login ID &#x201c;root&#x201d;, and fingerprint information of the user names &#x201c;tamai&#x201d;, &#x201c;aoki&#x201d;, &#x201c;tamura&#x201d;, &#x201c;kinjoh&#x201d;, and &#x201c;saeki&#x201d; of five people is registered for the login ID &#x201c;admin&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an explanatory diagram of the association data table <b>30</b> provided in the login administration server <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The association data table <b>30</b> corresponds to the fingerprint information of the users registered as the authentication information of the authentication table <b>28</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and the corresponding association data is read from the association data table <b>30</b> by using the user to whom authentication using the authentication table <b>28</b> with respect to a login request is successful as a key. Therefore, in the association data table <b>30</b>, authentication user names, user rights upon authentication, login permitted terminals for each user name, and passwords corresponding to the login IDs which are the accounts of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are registered. As the authentication user names, the user names whose fingerprint information is registered as the authentication information in the authentication table <b>28</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are registered. As the user rights upon authentication, &#x201c;super user&#x201d; and &#x201c;user&#x201d; are registered in the present embodiment, wherein &#x201c;user&#x201d; is a normal access right, whereas &#x201c;super user&#x201d; is a special administrator right given to an administrator. Furthermore, as the passwords transmitted to the login terminals, &#x201c;root&#x201d; and &#x201c;admin&#x201d; which are the login IDs corresponding to the accounts of the authentication table <b>28</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are registered. Note that, instead of registering the passwords in the authentication table <b>28</b>, a process of using the login ID which is the account of an authenticated user as a password without modification may be incorporated to automatically generate the password. Herein, as the rights upon authentication, the user names &#x201c;koike&#x201d;, &#x201c;aoki&#x201d;, and &#x201c;tamai&#x201d; of three people are registered for the &#x201c;super user&#x201d;, and the user names &#x201c;tamai&#x201d;, &#x201c;aokin&#x201d;, &#x201c;tamura&#x201d;, &#x201c;kinjoh&#x201d;, and &#x201c;saeki&#x201d; are registered for the right &#x201c;user&#x201d; upon authentication. Among these, both &#x201c;super user&#x201d; and &#x201c;user&#x201d; are registered as the rights upon authentication for &#x201c;tamai&#x201d;; thus, the rights of &#x201c;super user&#x201d; and &#x201c;user&#x201d; are imparted to the authentication user name &#x201c;tamai&#x201d;. In the field of the login permitted terminals of the association table <b>30</b>, the terminal addresses of a plurality of terminals which can be logged in at the same time along with authentication of a login request to a particular terminal are registered. For example, for the users &#x201c;koike&#x201d; &#x201c;aoki&#x201d;, and &#x201c;tamai&#x201d; for whom &#x201c;super user&#x201d; is imparted as the right upon authentication, the terminal addresses &#x201c;bbbb&#x201d;, &#x201c;cccc&#x201d;, and &#x201c;dddd&#x201d; corresponding to the network terminals <b>16</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>16</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>16</b>-<b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are registered as the login permitted terminals. Table registration processes such as new registration, change, and deletion for such entries of the authentication table <b>28</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and the association data table <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> can be arbitrarily performed in accordance with needs by access to the login administration server <b>10</b>, for example, from the administrator terminal <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when authentication with respect to a login request from the administrator terminal <b>12</b> which is a login origin is successful, the login request transmitting unit <b>32</b> provided in the login administration server <b>10</b> transmits a login request to the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> which is a login destination, transmits a shared account and a password, or a user name, a shared account, and a password in response to an input request by a login prompt from the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> so as to log into it, and imparts the right obtained from the association data table <b>30</b> upon authentication to the administrator terminal <b>12</b>. Furthermore, if a login permitted terminal (third information processing apparatus) other than the login destination terminal which is the target of the login request is present among the login permitted terminals of the association data obtained from the association data table <b>30</b> upon authentication, the login request transmitting unit <b>32</b> similarly transmits a login request to the login permitted terminal, transmits a shared account and a password, or a user name, a shared account, and a password in response to a login prompt from the login destination so as to log into it, and similarly imparts the right obtained from the association data table <b>30</b> upon authentication to the administrator terminal <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> are explanatory diagrams of the authentication tables registered in the network terminals <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>16</b>-<b>6</b> which are to be logged in from the login request transmitting unit <b>32</b> provided in the login administration server <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>; wherein either an authentication table <b>62</b>-<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> or an authentication table <b>62</b>-<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> is used. In the authentication table <b>62</b>-<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the shared accounts and the passwords are registered. In a login process of the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> using the authentication table <b>62</b>-<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, a shared account and a password from the login authentication server <b>10</b> are transmitted, a search in the authentication table <b>62</b>-<b>1</b> is performed, and the authentication succeeds and login is achieved when a matched entry is found. In this case, since the user name is unknown in the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> side, the log that who did what access cannot be obtained; however, the account and the password that used a login prompt with respect to a login request can be input and transmitted, and there is a merit that a conventional terminal can be used without modification as the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> of the login destination. On the other hand, in the authentication table <b>62</b>-<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, user names are registered in addition to the shared accounts and the passwords. In a login process of the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> using the authentication table <b>62</b>-<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, a user name is further transmitted in addition a shared account and a password from the login authentication server <b>10</b>, a search is performed in the authentication table <b>62</b>-<b>2</b>, and the authentication succeeds and login is achieved when a matched entry is found. In this case, the log that who did what access can be obtained in the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> side since the user name is known. However, the user name has to be input and transmitted in addition to the account and the password in response to a login request; therefore, a new login prompt corresponding to them has to be prepared.</p>

<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref> are time charts of a login administration process according to the present embodiment, which employs, as an example, the case in which login is requested to the login administration server <b>10</b> by specifying the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> as a login destination by the administrator terminal <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>, in step S<b>1</b>, the administrator terminal <b>12</b> specifies the address &#x201c;bbbb&#x201d; of the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> and transmits a login request to the login administration server <b>10</b> according to the Telnet protocol. The login administration server <b>10</b> which has received the login request from the administrator terminal <b>12</b> returns a login prompt in step S<b>101</b> to request input of a login ID as a shared account and the fingerprint information of the user who uses the administrator terminal <b>12</b> for authentication confirmation. In response to this login prompt, in step S<b>2</b>, the administrator terminal <b>12</b> inputs the login ID the administrator knows as a shared account input by the administrator and the fingerprint information and transmits them to the login administration server <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A to 11D</figref> show the login prompt from the login administration server <b>10</b> to the administrator terminal <b>12</b> and the screens of the state in which the login ID and the fingerprint information with respect to that are input, wherein the case of a UNIX (R) computer is employed as an example.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> is a first login prompt <b>52</b>-<b>1</b> transmitted from the login administration server <b>10</b>, wherein &#x201c;login:&#x201d; is shown as a display <b>54</b> which urges input of a login ID which is a shared account. In response to this, when the administrator inputs &#x201c;root&#x201d; which is a login ID <b>56</b> serving as a shared account at the administrator terminal <b>12</b> by using a keyboard as shown in a login prompt <b>52</b>-<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, it is switched to a login prompt <b>52</b>-<b>3</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>, and &#x201c;Password:&#x201d; is displayed as a password request display <b>58</b>. Then, when the administrator inputs the fingerprint of the finger, which is determined in advance, for example, the index finger by the fingerprint sensor <b>14</b> provided on the administrator terminal <b>12</b>, fingerprint information <b>60</b> is input as shown in a login prompt <b>52</b>-<b>4</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</figref> and transmitted to the login administration server <b>10</b>. Herein, the fingerprint image of the administrator read by the fingerprint sensor <b>14</b> is information in which feature points of branch points and end points in the fingerprint image are extracted by a feature extraction process of the fingerprint image. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>, the login administration server <b>10</b> which has received the login ID and the fingerprint information from the administrator terminal <b>12</b> performs a search in the authentication table <b>28</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in step S<b>102</b> by using the address &#x201c;bbbb&#x201d; of the login terminal, the login ID &#x201c;root&#x201d;, which serves as a shared account, and the fingerprint information as a key. When an entry which matches the key is found by the search process, the login administration server <b>10</b> determines successful authentication in step S<b>103</b>, and requests login to the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> which is the login destination terminal in step S<b>104</b>. Meanwhile, if no matching entry is present in step S <b>103</b>, the login administration server <b>10</b> notifies the administrator terminal <b>12</b> of an error and disconnects the connection in step S<b>109</b>. Furthermore, when the login administration server <b>10</b> determines successful authentication in step S<b>103</b>, the user name can be recognized from the fingerprint information obtained by the matched entry of the authentication table, and the association data corresponding to the user name can be acquired from the association data table <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Herein, the login administration server <b>10</b> performs the search in the authentication table <b>28</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> by using the login ID &#x201c;root&#x201d; and the fingerprint information as a key. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the state that the login ID and the fingerprint information of an entry No. <b>2</b> of the authentication table <b>28</b> indicated by an arrow match the key is shown, wherein &#x201c;tamai&#x201d; can be acquired as the user name in this case. Therefore, when the address corresponding to the entry corresponding to the authentication table <b>28</b> in the association data table <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> (in this case, the fourth entry &#x201c;tamai&#x201d; from the top in the association data table <b>30</b>) is read according to the user name &#x201c;tamai&#x201d; obtained by the authentication, the association data indicated by an arrow can be acquired. The acquired association data has &#x201c;super user&#x201d; as the right upon successful authentication and includes three &#x201c;bbbb, cccc, dddd&#x201d; as the login permitted terminals. When the authentication is successful in step S<b>103</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>, the login administration server <b>10</b> requests login to the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> corresponding to the terminal address &#x201c;bbbb&#x201d; of the login destination by using the Telnet protocol in step S<b>104</b>. This authentication process performed when the login process from the login administration server <b>10</b> to the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> is performed is an authentication process using an account and a password if the authentication table <b>62</b>-<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> is registered in the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b>. If the authentication table <b>62</b>-<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> is registered in the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b>, it is an authentication process using a user name in addition to an account and a password. When the case in which the authentication table <b>62</b>-<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> is used herein is employed as an example, in step S<b>106</b>, the login administration server <b>10</b> requests login to the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> serving as a login destination. In response to this, the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> returns a login prompt in step S<b>201</b>, and requests input of a user name, a shared account, and a password. In response to this login prompt, in step S<b>105</b>, the login administration server <b>10</b> transmits the user name &#x201c;tamai&#x201d;, the shared account &#x201c;root&#x201d;, and the password &#x201c;root&#x201d;. As a login process of step S<b>202</b>, the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> performs a search in the authentication table <b>62</b>-<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> by using the user name, the shared account, and the password received from the login administration server <b>10</b> as a key, performs authentication/login by determining whether they match any entry (in this example, the entry indicated by the arrow of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> in the authentication table <b>62</b>-<b>2</b>, and notifies the login administration server <b>10</b> of the login completion. In step S<b>106</b>, in response to the login completion notice of the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b>, the login administration server <b>10</b> imparts the right obtained from the association data table when the authentication performed in step S<b>102</b> is successful, in this case, the right of &#x201c;super user&#x201d; to the administrator terminal <b>12</b>, and notifies the administrator terminal <b>12</b> of the login completion. Subsequently, the login administration server <b>10</b> checks whether other simultaneous login terminals are present in the association data or not in step S <b>107</b>. In this case, other than the address &#x201c;bbbb&#x201d; of the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> to which the login request is output, &#x201c;cccc&#x201d; and &#x201c;dddd&#x201d; corresponding to the network terminals <b>16</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>16</b>-<b>3</b> are present in the association data table; therefore, login processing is requested to another simultaneous login terminal, for example, the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>2</b> in step S<b>108</b>. In this case, the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>2</b> which has received the login request performs authentication by referencing the authentication table wherein the user name, the login ID serving as a shared account, and the password are used as a key as well as the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> in step <b>5301</b>; and, when the authentication is successful, the terminal imparts &#x201c;super user&#x201d; which is the right obtained from the association data in the login administration server <b>10</b> and notifies the administrator terminal <b>12</b> of the login completion. This point is also same for the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>3</b> of the terminal address &#x201c;dddd&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref> are flow charts of the login administration process according to the present embodiment, and it will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref>, in the login administration process, in step S<b>1</b>, the login request receiving unit <b>22</b> checks whether there is a login request or not to any login substitution destination terminal administered by the connection administration table <b>24</b>. When there is a login request from the administrator terminal <b>12</b>, the login request receiving unit <b>22</b> of the login administration server transmits a login prompt to the administrator terminal <b>12</b> which is the login origin and requests input of a login ID serving as a shared account and the fingerprint information of the user in step S<b>2</b>. When an input response from the administrator terminal <b>12</b> with respect to the login prompt is determined in step S<b>3</b>, the search engine unit <b>26</b> in the login administration server performs a search in the authentication table <b>28</b> by using the login ID serving as a shared account and the fingerprint information for the login destination terminal as a key in step S<b>4</b>. In the search of the authentication table <b>28</b>, when an entry which matches the login ID received from the administrator terminal is determined in step S<b>5</b>, the authentication succeeds; and, in step S<b>6</b>, the search engine unit <b>26</b> in the login administration server reads association data from the association data table <b>30</b> according to the address of the matched entry in the authentication table <b>62</b> and notifies the login request transmitting unit <b>32</b> of that. If the authentication does not succeed in step S<b>5</b>, a message about the authentication failure is sent to the administrator terminal which has output the login request, and the connection is disconnected in step S<b>15</b>. When the association data is read in step S<b>6</b>, the login request transmitting unit <b>32</b> of the login administration server requests login to the terminal of the login destination, for example, to the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> in step S<b>7</b>. When the login request transmitting unit <b>32</b> of the login administration server receives a login prompt from the terminal of the login destination (network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b>) in step S<b>8</b>, the transmitting unit inputs and transmits the login ID serving as the shared account and the password in response to the login prompt in the case of the authentication table <b>62</b>-<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> or inputs and transmits the user name in addition to the login ID serving as the shared account and the password in the case of the authentication table <b>62</b>-<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> in step S<b>9</b>. Consequently, authentication according to the login ID and the password is performed in the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> of the login destination; and, when the authentication succeeds, login is achieved, and the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> returns a login completion response to the login administration server. Then, when the login request transmitting unit <b>32</b> of the login administration server determines the login completion response from the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> of the login destination in step S<b>10</b>, the right upon authentication success obtained from the association data is imparted to the administrator terminal which requested the login, and a response about login completion is made to the administrator terminal <b>12</b> which is the login origin in step S<b>11</b>. Subsequently, the login request transmitting unit <b>32</b> of the login administration server checks whether login processes for all the simultaneous login permitted terminals are finished or not according to the association data in step S<b>12</b>. If they are unprocessed, the process returns to step S<b>7</b>, and the process of requesting login to a next simultaneous login permitted terminal and imparting the right upon authentication to the administrator terminal is repeated. When the login processes of all the simultaneous login permitted terminals of the association data are finished, the process proceeds to step S<b>13</b>, in which whether a logoff is requested from the administrator terminal or not is monitored/determined. When logoff with respect to the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> to which the login has been requested is requested from the administrator terminal <b>12</b> in this state, the process proceeds to step S<b>14</b>, in which the login request transmitting unit <b>32</b> of the login administration server requests logoff to the simultaneous login permitted terminals including the network terminal <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> to which logoff is requested, and the process is terminated. The present embodiment also provides the login administration program executed by the login administration server <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and the program has the contents shown in the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref>. The present embodiment also provides a computer readable recording medium storing the program of the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref>. Examples of the recording medium include portable storage mediums such as a CD-ROM, a floppy disk (R), a DVD disk, a magneto-optical disk, and an IC card; storage devices such as a hard disk provided inside/outside a computer system; a database or another computer system and a database thereof which retains the program via a line; and a transmission medium on a line.
