<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a mould system according to the preamble of claim <b>1</b> for changing the depth of a cardboard-based container, wherein the mould system includes a movable mould half and a stationary mould half, which mould halves are located opposite to each other; and the mould system can be used to manufacture a container that comprises a bottom, which is pressed from a cardboard blank, walls that are connected to the bottom and a (plastic) rim that is at least partly moulded from plastic and connected to the upper edge of the walls, encircling the walls.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In food industry, in particular, so-called tray packages are used as storage packages, consisting of lidded containers that have a bottom, walls that encircle the bottom and extend upwards, and a rim that encircles the upper edge of the walls and extends outwards. The container is closed with a lid that is connected to the rim. In such containers, the material of the container bottom and walls often comprise cardboard, on top of which plastic and/or metal layers may be added, which change the steam and/or oxygen transmission properties of the cardboard depending on the application.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Generally, such a so-called tray package is used for storing foodstuffs, whereby it is closed hermetically by the lid. To be able to attach the lid to the package, the edge of the container that is used as tray package must be provided with a horizontal rim, which protrudes from the upper end of the side walls and encircles the package. On the upper surface of the rim, there is usually a suitable coating by means of which the lid can be fastened tightly to the package. For example, it is very common to use heat-sealable plastic materials for fastening the lid part to the package. As examples of food packages and packaging materials used therein, among others, the patent specifications WO-03/033258, EP-1289856, WO-00/21854 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,425,973 could be mentioned.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such a container with the shape of a tray, comprising a bottom pressed from a cardboard blank, walls that are connected to the bottom and a rim, that is at least partly cast of plastic and connected to the upper edge of the walls, encircling the walls can be formed by various methods. The published application FI 20070973 describes a manufacturing method of a tray package, wherein the container is formed from a straight cardboard blank by pressing to shape in a mould system which includes a movable mould half and a stationary mould half, which are located opposite to each other, whereby the mould part that is movable with respect to the stationary mould part includes at least a core plate provided with a core, a plate-like seal ring, which is movable with respect to the core and has a seal surface and surrounds the core, and a collar ring, which can be moved with respect to the core and the seal ring and is fitted between the same, and which can be used to form the rim on the container; and the stationary mould half includes at least a mould plate provided with a mould cavity and a seal surface.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A cardboard blank that is pressed to shape by such a mould system is brought on top of the mould cavity of the stationary mould half, the core of the movable mould half settles into the mould cavity, and the cardboard blank remaining between the core and the mould cavity is moulded into a container with the shape of a tray. At the end stage of the compression moulding, a rim of plastic material extending sideways is moulded to the upper part of the side walls of the package, when the mould is kept closed in such a way that a mould cavity corresponding to the rim is formed by moving a counter surface inside the mould system backwards from a surface opposite to it, after which the casting material is introduced into the mould cavity. In the cavity, the material solidifies into a fixed rim, after which the mould is opened and the finished container-shape package is removed from the mould.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">With the prior art above as basis, the object of the applicant was to provide a more versatile manufacturing method of tray packages, wherein the same mould system could be used to manufacture various containers, which are used as tray packages and provided with one or more partitions or wherein the cardboard-based body of the container could be provided with various embossed or inlaid shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Surprisingly, it has now been observed that by modifying the mould cavity and/or the (forming) core of the mould system described above by various inserts that are placed in the mould cavity and/or attachments that are detachably placed in the forming core, or cores, which are detachably attached to the core plate and the length of which can be changed, the depth of the container that is manufactured can be modified as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To be more precise, the invention relates to a mould system according to claim <b>1</b> for changing the depth of a cardboard-based container. Such a mould system includes a movable mould half and a stationary mould half, which are located opposite to each other; the mould system can be used to manufacture a container which comprises a bottom that is pressed from a cardboard blank, walls that are connected to the bottom and a rim that is at least partly cast of plastic and connected to the upper part of the walls, encircling the walls, whereby the mould that is movable with respect to the stationary mould includes at least a core plate provided with a core, a plate-like seal ring that is movable with respect to the core and comprises a seal surface and surrounds the core, and a collar ring, which can be fitted between the core and the seal ring and which can be used to form the rim on the container and which can be moved with respect to both the seal ring and the core; and the stationary mould part includes at least a mould plate provided with a mould cavity and a seal surface. In the mould system, an insert can be supported on and detachably attached to the base of the mould cavity, reducing the depth of the mould cavity by its height h, so that the continuous surface of the insert works as a new bottom of the mould cavity and that the length H of the core part that penetrates inside the mould cavity at the pressing stage of the cardboard blank can be shortened, respectively, by the height h of the insert either by replacing the core in the core plate with a shorter one or by detachably attaching to the basic part of the core, the length of which does not change, an attachment the length of which can be changed, whereby the core or attachments of the core and the inserts of the base of the mould cavity, which correspond to each other can be used to change the depth of the cardboard blank that is being manufactured, i.e., the distance of the container bottom, which is pressed from the cardboard blank, from the upper edges of the walls.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an embodiment of the invention, the insert that is attached to the base of the mould cavity can be used to form a one or two-sided inlay or embossing on the cardboard-based body of the container.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The base herein refers to the plane of the mould cavity, by which a container can be made, the depth of which, i.e., the distance of the bottom from the rim is the greatest.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In this context, the longitudinal direction of the insert of the mould cavity and the longitudinal direction of the core refer to a dimension perpendicular to the bottom of the formed container, which is also the depth direction of the container thus formed.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The one-sided inlaid of embossed patterns or shapes of the body refer to the recesses or bulges that are formed on one surface of the body only. The two-sided inlaid or embossed patterns or shapes of the body refer to the recesses or bulges that go through the body that is pressed from cardboard, whereby a recess on one side of the body always corresponds to a bulge of a similar size and shape on the opposite side of the body.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the method according to the invention, the cardboard blank is pressed between the (forming) core and the bottom of the mould cavity to make the container bottom and the walls that encircle the bottom, whereafter a flange-like rim that at least partly consists of plastic and encircles the walls is formed on the upper edges of the walls by casting. The insert, which is attached to the bottom of the mould cavity, and the core, which is attached to the core plate and the length of which changes, or the attachment the length of which changes and which is connected to the basic part of the core that does not change its length, are used to change the distance of the container bottom, which is pressed from the cardboard blank, from the upper edges of the container walls.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Using a corresponding method, one or two-sided inlaid or embossed patterns can be formed on the cardboard-based body of the container.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The invention is based on the fact that the length of the forming core on the core plate is changed, or an attachment, the length of which changes, is added onto the basic part of the forming core, the length of which does not change, and simultaneously, a detachable insert, the length of which can be changed, is added onto the base of the mould cavity. Thus, the inserts or the attachment of the core can either be used to increase or decrease the depth of the container, i.e., the distance of the bottom from the rim. If the depth of the container that is made is to be decreased, an insert that reduces the depth of the mould cavity is attached to the base of the mould cavity and, at the same time, the forming core is shortened by reducing the length of the attachment that is connected to the end of the core basic part, to an extent that corresponds to the decrease in depth of the mould cavity. In this way, the surface area of the tray bottom can be kept as before regardless of the changes in the depth of the tray.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The patent specification US 2007/0267374, FIGS. 161-163, discloses baffle plates that are placed in the mould cavity and connected to the walls of the mould cavity, however, these baffle plates are mainly used for positioning the container that is made into the mould cavity and not to adjust the depth of the container, which is why they differ as to both their structure and their function from the inserts placed in the mould cavity of the mould system according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Furthermore, the manufacturing method described in the patent specification mentioned above cannot provide the cardboard-based containers with wide plastic rims as, contrary to the invention, the casting cavity therein is already formed during the moulding of the blank, whereby the retention of the edges of the cardboard, which ensures an even creasing, stops too early. In the invention, the cardboard blank is retained between the seal surface of the seal ring and the seal surface of the collar ring and the seal surface of the mould plate opposite to them at least until the cardboard blank has slid into the mould cavity, and the casting cavity is not made in the mould system until after this by pulling the collar ring backwards, i.e., moving it away from the stationary front mould to provide the flange-like rim that at least partly consists of plastic and encircles the walls of the container.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an embodiment of the invention, the insert, which are provided with bulges and inlays of the surface and connected to the mould cavity or the forming core, correspondingly mould the cardboard blank when the forming core is pressed to the bottom of the mould cavity at the forming stage of the body.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">By using the detachable inserts and attachments, the shape and dimensions of the container body that is manufactured can be changed considerably quicker than by replacing the entire core plate or mould plate with a new core plate mould plate. In this way, the mould system becomes modular and changes are easy and simple to make without changing the operation of the entire mould system.</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an exploded view of the main parts of the mould system according to the invention as viewed from the side and in cross section. The mould system <b>1</b> includes a movable mould half <b>10</b> or &#x201c;rear mould&#x201d; and a stationary mould half <b>20</b> or &#x201c;front mould&#x201d;. The main parts of the movable mould half <b>10</b> comprise and ejection part <b>30</b> that comprises and ejection bar <b>31</b> and the two-piece body <b>3</b> of the ejection part, which comprises, between the parts <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the body, a pneumatic actuator <b>33</b> for providing compression between the moulds halves <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>. The movable mould half <b>10</b> further includes a plate-like seal ring <b>5</b>, a plate-like collar ring <b>6</b> and a core plate <b>4</b>, to which a (forming) core <b>41</b> is attached. The stationary mould half <b>20</b> includes a mould plate <b>7</b>, which comprises a mould cavity <b>71</b> against which the planar cardboard blank is shaped and which determines the general shape of the package (bottom, shape of side walls extending from bottom, inclination of walls, roundings etc.) The cardboard blank herein refers to a cardboard blank or a cardboard-based blank, wherein the cardboard is possibly coated with layers of plastic or metal to change its barrier properties. Furthermore, the stationary mould half <b>20</b> includes a mould frame <b>8</b>, through which casting conduits are conveyed to the casting spot of the rim in a manner better shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The seal ring <b>5</b> is located annularly around the forming core <b>41</b>. A collar ring <b>6</b>, which is movable in the depth direction with respect to the seal ring <b>5</b> and the forming core <b>41</b>, can be arranged between the seal ring <b>5</b> and the forming core <b>41</b>. The depth direction herein refers to a direction perpendicular to the surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the core plate <b>4</b>. The seal ring <b>5</b> comprises a seal surface <b>5</b><i>a</i>, which becomes flush with the face <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the moulding part of the core <b>41</b> at the end of the pressing stage. The face of the moulding part refers to the part of the core <b>41</b>, which comes to the plane of the rim of the formed container, i.e., about to the plane of the seal surface <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the mould plate <b>7</b> and, at the same time, to the plane of the upper edge of the mould cavity <b>71</b>. The moulding part of the forming core <b>41</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is the part of the core <b>41</b>, which can be fitted into the mould cavity <b>71</b>. The moulding part of the forming core <b>4</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and the corresponding mould cavity <b>71</b> have cross-sectional profiles of the shape of a rounded rectangle, whereby they can provide, correspondingly, a container that has a cross section of a rounded rectangle, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, for example. The cross-sectional profiles of the mould cavity, forming core and container refer to the cross sections as examined in the depth direction of the mould system <b>1</b>, i.e., perpendicular to the surface plane of the mould plate <b>7</b> and the core plate <b>4</b>. If the cross-sectional profiles of the moulding part of the forming core and the mould cavity are changed, e.g., into the form of a circle, containers with a circular cross section are obtained respectively, as shown, e.g., in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The seal surface <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the seal ring <b>5</b> is opposite to the corresponding seal surface <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the mould plate <b>7</b> that surrounds the mould cavity <b>71</b> of the front mould <b>20</b>.

<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3B</figref> show a cross-sectional side view of the mould system <b>1</b> according to the invention, its mould halves being the same as those described above by means of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B. The mould system <b>1</b> is used for forming the tray package, starting from pressing the package and ending in casting the rim. The mould system <b>1</b> comprises a mould for compression moulding and casting, which is formed from two mould halves <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> and the purpose of which is, at a first stage, to mould a container-shape tray package from an essentially straight and uniform cardboard blank K. A casting function is also integrated into the mould system <b>1</b> for casting a rim <b>50</b> on the edges of the walls of the package <b>500</b> that is shaped by compression.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When the seal surface <b>61</b><i>a </i>of the collar <b>61</b> of the collar ring <b>6</b>, i.e., the face <b>61</b><i>a </i>that is turned to the stationary mould half <b>20</b> is flush with the seal surface <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the seal ring <b>5</b>, a common seal surface is formed by the seal surface <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the seal ring and the face of the seal surface <b>61</b> of the collar <b>61</b>. When the mould is closed (the mould halves <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> are brought together) according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B-3D</figref>, the seal surface <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the mould plate <b>7</b> of the stationary mould half <b>20</b> and the common seal surface <b>5</b><i>a</i>, <b>61</b><i>a </i>of the movable mould half <b>10</b> come against each other so that the cardboard blank K to be shaped remains between them. The pneumatic actuator <b>33</b> between the parts <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the body <b>3</b> of the ejection part <b>30</b> is connected to the collar ring <b>6</b> and it pressurizes, through the collar ring <b>6</b>, the seal ring <b>5</b> and, thus, the common seal surface <b>5</b><i>a</i>, <b>61</b><i>a </i>of the movable mould half <b>10</b> to provide a holding force between the mould halves <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>, i.e., between the common seal surface <b>5</b><i>a</i>, <b>61</b><i>a </i>and the seal surface <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the stationary mould half. The main part of the compression or holding force exerted on the seal surface <b>7</b><i>a </i>and, besides, on the cardboard blank K between the seal surfaces, is generated by the seal surface <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the seal ring <b>5</b>, but the seal surface <b>61</b><i>a </i>of the collar <b>61</b> of the collar ring also exerts holding force on the cardboard blank K. The holding force can be adjusted by means of the actuator <b>33</b>, such as a compressed air cylinder that works on a pressure medium. The collar ring <b>6</b> is located inside the ejection part <b>3</b> between the seal ring <b>5</b> and the core <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The two-piece body <b>3</b> of the ejection part <b>30</b> and the core plate <b>4</b> that comprises the core <b>41</b> can be moved by the ejection bar <b>31</b> in the depth direction with respect to the stationary mould half <b>20</b>, whereby the depth direction means the same as above. The movable mould half <b>10</b> thus moves between a front position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) and a rear position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B-3D</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">At the compression stage, the movable mould half <b>10</b> in the mould system presses the cardboard blank K into the mould cavity <b>71</b> of the mould plate <b>7</b> of the stationary mould half <b>20</b>. For this, the movable mould half comprises the forming core <b>41</b> that is located on the core plate <b>4</b>, its forming part fitting into the above-mentioned mould cavity <b>71</b> up to the face <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the core, so that the cardboard blank is pressed between the core <b>41</b> and the cavity <b>71</b>, obtaining its tray shape. The movable mould half <b>10</b> is arranged to move with respect to the stationary mould to close and open the mould by arrangements that are not described herein in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows the mould system <b>1</b> before closing the mould. The cardboard blank K is brought by a robot to the small holders (not shown) on the mould plate <b>7</b> of the stationary mould half <b>20</b>. After this, the mould is closed, i.e., the core <b>41</b> settles into the mould cavity <b>71</b> and the cardboard blank K remaining between them is pressed into a tray-shape container.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The stage, at which the core <b>41</b> begins to shape the blank after settling into the cavity <b>71</b>, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. The seal surfaces, i.e., the seal surface <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the seal ring and the seal surface <b>61</b><i>a </i>of the collar ring lean on the cardboard blank K by the force of the actuator <b>33</b> and retain the blank K at its edges and the compression stage between the said seal surfaces <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>61</b><i>a </i>and the seal surface <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the mould plate <b>7</b> of the stationary mould half.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> shows a situation, where the mould is fully closed, the mould halves <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> being pressed against each other and the cardboard blank K between them being pressed into a tray, so that the upper edge of the side walls of the tray is flush with the seal surface <b>61</b><i>a </i>of the collar ring <b>6</b> or slightly in front of it. The last holding force on the edges of the blank is caused by the face <b>61</b><i>a </i>of the collar <b>61</b> of the collar ring <b>6</b>, against which there is the seal surface <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the mould plate that surrounds the cavity <b>71</b> of the stationary mould half.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> shows a situation, where the mould is still closed, but the collar ring <b>6</b> has moved a short distance, backwards from the seal surfaces <b>71</b><i>a </i>of the stationary mould half <b>20</b>, i.e., in the direction of the ejection part <b>3</b> of the movable mould half <b>10</b>. The movement is provided by an actuator performing precise movements, e.g., by pulling the ejection bar <b>31</b> by an ejection motor. A small casting cavity <b>43</b> then remains between the seal surface <b>7</b><i>a </i>that surrounds the cavity <b>71</b>, the seal surface <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the seal ring <b>5</b>, the face <b>61</b><i>a </i>of the collar <b>61</b> of the collar ring <b>6</b> and the face <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the core <b>41</b>, the casting cavity being in contact with the outer edge of the tray and encircling the tray annularly. When the molten plastic material is fed into this casting cavity <b>43</b>, it forms a flange-like rim that extends outwards from the side walls of the tray. Due to its shape, the collar ring <b>6</b> is tightened against the forming core <b>41</b> to ensure the tightness of the casting cavity <b>43</b>. The injection channel of the casting material is arranged through the mould frame <b>8</b> of the stationary mould half <b>20</b> and the plastic to be cast moves through there to the casting cavity <b>43</b>. The injection channels can also be arranged to arrive in the injection cavity in another manner, depending on the structure of the container that is shaped.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">After the molten plastic material has solidified in the casting cavity <b>43</b>, the mould can be opened to its open position again. The ejection part <b>3</b> is then still in the rear position. When the ejection part <b>3</b> is pushed by the ejection rod <b>31</b> to the front position, it removes the finished container from the movable mould half <b>10</b> and, at the same time, the collar ring <b>6</b> can be moved to the front position again, i.e., the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is reassumed. The seal surface <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the mould plate <b>7</b> of the front mould <b>20</b> then works as ejection surface, against which the ejection bar <b>31</b> pushes, when the finished container is removed from the mould. After this, the robot takes the finished container out and replaces it with a new blank K, after which the working phases are repeated as above.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">By using as mould cavity, a cavity suitable for a container with a round bottom, and by adapting the shape of the moulding part of the forming core so as to suit the shape of the mould cavity in question, the mould system described above can be used to make, e.g., the container <b>500</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, comprising a body <b>58</b> that is compression-moulded from cardboard blank and includes a round bottom <b>57</b> and upward extending walls <b>59</b> that are connected to the bottom <b>57</b>. A flange-like plastic rim <b>50</b> extending outwards is cast to the upper edge of the walls <b>59</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">When the container shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> is to be shaped by forming two-sided decorative or functional embossed or inlaid shapes to its body <b>58</b>, which is pressed from cardboard blank, i.e., the bottom <b>57</b> or walls <b>59</b>, this can be carried out by changing the forming core used in the mould system according to the invention and the corresponding mould cavity <b>71</b>, according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows schematically the forming core <b>41</b>, which is attached, to the core plate <b>4</b> and consists of two parts; a basic part <b>41</b><i>f</i>, the length of which remains unchanged and which is attached to the core plate <b>4</b> of the forming core, and an attachment part <b>41</b><i>g </i>of the core, the length of which can be changed and which is attached to the said basic part. A projection <b>410</b> is connected to the outer edge <b>411</b><i>b </i>of the attachment part <b>41</b><i>g</i>, which at the same time works as the outer edge <b>41</b><i>b </i>of the core, the projection being used as an insert and directed downwards from the plane of the outer edge of the core, i.e., perpendicular to the direction of the plane of the seal surface <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the mould plate <b>7</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> also shows the collar ring <b>6</b>, which is located below the core plate <b>4</b> and surrounds the forming core <b>41</b>. The attachment part <b>41</b><i>g </i>of the core <b>41</b> can be connected to the basic part <b>41</b><i>f </i>of the core at a desired spot but, generally, it is most preferable to form the core <b>41</b> so that the attachment part <b>41</b><i>f </i>constitutes the forming part of the core, i.e., the part that is fitted into the mould cavity <b>71</b>, when the cardboard blank K is pressed to shape in the manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref>. The face <b>411</b><i>a </i>of the attachment then functions as the face <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the core and it will be flush with the seal surface <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the mould plate <b>7</b> or slightly above the same in the direction of the movable-mould half <b>10</b>, when the core <b>41</b> is pressed into the mould cavity <b>71</b>. The attachment part <b>41</b><i>g </i>of the core <b>41</b> is connected to the basic part <b>41</b><i>f </i>of the core by an appropriate fastening, such as a screw fastening. As the joint between the basic part <b>41</b><i>f </i>and the attachment part <b>41</b><i>g </i>of the core is not copied to the plastic rim of the container that is made, the mutual fastening of the attachment part <b>41</b><i>g </i>of the core and the basic part <b>41</b><i>f </i>of the core can also be implemented by other fastening methods that are known by those skilled in the art. In the pair of forming core and mould cavity according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a recess <b>710</b> that corresponds to the projection <b>410</b> of the attachment part <b>41</b><i>g </i>of the core is now formed on the base <b>71</b><i>b </i>of the mould cavity <b>71</b> of the mould plate <b>7</b>. In this case, the insert of the mould cavity <b>71</b> is, in fact, an insert, which is removed from the flat base <b>71</b><i>b </i>of the mould cavity and which can be reconnected to the bottom <b>71</b><i>b</i>, when a mould system according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is to be formed, wherein the bottom <b>71</b><i>b </i>of the mould cavity <b>71</b> is flat and by which one-sided shapes are created to the body <b>58</b> of the container part that is formed from the cardboard blank. When the pair of forming core and mould cavity according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is used in the manufacture of the container <b>500</b> in the manner illustrated earlier by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the projection <b>410</b> of the core attachment part <b>41</b><i>g </i>is pressed to the bottom <b>71</b><i>b </i>of the mould cavity <b>71</b> at the compression stage, i.e., in the work phase shown above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3C</figref>. In that case, the projection <b>410</b> pushes the cardboard blank that lies between the forming core <b>41</b> and the mould cavity <b>71</b> towards the recess <b>710</b>, which is on the bottom <b>71</b><i>b </i>of the mould cavity <b>71</b>, has a slightly larger bottom area than the said projection and the same shape as the projection. Thus, the inner recess of the container is copied to the inner surface of the bottom <b>57</b> of the container <b>500</b> that is made; and a corresponding bulge that extends downwards from the rest of the bottom outer surface is copied to the outer surface of the bottom.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The forming core <b>41</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and the mould cavity <b>71</b> opposite to it differ from the forming core according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and the moulding cavity opposite the same only in that the bottom of the mould cavity <b>71</b><i>b </i>is now even. The base is either not provided with the insert <b>710</b> that deepens the base, or the detachable insert <b>710</b> of the base of the mould cavity is re-attached to the base. When the pair of forming core and mould cavity according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is used in the manufacture of the container <b>500</b>, the projection <b>410</b> of the core attachment part <b>41</b><i>g </i>is pressed to the bottom <b>71</b><i>b </i>of the mould cavity <b>71</b> at the compression stage and the projection <b>410</b> pushes the cardboard blank K that is between the forming core <b>41</b> and the moulding cavity <b>71</b> towards the even bottom <b>71</b><i>b </i>of the mould cavity <b>71</b> in the manner illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3B</figref>. The recess is copied only to the inner surface of the bottom <b>57</b> of the container <b>500</b> that is made and the outer surface of the bottom <b>71</b><i>b </i>remains flat.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an embodiment of the invention which changes the depth of the container <b>500</b> that is pressed form the cardboard blank, i.e., the distance of the container bottom from the upper edge of its walls by arranging on the base <b>71</b><i>b </i>of the mould cavity <b>71</b>, a detachable insert <b>720</b> that reduces the depth of the mould cavity <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the mould plate <b>7</b>, wherein the detachable insert <b>720</b> is attached on top of the base of the mould cavity <b>71</b>. The upper edge of the mould cavity, i.e., the upper surface (seal surface) of the mould plate <b>7</b> is at the height H from the plane defined by the base <b>71</b><i>b</i>, which is also the greatest depth of the mould cavity. The bottom of the insert <b>720</b> is supported on the base <b>71</b><i>b</i>. When a new insert (spacer) is added onto the base <b>71</b><i>b </i>of the mould cavity, its height being h, the upper surface <b>71</b><i>b </i>of the insert <b>720</b> works as the new bottom <b>71</b><i>b </i>of the mould cavity. The bottom of the insert <b>720</b> is supported to the base <b>71</b><i>b</i>. When a new insert (spacer) is added onto the base <b>71</b><i>b </i>of the mould cavity, its height being h, the upper surface <b>71</b><i>b </i>of the insert <b>720</b> works as the new bottom <b>71</b><i>b </i>of the mould cavity, thus reducing the depth of the mould cavity from the depth H into a new depth H-h. The shape of the insert in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> enables it to be fitted tightly onto the base of the mould cavity, filling completely the space defined by the base <b>71</b><i>b </i>and the walls <b>71</b><i>a </i>in the lower part of the mould cavity <b>71</b>, up to the height h of the mould cavity from the plane defined by the base. The upper surface <b>71</b><i>b </i>of the insert is continuous and planar, whereby it can be used as the new bottom of the mould cavity. The continuous upper surface of the insert could also have a downwards concave or upwards convex shape, if this were appropriate regarding the shape of the bottom <b>57</b> of the intended container.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">When the depth of the mould cavity <b>71</b> is reduced by the insert <b>720</b>, so that the new depth of the mould cavity <b>71</b> is H-h, the length of the core attachment part <b>41</b><i>g</i>, which is connected to the end of the basic part <b>41</b>; <b>41</b><i>f </i>of the core, which does not change its length, is reduced by the height h of the insert <b>720</b> that is placed on the bottom of the mould cavity <b>71</b>. Then, the length of the forming part of the core, which penetrates inside the mould cavity at the compression stage of the cardboard according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, is H-h.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Then, the core consists of the basic part <b>41</b>; <b>41</b><i>f </i>and the attachment part <b>41</b><i>g </i>that can be connected on top of the basic part. In this way, the length of the forming part of the core can be changed by correspondingly changing, with respect to each other, the length of the core basic part <b>41</b><i>f </i>that does not change its length and the length of the core attachment part <b>41</b><i>g </i>that changes its length and is connected on top of the basic part of the core. In this way, the surface area of the tray bottom among others, can be kept as before regardless of the changes in the depth of the tray.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The insert <b>720</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, which is attached at the bottom <b>71</b><i>b </i>of the mould cavity <b>71</b>, is connected detachably to the bottom <b>57</b> of the mould cavity by means of a magnet system S containing a permanent magnet M. Other detachable fastening methods, such as a screw fastening, can also be used. In the magnet system S, an insulation E that surrounds the permanent magnet M and the magnetizable insert <b>720</b> is formed in the mould cavity <b>71</b>. Alternatively, the magnet system S can be insulated by non-magnetizable insulation pieces that surround the same, whereby the insert <b>720</b>, in turn, can be coated with a non-magnetizable coating on surfaces other than the one directed towards the magnet system S. This solution provides the advantage that the magnetic field of the magnetizable insert does not impede the operation of the mould, when it is coated with the non-magnetizable coating on sides other than the one turned to the magnet.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The magnet system S consists of a magnetizable metal, herein two iron sheets Me<b>1</b>, which are on both sides of a non-magnetic metal (Me<b>2</b>), and a permanent magnet rod M with a round cross sectional profile, which is fitted into an opening in the non-magnetizable metal sheet Me<b>2</b>, such as aluminium. When the magnet M is turned in the opening, the magnetic field generated by it changes. When the magnet is turned so that the magnetic field moves in the direction of the iron sheets Me<b>1</b>, they prevent the action of the magnet and the magnetic field does not move through the insert <b>720</b>. The magnet is then in the off position. When the permanent magnet rod M is turned in the opposite direction, the magnetic field moves towards the iron sheets Me<b>1</b> through the non-magnetic metal Me<b>2</b>, whereby the iron sheets Me<b>1</b> enhance the magnetic field and the magnet is in the on position. By turning the permanent magnet rod in the opening that is in the non-magnetic metal Me<b>2</b>, so that the magnetic field is in the off position, the insert <b>720</b> can be quickly replaced with another. By turning the magnet back to the on position, the insert <b>720</b> can be attached to the bottom <b>71</b><i>b </i>of the mould cavity <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Only a few embodiments of the invention are described above and it is obvious to those skilled in the art that the invention can be implemented in various other ways within the scope of the invention disclosed in the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Accordingly, the permanent magnets can also be used without the insulation of the mould cavity, if the insert placed on the base of the mould cavity and, thus, also the permanent magnet are relatively small.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Thus, in the embodiments of the invention according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the entire core <b>41</b> that is on the core plate <b>4</b> can be replaced. In that case, the projection <b>410</b> of the core <b>41</b>, which is used as insert in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, is attached to the outer edge <b>41</b><i>b </i>of the actual forming core <b>41</b>. Similarly, even though in the embodiment of the invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the attachment part <b>41</b><i>g </i>of the core <b>41</b> is provided with the projection <b>410</b> and the bottom <b>71</b><i>b </i>of the mould cavity <b>71</b> is provided with the recess <b>710</b> that corresponds to the said projection <b>410</b>, the same end result is obtained by providing the bottom <b>71</b><i>b </i>of the mould cavity <b>71</b> with an upwards extending projection and the outer edge <b>411</b><i>b </i>of the attachment part <b>41</b><i>g </i>of the mould core <b>41</b> with a corresponding recess. The length of the core <b>41</b> that is replaced in the core plate in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, is adapted to the changes in the depth of the mould cavity, so that the length of the core part that penetrates inside the mould cavity at the compression stage of the cardboard blank is the same as the depth H-h of the mould cavity provided with the insert.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The walls <b>59</b> of the container <b>500</b> can also be provided with various functional or decorative, one or two-sided embossed or inlaid shapes. In that case, the bulges and recesses are placed on the walls of the core <b>41</b> or its attachment part <b>41</b><i>g </i>and/or on the walls <b>71</b><i>a </i>of the mould cavity instead of the outer end of the core and the bottom <b>71</b><i>b </i>of the moulding cavity.</p>
