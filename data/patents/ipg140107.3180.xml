<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a top gate thin film transistor (top gate type thin film transistor) that uses an oxide semiconductor for a semiconductor layer, and a display apparatus including the top gate thin film transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thin film transistors (TFTs) that use amorphous silicon or low-temperature polysilicon for a semiconductor layer are widely used in a drive circuit in display apparatuses such as active matrix liquid crystal display devices and organic electroluminescence (EL) display devices. However, the manufacture of those TFTs requires a high temperature process, and hence it is difficult to employ a flexible substrate such as a plastic substrate or a film substrate which is low in heat resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Meanwhile, in recent years, the development of TFTs that use, for a semiconductor layer, an oxide semiconductor having ZnO as a main component has recently become active. This oxide semiconductor can be made into a film at low temperature, and hence it is possible to form a TFT on a plastic substrate, a film substrate, or the like. However, the oxide semiconductor having ZnO as the main component has high sensitivity with respect to an atmosphere, and hence, in order to enable actual use of the TFT, it is necessary to isolate the oxide semiconductor layer from the atmosphere by a protective layer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) method is generally used as a method of forming the protective layer, which is high in film formation speed and is excellent in productivity. However, it is known that an insulating layer made of silicon nitride or the like, which is formed by a PECVD method and serves as a protective layer, has a large hydrogen amount in the layer, and hence when hydrogen is diffused from the protective layer into a channel region formed in the oxide semiconductor, the resistance of the oxide semiconductor is reduced (see SID'08 Digest, p. 633 (2008)).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As a method of preventing hydrogen from diffusing into the channel region, there is disclosed a method of forming a protective layer containing hydrogen while using a gate insulating layer and a gate electrode layer as a mask in a top gate polycrystalline oxide TFT having ZnO as the main component (see Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2007-220817). In this case, the hydrogen concentration of the semiconductor layer in an unmasked region increases, and therefore the resistance of the unmasked region of the semiconductor layer reduces. In this manner, source and drain electrode layers are formed in a self-alignment manner, and thus a TFT having a coplanar structure may be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the structure disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2007-220817, in order to prevent hydrogen from diffusing into the channel region of the semiconductor layer when the protective layer containing hydrogen is formed, the gate insulating layer or the gate electrode layer to be the mask is required to have a function of sufficiently suppressing the hydrogen diffusion.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">When silicon oxide or the like is used for the gate insulating layer, in order to suppress reduction in resistance of the semiconductor layer, the gate insulating layer is preferred to be formed thick. However, the increase in thickness of the gate insulating layer may cause an increase in drive voltage of the TFT, or lowering of an on-current or deterioration of an S value.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, it is more desired to provide a function of suppressing hydrogen diffusion to the gate electrode layer. However, the inventors of the prevent invention have been made clear that, when Mo is used for the gate electrode layer, hydrogen diffusion cannot be suppressed even if the film thickness is 200 nm. Further, even when a polycrystalline oxide semiconductor such as indium tin oxide (ITO) and ZnO is used for the gate electrode layer, hydrogen is diffused through grain boundaries in the polycrystalline oxide semiconductor, and hence the reduction in resistance of the channel region of the semiconductor layer cannot be suppressed. From the facts above, a gate electrode layer capable of suppressing hydrogen diffusion has been desired.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a top gate oxide semiconductor TFT, which is capable of suppressing reduction in resistance of a channel region of an oxide semiconductor layer due to hydrogen diffusion, and to provide a display apparatus including the top gate oxide semiconductor TFT.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Hereinafter, a top gate thin film transistor (top gate type thin film transistor) (TFT) according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating a structure of an oxide semiconductor TFT having a top gate coplanar structure, which is an example of the exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The oxide semiconductor TFT includes a substrate <b>10</b>, an oxide semiconductor layer <b>11</b> including a channel region <b>11</b><i>a </i>and source and drain regions <b>11</b><i>b</i>, a gate insulating layer <b>12</b>, a gate electrode layer <b>13</b>, a protective layer <b>14</b>, and source and drain wiring layers <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A glass substrate is preferred to be used as the substrate <b>10</b>. Alternatively, there may be employed a plastic film of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polyimide, polycarbonate, and the like, a thin plate, a stainless substrate coated with an insulating layer, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">First, on the substrate <b>10</b>, the oxide semiconductor layer <b>11</b> is formed by methods such as a sputtering method, a pulse laser deposition (PLD) method, and an electron beam deposition method. After that, the oxide semiconductor layer <b>11</b> is patterned by a photolithography method and an etching method. As the oxide semiconductor layer <b>11</b>, an amorphous oxide semiconductor containing at least one kind of element selected from among In, Ga, Zn, and Sn is preferred to be used.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Next, on the oxide semiconductor layer <b>11</b> (on the channel region <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the oxide semiconductor layer), the gate insulating layer <b>12</b> is formed by methods such as a sputtering method, a pulse laser deposition (PLD) method, an electron beam deposition method, and a plasma-enhanced CVD method. The gate insulating layer <b>12</b> is provided in direct contact to the oxide semiconductor layer <b>11</b>, and hence the gate insulating layer <b>12</b> is required to have a function of suppressing reduction in resistance of the channel region <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the oxide semiconductor layer when the gate insulating layer <b>12</b> is formed. Specifically, as the gate insulating layer <b>12</b>, an insulating layer containing oxygen, such as a silicon oxide layer and a silicon oxynitride layer, is preferred to be used. Those insulating layers raise no problems even when the compositions of the insulating layers do not strictly follow stoichiometry. For example, an amorphous structure may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Subsequently, on the gate insulating layer <b>12</b>, the gate electrode layer <b>13</b> is formed by methods such as a sputtering method, a PLD method, and an electron beam deposition method. After that, the gate insulating layer and the gate electrode layer <b>13</b> are patterned by a photolithography method and an etching method. As the gate electrode layer <b>13</b>, an amorphous oxide semiconductor layer containing at least one kind of element selected from among In, Ga, Zn, and Sn is preferred to be used. The gate electrode layer <b>13</b> may be formed of a laminate of a metal electrode material made of a metal such as Ti, Pt, Au, Ni, Al, and Mo and alloys of those metal elements, or a laminate film of the metal electrode materials, and an electrode material such as an oxide conductor including ITO. In this case, any one of the electrode materials may be the upper layer.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Next, on the oxide semiconductor layer <b>11</b> (on regions which become the source and drain regions <b>11</b><i>b </i>of the oxide semiconductor layer) and on the gate electrode layer <b>13</b>, the protective layer <b>14</b> is formed. The protective layer <b>14</b> is required to have a function of reducing resistance of regions of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>11</b> in which the gate electrode layer <b>13</b> is not formed on its upper side (the regions which become the source and drain regions <b>11</b><i>b </i>of the oxide semiconductor layer), and the gate electrode layer <b>13</b> made of an oxide semiconductor. The resistance of the oxide semiconductor may be reduced by adding hydrogen, and hence as the protective layer <b>14</b>, an insulating layer containing hydrogen is preferred to be used. Specifically, it is preferred to use a silicon nitride film, a silicon oxide film, a silicon oxynitride film, or a silicon carbide film containing hydrogen, or a laminate thereof. Those insulating layers raise no problems even when the compositions of the insulating layers do not follow stoichiometry. A plasma-enhanced CVD method that uses a raw material gas containing hydrogen is desired as a method of forming the protective layer <b>14</b>, in light of the plasma's effect of accelerating hydrogen diffusion into an oxide semiconductor. At this time, hydrogen in the raw material diffuses into the regions of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>11</b> in which the gate electrode layer <b>13</b> is not formed on its upper side (the regions which become the source and drain regions <b>11</b><i>b </i>of the oxide semiconductor layer) and into the gate electrode layer <b>13</b>. With this diffusion, the resistance of the regions of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>11</b> in which the gate electrode layer <b>13</b> is not formed on its upper side is reduced, and at the same time, the resistance of the gate electrode layer <b>13</b> is reduced. Further, at this time, in the regions of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>11</b> in which the gate electrode layer <b>13</b> is not formed on its upper side, with the use of the gate insulating layer <b>12</b> and the gate electrode layer <b>13</b> as a mask, the source and drain regions <b>11</b><i>b </i>of the oxide semiconductor layer are formed in a self-alignment manner. That is, a source electrode layer and a drain electrode layer are formed. In this case, the channel region <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the oxide semiconductor layer and the source and drain regions <b>11</b><i>b </i>of the oxide semiconductor layer are formed of the same oxide semiconductor layer <b>11</b>. Accordingly, a TFT that has small parasitic capacitance can be manufactured. Note that, the source and drain regions <b>11</b><i>b </i>of the oxide semiconductor layer may be separately formed by different layers, to thereby form the source and drain electrode layers. The structure of the TFT in this case is preferred to be a bottom contact structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a top contact structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, or the like. As the source and drain electrode layers in this case, it is preferred to use a metal electrode material made of a metal such as Ti, Pt, Au, Ni, Al and Mo, and alloys of those metal elements, a laminate film of the metal electrode materials, or an oxide conductor such as ITO.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Subsequently, contact holes are formed in the protective layer <b>14</b> by a photolithography method and an etching method. After that, the source and drain wiring layers <b>15</b> are formed for electric connection to the outside by methods such as a sputtering method, a pulse laser deposition (PLD) method, an electron beam deposition method, and a CVD method. As the source and drain wiring layers <b>15</b>, any material that has good electric conductivity can be employed, and it is preferred to use, for example, a metal electrode material made of a metal such as Ti, Pt, Au, Ni, Al and Mo, and an alloy of those metal elements, a laminate film of the metal electrode materials, or an oxide conductor such as ITO. Note that, the source and drain regions <b>11</b><i>b </i>of the oxide semiconductor layer can be used as the source and drain wiring layers <b>15</b> as it is.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Here, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the film thickness dependence of the resistivity obtained when a silicon nitride layer, which is the insulating layer containing hydrogen, is formed on the gate electrode layer made of an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based amorphous oxide semiconductor (amorphous IGZO). The silicon nitride layer is formed by a PECVD method. Before the silicon nitride layer is formed, the amorphous oxide semiconductor has a resistivity of a value larger than 10<sup>5 </sup>&#x3a9;cm, which is a measurement limit, but by forming the silicon nitride layer, the resistance is sufficiently reduced as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. From <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it is understood that when the film thickness of the gate electrode layer made of an amorphous oxide semiconductor exceeds 30 nm, the resistivity thereof increases. This shows that there is a resistivity distribution in a film thickness direction, and hence it may be said that as a portion in the amorphous oxide semiconductor film is spaced apart from the interface with the insulating layer containing hydrogen, the resistivity thereof increases. That is, the amorphous oxide semiconductor has a function of suppressing the reduction in resistance due to hydrogen diffusion.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Meanwhile, a bottom gate oxide semiconductor TFT is manufactured, in which a laminate film including a silicon oxide layer and an Mo layer being sequentially formed is formed on the amorphous oxide semiconductor. At this time, the silicon oxide layer and the Mo layer have a film thickness of 300 nm and 200 nm, respectively. The silicon oxide layer and the Mo layer are formed by a PECVD method and a sputtering method, respectively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates Id-Vg characteristics of cases before and after the silicon nitride layer, which is the insulating layer containing hydrogen, is formed on this TFT. It is understood from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> that even if the silicon oxide layer having a film thickness of 300 nm and the Mo layer having the film thickness of 200 nm are present, after the silicon nitride layer is formed, the TFT cannot be turned OFF. That is, it is understood that those films cannot suppress reduction in resistance of the channel region of the oxide semiconductor layer due to the hydrogen diffusion from the silicon nitride layer. This reason is not clear, but because the Mo layer is a polycrystalline film, there is a possibility that an enhanced diffusion in grain boundaries causes this result. On the other hand, there are no grain boundaries in an amorphous oxide semiconductor. From those results and because the gate insulating layer is desired to be thin in view of the TFT characteristics, it can be said that the gate electrode layer <b>13</b> is desired to have a function of suppressing hydrogen diffusion.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Further, in a structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, on the substrate <b>10</b>, a storage capacitor including a lower electrode layer <b>24</b>, an insulating layer <b>25</b>, and an upper electrode layer <b>26</b> is formed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a comparison of a leakage current density between the lower electrode layer <b>24</b> and the upper electrode layer <b>26</b>, between a case where an amorphous oxide semiconductor subjected to resistance reduction is used as the upper electrode layer <b>26</b> and a case where a metal is used as the upper electrode layer <b>26</b>. In this case, a Ti/Au/Ti layer and a silicon oxide layer are used as the lower electrode layer <b>24</b> and the insulating layer <b>25</b>, respectively. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, it is understood that when an amorphous oxide semiconductor layer is used on a side of the upper electrode layer <b>26</b> of the storage capacitor provided in contact to the insulating layer, the leakage current density between the lower electrode layer <b>24</b> and the upper electrode layer <b>26</b> is smaller. From the description above, an effect may be expected that, even when an amorphous oxide semiconductor layer subjected to resistance reduction as described above is used as the gate electrode layer in the top gate TFT, the leakage current density of the gate insulating layer is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The oxide semiconductor TFT having the top gate coplanar structure is thus completed. In the present invention, multiple transistors structured as above can be arranged two-dimensionally on the substrate (arranged in crosswise and lengthwise directions as if forming a plane).</p>
