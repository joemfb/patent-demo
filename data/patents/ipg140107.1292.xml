<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A chair includes a seat and a supporting structure associated for positioning of the seat in an orientation in which the seat has a downward inclination towards its front edge. The supporting structure includes an elongate member on each side of the chair, each member extending substantially continuously between the seat and a rearward region of the chair via a floor-engaging region of the supporting structure. Each elongate member has a generally loop-shaped configuration, with the seat end region of the elongate member overlying the opposite end region of the elongate member, and has an inherent resilience with a bias in which the seat end region is spaced from the opposite end region in the unoccupied state of the chair and the seat has the desired forwardly-downward inclination, wherein the resilience is selected such that the seat end region approaches or comes into engagement with the opposite end region when the chair is occupied.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to chairs. The invention is in particular directed to a chair in accordance with the principles of &#x201c;Inclusive Design&#x201d;, namely one which addresses the needs of less able-bodied and encumbered users, while nonetheless also meeting the needs and expectations of all users, while at the same time not looking in any way &#x201c;different&#x201d; or &#x201c;special&#x201d;. The invention is especially directed to the provision of a chair that is at least easy to get out of, as far as possible irrespective of the health and physical abilities of the user, and preferably is also easy to sit into, again as far as possible for users of all capabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A traditional chair which can in certain respects be regarded as facilitating sitting and rising actions by users is the familiar rocking chair, which may have curved members engaging directly on the surface of a floor, or may have more complex arrangements involving a base structure, in order to achieve the required rocking feature, for example by a suspended structure or by curved members rocking on a fixed base.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A type of chair which is specifically targeted at the older or disabled user is the so-called &#x201c;assist chair&#x201d;, which may incorporate features such as an inflatable cushion or cushion portion, to elevate the user wishing to get out of the chair into a disposition in which returning to a standing position from a sitting posture is facilitated.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Users facilitated by such a function include not only those suffering from a specific physical disability, but also for example pregnant women, a breast-feeding mother, or anyone holding for example a child while sitting into or rising from a chair; in other words, any person who can be regarded as encumbered in the short term.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Prior art patent specifications relevant to the field of the invention include inter alia the following:</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">CA-A-2083642 describes a geriatric chair providing easy patient entry and exit and a stable-restraint-free environment for a patient seated in the chair and left unattended. The chair has a floor-engaging central fulcrum, such as for example a pair of wheels or rollers, and floor-engaging rest portions, respectively forward of and to the rear of the fulcrum. When the chair is tilted forward about the fulcrum, the front floor-engaging rest portion engages the floor, so that the seat of the chair is inclined downwardly towards the front and it is easy for the patient to get in. The chair can then be tilted rearwardly until the rear floor-engaging rest portion encounters the floor, in which orientation the centre of gravity of patient and chair is to the rear of the fulcrum, with the seat sloping downwardly towards the rear. However, by no stretch of the imagination can this chair be described as anything other than &#x201c;different&#x201d; and &#x201c;special&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">EP-A-0775457 describes a chair having variable geometry, in which front and rear legs are linked by a front-to-rear member underlying the seat and pivoted to the front and rear legs such that the elongate extent of the cross-member between its pivot points with the legs is greater that the spacing between points at which the overlying seat is pivoted to the legs. A trapezoidal linkage is thus defined such that by pivoting the legs of the chair to the rear relative to the floor on which the chair stands, the seat is tilted downwardly towards the front, while pivoting the legs to the front causes the front of the seat to rise so that the seat then slopes downwardly towards the rear. The unit is called a &#x201c;rocking chair&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">WO-A-0135798 describes a chair in which the seat may move backwards and forwards according as a person sitting on the chair leans against the backrest of the chair or leans forwards.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">U.S. Pat. No.5,695,244 describes a rocking chair of more conventional aspect, in which the seat is supported by two spaced apart side members having a continuous outer periphery, each member having a large ground-contacting arcuate region that extends forwards and upwards and turns back and overlies the ground-contacting region of the members to form armrests. The relationship between the seat and curvature of the arcuate regions is selected so that the axis of curvature of the arcuate ground-engaging region is slightly rearward of the centre of gravity of an occupied chair, thus enabling the user to change the position of the chair over a wide range of orientations.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Resilient chair structures in which a single length of material, for example a metal tube or bar, is bent into a shape having a floor-engaging elongate portion and a seat supporting portion which are interconnected by a single upright portion of the bent material, are described by U.S. Pat. No. 2,981,315 and GB-A-374342. The basic shape of the chair frame may be generally that of a U turned on its side. Armrests may be provided by a further upstanding tube portion extending upwards from the seat supporting portion and further bent around to define a generally horizontally extending armrest portion.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A development of this type of structure is described in GB-A-416758, in which the generally horizontal floor-engaging portion and the seat supporting portion are further interconnected by springy members, typically of curved configuration, with the concavity of the curve opening in the same direction as the sideways oriented U-structure. This arrangement facilitates construction of the chair from less strongly resilient materials than are required for the structures of the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 2,981,315 and GB-A-374342.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Examples of laminated wood products adapted to comprise springiness or to provide parts of spring structures formed from such products are described in, inter alia, the following patent specifications:</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">AT-B-405783 describes a spring element for furniture, in particular a couch, in which upper and lower cambered laminated wood springs are arranged so that the concave faces of the elements face one another. A two-element wood spring is also described by JP-A-2006149948 in which a similar function is achieved by two laminated wood strips which are curved gently upwardly and cross one another intermediate their ends, so that one end of each element overlies an end of the other element. Each lower end can be fixed to a structure, and a load may be supported resiliently on the upper ends.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">FR-A-2582980 describes a leaf spring made from bonded laminated wood in which strips are bonded grain on grain and arranged along the axis of the leaf such that the grain of the wood is substantially parallel to the axis of the leaf spring and the bonding planes are perpendicular to the plane of the leaf spring.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">HU-A-69569 describes a leaf spring made from wood in which a sprung slat is formed from a number of veneers glued together such that the thickness of the slat increases in the middle. The neutral zone of the sprung slat may incorporate a layer of at least one ply, which is thinner than the veneer strips and shorter than the sprung slat.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Examples of composite part-wooden laminates adapted to provide a combination of strength and resilience are disclosed by, inter alia, the following patent specifications:</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">JP-A-2001254476 describes a composite metal-wooden beam, the bending rigidity of the beam being reinforced by forming a composite in which a metal member, such as one or more metal wires, is integrated into a laminated wood material in which light and soft woods of low strength overlap in the fibre direction.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">JP-A-4279332 describes a carbon fibre-reinforced laminated timber product in which at least one layer of the product comprises carbon fibre of a specified elasticity for the purpose of enabling use of the laminated material as a structural material.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Further examples of so-called &#x201c;lift chairs&#x201d; designed to assist individuals in rising from a seated position are described in the following specifications:</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">U.S. Pat. No. 4,690,457 discloses a lift chair in which a front portion of the seat is pivotally attached to the chair frame and a pneumatic cylinder is pivotally connected between a central frame member below the front portion of the seat and the seat.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">U.S. Pat. No. 4,907,303 provides an orthopedic chair with a seat pivoted at the front to the frame of the chair. A spring mechanism biases the seat towards an upwardly pivoted orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">U.S. Pat. No. 4,729,598 describes a convalescent chair in which a seat support structure pivotally connected to the forward portion of the seat structure is elevated by a motorized jack from a horizontal position to an inclined position to assist in raising a patient from a seated position to a standing position.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">U.S. Pat. No. 3,250,569 provides a chair having a seat elevator unit by which the seat is both raised and tilted forwardly to assist a person rising from the chair. The unit is removable and may be shifted from one chair to another.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The chair of GB-A-2183150 for use by an old or infirm occupant has a seat member that can be tilted about its front edge to slope downwardly and forwardly and is connected to a similarly pivoted armrest. The tilting is operable by the occupant.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Examples of similar vehicle seat arrangements for disabled drivers include the following:</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">GB-A-2191086 describes driving seat for a vehicle in which the door opening is at the front of the vehicle and the vehicle controls are on a retractable steering means. The driving seat is moved from the driving position to a forward entry/exit position and has a releasable compression spring for urging the squab of the seat upwards to assist the driver into a standing position.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">GB-A-199698 provides a cushioned seat for vehicles which is pivotally mounted on a framework so that its rear end may be raised to assist the occupant in rising, following which the seat reverts to its normal position in which it is downwardly inclined towards the rear.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">It is an object of the invention to provide a chair that is easy to get out of and/or to get into, but is nonetheless a normal piece of furniture and does not look &#x201c;different&#x201d; or &#x201c;special&#x201d;. It is a further objective of the invention to provide a chair which will facilitate inter alia the widest diversity of users in the above respects, including the disabled, the elderly, the mobility-impaired, and those temporarily encumbered, such as pregnant women and nursing mothers, while being also suitable for and attractive to the &#x201c;ordinary&#x201d; user, i.e. users not falling into any of the foregoing categories.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">This objective is met by a chair in accordance with claim <b>1</b>. The seat of the chair may be adapted to slope downwards towards the front of the chair, in particular when a user is getting up from the chair.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Thus in a chair comprising a seat and a supporting structure for the seat, the seat and supporting structure may be associated for positioning of the seat in at least an orientation in which the seat has a downward inclination towards its front edge for facilitating at least exit from the chair. The association of seat and supporting structure required to achieve this property of the seat under exit conditions, and preferably also for entry action, when a user requires to sit in the chair, may be established by a diversity of arrangements and constructions, as now further identified and explained.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to the invention, the desired association between seat and supporting structure is achieved by at least a portion of the supporting structure between the seat and a floor-engaging region of the supporting structure being resiliently yieldable under user weight relative to the floor-engaging region. Thus preferably the seat is adapted to have an orientation in the unoccupied state of the chair in which the desired forwardly downward positioning of the seat is achieved. A user wishing to sit into the chair may encounter the seat in a disposition conducive to a safe, comfortable and easy sitting action, while the yieldability of the structure may be adapted such that the user may engender reverse rising displacement of the seat towards the starting position, most suitably by personal weight transfer in a forward direction while still seated in the chair.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The seat may be supported on or comprised by an upper limb of a U-shaped resilient member disposed on its side, the lower limb of which forms a fixed portion of the supporting structure. In side view, the U-shaped member resembles a hairpin, and springiness is built into the member to achieve the required ease of entry and exit for the user.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In an especially favoured construction however, the supporting structure of the chair in accordance with the invention comprises an elongate member on each side of the chair, each elongate member extending substantially continuously between the seat and a rearward region of the chair via the floor-engaging region of the supporting structure. Each elongate member then suitably has a generally loop-shaped configuration in side view. In a preferred configuration of this loop shape of the member as seen in side view, each member has a generally oblong, quasi-elliptical shape, the loop being however adapted to be open in an unstressed or substantially unloaded condition of the chair, so that the opposite ends of the member are essentially free ends and are at a spacing from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In a preferred embodiment of the chair, the seat end region of each elongate member overlies its opposite end region. In the unloaded condition of the chair, the end regions are spaced from one another and overlie one another at a spacing, while in the loaded condition, normally when a user is sitting in the chair, the overlying ends may come substantially into contact, depending on the weight of the user, or at least approach one another with a lesser degree of spacing between them, in the event of a lighter user.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Thus it is preferred for each elongate member to be adapted to have an inherent resilience with a bias into a configuration in which the seat end region is spaced from the opposite end region in the unoccupied state of the chair, and for the resilience of the member to be selected such that when the chair is occupied, the seat end region approaches or comes into engagement with the opposite end region. The supporting members on or by which the seat of the chair is carried then serve as spring members, and their spring characteristics are selected such that the desired entry/exit disposition of the chair is established by the unloaded condition of the springs, and the weight of a user is then taken up and absorbed or resisted by the resilience of the supporting spring members, until a force/weight equilibrium is established or the spring members bottom out by their opposed end regions coming into engagement or abutment against one another, in the event of the loading being greater than can be absorbed by the travel between the initially spaced apart free ends.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The resilience of the support arrangement for the seat is preferably achieved solely by the elongate members, but should it be desired to augment the spring force opposing the weight load exerted by a seated user, for example in a variant of the invention for very heavy users, a spring member as such may be interposed between the seat end regions of the elongate members and their opposite end regions.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">While an open structure of the chair is preferred, namely one in which the free ends of the respective supporting members are fully independent of each other and there is no interaction between the respective ends of each member, other than when the end regions abut one another, a variant of the invention is also provided in which a free end of each elongate member at the opposite end region of the elongate member from the seat passes through or interacts with the seat end region of the elongate member, for stop-limited displacement of seat end region relative to the opposite end region. A construction of this kind effectively establishes a closed loop arrangement of the elongate supporting member as seen in side view, but the ends are nonetheless free to move with respect to one another within limits of travel set by stops.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A diversity of possibilities is available for mounting the seat on or attaching it to or associating it with the elongate members of the supporting structure. Thus the seat of the chair may extend in continuation of the elongate members or it may be supported on the elongate members. In both of these arrangements, the seat is therefore as it were generally on top of the support members, at least in side regions of the seat. Alternatively, the seat of the chair may be at least in part suspended from the elongate members. In this arrangement, the seat may therefore be at a lower level than the upper runs of the elongate members, as a result of which a larger curvature, of greater nominal radius or radii, may be selected for the elongate members, thus giving the potential to enhance the springiness or resilient characteristics of the supporting members. In such a construction, the front of the seat may be located at a level lower than that of the supporting members by for example bracket arms, with the upwardly extending backrest then being attached to the supporting members to extend transversely between them and thereby also fulfil a stretcher function.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In this preferred suspended-seat embodiment, the front edge of the seat may be set back between the supporting members, so that a space exists at the front of the seat between the supporting members, which is unobstructed by transverse stretchers and within which a user may stand, either preparatory to sitting into the chair, or immediately after having got out of the chair.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">An alternative configuration may also be provided, however, in which the front edge of the seat is brought forward so that it extends substantially transversely to the planes of the elongate bent-around supporting members, and then either itself fulfils a stretcher function by being attached at each side at its front edge to a respective supporting member, or the front edge is underlaid by a separate transverse stretcher which then also forms a support for the front edge of the seat. In this variant, the user stands immediately in front of the chair when getting into it or after having got out of it, rather that actually between the supporting side members.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In any of the foregoing constructions of the invention incorporating elongate members, the elongate members suitably have a continuous convex curvature between the two free end regions of the members. Such continuous convex curvature facilitates the provision of an optimised spring action or resilience, while also enabling the chair of the invention to have further a rocking capability, in conjunction with its resilient features. The extent of scale of the rocking is established by the exact curved profile of the members, and may consist of a relatively gentle rocking facility, or the rocking may be more vigorous. As subsequently further adverted to, the provision of a rocking capability may also serve to augment the easy entrance/exit capability of the chair of the invention, by virtue of it being then possible for the entire chair to tilt, in addition to tilting of the seat by virtue of resilient deflection of springlike supporting members or similar features, or by structures and mechanisms of other kinds, as discussed further below.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Also in any of the foregoing embodiments having elongate supporting members, these members suitably comprise side members of the supporting structure and are cross-linked by a plurality of transverse stretchers. Transverse stretchers give lateral stiffness to the chair and are preferably positioned in all embodiments having elongate curved supporting members at least in the region of the rear free ends of the members and at one or more other locations along the lower runs of the members. The mounting of the seat, whether on or to the members or by being suspended from them, gives lateral stiffness to the upper runs of the members, and one or more stretchers may also be provided at the front of the structure, where the elongate members curve upwardly between the lower and upper runs, depending on the stiffness characteristics of the elongate members individually.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In a variant, a lower run of each elongate member may associatable with a substantially linear base stand member. Thus a structure may be provided that is basically capable of rocking displacement, but may be prevented from rocking by attachment to or mounting on base members as identified above.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In further elaboration of the properties of the chair embodying elongate supporting members, the seat is preferably associated with the supporting structure in a position such that in the unoccupied state of the chair, the elongate members adopt a configuration in which the seat has the required downward inclination towards its front edge. Thus the arrangement is such that by appropriate placement of the seat and its associated backrest, the chair assumes an orientation when unoccupied such that its centre of gravity favours the downward inclination of the front of the seat. Preferably displacement of the elongate members between their relaxed unloaded configuration and a fully loaded configuration of the elongate members in an occupied state of the chair is at least partially effectable by user weight transfer. This balance of forces is especially realisable in the case of the rocking variant of the chair by suitable location of the various component parts, including seat and backrest, in conjunction with the seat and backrest in particular being shaped and aligned such that this balance is also maintained when the chair is occupied by a user and the user can achieve exit as far as possible by his or her own weight transfer movements, substantially while in a seated position in the chair.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Finally, in regard to the elongate members, the supporting structure suitably comprises at least one laminated member. Preferably, at least each supporting member is a laminate structure comprising wood. Suitable selection of timber kind and quality, as also lamina thickness for each layer, the adhesives used, and the process technology, for example steaming, enables precise establishment of the requisite spring characteristic of the finished supporting member. Composite materials may also be used if required, for example, wood and metal, or wood with for example interposed layers of textiles or a reinforcing material such as carbon. It is also possible to vary the depth or thickness of for example a laminate which is generally rectangular in cross-section, by using strips of greater lamina thickness over part of the extent of the member, or by using additional laminas again over part of the length of the member, to give it additional thickness where for example, greater bending stiffness may be required.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In a non-passive construction of a chair of the generic kind, the seat may be tiltingly mounted on the supporting structure. In a first variant of such an arrangement, the seat may be substantially centrally pivoted to the supporting structure about a pivot axis located substantially midway between front and rear edges of the seat. Alternatively, the seat may pivoted to the supporting structure about a pivot axis located in the region of the front edge of the seat, or in a still further possibility, the seat may be pivoted to the supporting structure about a pivot axis located in the region of rear edge of the seat.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The seat may also be associated with the supporting structure for displacement of the front and rear edges of the seat relative to the supporting structure. Thus for example, pins extending laterally from the front and rear edges of the seat may engage in elongate slots in fixed members, such as legs, of the supporting structure of the chair, so that the tilting action may be achieved by simultaneous displacement of the front and rear edges of the seat.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Chairs in accordance with this alternative active construction may have a mechanism for user-controlled latching of the seat in a selected tilted disposition relative to the supporting structure and for release of the latching as required by the user. Alternatively, or in addition to a latching feature, the chair may have a mechanism for user-controlled displacement of the seat into a selected tilted disposition relative to the supporting structure. In a particular possibility, this mechanism may be a lever-actuated linkage, the lever being located at or in an armrest of the chair.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In any of the foregoing variants of the construction in which the seat is tiltable, the chair may also comprise means for biasing the seat towards the orientation in which it has a downward inclination towards its front edge. This biasing means may be accommodated within a rear supporting member of the chair and may for example be a compression spring, either a mechanically-acting coil spring, or a piston and cylinder type structure, expandable under for example gas pressure, compressible by loading such as the weight of a user sitting into the chair, and lockable at a selected degree of expansion, should such a feature be desired.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In a further option, the seat of the chair may be fixedly associated with the supporting structure and the chair may comprise means for urging the support structure towards the orientation in which the seat has a downward inclination towards its front edge. Such means may be incorporated into the supporting structure, which may for example comprise biasing means for effecting upward displacement of a rear region of the supporting structure, such as for example an expandable feature such as a sprung foot extendible under spring force from the foot of a rear leg of the chair. The supporting structure may in addition comprise means for effecting upward displacement of a front region of the supporting structure, the force exertable by the front biasing means being less than that exertable by the rear biasing means, so that the chair can be urged towards a disposition in which entry and exit is facilitated.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In all of the various embodiments and variants of the chair according to the invention, the floor-engaging portion may provide for at least limited rocking action of the chair as a whole relative to an underlying supporting floor. In such a rockable construction, the seat may however be fixedly associated with the supporting structure and the displacement of the seat into at least an orientation in which the seat has a downward inclination towards its front edge may then be established by suitable location of the centre of gravity of the chair when unoccupied. However, many other combinations of rockability with other features of the chair of the invention as described above are also feasible and are encompassed or envisaged within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Rockability may also be established for example by the seat being suspended from the supporting structure by swing links. Alternatively a motion equivalent to rocking may also be effected by the seat being slidingly displaceable relative to the supporting structure along a substantially arcuate path which is upwardly convex. Both of these options also engender the desired easy access/exit feature of a chair of the of the generic kind.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In many of the configurations described above, the seat is displaceable into the orientation in which it has a downward inclination towards its front edge by user weight transfer. This is the case both for fully passive constructions, such as those having the laminated spring supporting members, or those which apply a rocking motion in order to facilitate entry and egress to and from the chair, as well as for those using active mechanisms, such a user-controlled springs or the like, where the action of these features can be augmented or assisted by user weight transfer.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">A variety of constructions of chairs of the generic kind will first be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-25</figref> of the drawings, followed by description of embodiments of chairs according to the invention with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26-44</figref>. The same reference numerals are used for the same, or similar or corresponding features, in all of the exemplary constructions explained.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> show a basic version of a chair <b>1</b> of the generic kind in a normal position for seating use, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and for a tilted position of the seat, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, this representing an exit disposition when a user wishes to leave or rise from the chair. The seat <b>2</b> is pivoted <b>61</b> to the frame portion or leg <b>6</b> of the chair at the rear <b>12</b> and may be displaced downwardly at the front <b>11</b> under user control by a movable element <b>65</b> in one or both of the armrests <b>4</b>. When the person seated in the chair <b>1</b> wishes to get out, he or she pushes forwardly and downwardly on these displaceable portions <b>65</b> of the armrests <b>4</b>, such action representing in any case a natural reaction in the course of an exiting movement from the chair <b>1</b>. An associated mechanism then moves the front <b>11</b> of the seat <b>2</b> down, so that getting out of the chair <b>1</b> is facilitated. The linkage or mechanism may be very simple, as illustrated, where a slideable sector <b>65</b> of the armrest <b>4</b> is directly connected or coupled to the front <b>11</b> of the seat <b>2</b> such as by a flexible linkage. The downward movement may be effected against a return spring, not illustrated. The downward tilt of the front <b>11</b> of the seat <b>2</b> may be augmented by the chair <b>1</b> being formed to also have a rocking feature, such as by curved underlying floor-engaging supports <b>7</b> on which the seat <b>2</b> is supported by front legs <b>5</b> and rear legs <b>6</b>, so that the chair is then able to also rock forwardly on floor <b>91</b> to further assist an exiting movement as the user's weight transfers towards the front of the chair.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> show a similar concept, but in this case the seat <b>2</b> is centre-pivoted <b>61</b> and can rotate about this pivot axis <b>61</b> within limits defined by upper <b>66</b> and lower <b>67</b> end stops provided on both the front <b>5</b> and rear <b>6</b> legs of the chair <b>1</b>. No operating mechanism is provided to effect the pivoting action of the seat <b>2</b>, and the movement of the seat <b>2</b> between its end stop positions delimited by features <b>66</b> and <b>67</b> takes place by user weight transfer only. When the user <b>15</b> leans forward from a reclining position against the backrest <b>3</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, to exit the chair <b>1</b>, the seat <b>2</b> tilts down at the front <b>11</b> and the chair <b>1</b> rocks forward on curved floor supports <b>7</b>, thereby facilitating the action of getting out of the chair, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a further conceptual arrangement in which the seat <b>2</b> and backrest <b>3</b> define a unitary structure and are guided between seated and exit positions by pins <b>62</b> extending laterally from the seat <b>2</b>/backrest <b>3</b> structure at two locations along the extent of this unit, the pins <b>62</b> being guidingly engaged in elongate slots <b>63</b> in the frame of the chair <b>1</b>, respectively in the front upright supports or leg portions <b>5</b> and in the armrest portions <b>4</b>. The sliding and tilting action of the seat <b>2</b> may be mechanically initiated and assisted, as for the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, or it may take place by weight transfer alone, as for the chair <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, and this construction may again also incorporate an optional rocking facility. The seated or reclining disposition of the seat <b>2</b> and backrest <b>3</b> are shown in solid lines, while the tilted or exit orientation is indicated in dotted outline.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a variant of this possibility, in which the backrest <b>3</b> is pivoted <b>61</b> to the armrests <b>4</b> and the front edge <b>11</b> of the seat portion <b>2</b> is pin-guided <b>62</b> in an arcuate slots <b>63</b> in the front leg portions <b>5</b> for upward and downward movement between an entry/exit orientation in which the front edge <b>11</b> is moved to a lower downward position and a seated orientation in which the front edge <b>11</b> occupies an upward position. In this construction, a mechanical linkage, as for the chair <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, is favoured, preferably also with spring bias towards the upper seated orientation of the seat portion <b>2</b>. The reclined position of the combined seat <b>2</b> and backrest <b>3</b> is shown in solid outline, with the downwardly sloping exit disposition of the seat <b>2</b> being depicted in double chain dot. An intermediate orientation in which the seat <b>2</b> is substantially horizontal is rendered in single chain dot. Also in this construction, the floor-engaging supports <b>8</b> are linear rather curved, so that the frame defined by armrests <b>4</b>, legs <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>, and supports <b>8</b> is substantially rectangular in side view.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a chair <b>1</b> is provided in which the seat cushion <b>2</b> is biased at the rear <b>12</b> towards an upward position of the rear of the cushion <b>2</b>, i.e. into an entry/exit position, and this bias is overcome when the user sits into the chair <b>1</b> and leans back into a reclined seated position. The upward disposition of the seat cushion <b>2</b> is indicated in dotted outline in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, with its lower seated location shown solid. The maximum extent of the uplift is indicated by dimension &#x201c;L&#x201d;. This upward biasing may be achieved by an underlying spring mechanism or any other suitable arrangement, adapted to be overcome by the weight of an average user, but sufficiently strong to urge the seat <b>2</b> upwardly when the user leans forwards. As shown in this drawing, the chair <b>1</b> may also be equipped with a rocking floor-engaging feature <b>7</b> to further facilitate easy entry and exit, these rockers <b>7</b> being cross-linked by front <b>32</b> and rear <b>33</b> transverse stretchers.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">So far, there has been no specific disclosure of a mechanism by which the tilting or biasing action adverted to above may be achieved. One such possibility is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>10</b> in a non-rocking construction. Here the unitary seat <b>2</b> and backrest <b>3</b> construction may be pivoted <b>61</b> between a forward disposition and a rearward disposition under the action of a drive mechanism <b>71</b> concealed with one or both rear legs <b>6</b>. The mechanism <b>71</b> comprises a gas piston and cylinder unit, similar to those used for height adjustable office chairs, this being controlled by a lever <b>65</b> incorporated in one of the armrests <b>4</b>. To tilt the seat <b>2</b> into the exit position from the reclined position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the user may for example, pull upwards on the lever <b>65</b> into the orientation shown in dotted outline in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, thereby releasing the piston/cylinder mechanism <b>71</b> for expansion so as to act upwardly on the rear <b>12</b> of the seat <b>2</b> and thereby tilt it so that that the front edge <b>11</b> drops down. In the course of this displacement of seat <b>2</b>, the chair will pass through the disposition shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in which the seat is substantially level. The expanding action of the piston/cylinder unit <b>71</b> is terminated by releasing the lever <b>65</b>. In this construction, the armrest <b>4</b> is fixed to the backrest <b>3</b> and pivoted <b>64</b> to the rear legs <b>6</b> of the chair <b>1</b>, so as to adapt to the alternative orientations of the seat <b>2</b> in reclined and exit conditions of the chair <b>1</b>. The chair is non-rocking and the floor engaging members <b>8</b> extending between the bottom ends of the front <b>5</b> and rear <b>6</b> legs are linear.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Detail of a possible mechanism <b>71</b> is shown in the sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The unit <b>71</b> is accommodated within a chamber <b>711</b> inside a hollow portion of leg <b>6</b>. The cylinder of unit <b>71</b> is secured to the walls <b>712</b> of chamber <b>711</b> such as by a transverse pin <b>713</b>. Piston <b>714</b> extends from cylinder <b>71</b> and terminates with a sliding pivot link <b>715</b>, for connection to the tilting seat <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">A fully passive mechanism of a generally similar kind may be effected in the manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, again as a static or non-rocking construction. In this variant, the seat <b>2</b> is pivoted <b>61</b> to the rear uprights <b>6</b> and the front <b>11</b> of the seat <b>2</b> is biased upwardly by a spring mechanism <b>72</b> within the front legs <b>5</b>, or within at least one front leg <b>5</b>. The upward position of seat <b>2</b> under this bias is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> and in dotted outline in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The spring bias is balanced such that a user of typical weight wishing to get out of the seat <b>2</b> can overcome the bias by shifting his or her weight forward, this establishing the tilted down orientation of the front <b>11</b> of the seat <b>2</b>, shown in full outline in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. However, this arrangement does not provide for a seat orientation in which a user intending to sit into the chair <b>1</b> encounters an initially downwardly tilted seat <b>2</b>. The construction facilitates therefore exit, but entry takes place in the normal manner, with the user lowering him or herself onto the seat <b>2</b> and attaining a position of rest by leaning back. Detail of a possible interaction arrangement between the spring <b>72</b> and the seat is shown in section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The spring is compressed by a downwardly extending plunger <b>721</b> extending from the front <b>11</b> of seat <b>2</b> and penetrating into the chamber <b>711</b> in leg <b>5</b> within which the spring <b>72</b> is housed. Compressive travel of this plunger is stop-limited by abutment of the end face <b>722</b> of a chamber <b>723</b> within the front end region of the seat <b>2</b>, surrounding the plunger <b>721</b> and adapted to receive the top end of the leg <b>6</b>, against the top of leg <b>6</b> in the region surrounding spring chamber <b>711</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref>, <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> show an arrangement in which the chair <b>1</b> also provides an initial entry position. The front <b>5</b> and rear <b>6</b> legs of the chair <b>1</b> are equipped with extending portions <b>73</b> and <b>74</b> respectively which can be pushed out from the respective chair leg <b>5</b> or <b>6</b> to engage against the floor <b>91</b> and tilt the chair <b>1</b> either forwards or rearwards. The chair <b>1</b> may be a passive structure in which the rear extending portion <b>74</b> is more strongly biased, such as by a compression spring or piston and cylinder feature, so that in a normal (extended) position of this rear extending portion <b>74</b>, the chair <b>1</b> is tilted forwardly and the front edge <b>11</b> of the seat <b>2</b> is lowered for easy entry, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. When a user <b>15</b> sits into the chair <b>1</b>, the loading of the rear extending member <b>74</b> is overcome as the user <b>15</b> reclines back into the seat <b>2</b> and the chair <b>1</b> then moves into a neutral position, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Suitably, the region between the front <b>5</b> and rear <b>6</b> legs is also spanned by gently curved rocker members <b>7</b> so that the chair <b>1</b> can oscillate between forward and rearward orientations, the rearward disposition being illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. The rocking action may be additionally facilitated and damped by the front legs <b>5</b> also being equipped with extending portions <b>73</b> that are however preferably less strongly biased than the extending portions <b>74</b> of the rear legs <b>6</b>. A construction of this kind may also incorporate a triggering or latching mechanism for at least the rear extending portions <b>74</b>, so that these can be latched in either or both of the extended and retracted positions. As well as compression springs, damping features may be provided to prevent the active movement of the extending portions <b>73</b>, <b>74</b> from taking place with excessive speed or force.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">A construction in which the seat <b>2</b> and backrest <b>3</b> are suspended from a static frame <b>81</b> of the chair <b>1</b> by means of pivotally mounted swing links <b>82</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>. Each swing link <b>82</b> is pivoted at <b>821</b> to an upper member <b>811</b> of frame <b>81</b>, while the lower end of the swing link <b>82</b> is pivoted to the lower end of a respective leg <b>5</b> or <b>6</b> at pivot point <b>822</b>. The frame <b>81</b> has a bottom linear floor-engaging support <b>812</b>. While not specifically illustrated in the drawings, the chair <b>1</b> may be equipped with biasing mechanisms such as to maintain the chair in the entry position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, until such time as a user enters and overcomes the biasing by shifting his or her weight rearwardly, to achieve the reclining orientation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref> show a similar result achieved by an arrangement in which an arcuate seat structure <b>2</b>, upwardly-convex, is slidingly mounted for forward and rearward movement on a likewise arcuately-shaped, upwardly-convex base structure <b>85</b>. Again, spring or other biasing features may be provided so that the sliding seat unit <b>2</b> is urged forwardly towards the entry/exit position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, from which it may move rearwardly under the action of a user's weight or by other action to adopt the inclined of rearward orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref> show a fully passive arrangement in which a rocking unit <b>1</b> is configured such that its centre of gravity in the unoccupied state tilts it forward into the entry/exit orientation. When a user <b>15</b> sits into the chair <b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>) and leans against the backrest <b>3</b>, the chair <b>1</b> tilts backwards into a new stable orientation, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, on the floor-engaging curved supports <b>7</b>. The chair <b>1</b> has no moving parts and the seat <b>2</b> and backrest <b>3</b> are fixedly connected to the leg-defining and base-defining portions <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> of the structure.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</figref> show the same effect achieved by a structure having static legs <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> but with the seat <b>2</b> and backrest <b>3</b> unit pivoted <b>61</b> to the base of the chair <b>1</b>. The armrest <b>4</b> is fixed to the backrest <b>3</b> and pivoted <b>64</b> to the rear legs <b>6</b> of the chair <b>1</b>, so as to adapt to the alternative orientations of the seat <b>2</b> in reclined and exit conditions of the chair <b>1</b> respectively. The weight balance of the seat <b>2</b>/backrest <b>3</b> combination may be such that the normal position of this unit is a forward, downwardly tilted orientation as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> and the seat <b>2</b> is tilted backwards into the occupied configuration by user weight transfer, this configuration being depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. Alternatively, the construction may incorporate an active biasing mechanism to urge the seat <b>2</b> into the forwardly tilted position.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The majority of the arrangements shown so far require a multipart construction of the chair and also for the most part various mechanical features governing the relationship between the components of the chair, for example, pivots and linkages, as well as, optionally, latching, lever and spring mechanisms, especially in order to achieve an advantageous raised and/or forwardly tilted entry disposition for the seat. This preferred seat position and orientation to facilitate sitting-in action by a user entering the chair is only partially met by solely rocking and passive constructions such as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</figref> illustrate a construction in which moving parts and mechanisms are substantially dispensed with while yet achieving the required predisposition or bias of the seat to facilitate entry and exit. The seat <b>2</b> of the chair <b>1</b> is defined by one leg <b>22</b> of a generally U-shaped spring member <b>51</b>, which is oriented on its side so that the mouth of the U opens towards the rear of the chair <b>1</b>. The lower limb <b>23</b> of the U is secured to the static frame of the chair <b>1</b> with a downward inclination towards the rear and the spring structure is formed with an initial bias such that the upper limb <b>22</b> has an unloaded disposition in which it slopes upwardly towards the rear of the chair <b>1</b>, so that the end <b>24</b> of the upper limb <b>22</b> that is remote from the base of the U <b>51</b> and is connected to the backrest <b>3</b> is spaced above the end <b>25</b> of the lower limb <b>23</b> that is remote from the base of the U <b>51</b> and is connected to the rear leg <b>6</b> of the chair at a first spacing dimension.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">When the user <b>15</b> sits into the chair <b>1</b> and applies his or her weight to the seat <b>2</b> and thereby to the upper limb <b>22</b> of the U <b>51</b>, this limb <b>22</b> yields resiliently under the weight force and bends downwardly, to reach a new equilibrium position in which the end <b>24</b> of the upper limb <b>22</b> is at a second spacing dimension from the end <b>25</b> of the lower limb <b>23</b> that is less than the corresponding dimension in the unloaded condition of the chair <b>1</b>. In this orientation, the upper limb <b>22</b> may now be substantially parallel to the lower limb <b>23</b> of the U <b>51</b>. This reclining configuration of the chair is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In order to stand up again and get out of the chair <b>1</b>, the user <b>15</b> slides forwardly, and as the user's weight transfers forwardly, the bias within the spring member <b>51</b> causes it to expand by its legs <b>22</b>, <b>23</b> moving apart, so that the seat <b>2</b> rises up and assists the user <b>15</b> in exiting the chair <b>1</b>. This exit orientation, which is also an entry disposition, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. The spring member <b>51</b> may be made from a multiplicity of suitable materials, a mixed material laminate of alternating layers of metal, e.g. steel, and wood being one possibility. Alternatively, a laminate entirely of wood may also be formulated and produced to achieve the necessary resilience.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In the unit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the rocking structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref> is combined with the concept of resilient seat mounting of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</figref> to provide a chair <b>1</b> according to the invention in which the entry disposition of the seat <b>2</b> is achieved by adapting the centre of gravity of the chair <b>1</b> so that its normal empty position is one in which it is disposed so as to receive a user, with the seat <b>2</b> in a raised and forward disposition, conveniently placed for entry. The seat <b>2</b> is again spring-mounted, but in this case the spring feature is provided by the front limbs <b>5</b> of the chair <b>1</b> extending upwardly and curving rearwardly from the arcuate floor-engaging members <b>7</b> of the chair <b>1</b>, to support the transversely-mounted seat <b>2</b>. When the user sits onto the seat <b>2</b>, this yields under the weight of the user by virtue of a bending action of the front limbs <b>5</b>, so that the seat <b>2</b> sinks and moves rearwards until a comfortable and stable disposition is reached, in which the downward weight force is balanced by the upward force exerted by the sprung front limbs <b>5</b> of the chair <b>1</b>. A stop feature <b>27</b> is provided to limit the downward movement of the seat <b>2</b>, in the event of the user being exceptionally heavy. The stop feature may be effected in a constructionally advantageous manner by the rear limbs <b>6</b> of the chair <b>1</b> being brought forward and passing through or closely adjacent to the sides of the seat <b>2</b>, these sides being supported by generally rearwardly oriented continuations <b>22</b> of the front limbs <b>5</b>, and by the rear limbs having a step feature <b>27</b> in each case, against which an abutment feature <b>41</b> of the seat <b>2</b> or the rearward continuations <b>22</b> of the front limbs <b>5</b> engage at the end of the allowed travel of the seat <b>2</b>. The rear limbs <b>6</b> continue upwardly and forwardly above the stop region <b>27</b>, to define armrests <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27 and 28</figref> show a variant of the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>. In the previous embodiment, the armrests <b>4</b> were brought up at the rear <b>12</b> of the seat region <b>2</b>, as upward continuations <b>23</b> of the rear limbs <b>6</b>, and curved forwardly, towards the front of the chair <b>1</b>. In the construction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27 and 28</figref>, the rear limbs <b>6</b> of the chair <b>1</b> are brought more towards the front of the chair <b>1</b> and then sweep upwardly and rearwardly to define the armrests <b>4</b>, as compared with the forwardly-directed armrests <b>4</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>. The region of intersection of the front <b>5</b> and rear <b>6</b> limbs alongside the seat <b>2</b> are again adapted to stop limit the downward travel of the seat <b>2</b> under the weight force exerted by the user <b>15</b>, such as by arrangements similar to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, but not specifically represented in the present Figures. In this embodiment, the integration of front limbs <b>6</b> and seat <b>2</b>/backrest <b>3</b> results in a clean and pleasing shape. Entry and exit, depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, are also further facilitated by the chair <b>1</b> having a limited rocking capability by virtue of the curved floor-engaging supports <b>7</b>, thus facilitating in particular, movement of the chair into the reclined orientation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 and 30</figref> show a variant of the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27 and 28</figref> in which the front <b>5</b> and rear <b>6</b> limbs of the chair <b>1</b> are substantially integrated into a single substantially continuously curved or shaped member <b>21</b>, so that the resilient yielding of the seat supporting elements <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>21</b> of the structure under a user's weight is to an extent shared by the entirety of the shaped member <b>21</b> defining the limb parts <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> of the unit. The seat <b>2</b> is carried on upper rearward runs <b>22</b> of the front portions <b>5</b> of the continuous limb features <b>21</b>, while the upper run <b>23</b> of the back portion <b>6</b> of each continuous limb feature <b>21</b> terminates with an upstanding stop-defining portion <b>26</b> intersecting and cooperating or interacting with the elongate extent of the upper rearward run <b>22</b> of the front portion <b>5</b>, and then runs out to end at the free ends <b>24</b> of the limbs <b>6</b> by way of rearwardly extending armrests <b>4</b>. When the user <b>15</b> sits into the chair <b>1</b> in the entry configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, the greater part of the resilient yielding is effected by bending of the front portions <b>5</b> of the continuous limb member <b>21</b>, but the rearward part <b>6</b> of this member <b>21</b> is also capable of resilient yielding action and in the event of the seat <b>2</b> bottoming on stops <b>27</b> should the chair <b>1</b> be sat on by an exceptionally heavy user <b>15</b>, the load is then shared by both the front half <b>5</b> and the rear half <b>6</b> of the generally loop-shaped or carriage-spring-like structure <b>21</b> then defined, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>. In the forward entry and exit disposition of the chair <b>1</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, linear portions <b>8</b> of the ground-support members lie flat on the floor <b>91</b>, but the chair <b>1</b> can tilt back onto a reclining position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, by user weight transfer, by virtue of the flat profile <b>8</b> of the supporting members <b>7</b> changing to a curved configuration in the rearward regions of the supports.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 and 32</figref> show an arrangement in which the seat <b>2</b> is fully independent of the resilient continuous limbs <b>21</b>. The laminates <b>21</b> of the supporting structure fulfil the spring function while the seat <b>2</b> and backrest <b>3</b> extend in substantially integral continuation of the front free ends <b>24</b> of the elongate laminated members <b>21</b>. The springing action is as described before&#x2014;when the chair <b>1</b> is unoccupied, the seat <b>2</b> is raised into a disposition facilitating entry, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>. When a user sits in, the seat <b>2</b> moves downwardly and rearwardly in a controlled manner, as the sprung support members yield, and depending on the weight of the occupant, it either assumes a balanced position in which the weight force is in equilibrium with the spring force of the laminates <b>21</b>, or the seat travel bottoms out when the laminates <b>21</b> and seat <b>2</b> come into abutment or contact, i.e. when the underside <b>41</b> of the seat <b>2</b> engages onto the tops <b>42</b> of the forwardly-directed upper runs <b>23</b> of the rear portions <b>6</b> of the curved limbs <b>21</b>. Such a disposition is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>. Guidance for this movement may be established by the free ends <b>25</b> of the rear portions <b>6</b> of the elongate laminates <b>21</b> passing through apertures in the sides of the base of the seat <b>2</b>, or otherwise interacting with the seat <b>2</b> in a guided manner. If required, a stop may also be provided at the upper ends of the end regions <b>23</b> of rear portions <b>6</b>, to limit displacement of the seat <b>2</b> in the upward direction, this upward movement being effected by the expanding resilience of the curved laminates <b>21</b> in the unloaded condition. Limited rocking action is facilitated by gentle curvature of the underlying floor-engaging supports <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 and 34</figref>, the seat <b>2</b> is now supported directly on rearwardly-directed upper runs <b>22</b> of the front regions <b>5</b> of the curved elongate resilient spring members <b>21</b> (typically laminates) of the supporting structure. Controlled guidance of the resilient displacement is again achieved in this case by the rear portion free ends <b>25</b> of the laminates <b>21</b> being brought forward and engaging or interacting with the front free end regions <b>24</b> of the laminated elongate members <b>21</b>. Downward displacement of the seat <b>2</b> is stop-limited by the upper run <b>22</b> reaching and abutting the top <b>42</b> of the rear part <b>6</b> of each member <b>21</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, while an end cap <b>28</b> or the like similarly stop-limits upward travel and delimits the forward-tilted entry/exit position of the chair <b>1</b>, in conjunction with the weight balance achieved by choice of materials and seat position, such an orientation being depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>. Entry and exit is effected by user weight transfer. To exit, the user leans forward and/or extends his or her legs, thereby enabling the springy elongate members <b>21</b> of the supporting structure to engender the required upward and forward displacement of the seat <b>2</b>, in conjunction with limited rocking action enabled by the curved shape of the floor-engaging supports <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35 and 36</figref>, the guidance of the relative displacement of the ends <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> of the elongate members <b>21</b> by means of the interacting upward end portions of the rear portion free ends <b>25</b> has been dispensed with and the downward displacement of the seat <b>2</b> is terminated solely by abutment of the overlying upper rearward run <b>22</b> of each elongate member <b>21</b> on the underlying upper side <b>42</b> of the wrapped around underlying forwardly oriented termination <b>25</b> of the rear free end portion <b>23</b>, run <b>23</b> being the upper forwardly turned back region of rear portion <b>6</b> ending at <b>25</b>. This situation is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>. The underside of the seat <b>2</b> and the upper side <b>42</b> of region <b>23</b> may be cushioned or padded to smooth the action of mutual abutment or bottoming, when the chair is loaded. There is no specific stop to terminate upward movement of the seat <b>2</b> and this is established solely by the resilience of the curved laminates <b>21</b> which expand towards an unstressed normal configuration when the chair <b>1</b> is unloaded, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>. The maximum extent of this upward movement can be determined by the design and manufacturing parameters of the laminates. The base of the seat <b>2</b> is here also located below the level of the rearwardly-directed upper runs <b>22</b> of the elongate members <b>21</b>, thereby providing a tapering guidance of the seat <b>2</b> between the upper runs <b>23</b> of the rear free end regions <b>25</b> of the elongate members <b>21</b> during downward displacement of the seat <b>2</b> under weight loading by a user. It has been found that the curved elongate spring members <b>21</b>, connected by transverse stretchers in side by side disposition in parallel planes, have adequate stiffness without necessarily requiring the interacting linking of the rear free end <b>25</b> with the front end region <b>24</b>, such as provided in previous embodiments by way of interengagement or interaction or the rear portions <b>23</b> of the curved laminates <b>21</b> with the rear end regions <b>24</b> of the front portions <b>5</b> of the curved limbs <b>21</b>. The locations for stretchers fulfilling the transverse linking between the members <b>21</b> is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> by reference numerals <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> and <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref> shows a refinement in which the downward displacement of the seat <b>2</b> under the weight of a user and the required upward return movement necessary for assisting exit from the chair <b>1</b> may be respectively further controlled and augmented by means of a leaf spring <b>52</b>, preferably formed from two opposed convexly curved laminates, interposed between the underside <b>41</b> of the seat <b>2</b> and the forwardly-oriented free end region <b>25</b> of the rear <b>23</b> of the elongate laminate <b>21</b>. The cooperative association of this spring <b>52</b> and the inherent springiness of the curved supporting structure laminate <b>21</b> can be adjusted to optimise the entry/exit assisting action of the chair of the invention. No rocking is provided in this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, the floor-engaging portion of the laminated strips <b>21</b> forming the supporting structure is provided with a region <b>9</b> having reverse curvature as compared with the general convexity of the elongate member <b>21</b> as a whole, so that the supporting structure engages the floor <b>91</b> at two spaced-apart locations, respectively towards the front and rear of the chair <b>1</b>. The supporting structure is therefore in this embodiment inhibited from undertaking any rocking action and the entry/exit facility is established solely by deflection of the springy front portions <b>5</b> of the elongate members <b>21</b> and to an extent optionally also by limited yielding of the rear parts <b>6</b> of the elongate members <b>21</b> should the seat <b>2</b> bottom onto the rear part <b>23</b> in stop-limited manner when loaded by a seated user. Buffer portions <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> are provided on the underside of the rear end regions <b>24</b> of the upper limbs <b>22</b> and on top of the free end regions <b>25</b> of the lower limbs <b>23</b>, to damp bottoming out when the chair <b>1</b> is sat on by a heavy user.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref> is a pictorial representation of a preferred embodiment of chair <b>1</b> in accordance with the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref> is to be interpreted together with the side view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> and the substantially isometric view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>. In this case, each supporting limb of the chair <b>1</b> is defined by a single continuously curved spring member <b>21</b>, suitably a wood laminate, although other materials or composites of metal and wood are also possible. In side view in the unloaded condition, each supporting member <b>21</b> has the shape of an open loop, with the free ends <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> of the member <b>21</b> being spaced apart vertically and located substantially one above the other in the normal or unloaded orientation of the member <b>21</b>. Also in this view and orientation, there is a short overlap between the free ends <b>24</b>, <b>25</b>, so that the upper free end <b>24</b> is seen as overlying the lower free end <b>25</b>, when viewed from above.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">As compared with the previous embodiments, the seat <b>2</b> is now suspended by downwardly-dropping brackets <b>31</b> from the rearward upper runs <b>22</b> extending from the front upwardly curving regions <b>5</b> of the limb members <b>21</b>, so that these upper runs <b>22</b> now also define the armrests <b>4</b> of the chair <b>1</b>. Lateral stiffness is achieved by two or more stretcher bars <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> extending transversely between the curved spring members <b>21</b> in their lower regions <b>7</b> where they run in proximity to an underlying surface on which the chair <b>1</b> is to be supported, and at least one further stretcher <b>34</b> extends between the members <b>21</b> close to the free ends <b>25</b> of the members <b>21</b> that do not form the armrests <b>4</b>. Transverse stiffness is also provided by a stretcher <b>35</b> to the rear of the backrest <b>3</b>, or stretcher action is achieved by the backrest <b>3</b> itself.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The lower runs <b>24</b> of the spring supports <b>21</b> may optionally be underlaid by base stands <b>37</b>, which may be secured to the spring members <b>21</b> in this region <b>7</b>. The base stands <b>37</b> suitably comprise stainless steel strip members, which, when associated with the spring members <b>21</b> such as by a suitable securing method, e.g. fasteners, inhibit any rocking motion of the chair <b>1</b>. The base stands <b>37</b> are suitably selectively attachable to the unit, so that if a degree of rocking action is desired, they may be omitted from the assembly. Preferably, the floor-engaging portions <b>7</b> of the curved spring members <b>21</b>, which may also be associated with the base stands <b>37</b>, have a relatively slight degree of curvature over their elongate extent, so that the amount of rocking action achievable is modest.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The easy entry and exit facility of the chair <b>1</b> in this embodiment is achieved almost entirely by the spring action of the continuous support members or laminates <b>21</b>, with possible optional augmentation by limited rocking action, where provided or not inhibited by base stands <b>37</b>. The curvature and resilience or springiness of the side members <b>21</b> is specified and realised such that in the unloaded condition of the chair <b>1</b>, the seat <b>2</b> occupies an upward and forwardly tilted disposition, which is conveniently and comfortably placed as to height and angle for the user requiring to sit into the chair <b>1</b>. This can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref> in particular. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>, the user <b>15</b> backs into the chair <b>1</b> in conventional posture, may grasp the armrests <b>4</b> if desiring to do so, and as he or she sits down, the user's thighs and buttocks encounter the seat <b>2</b> at a comfortable height and with a convenient angle of tilt. As the user <b>15</b> sits fully into the chair <b>1</b>, the spring members <b>21</b> yield under his or her weight, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>. Depending on the user's weight and the spring characteristics of the assembly, the seat <b>2</b> may come into equilibrium before it encounters stop members in the form of resilient elements <b>45</b> on the upper stretcher <b>34</b> of the rear of the support structure, but if the user <b>15</b> is heavy, or the chair <b>1</b> has been designed to be highly resilient and springy, the seat <b>2</b> may bottom onto these stop elements <b>45</b>, which may suitably be rubber sleeves on a bar-shaped stretcher <b>34</b>. Under these conditions, the initially open spring structure <b>21</b> takes up a closed configuration and its further behaviour will resemble to some extent that of a carriage spring, with resilience and yielding being delivered by the now substantially closed-loop laminate structure <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The structure is balanced and arranged such that it is stable for a forwardly tilted orientation of the seat <b>2</b> when unoccupied and is similarly stable when the user <b>15</b> reclines against the backrest <b>3</b>, but with the seat <b>2</b> then sloping downwardly to the rear. This configuration is clearly apparent in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In order to exit from the chair <b>1</b>, the user <b>15</b> leans forward, thereby shifting the combined centre of gravity of chair <b>1</b> and user <b>15</b> forward, so that the spring members <b>21</b> are then able to rise again towards their unloaded disposition, thus causing the seat <b>2</b> to rise and assist the user <b>15</b> in standing up out of the chair <b>1</b> and exiting from it. At least when the chair <b>1</b> has a degree of rocking action available, this exiting action may be initiated simply by the user <b>15</b> stretching his or her legs forwardly, away from the chair, this small shift in weight distribution sufficing to effect the assist action on the part of the spring members <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">This ease of entry and exit is of benefit to all users, but in particular assists those who may be disabled or encumbered. It is especially effective for elderly but frail persons, as well as pregnant women and nursing mothers. The chair facilitates sitting down and rising up on the part of users who are encumbered or supporting for example a child or infant. The smooth take-up of body weight by the sprung structure means that the user can have confidence in being supported at an earlier stage in a sitting action, while the rising motion of the chair for the exiting user provides a similar assurance for this exit movement.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Front end lateral stiffness can be achieved by appropriate formation of the laminate or strip members <b>21</b> in this region to have individual resistance to sidewise or twisting motions. The manner of attachment or suspension of the seat <b>2</b> may also serve to enhance lateral stiffness, such as by means of a U-member which comprises bracket portions <b>31</b>, but also links the side strips <b>21</b> by portions underlying the seat <b>2</b>. In a variant, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>, the seat <b>2</b> and backrest <b>3</b> are repositioned so that the front edge <b>11</b> of the seat <b>2</b> extends transversely between the curved side spring members <b>21</b> in the vicinity of the location <b>5</b> where the curvature turns back to define the armrests <b>4</b>. The front edge <b>11</b> of the seat <b>2</b> may be underlaid in this region by a further stretcher <b>36</b>. The backrest <b>3</b> is then disposed somewhat further forwardly than in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 39</figref>, <b>40</b>, <b>41</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>43</b>, and the weight distribution of the unloaded/unoccupied chair <b>1</b> is then adjusted and adapted so that the desired forward tilt in this condition is again achieved. This variant of the invention functions essentially in precisely the same manner as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 39</figref>, <b>40</b>, <b>41</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>43</b>, but provides additional transverse stiffness for the upward sweep <b>5</b> of the curved spring supports <b>21</b> at the front of the chair <b>1</b>, as compared with the integrally achieved stiffness of the construction of the former figures.</p>
