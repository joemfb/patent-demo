<heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Integrated circuits are produced by a plurality of complex semiconductor fabrication processes in a semiconductor wafer fabrication facility. Maintaining a high yield in semiconductor fabrication processes continues to be a critical factor in reducing the costs of device fabrication. However, despite the sophistication of semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities and expense of semiconductor manufacturing tools, achieving a high yield remains a difficult accomplishment. For example, the natural variation inherent in processes performed in semiconductor fabrication facilities, tool function changes or drift, inadequate sacrificial film removal, tool imperfections, contamination, and/or tool miscalibration are all challenges facing semiconductor fabrication facilities that can cause unacceptable levels of chip failures. Failure analysis is therefore critical to solution identification and maximizing yield.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Failure analysis methods involve manual &#x201c;eyeball&#x201d; techniques in which semiconductor process engineers examine selected sample wafers, check for failure results and manually classify the wafers into failure patterns. These non-systematic processes are labor-intensive, time-consuming, limited to small sub-sets of the high volume of semiconductor wafers that are manufactured daily and will be unable to meet Giga Fab and future 450 mm targets.</p>

The inventors have developed a system and method that is adaptive and self-learning in that as more failure data are received into the system, more refined failure features and patterns can be determined and new features and patterns can be formed. Thus, the system and method will continue to provide improved accuracy in failure pattern recognition as more failure data is analyzed and the library of wafer fingerprints is further developed. The inventors have also determined a reliable method and system of automatically determining the strength of correlation of new features and patterns in a tunable ranking system.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a flow chart illustrating a method <b>100</b> of automatically detecting failure patterns for a semiconductor wafer fabrication process. At block <b>102</b>, a plurality of semiconductor wafers are fabricated. A variety of test data is collected from fabricated wafers that have completed production as illustrated at blocks <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>. At block <b>104</b>, circuit performance (CP) tests, in-line defect tests, bin tests, wafer acceptance tests (WAT or electrical test method) and/or defect tests can be performed by applying the appropriate test criteria to the fabricated wafers. For example, a defect map can be formed using KLA-Tencor equipment. At block <b>106</b>, a test data set is collected from testing the fabricated wafers at block <b>104</b>. At block <b>105</b>, a respective wafer map is formed for each of the wafers based on the collected test data set. For example, during the fabrication process of the plurality of semiconductor wafers, various in-process layers of each of the plurality of wafers can be verified by an in-line defect test to collect a test data set. A respective wafer map can be formed for each wafer using the test data collected and/or measured at various points on various in-line process layers (e.g. film deposition layers, lithography layers, etching layers, diffusion layers) of the wafer. In some embodiments, wafer maps can be generated based on a test data set measured at various points at each of the various in-process layers during fabrication of each of the plurality of wafers. The measurement points can be organized to form a wafer map.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">At block <b>110</b>, in various embodiments, the method determines whether each respective wafer map includes one or more respective objects. An object, as defined herein, is a collection of test data on a wafer map formed for a respective wafer that is indicative of wafer failure. In various embodiments, an object can be a collection of test data formed by two or more adjacent failure die. In some embodiments, the step of determining whether each respective wafer map includes one or more respective objects can include discriminating failure data from noise on each respective wafer map. For example, a k-nearest neighbor algorithm may be used in discriminating objects from noise and in separating the failure data on the wafer map into discrete objects. Further by way of example, a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) can be performed to discriminate failure data from noise and to separate the failure data on the wafer map into discrete objects. At block <b>112</b>, if no objects are determined to be present on a wafer map, then the wafer is determined to be suitable for use and no further processing is performed on the wafer map. In some embodiments, the non-defect wafer maps can be discarded. In other embodiments, a respective wafer map is only generated if test data for a respective wafer includes failure data forming one or more respective objects. At block <b>110</b>, if a respective wafer map is determined to include one or more respective objects, the respective wafer map is selected for further processing.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In various embodiments, a respective wafer map can be determined to include one object. In other embodiments, a respective wafer map can be determined to include two or more objects. If the wafer map is determined to include more than one object, then the wafer map can be segmented by object where each object in the wafer map is individually processed as described below. In some embodiments, a wafer map can be split into several sub-wafer maps, each containing a subset of the failure data for a particular wafer map.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">At block <b>115</b>, one or more object indices for selecting a respective object in each respective selected wafer map of the plurality of wafer maps are selected. As used herein, an object index for selecting an object on a wafer map is a mechanism for describing the object. For example, objects can have different relative dimensions and different relative locations on a wafer map. The object index thus provides a mechanism for describing the object's dimensions, location, spatial positioning, etc. relative to the wafer map. In some embodiments, an object index can include, but is not limited to, an index defining a measurement of the number of failure dies in the object (e.g. a geography length, a geography area, a geography width, a geography height), a centroid distance, a number of pixels, a distance or an angle relative to a center or an edge of the wafer map or to some other relative fixed location of the wafer map, an object perimeter distance, a circumference, an inner circumference, an outer circumference, a differential circumference, a diameter, a radius, a differential radius, a wafer map perimeter distance, a wafer map percent coverage, a distance from a fixed point on the wafer map to a centroid distance, a distance from a fixed point on the wafer map to a fixed point of the object, a major axis length, a minor axis length, a bounding box, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In various embodiments, an object index can be measured relative to the center of the wafer map. In some embodiments, an object index can be measured relative to some fixed point on the wafer map. In various embodiments, the method can use, for example, standardized rectangular or polar coordinate systems, or other Euclidean coordinate system to enhance object selecting techniques. In various embodiments, an object index can define one or more respective attributes of an object. In some embodiments, an object index can define a respective position-independent object related attribute. For example, an object index can define the shape or size of an object. In other embodiments, an object index can define a position-dependent object related attribute. For example, an object index can define the relative position or percent coverage of the object relative to the wafer map.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to various embodiments, one or more respective object indices for selecting a respective object on each of the respective selected wafer maps are selected at block <b>115</b>. For example, geography length and geography area can be selected for selecting a respective object on a respective wafer map. By way of example, the one or more indices can be selected based on the dimensions of the objects on the wafer map. Further by way of example, the one or more indices can be selected based on the spatial positioning of the objects relative to the wafer map. Further by way of example, a geography area and a perimeter distance may be selected as indices for selecting a respective object on each of the respective selected wafer maps.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">At block <b>120</b>, a plurality of object index values in each respective selected wafer map are determined using each of the respective selected one or more object indices. In various embodiments, the resultant values using the one or more selected object indices are calculated for each object in each respective selected wafer map to select an object. For example, the resultant values for geography area and perimeter distance are calculated for each object in each respective selected wafer map of the plurality of wafer maps to select an object.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">At block <b>125</b>, a respective object is selected in each respective selected wafer map based on the determined plurality of object index values. For example, the object having the maximum object index values of geography area and perimeter distance can be selected. By way of example, the object having the minimum object index value (e.g. differential circumference between an outer circumference and an inner circumference) can be selected. In various embodiments, two or more objects can be selected in one or more of the respective selected wafer maps based on the determined plurality of object index values and stored object index values for the selected one or more object indices.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a step of selecting an object <b>225</b> in a method of automatically detecting failure patterns for a semiconductor wafer fabrication process according to some embodiments is provided. At block <b>227</b>, two or more objects in one or more wafer maps of a plurality of wafer maps can be selected. For example, stored object index values (block <b>226</b>) may indicate that one object is an independent object and another object is a dependent object such that there is a high probability of both objects being observed on the same wafer map. By way of example, object index values can be stored at block <b>226</b> in a histogram format to indicate a relationship between the two or more objects. By way of another example, one object can have a maximum geography area object index value and another object can have a maximum perimeter distance object index value. At block <b>228</b>, the two or more selected objects can be grouped to form a grouped object. For example, the objects can be merged and grouped to form one object and then processed as an object as described below. In various embodiments, a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) can be performed to eliminate noise during the process of grouping or merging the two or more selected objects.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, a preliminary label and/or a recording label can be assigned to each object in each respective selected wafer map of the plurality of wafer maps. For example, a preliminary numeric label can be assigned to each object in each respective selected wafer map to differentiate the objects during the selection process. In some embodiments, equivalences for the object index values can be determined in a local equivalence table for the objects in each respective selected wafer map of the plurality of wafer maps. In some embodiments, the equivalence classes can be resolved and the respective objects can be relabeled in each respective selected wafer map of the plurality of wafer maps. For example, the object index values for a plurality of objects in a wafer map can be determined. The objects can be preliminarily labeled to identify an object with its associated object index values. Two or more objects can be selected based on their associated object index values and stored object index values. The objects can be grouped, equivalences resolved for the determined object index values for the grouped object and a recording label can be assigned to the respective grouped object.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In various embodiments, one or more wafer map indices can be selected for determining a respective feature in each respective wafer map. As used herein, a wafer map index for determining a respective feature in each respective wafer map is a mechanism for describing the information on the wafer map. In various embodiments, the selected one or more object indices are insufficient to describe the information on the wafer map for feature determination. For example, a wafer map index may be a transformation function applied to the failure data on the wafer map. By way of example, a wafer map index may include, but is not limited to, a Radon transform, a Fourier transform, a Hough transform, a random transform, etc. A plurality of wafer map index values can be determined in each respective wafer map using each respective selected one or more wafer map indices.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, a Radon transform can be selected as a wafer map index. A plurality of wafer map index values (e.g. s and a where s represents a distance along any straight line L and &#x3b1; represents an angle that a straight line L makes with an axis) can be determined in each respective wafer map such that the radon transform function returns a radon transform R of an intensity image of the wafer map for each angle &#x3b1; from a fixed point (e.g. center of the wafer map) in the wafer map. In various embodiments, determining a plurality of wafer map index values can include determining a matrix of wafer map index values and a projection of the wafer map index values. For example, determining a plurality of wafer map index values using a Radon transform wafer map index can involve computing a matrix in which each column is the Radon transform for one of the angles &#x3b1; from a fixed point (e.g. center of the wafer map) and computing an x-y projection where the y-axis represents the distance (s) of the projection and relative to the fixed point and the x-axis represents the angle &#x3b1; from 0 to 179 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">At block <b>130</b>, a respective feature in each of the respective selected wafer maps is determined using the determined first plurality of object index values for the respective selected object and stored feature information. In various embodiments, feature information stored in a database at block <b>131</b> can include previously calculated object index values determined using previously selected object indices in previously selected wafer maps. In some embodiments, feature information stored in a database at block <b>131</b> can include object index values object stored in a histogram format to indicate a relationship between two or more objects. In some embodiments, feature information stored in a database can include previously calculated object index values for grouped objects in a previously selected wafer map. In some embodiments. In some embodiments, the stored feature information can include feature points previously determined for previous objects using previously selected object indices in previously selected wafer maps and previously stored feature information.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">For example, the geography length and geography area can be selected as object indices in a respective wafer map. A plurality of object index values can be calculated for a plurality of objects in each respective selected wafer map. Also, an object can be selected from the respective wafer map based on the determined plurality of object index values. In various embodiments, the object index values for the selected object can be combined (e.g. by plotting on a 2-D graph) to form a feature point. Then, the selected object can be compared with feature points stored in the feature database. The feature database stores feature points with the same selected object indices of each previously processed wafer. On the other hand, in various embodiments, a respective feature can be determined by using a predefined plurality of wafer map index values in each selected wafer map. By way of example, a Radon transform function can be selected as a wafer map index. Then, the Radon transform function can be used as a plurality of wafer map index values for each respective selected wafer map. A feature point can be extracted for a respective wafer map by selecting the maximum value of a Radon transform projection for the selected wafer map. In addition, a feature point can be extracted from a respective wafer map by averaging the projection matrix of the Random transform. After performing the average operation on the projection matrix, then the more discriminating power 1-dimensional data can be derived. This 1-dimensional data can be seen as a data distribution of the selected wafer map. This feature also can be compared with other feature points in the feature database.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further by way of example, geography area, geography length and perimeter distance can be selected as object indices for a respective wafer map and a plurality of object index values can be calculated for a plurality of objects in each respective wafer map to select one or more objects in each respective selected wafer map. The resultant object index values for the respective selected one or more objects can be combined (e.g. by plotting on a 3-D graph) to form a feature point and compared with feature points stored in a database for previous features of previously processed wafer maps formed using the same object indices. The feature point can be compared with a library of known feature points to match the feature point. In this manner, the quality of the determined feature can be quantified, and irrelevant features can be quickly eliminated. A respective determined feature for a respective wafer map can include, but is not limited, to an upwardly curving semicircular feature (e.g. smile-shaped feature), a downwardly curving semicircular feature (e.g. frown shaped feature), a laterally curving semicircular feature, an elongated substantially linear feature emanating from the center of the wafer map, a circle of N units in diameter positioned substantially about the center of the wafer map, a triangle of N area units positioned in an upper left quadrant of the wafer map, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Any suitable feature discrimination algorithm commonly used in the art to extract features in image processing can be utilized, or alternatively, future developed feature discrimination algorithms can also be utilized. For example, degrees of correlation can be measured between the determined feature point and previously stored feature points to extract the respective feature in the respective wafer map by selecting the feature point that has the highest degree of correlation. In some embodiments, a covariance matrix based distance (e.g. diagonal covariance matrix based distance) can be determined for the feature data. In various embodiments, a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) can be performed for the feature data. Ranges for degrees of correlation can be selected based on, for example, the feature discrimination algorithm selected for feature determination and/or based on the amount of failure data in the respective selected wafer map and/or the amount of failure data for a selected object in a respective selected wafer map. For example, a degree of correlation between approximately 70% and 100% (i.e. between 69.5% and 99.5%) between the determined feature point and a previously stored feature point can be used for feature discrimination. In some embodiments, a degree of correlation range between approximately 80% and 100% (i.e. between 79.5% and 99.5%) between the determined feature point and a previously stored feature point can be selected. In other embodiments, fuzzy matching can be used and/or fuzzy membership degrees can be assigned to calculate the highest degree of correlation and determine the respective feature. For example, a fuzzy matching algorithm can be used to compute and assign probabilities of belonging to a certain feature to the newly determined feature point.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">At block <b>140</b>, a respective pattern for each of the respective selected wafer maps is classified using the respective determined feature and a plurality of stored pattern information at block <b>161</b>. A pattern represents the one or more features on a respective wafer map, determined using the plurality of object index values and/or wafer map index values for the wafer map, and including the associated feature information, object index information and/or wafer map index information, attribute information, object information and image information on the wafer map (e.g. pixel information). Stored pattern information can include pattern definitions and pattern templates. Pattern definitions can include feature information, object index information and/or wafer map index information, attribute information, object information and image information on the wafer map (e.g. pixel information, angle information) for respective patterns. Pattern templates can include a general format for pattern information in a pattern (e.g. hierarchical relationship between feature information, attribute information, object information and image information). In various embodiments, a k-nearest neighbor algorithm is used to classify the respective pattern for each of the respective selected wafer maps using the respective determined feature and a plurality of stored pattern information. Thus, a respective pattern is classified by a majority vote amongst its k nearest neighbors. The choice of k can be a trade-off between the variability and susceptibility to noise associated with a low value of k against the over-smoothing associated with a high value of k. In some embodiments, k can be determined by heuristic techniques commonly used in the art or alternatively by future developed techniques that depend on the type of wafer map being processed, and/or the number of defect data points being processed.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">By way of example, a respective pattern for a respective selected wafer map can be classified using the formula &#x3a3;<sub>i,j&#x3b5;Ni</sub>d(xi, xj) where d(xi, xj)=(xi&#x2212;xj)M(xi&#x2212;xj), M is the identity matrix, that for an unknown wafer map classification point (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>) and N representing k, a distance (e.g. Euclidean or Mahalanobis distance) can be measured between the unknown wafer map classification point's independent variable value (x<sub>i</sub>), the unknown wafer map classification point's dependent variable value (y<sub>i</sub>), and k stored classification points (x<sub>j</sub>, y<sub>j</sub>) for previously stored patterns. In some embodiments, (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>) can be a feature point for the determined feature for a respective wafer map. In other embodiments, (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>) is determined based on two or more feature points for a respective wafer map. For example, two or more feature points for a respective wafer map can be combined (e.g. by plotting on a 2-D or 3-D graph) to form a classification point and compared with classification points stored in a database <b>136</b> for classified patterns of previously processed wafer maps formed using the same two or more features. In various embodiments, classification points can be stored at block <b>136</b> for classified patterns including, but not limited to, localized patterns, sector patterns, center patterns, scratch patterns, edge patterns, ring patterns, radiation patterns, donut patterns or top/bottom patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">For example, and with reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, k can be selected to equal 3 for classifying a respective pattern for each of a plurality of respective selected wafer maps. As described above, a respective wafer map can be determined to include respective feature 1 and respective feature 2 for a respective wafer map. The respective wafer map can be determined to include a classification point (x<sub>i</sub>=determined feature 1 point value, y<sub>i</sub>=determined feature 2 point value). In various embodiments, a respective wafer map can be determined to include one respective feature and a classification point ((x<sub>i</sub>=determined object index 1 point value, y<sub>i</sub>=determined object index 2 point value). The respective wafer map's respective pattern can be classified using a k nearest neighbor algorithm (k=3), its respective classification point and by majority voting among the classification points of two or more of a plurality of stored classified patterns (x<sub>i</sub>=stored feature 1 point value, y<sub>i</sub>=stored feature 2 point value) such as for example, center patterns and localized patterns. In the illustrated example, using a 3-nearest neighbor algorithm, the respective pattern for the respective wafer map is classified as a localized pattern. Once a respective pattern for a respective wafer map is classified as described herein, the failure and/or defect type of the input wafer can be established. In various embodiments, the pattern information for each of the respective selected wafers is stored in pattern database <b>136</b>. In some embodiments, the classified patterns are used to adjust one or more parameters of the semiconductor fabrication process.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">At block <b>140</b>, a respective wafer fingerprint for each of the respective selected wafer maps is formed using the respective classified pattern and the plurality of stored patterns. In various embodiments, each respective classified pattern represents a respective wafer fingerprint, corresponding to a classified failure type, and having its respective determined feature information, object index information and/or wafer map index information, attribute information, object information and image information. In various embodiments, each respective wafer fingerprint is stored in a database. For example, each respective wafer fingerprint can be stored in a wafer fingerprint library.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In various embodiments, the plurality of respective classified patterns can be ranked using a clustering algorithm with stored patterns of substantially similar classification (e.g. localized, sector, center, scratch, edge, ring, radiation, donut or top/bottom.) In various embodiments, a hierarchical clustering method can be used to form a respective wafer fingerprint for each of the respective selected wafer maps. For example, a respective wafer fingerprint can be formed for each of the respective selected wafer maps using the formula D<sub>max</sub>(C<sub>i</sub>, C<sub>j</sub>)=max d(a,b) where a&#x3b5;Ci, b&#x3b5;Cj where d represents a distance (e.g. Euclidean distance) between i and j, two points in pattern clusters C<sub>i </sub>and C<sub>j </sub>and D<sub>max </sub>represents the cluster distance. In this algorithm, the distance of the farthest points of the two clusters can be compared. In other embodiments, a respective wafer fingerprint can be formed for each of the respective selected wafer maps using the formula D<sub>min</sub>(C<sub>i</sub>, C<sub>j</sub>)=min d(a,b) where a&#x3b5;Ci, b&#x3b5;Cj where d again represents a distance (e.g. Euclidean distance) between i and j, two points in pattern clusters C<sub>i </sub>and C<sub>j </sub>and D<sub>min </sub>represents the cluster distance. In this algorithm, the distance of the closest points of the two clusters can be compared. If the computed cluster distance in either algorithm is below a certain predetermined threshold, then the two clusters are completely merged. In various embodiments, an average value is determined in each pattern cluster C<sub>i </sub>and C<sub>j </sub>and the average value represents the cluster centroid. In various embodiments, the cluster distance (d) is computed between the cluster centroids of pattern clusters C<sub>i </sub>and C<sub>j</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Each of the newly classified patterns and each of the stored patterns can be individually assigned to their own pattern cluster. The closest (most similar, e.g. closest distance) pair of pattern clusters are merged into a single pattern cluster, so that one less pattern cluster exists. The distances between the new cluster and each of the remaining pattern clusters is computed and the two closest (most similar) pattern clusters are again merged into a single pattern cluster, The algorithm can then iterate until no more merging occurs, at which point all pattern clusters are formed. The pattern information of the formed pattern clusters represent new wafer failure patterns. A wafer fingerprint is thus formed that represents the new wafer failure pattern. The wafer fingerprint can be stored in a database such as, for example, a wafer fingerprint library.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">At block <b>145</b>, the respective wafer fingerprints are used to adjust one or more parameters of the semiconductor fabrication process. For example, the one or more parameters can include active process parameters, passive process parameters, design parameters, layout parameters, or combinations thereof. Further, by way of example, an active (or actively controlled) process parameter can include any process parameter that can be easily specified during a particular semiconductor process (such as, by defining the parameter in an equipment recipe.) Examples of an active parameter include an RF power, a gas flow rate, a concentration, a trim time, a pressure, or a processing time. A passive parameter can include any fabrication process parameter that is not determined by recipe but rather, for example, is a dependent variable inherent in a process based upon other passive and/or actively controlled parameters, a type of equipment, a condition of equipment, a condition of a wafer being processed, and/or other possible factors. Examples of a passive process parameter include reflected power, ambient conditions, contaminate levels, and temperature and/or pressure profiles inherent in a fabrication tool. Further examples include critical dimension (CD) or depth for a poly etching process. In various embodiments, a respective classified pattern, and its associated wafer fingerprint, can be used in identifying a process within a tool that caused the indicated failure type. For example, a respective classified pattern may indicate a problem with a deposition process, or a chemical dispensing process, or a wafer handling or transfer process, or a problem with a photo-lithography tool. The inventors have determined that the use of the determined wafer fingerprints can significantly reduce this analysis and identification time and thus significantly improve yield. A process parameter associated with an identified problem, for example with a wafer handling or transfer process, can be adjusted accordingly. In various embodiments, a plurality of semiconductor wafers are fabricated in a wafer fabrication process incorporating the adjusted process parameter.</p>
