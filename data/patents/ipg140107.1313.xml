<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to shelving and, more particularly, to glass shelving for refrigerators and the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is known to provide a substantially transparent glass shelf for a refrigerator, where the shelf is supported on a pair of supports extending at least partially along the side edges of the glass shelf. The supports receive the edges of the shelf along side caps or the like to retain the shelf to the supports and to provide a lip along the upper surface of the shelf to form a &#x201c;spill proof&#x201d; shelf. Such lips or caps may limit spillage over the edges of the shelves, but may interfere with the upper surface of the shelves and may not be aesthetically pleasing to look at. Examples of such shelves are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,786,562; 6,113,206; 6,120,720; 5,228,764; 6,488,347; 6,679,573; 6,604,800; 4,934,541; and 6,729,704, which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention provides a shelf assembly, such as a shelf assembly for a refrigerator, where a lower surface of the shelf panel is bonded to a support or rail or slide or roller mechanism extending along each side region of the shelf panel. The shelf panel may have curved or turned or bent edge regions along the support (and optionally along the front and/or rear edges or regions of the shelf panel) to provide a spill proof shelf without end caps or the like along the edges of the shelf panel. The glass shelf panel may include a frit layer or the like along the lower surface of the panel and along the bonded region to provide an enhanced appearance to the shelf assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to an aspect of the present invention, a shelf assembly for use in a refrigerator includes a shelf panel and at least one support rail or slide or roller mechanism. The shelf panel has a lower surface and comprises a substantially transparent glass material. The support rail is bonded along the lower surface of the shelf panel.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The shelf assembly may include a frit layer along the lower surface of the shelf panel, and the support rail may be bonded to the frit layer. Optionally, a frit layer or concealing or substantially non-transparent layer may be provided along the upper surface of the shelf panel and generally at and above the region of the shelf panel where the support rail is located. The support rail may include a generally horizontal support portion that is bonded to the lower surface of the shelf panel, and the generally horizontal support portion may comprise a curved portion.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The shelf panel may have at least one perimeter region that is curved, such as upwardly and/or downwardly curved depending on the particular application of the shelf assembly. The shelf panel may comprise a substantially transparent strengthened or toughened or tempered glass material. The opposite side regions of the shelf panel may be curved, and the support rail may bond to the shelf panel along each of the curved side regions of the shelf panel. Optionally, a front region of the shelf panel may also be curved, and/or a rear region of the shelf panel may also be curved.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to another aspect of the present invention, a shelf assembly for use in a refrigerator includes a shelf panel comprising a glass material and a pair of opposite support rails. The shelf panel comprises a generally planar shelf portion, a front perimeter region, a rear perimeter region and opposite side perimeter regions. The front perimeter region, the rear perimeter region and the perimeter side regions are upwardly angled along respective perimeter regions of the generally planar portion of the shelf panel. The upwardly angled side perimeter regions and the upwardly angled front and rear perimeter regions cooperate to provide a substantially continuous upwardly angled perimeter lip around the perimeter regions of the generally planar shelf portion. The side perimeter regions have an upwardly angled lower attachment surface. Each of the support rails have a generally vertical portion and an angled portion that extends at an angle from an upper edge region of the generally vertical portion, which is at a generally vertical orientation when mounted in a refrigerator. The angled portions of the support rails are angled to generally correspond to the angle of the upwardly angled side perimeter regions of the shelf panel. The angled portions of the support rails are bonded along a respective one of the lower attachment surfaces of the side perimeter regions of the shelf panel via a cured adhesive layer.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Optionally, the angled portions of the support rails may include generally planar portions and may be angled to generally correspond to the angle of the upwardly angled side perimeter regions of the shelf panel. The generally planar portions of the angled portions of the support rails may be bonded along a respective one of the lower attachment surfaces of the side perimeter regions of the shelf panel via the cured adhesive layer. Optionally, the shelf panel may be substantially transparent and the cured adhesive layer may be substantially optically matched with the optical index of the shelf panel glass material.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, the present invention provides a substantially transparent strengthened glass shelf panel, such as a tempered glass (such as thermally tempered glass or chemically tempered glass) or toughened glass shelf panel or the like, that is bonded along its lower surface and along the side regions of the panel to a pair of side shelf support rails so as to avoid interference or intrusion of the rails onto the upper surface of the shelf panel. The shelf panel may be formed to have curvatures along one or more of the side or front or rear perimeter portions or regions, in order to provide the desired appearance and function, such as a spill proof function or handle function or the like, to the shelf panel. The shelf panel may have a frit layer along its lower surface and in the bonding area along the shelf support rails to conceal the rails so that they are not readily discernible and viewable through the substantially transparent strengthened glass shelf panel.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">These and other objects, advantages, purposes and features of the present invention will become apparent upon review of the following specification in conjunction with the drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now to the drawings and the illustrative embodiments depicted therein, a shelf assembly <b>10</b> includes a substantially transparent shelf panel <b>12</b> that is supported at least partially along its side regions or edges <b>14</b> by respective supports or support brackets or rails <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>). The support brackets <b>16</b> are attachable or mountable to a support structure (not shown), such as to a support rack or the like within a refrigerator. The underside or lower surface <b>18</b> of shelf panel <b>12</b> is bonded to the support brackets <b>16</b>, such that the support brackets are secured to the lower surface of the shelf panel and thus do not extend over or intrude onto the upper surface of the shelf panel <b>12</b>. The perimeter side regions or edges <b>14</b> and/or the front edge or region <b>20</b> and/or the rear edge or region <b>22</b> of the shelf panel may be curved or bent to provide a spill proof shelf, as discussed in detail below. Although shown and described as a shelf panel assembly for a refrigerator, the shelf panel assembly of the present invention is intended for use in other types of cabinets or coolers or the like, and the term &#x201c;refrigerator&#x201d; is intended to include other food storage containers or cold storage containers or devices or cabinets or freezers or the like, without affecting the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Shelf panel <b>12</b> may comprise a glass panel, and preferably a substantially transparent strengthened glass panel, such as a tempered or toughened glass panel, suitable for use in a refrigerator environment. The glass panel may be cut to the desired size and shape for the shelf and may be formed to have the desired curvature along the peripheral edges or perimeter regions of the shelf. For example, the shelf panel may be pressed to bend or turn or curve the perimeter regions to the desired shape. In the illustrated embodiment, of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the panel is press bent or pressed against a form so as to form generally upwardly turned side regions <b>14</b> to limit or substantially preclude spillage of liquids over the sides of the shelf. For example, the shelf panel may be pressed upward against a substantially flat form (with curved side or perimeter edges) while the glass shelf panel is heated, whereby the side edge portions of the shelf panel are bent at the perimeter edges of the form. The shelf panel may then be lowered away from the form and cooled or quenched to form the shelf panel. The formed shelf panel may be substantially planar or flat between the curved side edge portions or regions. Other forms may be implemented (as discussed below) to provide the desired function and appearance of the shelf panel, without affecting the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, each support bracket <b>16</b> includes a generally vertical portion <b>16</b><i>a </i>that may include tabs <b>24</b> or the like at a rearward end of the bracket for mounting the support bracket and shelf assembly within the refrigerator, such as in a manner known in the art. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each support bracket <b>16</b> includes a generally horizontal support portion <b>16</b><i>b </i>that extends generally horizontally from an upper end of the vertical portion <b>16</b><i>a</i>. The support portion <b>16</b><i>b </i>may be curved to receive an adhesive bonding material therealong (as discussed below) and/or to generally correspond to the curvature of the side regions <b>14</b> of panel <b>12</b> (as also discussed below).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The side regions <b>14</b> of shelf panel <b>12</b> thus may rest on the support portions <b>16</b><i>b </i>of the brackets <b>16</b> when the shelf panel is attached to the support brackets <b>16</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the lower surface <b>18</b> of the shelf panel along the side regions <b>14</b> may be bonded to the generally horizontal support portion <b>16</b><i>b </i>of support brackets <b>16</b>, such as via curing of a bonding or adhesive material <b>26</b> and utilizing bonding processes of the types described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,298,606; 6,128,860; 5,966,874; 5,704,173; and 5,551,197, which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. In the illustrated embodiment, the shelf panel <b>12</b> includes a frit layer <b>28</b> along the lower surface <b>18</b> and along the side regions <b>14</b> of the shelf panel to substantially conceal the support brackets or rails along the side regions so that the brackets or rails are not readily viewable through the shelf panel from above the shelf panel. Optionally, however, the shelf panel may not include a frit layer, and the rail or support may be bonded directly to the lower surface of the shelf panel, such as via a UV cured adhesive or the other type of cured adhesive or bonding adhesive or the like, without affecting the scope of the present invention. In such an application, the supports or rails or slide mechanisms may be viewable through the shelf panel.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The bonding adhesive <b>26</b> may be selected from a number of adhesive types or classes including moisture-activated urethanes, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,707,521, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference, moisture-activated silicones, moisture-curable activated urethanes, chemically-activated adhesives, and thermally-activated adhesives, and/or the like. Other adhesives, such as aerobically-cured, anaerobically-cured, and radiation-cured adhesives can also be used, without affecting the scope of the present invention. When cured, the bond-line thickness may be in the range of about 1 micron to 10 mm, preferably about 5 microns to 5 mm, and most preferably about 25 microns to 1 mm. The adhesive may be a moisture-activated adhesive, a chemically activated adhesive, a heat or radiation or ultraviolet or microwave radiation activated adhesive or the like, and the shelf panel and brackets or rails may be exposed to the appropriate conditions or elements or radiation to cure the adhesive and bond the shelf panel to the brackets or rails, such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,298,606; 6,128,860; 5,966,874; 5,704,173; and 5,551,197; and 5,331,784, which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Optionally, a temporary fixturing adhesive (not shown) may also be provided, such as a hot-melt thermoplastic, which temporarily locates or fixtures the bracket or rail against the panel or frit layer, while the bonding adhesive <b>26</b> cures and forms the permanent primary bond. The temporary fixturing adhesive may secure or hold the brackets to the shelf panel until the bonding process is complete and the bonding adhesive has cured and formed the permanent bond. Optionally, to improve and promote the bonding characteristics of the bonding adhesive, the glass surface (or frit layer if applicable), and/or the rail or bracket portion <b>16</b><i>a</i>, may be coated with an adhesion-promoting compound or primer, such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,298,606; 6,128,860; 5,966,874; 5,704,173; and 5,551,197, which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Optionally, and as shown in the illustrated embodiment, the glass panel may include a frit layer <b>28</b> disposed along the side regions of the shelf panel and in the areas or regions at which the brackets are bonded. Optionally, the frit layer may comprise a ceramic frit layer and may function to facilitate adhering or bonding of the edge regions of the shelf panel to the rails. The frit layer is preferably substantially opaque, and thus may improve the overall appearance of the shelf, since the bonding surfaces are not readily discernible or viewable through the shelf panel and the frit layers. Examples of such frit layers are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,298,606; 6,128,860; 5,966,874; 5,704,173; and 5,551,197, which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. The frit layer may comprise a black or substantially opaque layer, or may comprise a white layer or other color as desired, such as to match a color scheme of the refrigerator. The frit layer may be disposed onto the lower surface <b>18</b> of the shelf panel in any desired pattern, such as stripes, dots, wave pattern or the like, to provide the desired appearance to the refrigerator shelf, depending on the particular application of the shelf assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Optionally, the frit layer may be disposed or deposited on and bonded to the lower surface <b>18</b> of shelf panel <b>12</b> as an opaque frit layer, and most preferably, an opaque ceramic frit layer or coating covering and concealing a region of the surface <b>18</b> from a peripheral edge <b>14</b><i>a </i>inward. Shelf panel <b>12</b>, which may be initially in an unstrengthened or untempered condition after cutting and sizing to its desired shape, can be painted, such as by screen coating or other techniques, with a coating of ceramic paint on its lower surface <b>18</b>. Thereafter, shelf panel <b>12</b> may be heated and bent or pressed to the desired contour with a bending furnace or other bending apparatus, followed by strengthening, such as tempering, to strengthen the glass. Such heating, bending and tempering operations cause the ceramic paint to become fused to the lower surface of the shelf panel. Thus, although starting as a layer of paint containing ceramic particles and pigment, the coating ends up as a thin frit layer of ceramic material, which is fused to the lower surface of the glass shelf panel. Since the ceramic frit coating includes a pigment of a desired color, the layer results in a permanent, second or lower surface coloration of the glass shelf panel. However, and as discussed above, the rails or supports may be bonded to the lower surface of the shelf panel without any frit layer on the shelf surface, without affecting the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The refrigerator shelf of the present invention thus provides a substantially transparent or clear shelf panel (such as a strengthened or tempered glass panel) that is mounted to or bonded to support brackets or rails with no caps or lips extending over the perimeter edges and onto the upper surface of the shelf panel. The shelf panel may be formed to have a desired raised shape or lip along one or more of the perimeter edges or regions to limit spillage of liquids over the formed or curved perimeter region or regions. The present invention thus provides a strengthened or tempered glass shelf that is bonded to the support brackets and that has upwardly turned or curved perimeter edge regions. Optionally, and desirably, the mounting or bonding portions of the supports or brackets may have bumps or raised portions or dimples or protrusions spaced along the generally horizontal portion of the supports to set the desired or appropriate bond gap or bond layer thickness between the shelf panel surface and the mating surface of the supports or rails or brackets.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Preferably, the shelf panel of the present invention comprises a substantially clear or transparent panel and the bracket comprises a polished or finished metal bracket (such as a painted or coated bracket or a brushed aluminum bracket or a brushed or polished stainless steel bracket or the like). Such a substantially clear shelf panel is often desired for various refrigerator applications or other food storage containers or cabinets or freezers or the like. The brackets and shelf panel of the present invention may be attached or secured or bonded together via a curable adhesive bonding material, and the curable adhesive bonding material may be selected to be substantially transparent or clear and, preferably, may be index matched or substantially index matched to the glass material (which may have an optical index of approximately 1.45 to approximately 1.55, more preferably about 1.48 to about 1.53, and more preferably about 1.5 to about 1.52) and may have few to no bubbles or other noticeable imperfections. Thus, a person viewing through the shelf panel from above may principally see or view the bracket and the mounting portion of the bracket under the shelf and not the adhesive or any other materials or components of the shelf assembly. Optionally, the mounting surfaces or portions of the brackets may be textured or finished or otherwise formed/processed so as to be aesthetically pleasing or cosmetically attractive for viewing through the shelf panel and the adhesive bonding layer. Optionally, spacers or beads or the like may be positioned along the bond line to space the shelf panel the appropriate or desired amount above the mounting portion of the brackets, so as to provide a desired bond layer thickness between the mounting portions and the shelf panel. Optionally, and desirably, such spacers or beads may also be optically index matched with the adhesive material and/or the glass panel material.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Optionally, the perimeter regions of the shelf panel may be formed to have other shapes, without affecting the scope of the present invention. For example, a refrigerator shelf assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>) may include a shelf panel <b>12</b>&#x2032; that is pressed or formed or curved to have a channel or trough <b>30</b> along the perimeter side edges or regions <b>14</b>&#x2032;. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the shelf support or rail <b>16</b>&#x2032; may include a curved generally horizontal portion <b>16</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; that is curved to form a channel that generally corresponds to the shape of the side regions <b>14</b>&#x2032; of the shelf panel <b>12</b>&#x2032;. The shelf panel may be bonded to the shelf brackets via a bonding material <b>26</b>&#x2032;, and the lower surface <b>18</b>&#x2032; of shelf panel <b>12</b>&#x2032; may include a frit layer <b>28</b>&#x2032; along the side regions <b>14</b>&#x2032;, in a similar manner as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Similarly, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, a refrigerator shelf assembly <b>10</b>&#x2033; may include a shelf panel <b>12</b>&#x2033; that has a raised bump <b>32</b> or reversed channel or trough formed along the perimeter side edges or regions <b>14</b>&#x2033;. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the shelf support or bracket or rail <b>16</b>&#x2033; may include a curved generally horizontal portion <b>16</b><i>b</i>&#x2033; that is curved to form a channel for receiving the bonding material <b>26</b>&#x2033; therealong to bond the panel to the support bracket. The lower surface <b>18</b>&#x2033; of shelf panel <b>12</b>&#x2033; may include a frit layer <b>28</b>&#x2033; along the side regions <b>14</b>&#x2033; in a similar manner as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Optionally, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, the refrigerator shelf assembly <b>110</b> may include a substantially flat shelf panel <b>112</b> that is supported on support brackets or rails <b>116</b>. The perimeter side regions <b>114</b> may be bonded to a generally horizontal and partially curved support portion <b>116</b><i>b </i>of brackets <b>116</b> via a bonding material <b>126</b> in a similar manner as described above. The shelf panel <b>112</b> may include a frit layer <b>128</b> along the lower surface <b>118</b> and along the side regions <b>114</b>, such as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Optionally, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the support bracket <b>116</b>&#x2032; may include a carrier member <b>134</b> that is bonded to the shelf panel <b>112</b>&#x2032; and that engages or attaches to or receives a portion of the generally horizontal support portions <b>116</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; to secure the shelf panel <b>112</b>&#x2032; to the support brackets <b>116</b>&#x2032;. In the illustrated embodiment, the carrier member <b>134</b> is a generally C-shaped member extending along the lower surface and side regions of the shelf panel (when bonded thereto) and receives an edge or end <b>116</b><i>c</i>&#x2032; of the horizontal portion <b>116</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; of the support bracket <b>116</b>&#x2032;. The carrier member <b>134</b> may be bonded to the lower surface <b>118</b>&#x2032; of panel <b>112</b>&#x2032;, and preferably to a frit layer <b>128</b>&#x2032; at the bonding area <b>126</b>&#x2032; along the edge portion <b>114</b>&#x2032; of the panel <b>112</b>&#x2032;. Such a carrier member may be suitable for use with any of the other shelf panels of the present invention, such as the upwardly curved or channel shaped shelf panels, without affecting the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Optionally, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the support bracket or rail <b>116</b>&#x2033; of a shelf assembly <b>110</b>&#x2033; may include a generally vertical portion <b>116</b><i>a</i>&#x2033; that extends upward above the generally horizontal portion <b>116</b><i>b</i>&#x2033; and that extends or protrudes above the upper surface <b>136</b> of the shelf panel <b>112</b>&#x2033;, in order to provide a lip <b>138</b> at least partially along the side edge of the shelf panel to provide a spill proof function to the refrigerator shelf assembly <b>110</b>&#x2033;. The shelf panel <b>112</b>&#x2033; may be substantially flat or planar (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) or may include generally flat side regions or edge portions <b>114</b>&#x2033; or curved or bent side regions or edge portions, without affecting the scope of the present invention. The lower surface <b>118</b>&#x2033; of the shelf panel <b>112</b>&#x2033; may include a frit layer <b>128</b>&#x2033; thereon and may be bonded (at bonding region <b>126</b>&#x2033;) to the generally horizontal portion <b>116</b><i>b</i>&#x2033; of the shelf support brackets <b>116</b>&#x2033;, in a similar manner as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Optionally, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a shelf panel <b>112</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; of a shelf assembly <b>110</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; may be slidably or movably mounted to the support rails or brackets <b>116</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; and may be movable along the support rails or brackets, such as via a slide mechanism or roller mechanism <b>144</b> or the like. For example, the support bracket or rail <b>116</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; may include a roller or rollers <b>144</b><i>a </i>(such as two or more rollers spaced along the support bracket) that extend from the rail <b>116</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; and rollingly engage or rotatably support a carrier or rail <b>144</b><i>b </i>of a shelf panel <b>112</b>&#x2032;&#x2033;. The carrier <b>144</b><i>b </i>may be an elongated rail that defines a channel or track <b>144</b><i>c </i>for rotatably receiving the rollers <b>144</b><i>a</i>, such that an upper surface <b>144</b><i>d </i>of the channel or track <b>144</b><i>c </i>rests on the rollers <b>144</b><i>a </i>when the shelf panel is mounted to the support or rail or bracket <b>116</b>&#x2032;&#x2033;. The carrier <b>144</b><i>b </i>may be bonded to the lower surface <b>118</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; of shelf panel <b>112</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; (and optionally may be bonded to a frit layer along the lower surface of the shelf panel), such as via a bonding adhesive <b>126</b>&#x2032;&#x2033;. The shelf panel <b>112</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; thus may be slidably or movably mounted to the support rail <b>116</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; to facilitate movement of the shelf panel along the support rails or channels. Although shown as a roller and track mechanism, other moving or rolling or sliding means may be implemented to provide relative movement between the shelf panel and the generally fixed support that is mounted in the refrigerator, without affecting the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Optionally, the front and/or rear perimeter regions or edges of the shelf panel may be curved or formed to provide a spill proof function and/or to provide a handle or the like for a user to grasp to move the shelf, such as to lift the shelf to detach the support brackets or rails from the support within the refrigerator, such as to adjust a height or position of the shelf within the refrigerator. For example, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the forward edge <b>120</b> of the shelf panel may be curved upwardly to provide a spill proof edge along the front of the shelf panel. Optionally, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the forward edge <b>120</b>&#x2032; may be curved to form a bump <b>132</b> along the front edge of the shelf panel. Alternately, the forward edge <b>120</b>&#x2033; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) may be generally flat and may be received within and along an extruded member or lip <b>140</b> that may provide a handle function and/or a spill proof function along the front edge of the shelf panel. Other shapes or curvatures or forms may be implemented may be implemented without affecting the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a shelf panel <b>212</b> may have a bump or raised curvature <b>232</b> along the front edge portion <b>220</b> and along the side portions <b>214</b> (and optionally along the rear edge portion (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>) as well) to form a shelf panel that provides a spill proof function substantially or entirely around the perimeter of the shelf panel. The curved perimeter regions may be formed by pressing the strengthened or tempered or toughened glass panel or sheet against a desired form to bend the glass to the desired shape along one or more of its perimeter regions or edges. The panel may be cut or otherwise formed to have a handle portion <b>242</b> at a generally central region along the front edge portion <b>220</b>. Optionally, it is envisioned that the front region may include a frit layer along at least a portion of the front of the shelf panel to enhance the appearance of the shelf and/or to make the handle portion readily viewable and discernible, depending on the application of the shelf assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Optionally, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, a shelf panel <b>312</b> may include an upper frame portion or form or guard <b>346</b> bonded to the upper surface <b>336</b> of shelf panel <b>312</b> and along one or more edge regions <b>314</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>322</b> of the shelf panel. The upper form <b>346</b> may be bonded to the upper surface <b>336</b>, such as via a bonding adhesive <b>326</b>, such as described above. The upper form or forms are thus bonded to the upper and often Class A finish surface (i.e. a surface readily viewable by a user of the refrigerator and thus required to be aesthetically and functionally acceptable) of the shelf panel. Optionally, the upper form or forms may be bonded to a frit layer at the upper surface of the shelf panel, without affecting the scope of the present invention. The upper form or forms may comprise a polymeric or plastic material or may comprise a metallic material or the like, without affecting the scope of the present invention. The upper form <b>346</b> provides a spill containment function to the otherwise generally flat surface of the shelf panel along the edge region or regions.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The upper form <b>346</b> may be bonded to the upper surface along the front and/or rear perimeter regions of the shelf panel, particularly for applications where the side regions of the shelf panel are turned upwardly or otherwise formed to provide a spill containment function. Alternately, or additionally, the form may be bonded to the upper surface along the side perimeter regions of the shelf panel, particularly for applications where the front and rear perimeter regions are upwardly turned or otherwise formed to provide a spill containment function. Optionally, an upper frame portion may comprise four sections unitarily formed or joined together and bonded to the upper surface of the shelf panel and along all four perimeter regions of the shelf panel to provide a spill containment function around the perimeter of the shelf panel.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Although shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> as a curved or half-moon shaped form, the upper form or forms or frame may be any other shape or form, without affecting the scope of the present invention. It is further envisioned that the upper form or forms or frame may be shaped or molded or otherwise formed to provide other functions. For example, the form or forms may be shaped or molded or otherwise formed to provide a storage or holding function for holding or storing refrigerated items, such as bottles or cans or eggs or the like. For example, the form or forms may include generally cylindrical depressions or recesses for receiving bottles or cans, or may include depressions or recesses for holding or receiving other items, such as eggs or the like. The forms or frame thus may be larger than the form shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, and may encroach further onto and over the upper surface of the shelf panel to provide for sufficient sized shapes or depressions or recesses or the like for receiving and/or holding and/or retaining the appropriate items or goods thereon. The upper frame or form of the present invention thus may provide a spill containment function and/or a food/drink/etc. storage or holding or retaining function at or near or along the perimeter regions of the upper surface of the shelf panel, and optionally along other regions of the upper surface of the shelf panel as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Optionally, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, a shelf assembly <b>410</b> includes a shelf panel <b>412</b> supported on support rails or slides or roller assemblies <b>416</b>. The shelf panel <b>412</b> comprises a glass panel with a generally planar central or storage portion <b>412</b><i>a </i>and an upwardly turned or curved perimeter portion or spill prevention portion <b>414</b>. The perimeter portion <b>414</b> includes opposite upwardly turned or curved side edge portions <b>414</b><i>a</i>, an upwardly turned or curved front edge portion <b>414</b><i>b </i>and an upwardly turned or curved rear edge portion <b>414</b><i>c</i>, so that the entire perimeter edge portion of the shelf panel is curved or bent upwardly to limit or substantially preclude spillage. The shelf panel thus may provide a substantially planar support portion and a four-sided integrated spill protection portion that circumscribes the circumference or entire perimeter of the substantially planar support portion of the shelf panel.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The shelf panel may comprise a tempered glass panel and may be substantially transparent or translucent so that a person may readily view items through the shelf panel or panels of a refrigerator. Optionally, the glass may comprise a thermally tempered glass or a chemically tempered glass, whereby the glass panel may be made with a reduced thickness of about one millimeter thick or thereabouts, while providing enhanced strength over other types of glass materials. The panel may be press bent or pressed against a form so as to form generally upwardly turned perimeter regions or edge portions to limit or substantially preclude spillage of liquids over the front, rear and/or sides of the shelf panel. For example, the shelf panel may be pressed upward against a substantially flat form (with curved perimeter edges) while the glass shelf panel is heated or at an elevated temperature, whereby the perimeter edge portions of the shelf panel are bent at the perimeter edges of the form. The shelf panel may then be lowered away from the form and cooled or quenched (such as air quenched) to form the shelf panel. The formed shelf panel may be substantially planar or flat at the central, support or storage region.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Optionally, the shelf panel may be formed via other forming techniques, such as glass molding or the like, to achieve the desired form. Optionally, anchor points or bumps or the like may be molded into the lower surface of the side edge portions of the molded shelf panel to provide anchor points for setting the bracket location. Optionally, a portion of the bracket may be molded with the shelf panel so as to provide an integrally or unitarily molded shelf panel and bracket portion. Desirably, the shelf panel comprises substantially clear or transparent glass, but may comprise a tinted glass or colored glass or a plastic material or the like, and may have a pattern or frit layer or the like screened or otherwise applied to the glass or plastic material.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As shown in FIGS. <b>18</b> and <b>20</b>-<b>23</b>, the front and side perimeter edge portions <b>414</b><i>b</i>, <b>414</b><i>a </i>of shelf panel <b>412</b> may protrude upwardly, such as, for example, about five to ten millimeters or thereabouts, while the rear perimeter edge portion <b>414</b><i>c </i>may protrude upwardly a greater amount, such as, for example, about ten to fifteen millimeters or thereabouts, in order to provide a greater lip or raised edge portion along the rear of the shelf panel to substantially preclude items from falling off the rear of the shelf panel. For example, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23</figref>, <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>, the rear edge portion may be turned upwardly to provide a spill prevention lip that extends upward about 14.5 mm from a lower surface of the shelf panel, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23</figref>, <b>25</b> and <b>27</b> illustrate that the front edge portion <b>414</b><i>b </i>and/or the side edge portions <b>414</b><i>a </i>may be turned upwardly to provide a spill prevention lip that extends upward about 10 mm from the lower surface of the shelf panel. The shelf panel <b>412</b> and the edge portions <b>414</b><i>a</i>, <b>414</b><i>b</i>, <b>414</b><i>c </i>may be formed and sized to provide the desired generally planar shelf support area and desired spill limiting perimeter lip for the refrigerator shelf. For example, and as can be seen with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</figref>, the shelf panel may have cross dimensions X, Y (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>) of about 435 mm by about 444 mm, with a generally planar support portion having cross dimensions X&#x2032;, Y&#x2032; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>) of about 402 mm by about 397 mm. Such a configuration thus may provide a substantially large generally planar support portion with a reduced amount of the overall shelf length and width dimensions being dedicated to the formation of the upwardly turned spill prevention portions.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The shelf panel <b>412</b> is supported by a pair of opposite rails or support brackets <b>416</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, and as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 27</figref>, the side perimeter edge portions <b>414</b><i>a </i>are curved upwardly and provide a substantially planar attachment region <b>414</b><i>d </i>for attaching a substantially planar bracket attachment portion <b>416</b><i>b </i>of the support brackets <b>416</b> thereto, as discussed below. For example, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, the side edge portion <b>414</b><i>a </i>may have an upwardly turned angle of approximately 30 degrees (but could be formed at other angles, without affecting the scope of the present invention). The front edge portion and/or rear edge portion may have a similar upwardly turned angle, or may have a greater or lesser upward angle. For example, the front and side edge portions may have similar upward angles (such as about 30 degrees), while the rear edge portion is curved or bent or formed at a greater angle, such as, for example, about 60 degrees, without affecting the scope of the present invention. Such a difference in angles between the side edge portions <b>414</b><i>a </i>and the rear edge portion <b>414</b><i>c </i>can be seen with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref>. The upward angle of the side edge portions may be selected to correspond to the upward angle of the angled attachment portion <b>416</b><i>b </i>of the support brackets, so that the support brackets substantially uniformly engage the side edge portions of the shelf panel, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the rear perimeter edge portion <b>414</b><i>c </i>may be curved or angled upwardly and may be curved upwardly from a location, for example, about 30 mm (or thereabouts) inward from the rear edge (which defines the rear perimeter edge region of the planar portion <b>412</b><i>a</i>). The rear perimeter edge portion <b>414</b><i>c </i>may curve upwardly at a desired angle and may provide a generally planar or flat region of about 6 mm or thereabouts at an upper portion of the rear edge portion <b>414</b><i>c</i>. Likewise, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, the side perimeter regions or portions <b>414</b><i>a </i>may curve upwardly from a side perimeter edge of the planar portion <b>412</b><i>a</i>, such as at a location, for example, about 25 mm (or thereabouts) inward from the outer edge of the shelf panel. The side perimeter regions <b>414</b><i>a </i>may curve upwardly and may provide the generally planar attachment portion or surface <b>414</b><i>d</i>, which may have a generally planar surface of, for example, about 12 mm wide or thereabouts along the length or substantially along the length of the side perimeter portions <b>414</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Support brackets <b>416</b> may be similar to the brackets described above, and may include a generally vertical arm portion <b>416</b><i>a </i>and an angled attachment portion <b>416</b><i>b </i>for attaching or adhering to the attachment portion or surface <b>414</b><i>d </i>of the upwardly turned perimeter side edge portions <b>414</b><i>a </i>of shelf panel <b>412</b>. In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, brackets <b>416</b> are roller assemblies that include roller bearings such that the shelf panel may be substantially smoothly moved between a retracted position and an extended position to ease loading and unloading of items on the shelf. Although shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> as a roller support assembly, the bracket may comprise a static bracket or a friction slider type bracket or a roller/slider type bracket, without affecting the scope of the present invention. For example, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the bracket <b>416</b>&#x2032; may comprise a static bracket with a generally vertical arm portion <b>416</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; and an angled attachment portion <b>416</b><i>b</i>&#x2032;, with the angled attachment portion <b>416</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; angling upward and laterally outward (and angled at an angled or bent region or knee region <b>416</b><i>e</i>&#x2032;) to substantially coincide with the angle of the perimeter edge portions. Optionally, the bracket attachment portion may angle downwardly and inwardly, with the vertical arm portion at the outward portion of the bracket, or the bracket attachment portion may be generally horizontal and may extend laterally inward to attach to the lower surface of the generally planar support portion of the shelf panel, without affecting the scope of the present invention. Optionally, and desirably, the mounting or bonding portions of the support rails or brackets may have bumps or raised portions or dimples or protrusions (such as protrusions <b>416</b><i>f</i>&#x2032; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) spaced along the angled attachment portion to set the desired or appropriate bond gap or bond layer thickness between the shelf panel surface and the mating surface of the supports or rails or brackets.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The brackets may comprise any suitable material, such as a metallic material, such as a powder coated metallic material (such as a white powder coat or a stainless steel looking powder coat or other coatings) or other metallic materials, such as stainless steel or the like, or may comprise a plastic or polymeric material, without affecting the scope of the present invention. Optionally, and particularly for slide out or roller bracket applications, the front portion of the shelf panel may include a handle portion formed or established thereon. For example, a handle portion or gripping or grasping element may be bonded to the front portion (such as to the lower surface of the planar support portion and/or of the upwardly turned front portion), to provide a means for a person to readily grasp the shelf panel to pull the shelf panel outward, such as for loading or unloading items at the shelf panel.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, attachment portion <b>416</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; of bracket <b>416</b>&#x2032; is angled relative to arm portion <b>416</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; to generally correspond with the planar attachment region <b>414</b><i>d </i>of side perimeter edge portions <b>414</b><i>a </i>of shelf panel <b>412</b>. A bead of suitable adhesive <b>417</b> (such as discussed below) may be applied along the attachment portion of the bracket and/or along the attachment region of the side perimeter edge portion, and the bracket may then be pressed against the attachment region of the shelf panel to adhere or bond the bracket to the shelf panel. As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the attachment portion <b>416</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; may include a channel or groove <b>416</b><i>c</i>&#x2032; therealong that receives and retains excess adhesive when the bracket is pressed against the attachment region of the shelf and with a bead of adhesive therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The attachment portion <b>416</b><i>b </i>thus may be readily adhered to or bonded to the attachment region <b>414</b><i>d</i>, such as via a bead of adhesive or the like. Desirably, the adhesive may comprise a transparent adhesive, such as a transparent or substantially transparent epoxy or acrylate or the like. Optionally, the adhesive may comprise a UV curable adhesive, such as a UV curable acrylate or epoxy or a UV curable optically matching adhesive, such as the optical adhesives of the types commercially available from Norland Products of Cranbury, N.J., or other suitable transparent or substantially transparent adhesive. Such UV curable adhesives provide rapid curing or bonding of the glass shelf panel to the support bracket after the bracket is pressed against the attachment portion of the panel with the adhesive therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Preferably, the adhesive is selected to be at least partially to substantially space filling so that any tolerances or gaps between the attachment portion <b>416</b>&#x2032; of bracket <b>416</b>&#x2032; and the lower attachment region <b>414</b><i>d </i>of shelf panel <b>412</b> are filled in or taken up by the adhesive. Preferably, the adhesive is a clear or substantially transparent adhesive to limit viewability of the adhesive. Optionally, beads, such as index matching beads, such as glass beads or fibers or polymeric beads or fibers or the like, may be provided so that the adhesive has an enhanced space filling function between the bracket and the shelf panel.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Optionally, the attachment regions of the shelf panel may have a non-transparent coating or frit layer or paint or ink or the like disposed thereon, so as to substantially conceal the support bracket and limit viewing of the support bracket and adhesive through the shelf panel. The frit layer may be disposed or established on the underside of the shelf panel. However, because the lower surface of the shelf panel typically may pass over and contact rollers while the glass is still hot (during manufacturing of the shelf panel), it may be desirable to dispose or establish a frit or paint or ink layer or coating on the upper surface of the shelf panel and along the side attachment regions, while the support bracket is bonded or adhered to the lower uncoated glass surface of the shelf panel. Optionally, the frit or paint or ink layer or coating may be disposed or screened onto either the lower surface or upper surface of the shelf panel after forming the shelf panel. In applications where a non-transparent frit layer or other pattern or the like may be disposed at the attachment portion of the shelf panel, the adhesive may comprise a substantially non-transparent adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Therefore, the present invention provides a substantially transparent glass shelf panel that is bonded along the side regions of its lower surface to a pair of side shelf support brackets so as to avoid interference or intrusion onto the upper surface of the shelf panel. The shelf panel may be formed to have curvatures along one or more side or front or rear perimeter portions or regions, in order to provide the desired appearance and function, such as a spill proof function or handle function or the like, to the shelf panel. The shelf panel may include a frit layer along its lower surface and in the bonding area along the shelf support brackets to conceal the brackets so that they are not readily discernible and viewable through the substantially transparent glass shelf panel. The shelf panel may include an upper frame or form bonded to the upper surface of the shelf panel to provide a spill containment function and/or a storage or holding function at the upper surface of the shelf panel.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Changes and modifications to the specifically described embodiments can be carried out without departing from the principles of the present invention, which is intended to be limited only by the scope of the appended claims as interpreted according to the principles of patent law.</p>
