The computerized code includes instructions that are executed by at least one processor <b>14</b> to provide functions for the modules. Details of these operations are as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The setting module <b>100</b> defines a magnification instruction that is used for magnifying content of the webpage displayed on the touch screen <b>11</b>, and defines a return instruction for returning to display the webpage before the webpage is magnified on the touch screen <b>11</b>. The setting module <b>100</b> further defines trigger instructions for magnification modes (including an automatic mode and a manual mode) of the webpage. In one embodiment, the automatic mode is a mode that divides the webpage into a plurality of sections automatically, and confirming a section as a target area to be magnified according to user selection. The manual mode represents a mode that allows the user to randomly choose and confirm the target area on the webpage to be magnified. In one embodiment, the setting module <b>100</b> may set a plurality of keys or virtual keys of the electronic device <b>1</b> to invoke the magnification instruction, the return instruction, and the trigger instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The setting module <b>100</b> further sets the webpage to be divided into N*M sections for the automatic mode. &#x201c;N&#x201d; represents a number of horizontal sections of the webpage, and &#x201c;M&#x201d; represents a number of vertical sections of the webpage. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the setting module <b>100</b> may set the webpage to be divided into &#x201c;2*3&#x201d; sections. Therefore, the webpage on the touch screen <b>11</b> may be divided into six sections.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The detection module <b>102</b> detects input instructions according to user input after the electronic device <b>1</b> requests the web server <b>3</b> to browse the webpage using the browser <b>12</b> and the touch screen <b>11</b> displays the webpage. The input instructions may include the magnification instruction, the return instruction, and the trigger instruction for the automatic mode and the manual mode.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The first determination module <b>104</b> determines whether the electronic device <b>1</b> has detected the magnification instruction according to the detected input instruction.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The first confirmation module <b>106</b> confirms a selected magnification mode according to the trigger instruction detected by the electronic device <b>1</b>. In one embodiment, if the electronic device <b>1</b> has detected the trigger instruction for the automatic mode, the first confirmation module <b>106</b> confirms that the selected magnification mode is the automatic mode. If the electronic device <b>1</b> has detected the trigger instruction for the manual mode, the first confirmation module <b>106</b> confirms that the selected magnification mode is the manual mode.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The second confirmation module <b>108</b> confirms a target area to be magnified in the webpage on the touch screen <b>11</b>, according to the selected magnification mode and touch operations on the touch screen <b>11</b> from the user. Details of confirming the target area are as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The magnification module <b>110</b> magnifies the content of the target area by displaying enlarging content of the target area to fit a screen size of the touch screen <b>11</b> (e.g., a full screen).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one embodiment, if the selected magnification mode is the automatic mode, the second confirmation module <b>108</b> confirms the target area by the following steps. In one embodiment, a resolution of the touch screen <b>11</b> is &#x201c;A*B&#x201d;, where &#x201c;A&#x201d; represents horizontal pixels of the resolution, and &#x201c;B&#x201d; represents vertical pixels of the resolution. The second confirmation module <b>108</b> divides the webpage on the touch screen <b>11</b> into the &#x201c;N*M&#x201d; sections by marking the horizontal pixels of &#x201c;(A&#xf7;N)&#x201d;, &#x201c;(A&#xf7;N)*2&#x201d;, . . . , and &#x201c;(A&#xf7;N)*(N&#x2212;1)&#x201d; with a predetermined color, and by marking the vertical pixels of &#x201c;(B&#xf7;M&#x201d;, &#x201c;(B&#xf7;M)*2&#x201d;, . . . , and (B&#xf7;M)*(M&#x2212;1)&#x201d; with another predetermined color. The second confirmation module <b>108</b> records a trigger range for each of the sections, according to ranges of the horizontal pixels and the vertical pixels on the touch screen <b>11</b> of each section. The user may long press on any position of the touch screen <b>11</b> with a finger or a stylus, to select one section to be magnified. Long press is defined as pressing on the touch screen <b>11</b> for a few seconds, such as, pressing for 2 seconds, for example. The selected section may be confirmed according to an X coordinate value and a Y coordinate value of a touch point of the long press on the touch screen <b>11</b> and the trigger range for each of the sections. The second confirmation module <b>108</b> confirms the selected section to be the target area. In one embodiment, after the webpage has been divided into the &#x201c;N*M&#x201d; sections, if the user just tap on the touch screen <b>11</b>, and not long press on the touch screen <b>11</b>, the selected section will not be confirmed.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, if the resolution of the touch screen <b>11</b> is &#x201c;320*480&#x201d; and the setting module <b>100</b> sets the webpage to be divided into &#x201c;2*3&#x201d; sections, the second confirmation module <b>108</b> marks the horizontal pixel of &#x201c;160&#x201d; with the predetermined color (e.g., a red color), such as line &#x201c;a&#x201d; in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, for example. The second confirmation module <b>108</b> further marks the vertical pixels of &#x201c;160&#x201d; and &#x201c;320&#x201d; with the another predetermined color, such as line &#x201c;b&#x201d; and line &#x201c;c&#x201d; in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. The webpage on the touch screen <b>11</b> is divided into six sections. If the user long presses on the touch screen <b>11</b> to select a section of the second row and the first line, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, content of the selected section will display on the full screen of the touch screen <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">If the selected magnification mode is the manual mode, the user may continuously draw (slide) a finger across the touch screen <b>11</b> to generate a closed path. The closed path has successive coordinate values on the touch screen <b>11</b> and a starting point and an ending point of the successive coordinates are same or substantially the same. The second confirmation module <b>108</b> confirms the target area by the following steps. The second confirmation module <b>108</b> records successive coordinate values (X coordinate values and Y coordinate values) of the closed path drawn on the touch screen <b>11</b>, and displays the pixels on the touch screen <b>11</b> that correspond to the successive coordinate values with the predetermined color. The second confirmation module <b>108</b> confirms a rectangular area according to a minimum value of X coordinate values (denoted as Xmin), a maximum value of X coordinate values (denoted as Xmax), a minimum value of Y coordinate values (denoted as Ymin), and a maximum value of Y coordinate values (denoted as Ymax) from the recorded successive coordinate values. Four vertices of the rectangular include the vertex at the upper left corner (Xmin, Ymax), the vertex at the lower left corner (Xmin, Ymin), the vertex at the upper right corner (Xmax, Ymax), and the vertex at the lower right corner (Xmax, Ymin). The second confirmation module <b>108</b> confirms the rectangular area to be the target area. In one embodiment, if the user just taps on the touch screen <b>11</b>, or not operate the closed path, the rectangular area may not be confirmed.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">For example, the closed path slid out on the touch screen <b>11</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>, the second confirmation <b>108</b> confirms the rectangular area according to the successive coordinate values of the closed path. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>, the magnification module <b>110</b> displays content in the rectangular area on the full screen of the touch screen <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The second determination module <b>112</b> determines whether the electronic device <b>1</b> has detected the return instruction, after the content in the target area is magnified.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The recovery module <b>114</b> returns to display the webpage before the target area is magnified on the touch screen <b>11</b>, upon the condition that the electronic device <b>1</b> has detected the return instruction.</p>
