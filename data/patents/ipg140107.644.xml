<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A furring channel framing member for use with joists or studs of a structural support framework for a wall or ceiling includes one or more creases placed specifically to provide a location for curvature of the framing member. In some cases, the one or more creases may establish a flex joint that permits hand-bending of the framing member about such flex joint to create a desired curved configuration for the furring channel framing member. The creases may also or instead placed at pre-determined intervals in a manner that, through the creases themselves, establish a curvilinear configuration of the framing member.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/524,178, filed on Aug. 16, 2011 and entitled &#x201c;Furring Channel Framing Member,&#x201d; the content of which being incorporated herein in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to structural support devices generally, and more particularly to furring channel framing members which may be configured to be sufficiently flexible to be hand-bendable, even when formed from relatively thick gauge material. Such hand-bendable furring channel framing members are particularly suitable in the construction of non-planar structures. Other furring channel framing members of the present invention are curved to a pre-determined extent and configuration with creases placed at certain locations of the framing members.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In light-frame construction, furring strips are long thin strips of wood or metal used to make backing surfaces to support the finished surfaces in a room. The term &#x201c;furring&#x201d; refers to the backing surface, the process of installing it, and may also refer to the strips themselves. Typically, furring strips may be laid out and secured perpendicularly to studs or joists, or simply set against an existing wall surface.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In metal framing systems, furring members are formed as generally U-shaped channels, which are often referred to as &#x201c;hat channels&#x201d;. The furring channels are typically secured to structural support members, such as studs, to serve as a mounting location for gypsum board, plywood, drywall, or the like. Such a furring system is widely employed in the construction of walls and ceilings, and have found particular use in sound isolation applications, wherein the finishing surface may be spaced from, and acoustically isolated from, the support framing.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some applications, furring systems are employed to established curved wall and ceiling constructions. To accommodate the necessary furring channel bending, conventional approaches typically utilize a resilient furring channel material, or a furring channel with a sufficiently thin material gauge to render the overall structure suitably flexible to accommodate bending into a curved configuration. Currently available products, however, are either too flexible to support long-span bridging in large-scale construction projects, or are too inflexible to permit on-site bending, and therefore rely upon custom-bending from the manufacturer to meet specific curve criteria of the construction project. Conventional products, therefore, do not provide for furring channels that possess substantial structural integrity, while nonetheless being hand-bendable at the construction site to permit custom-curving by the installer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a furring channel framing member that is sufficiently flexible to permit custom-curving of the member by an installer at the construction site. It is a further object to provide the furring channel framing member with sufficient material rigidity to establish a curved structural support member across relatively large spans.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another object of the present invention is to provide a custom-curved furring channel framing member.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">By means of the present invention, a furring channel framing member may be custom-curved at the installation site without the need for channel bending equipment. The hand-bendable structural framing member is specifically configured to provide both strength and flexibility in a custom-modifiable configuration. The furring channel framing member of the present invention, therefore, may be operably positioned in a curved arrangement as, for example, a convenient mounting location for wall or ceiling finishing materials to form a non-planar finished surface.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a particular embodiment, the furring channel framing member of the present invention includes a base having first and second side edges, a length, and a first crease extending between the first and second side edges and having a first apex that is spaced from a plane of a portion of the base adjacent to the first crease. The framing member further includes first and second legs extending respectively from the first and second side edges from the base and along the length to form a channel bounded by the base and the first and second legs. The first leg includes a second crease, and the second leg includes a third crease. A first flange extends outwardly from the first leg along a first direction, and includes a fourth crease, and a second flange extends outwardly from the second leg along a second direction that is substantially opposite to the first direction, wherein the first and second flanges are substantially parallel to the base. The second flange includes a fifth crease, wherein the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth creases together form a flex joint. The framing member may include a plurality of the flex joints spaced apart along the length to define one or more discrete zones between adjacent sets of two of the flex joints.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another aspect of the present invention, a furring channel framing member may be custom-curved to a specific pre-determined extent with creases placed at certain locations of the furring channel framing member. While not necessarily hand-bendable, such framing members are useful for establishing a curved surface against which to mount wall or ceiling finishing materials.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A furring channel framing member for use with joists or studs of a structural support framework for a wall or ceiling includes a base having an outer surface and an inner surface, first and second side edges, and a length. The furring channel framing member further includes first and second legs extending respectively from the first and second side edges of the base and along the length to form a channel bounded by the base and the first and second legs. Each of the first and second legs extend from a respective one of the first and second side edges to respective first and second terminus edges. A first flange extends outwardly from the terminus edge of the first leg along a first direction, and a second flange extends outwardly from the terminus edge of the second leg along a second direction that is substantially opposite to the first direction, and wherein the first and second flanges are substantially parallel to the base. The furring channel framing member further includes at least one of a first crease in the base extending between the first and second side edges and having a first apex spaced from a plane of a portion of the base adjacent to the first crease, and a flange crease extending from the terminus edge from the first leg along a first direction. The flange crease includes a second apex that is spaced from a plane of a portion of the first flange adjacent to the flange crease. The furring channel framing member forms a curvilinear surface extending between the joists or studs of the structural support framework.</p>

Other embodiments and aspects of the invention are recognized as being within the grasp of those having ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">With reference now to the drawing figures, and first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a non-planar structural support assembly <b>2</b> may be efficiently constructed with the devices of the present invention. Non-planar structural support assembly <b>2</b> may be arranged to support finishing materials, such as drywall, gypsum board, wood paneling, and the like in a non-planar configuration for, e.g. walls and ceilings. In the example embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, non-planar structural support assembly <b>2</b> includes a plurality of furring channel framing members <b>10</b> each arranged in a curvilinear configuration and secured to structural framing studs <b>4</b>. The resultant assembly establishes suitable surfaces upon which to securely anchor finishing materials to assembly <b>2</b> in a non-planar configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an enlarged view of a portion of assembly <b>2</b> to more clearly depict the interaction of furring channel framing member <b>10</b> with structural framing stud <b>4</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, furring channel framing member <b>10</b> is secured to a mounting surface <b>6</b> of structural framing stud <b>4</b>, such that framing member <b>10</b> establishes an outer surface <b>14</b> to which finishing materials may be secured to assembly <b>12</b> and spaced from structural framing stud <b>4</b>. As indicated above, the provision of a finishing material securement surface that is spaced from the structural framing support offers several advantages, including acoustical benefits.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Furring channel framing member <b>10</b> includes a base <b>12</b> having an outer surface <b>14</b> and an inner surface <b>16</b>, first and second side edges <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, and a length &#x201c;L&#x201d;. Base <b>12</b> further includes one or more first creases <b>22</b> extending between first and second side edges <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> and arrayed along length &#x201c;L&#x201d;. The array of a plurality of first creases <b>22</b> defines discrete base zones <b>24</b> between sets of adjacent first creases <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, first creases <b>22</b> extend substantially transverse to length &#x201c;L&#x201d; of base <b>12</b>, substantially perpendicularly between first and second side edges <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>. First creases <b>22</b> may extend completely across base <b>12</b> between first and second side edges <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>. Preferably, first creases <b>22</b> have a first crease length L<sub>1 </sub>that is at least 50%, and more preferably at least 80% of a width dimension &#x201c;W<sub>1</sub>&#x201d; of base <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">First creases <b>22</b> may be spaced apart along length &#x201c;L&#x201d; by equal or unequal spacing dimensions &#x201c;L<sub>2</sub>&#x201d; so as to provide framing member <b>10</b> with a desired degree of flexibility about respective pivot axes established in part by first creases <b>22</b>. In some embodiments, such spacing dimension &#x201c;L<sub>2</sub>&#x201d; may be, for example, four inches, six inches, or eight inches. However, it is contemplated that a variety of spacing dimensions &#x201c;L<sub>2</sub>&#x201d; may be employed in framing member <b>10</b> to accomplish desired flexibility characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">First creases <b>22</b> may each be arranged transverse to longitudinal axis <b>76</b>, or may instead be variously oriented between first and second side edges <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>. Typically, however, first creases <b>22</b> are employed to assist in establishing a pivot axis <b>23</b> at least partially transverse to longitudinal axis <b>76</b> for bending frame member <b>10</b> thereabout to form an overall curved configuration for framing member <b>10</b>. It is contemplated that framing member <b>10</b> may be fabricated from a single piece of metal, such as steel, and may be formed from various thickness gauges, including, for example, between thickness gauges of 0.012 and 0.025 in. Greater material thicknesses may require reduced spacing dimensions &#x201c;L<sub>2</sub>&#x201d; in order to effectuate sufficient flexibility for framing member <b>10</b>. Therefore, generally, spacing dimension &#x201c;L<sub>2</sub>&#x201d; may be increased as the gauge thickness of framing member <b>10</b> is decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">First creases <b>22</b> each include a first apex <b>26</b> that is spaced from a base plane <b>28</b> of a portion of base <b>12</b> adjacent to first crease <b>22</b> by a first apex dimension L<sub>3</sub>. First creases <b>22</b> may be formed in base <b>12</b> with respective first apexes <b>26</b> extending first apex dimension L<sub>3 </sub>outwardly from outer surface <b>14</b> or inwardly from inner surface <b>16</b>. Most typically, however, first creases <b>22</b> are formed with respective first apexes <b>26</b> formed inwardly from inner surface <b>16</b>, such that finishing materials (e.g. drywall, plywood, etc.) may be applied flush to outer surface <b>14</b> of framing member <b>10</b>. First creases <b>22</b> may have angles &#x3b1;<sub>1 </sub>and &#x3b1;<sub>2 </sub>of between about 15 and about 75&#xb0;. It has been determined by the Applicant that such crease angles provide strength and rigidity to framing member <b>10</b> both in an unstressed initial configuration, as well as subsequent to bending and forming operations wherein first creases <b>22</b> are altered in configuration with respect to an initial, pre-formed configuration. Moreover, such first creases <b>22</b> facilitate bending of framing member <b>10</b> about respective pivot axes established at least partially by first creases <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Framing member <b>10</b> further includes first and second legs <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> extending respectively from first and second side edges <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> of base <b>12</b> and along length &#x201c;L&#x201d; to form a substantially U-shaped channel <b>34</b> bounded by base <b>12</b> and first and second legs <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. In some embodiments, first and second legs <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> may extend from base <b>12</b> in a substantially common direction so as to be substantially parallel to one another. However, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, first and second legs <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> may extend from base <b>12</b> along respective third and fourth angles &#x3b1;<sub>3</sub>, &#x3b1;<sub>4 </sub>which result in somewhat non-parallel orientations for first and second legs <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. Third and fourth angles &#x3b1;<sub>3</sub>, &#x3b1;<sub>4 </sub>may generally be between 80-150&#xb0;, and more preferably between about 90&#xb0; and 135&#xb0;. In the illustrated embodiment, &#x3b1;<sub>3 </sub>and &#x3b1;<sub>4 </sub>are substantially equal, and are about 100&#xb0;-130&#xb0;. Such a configuration for framing member <b>10</b> has been found by Applicants to provide a stable, and yet hand-bendable furring channel structure.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Each of first and second legs <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> extend from a respective one of first and second side edges <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> to respective first and second terminus edges <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, first and second legs <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> extend continuously throughout length &#x201c;L&#x201d;. It is also contemplated that one or both of first and second legs <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> may extend discontinuously along length &#x201c;L&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">First leg <b>30</b> includes a second crease <b>40</b> extending between first side edge <b>18</b> at first crease <b>22</b> and first terminus edge <b>36</b>. Second crease <b>40</b> includes a second apex <b>42</b> that is spaced from a first leg plane <b>44</b> of a portion of first leg <b>30</b> that is adjacent to second crease <b>40</b>. In some embodiments, second crease <b>40</b> is configured with second apex <b>42</b> inwardly positioned from first leg <b>30</b>, into channel <b>34</b>. It is contemplated, however, that certain arrangements of framing member <b>10</b> may provide second crease <b>40</b> with second apex <b>42</b> disposed outwardly from first leg <b>30</b>, out from channel <b>34</b>. Moreover, it is contemplated that second crease <b>40</b> may be formed with similar first and second angles &#x3b1;<sub>1</sub>, &#x3b1;<sub>2 </sub>as first crease <b>22</b>. By positioning second crease <b>40</b> at a position of first leg <b>30</b> coextensive with first crease <b>22</b>, the second crease <b>40</b> assists in the bendability of framing member <b>10</b>. Such a result may be particularly observed where second apex <b>42</b> is coextensive with first apex <b>26</b>. However, it is contemplated that second crease <b>40</b> may not be coextensive with first crease <b>22</b>, and may instead be provided at a portion of first leg <b>30</b> that is longitudinally spaced from first crease <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Second leg <b>32</b> includes a third crease <b>46</b> extending between second side edge <b>20</b> at first crease <b>22</b> and second terminus edge <b>38</b>. Third crease <b>46</b> includes a third apex <b>48</b> that is spaced from a second leg plane <b>50</b> of a portion of second leg <b>32</b> that is adjacent to third crease <b>46</b>. In some embodiments, third crease <b>46</b> is substantially similar to second crease <b>40</b>, and may be formed with third crease <b>46</b> disposed outwardly or inwardly from second leg <b>32</b> with respect to channel <b>34</b>. Third crease <b>46</b> further assists in the bendability of framing member <b>10</b> about the pivot axes <b>23</b> established at each of first creases <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, second and third creases are respectively formed in first and second legs <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> as a consequence of the formation of first crease <b>22</b>. In such embodiments, second and third creases <b>40</b>, <b>46</b> may be irregularly configured, and not specifically formed through a dedicated crimping procedure to first and second legs <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. Therefore, it is contemplated that second and third creases <b>40</b>, <b>46</b> may alternatively be irregularly-shaped zones in first and second legs <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> created in the formation of first creases <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A first flange <b>52</b> extends outwardly from first terminus edge <b>36</b> of first leg <b>30</b> generally along a first direction <b>54</b>, and continuously or discontinuously along length &#x201c;L&#x201d;. A second flange <b>62</b> extends outwardly from second terminus edge <b>38</b> of second leg <b>32</b> along a second direction <b>56</b> that is substantially opposite to first direction <b>54</b>. Second flange <b>62</b> may also extend continuously or discontinuously along length &#x201c;L&#x201d;, such that first and second flanges <b>52</b>, <b>62</b> may be substantially parallel to base <b>12</b>. With first flange <b>52</b> extending continuously or discontinuously along length &#x201c;L&#x201d;, first and second flanges <b>52</b>, <b>62</b> may act as mounting locations for framing member <b>10</b> to a framing structure, such as support structure framing stud <b>4</b>. Securement may be accomplished by fasteners extending through first or second flanges <b>52</b>, <b>62</b>, and being anchored to the framing structure.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">First flange <b>52</b> includes a fourth crease <b>58</b> extending from first terminus edge <b>36</b> of first leg <b>30</b> at second crease <b>40</b>. Fourth crease <b>58</b> includes a fourth apex <b>60</b> that is spaced from a first flange plane <b>64</b> of a portion of first flange <b>52</b> adjacent to fourth crease <b>58</b>. Second flange <b>62</b> includes a fifth crease <b>66</b> extending from second terminus edge <b>38</b> of second leg <b>32</b> at third crease <b>46</b>. Fifth crease <b>66</b> includes a fifth apex <b>68</b> that is spaced from a second flange plane <b>70</b> of a portion of second flange <b>62</b> that is adjacent to fifth crease <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, fourth and fifth creases <b>58</b>, <b>66</b> extend from a coextensive merge point with respective second and third creases <b>40</b>, <b>46</b>. In this manner, first crease <b>22</b>, second crease <b>40</b>, third crease <b>46</b>, fourth crease <b>58</b>, and fifth crease <b>66</b>, in combination, form a flex joint <b>72</b> defining a respective pivot axis <b>74</b> that may be substantially transverse to a length axis <b>76</b> of framing member <b>10</b>. Fourth and fifth creases <b>58</b>, <b>66</b> may be similar to second and third creases <b>40</b>, <b>46</b>, and may possess similar configurations with similar first and second angles &#x3b1;<sub>1</sub>, &#x3b1;<sub>1 </sub>as second and third creases <b>40</b>, <b>46</b>. In some embodiments, fourth and fifth apices <b>60</b>, <b>68</b> are displaced outwardly from respective first and second flange planes <b>64</b>, <b>70</b>, as illustrated in the drawings. Such an orientation limits obstruction of mounting framing member <b>10</b> to a framing structure, wherein first and second flanges <b>52</b>, <b>62</b> may be secured substantially flush with a framing structure.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, first and second creases <b>22</b>, <b>40</b> coextensively meet at a first merge point <b>78</b>, and first and third creases <b>22</b>, <b>46</b> coextensively meet at a second merge point <b>80</b>. Additionally, second and fourth creases <b>40</b>, <b>58</b> may coextensively meet at a third merge point <b>82</b>, while third and fifth creases <b>46</b>, <b>66</b> may coextensively meet at a fourth merge point <b>84</b>. In such an arrangement, each flex joint <b>72</b> is comprised of a plurality of pre-formed creases coextensively meeting with one another to form a cooperating location to facilitate hand-bendability of framing member <b>10</b> about pivot axis <b>74</b>. The combination and coextension of each of the pre-formed creases enables a hand-bendable flex joint in a relatively rigid framing member <b>10</b>. For example, it has been determined by the Applicants that flex joints <b>72</b>, as described herein, facilitate a hand-bendable framing member <b>10</b> that is fabricated from a single piece of stamped metal having a thickness gauge of 0.010-0.025 in. Moreover, such combination of creases not only provide the flexibility characteristics for hand bendability of framing member <b>10</b> about respective pivot axes <b>74</b>, but also provide a desired degree of strength in retaining a designated shape of framing member <b>10</b>. Applicant has determined that the multiple pre-formed creases, coextensively meeting at respective merge points <b>78</b>, <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> at their respective junctions assists in strengthening and minimizing the latent resiliency of framing member <b>10</b>. In other words, the pre-formed configuration of creases <b>22</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>66</b>, as well as their respective merge points <b>78</b>, <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>84</b>, assist in eliminating undue resiliency to the overall length of framing member <b>10</b>. Such a characteristic is important in the field of construction for providing a sturdy and constant-shaped support to which to secure surface finishing materials. Installers may therefore rely upon a custom-created configuration set to framing member <b>10</b> by hand-bending furring member <b>10</b> at one or more of flex joints <b>72</b>. Once the custom configuration is achieved, the unique flex joints <b>72</b> maintain such pre-set arrangement through self-supporting forces in the creases.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">For the purposes hereof, the term &#x201c;pre-formed&#x201d; is intended to mean creases that are formed in member <b>10</b> in the fabrication process, and not as a result of shaping member <b>10</b> into a curved configuration. The pre-formed creases of the present invention are provided with specific geometries to provide the bendability and strength characteristics noted above. Accordingly, the pre-formed creases described herein are to be distinguished from defects, failures, or fatigue points or zones developed in an article as a result of post-manufacture bending or curving.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">For the purposes hereof, the term &#x201c;crease&#x201d; is intended to mean a fold or corrugation in the respective body portion of the framing member, wherein the fold or corrugation forms one or more apices that are spaced from a plane of the body surface adjacent to such crease. Therefore, the term &#x201c;creases&#x201d; is intended to mean an intentional folding or corrugating of one or more walls of the framing member. Depending upon the thickness and/or inherent flexibility of the framing member being creased, the creases may exhibit one or more apices having an apex height of, for example, between 2-20 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">For the purposes hereof, the term &#x201c;coextensive&#x201d; or &#x201c;coextensively&#x201d; is intended to mean two or more creases that meet at a merge point or structure, with the at least two creases being separated only by such merge point or structure. The term &#x201c;coextensive&#x201d; or &#x201c;coextensively&#x201d; may include two or more creases meeting at a merge point or structure, and that define respective apices that are each contained in a single plane.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">For the purposes hereof, the term &#x201c;merge point&#x201d; or &#x201c;merge structure&#x201d; is intended to mean a structure and/or a portion of the framing member that is interposed between two or more coextensive creases. As an example, the merge point or merge structure may be defined as the intersection of creases formed in the framing member.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, an array of a plurality of flex joints <b>72</b> may be spaced apart along length &#x201c;L&#x201d;, to define one or more discrete base zones <b>24</b> between sets of two adjacent flex joints <b>72</b>. Such flex joints may be spaced apart by any desired spacing dimension to accomplish the desired degree of flexibility to framing member <b>10</b>. Flex joints <b>72</b>, for example, may be spaced apart along length &#x201c;L&#x201d; by example spacing dimensions of four, six, or eight inches.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">It is contemplated that framing member <b>10</b> may be hand-bendable at one or more flex joints <b>72</b> about the respective pivot axes <b>74</b>. Framing member <b>10</b> may be hand-bendable in either direction about a respective pivot axes <b>74</b> to render a curvilinear configuration for framing member <b>10</b>. For example, framing member <b>10</b> may be custom-modified by the installer to obtain a curvilinear configuration with a &#x201c;flange out&#x201d; orientation in which first and second flanges <b>52</b>, <b>62</b> are outwardly circumaxially arranged, or &#x201c;flange in&#x201d;, in which first and second flanges <b>52</b>, <b>62</b> are inwardly circumaxially oriented. Moreover, frame member <b>10</b> may be custom-formed to accomplish complex curvilinear formations, as may be required per application.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Additional embodiments of the invention are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref>, in which framing members <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, and <b>310</b> may be configured with a custom curvilinear arrangement induced by the size and spacing of creases placed at various portions of the respective framing member. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, a &#x201c;flange out&#x201d; configuration for framing member <b>110</b> positions flanges <b>152</b>, <b>162</b> on the outside of the curve for framing member <b>110</b>, and base <b>112</b> on the inside of the curve. Furring channel framing member <b>110</b> begins as a linear member that is brought into a curvilinear configuration by crimping base <b>112</b> at first creases <b>122</b>. The array of a plurality of first creases <b>122</b> defines discrete base zones <b>124</b> between sets of adjacent first creases <b>122</b>. First creases <b>122</b> may be similar to first creases <b>22</b> described hereinabove, but may be employed without counterbalancing creases in flanges <b>152</b>, <b>162</b> with the resultant effect upon furring channel framing member <b>110</b> being to shorten base <b>112</b> in relation to flanges <b>152</b>, <b>162</b>. Such length difference, caused by the creases in base <b>112</b> (and optionally first and second legs <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>) induces a curve to framing member <b>110</b> with base <b>112</b> on the inside of the curve. In typical applications, furring channel framing member <b>110</b> is oriented with flanges <b>152</b>, <b>162</b> for attachment to framing studs or joists to establish a concave finishing surface for mounting of wall or ceiling finishing materials to base <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The radius of curvature of framing member <b>110</b> may be controlled by the depth of first creases <b>122</b>, as measured by the first apex dimension L<sub>3</sub>, and/or the spacing of first creases <b>122</b> along length L of framing member <b>110</b>. Those of ordinary skill in the art understand that increased frequency and/or first apex dimension L<sub>3 </sub>of the first creases <b>122</b> at base <b>124</b> correspondingly reduces the radius of curvature of furring channel framing member <b>110</b>. The overall curvature of framing member <b>110</b> may therefore be customized as a function of the spacing and size of first creases <b>122</b>. While the &#x201c;flange out&#x201d; arrangement of framing member <b>110</b> may typically be employed with flanges <b>152</b>, <b>162</b> oriented for securement to a wall or ceiling support structure, such as joists or studs, it is contemplated that framing member <b>110</b> may instead be employed for a convex wall or ceiling surface with base <b>112</b> oriented for securement to the wall or ceiling support structure.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A &#x201c;flange in&#x201d; curvilinear furring channel framing member <b>210</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, wherein the inside radius of framing member <b>210</b> is at flanges <b>252</b>, <b>262</b>, and the outside radius is at base <b>212</b>. Framing member <b>210</b> may typically be employed by securing flanges <b>252</b>, <b>262</b> to wall or ceiling framing structures, such as joists or studs, to establish a convex surface at base <b>12</b> against which to secure finishing material such as Gypsum board or the like. To accomplish the curvilinear configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, flange creases <b>258</b>, <b>266</b> are formed in flanges <b>252</b>, <b>262</b> in a similar manner and configuration as that described above with respect to fourth and fifth creases <b>58</b>, <b>66</b> of framing member <b>10</b>. The creasing of flanges <b>252</b>, <b>262</b> shortens the longitudinal length of flanges <b>252</b>, <b>262</b> with respect to base <b>212</b>, thereby forming the &#x201c;flange in&#x201d; curvilinear configuration of framing member <b>210</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As described above with reference to furring channel framing member <b>110</b>, the curvilinear configuration of furring channel framing member <b>210</b> may be defined by the size and spacing of flange creases <b>258</b>, <b>266</b>. A predetermined curve for framing member <b>210</b> may therefore be accomplished by appropriately sizing and spacing flange creases <b>258</b>, <b>266</b>. While flange creases <b>258</b>, <b>266</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> in pair sets, it is contemplated that other arrangements for the array of creases <b>258</b>, <b>266</b> may be useful in certain applications of framing member <b>210</b>. For example, flange creases <b>258</b>, <b>266</b> may be staggered along the length dimension L of framing member <b>210</b>, and one of flanges <b>252</b>, <b>262</b> may include a greater or lesser number, sizing, or spacing of creases than the counterpart flange <b>252</b>, <b>262</b>. Such an approach may be appropriate in the event that complex curvatures for framing member <b>210</b> are desired.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A further embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, wherein furring channel framing member <b>310</b> exhibits an &#x201c;s-curve&#x201d; configuration as the result of first creases <b>322</b> applied in base <b>312</b> along only a first portion <b>311</b> of the length L of framing member <b>310</b>, along with flange creases <b>358</b>, <b>366</b> applied only to a second portion <b>313</b> of the length L of framing member <b>310</b>. First creases <b>322</b> in base <b>312</b> presents a &#x201c;flange out&#x201d; configuration for first portion <b>311</b>, while flange creases <b>358</b>, <b>366</b> form a &#x201c;flange in&#x201d; curvature at second portion <b>313</b> of framing member <b>310</b>. The compound curve of framing member <b>310</b> may typically be applied to wall or ceiling framing structures, such as studs or joists, with flanges <b>352</b>, <b>362</b> of furring channel framing member <b>310</b> being secured to such wall or ceiling framing structures. Framing member <b>310</b> therefore presents a compound curved surface at base <b>312</b> against which wall or ceiling finishing materials may be secured to establish a compound-curved wall or ceiling surface.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The invention has been described herein in considerable detail in order to comply with the patent statutes, and to provide those skilled in the art with the information needed to apply the novel principles and to construct and use embodiments of the invention as required. However, it is to be understood that various modifications may be accomplished without departing from the scope of the invention itself.</p>
