<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure is related to clutch engagement of a selectable one-way clutch.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The statements in this section merely provide background information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A selectable one-way clutch (SOWC) is capable of producing a mechanical connection between a driving and a driven member in one or both rotational directions, i.e., forward and reverse. Also, depending on the design, an SOWC is capable of overrunning, i.e., freewheeling, in one or both directions of rotation. A SOWC includes an externally controllable selection mechanism that when moved to a second, and possibly even a third position, controls the operating modes of the device. An SOWC reduces the part complexity of the transmission, reduces weight and cost of the transmission, and reduces overall spin losses.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The ability of the driving member of a SOWC to transmit torque to a driven member depends on whether or not the engaging torque transmitting elements of the SOWC, typically rollers, sprags, rockers, or struts, etc., are able to freely engage one or more cams, notches, recesses, or similar features in the adjacent member. Similarly, the ability of the driving member to overrun in one or both directions with respect to the driven member also depends on whether or not the engaging elements are free to interact with the adjacent member. A rotatable retainer ring or selector plate can be used to accomplish this task by allowing or restricting engagement of the torque transmitting elements between the driving and the driven member. Other similar clutch designs are known in the art and capable of use as one-way clutching devices, including synchronizers and dog clutches.</p>

<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the purpose of illustrating certain exemplary embodiments only and not for the purpose of limiting the same, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary powertrain <b>10</b> including an engine <b>12</b>, a planetary transmission <b>14</b>, and a differential <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The planetary transmission <b>14</b> includes an input shaft <b>17</b> continuously connected with the engine <b>12</b>, a planetary gear arrangement <b>18</b>, and an output shaft <b>19</b> continuously connected with the differential <b>16</b>. A torque converter can be positioned between the engine <b>12</b> and the input shaft <b>17</b>. If no torque converter is present, then an isolator can be positioned between the engine <b>12</b> and the input shaft <b>17</b>. The planetary gear arrangement <b>18</b> includes three planetary gear sets; a first planetary gear set <b>20</b>, a second planetary gear set <b>30</b>, and a third planetary gear set <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The first planetary gear set <b>20</b> includes a sun gear member <b>22</b>, a ring gear member <b>24</b>, and a planet carrier assembly member <b>26</b>. The planet carrier assembly member <b>26</b> includes a plurality of pinion gears <b>27</b> rotatably mounted on a carrier member <b>29</b> and engaged via splines with both the sun gear member <b>22</b> and the ring gear member <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The second planetary gear set <b>30</b> includes a sun gear member <b>32</b>, a ring gear member <b>34</b>, and a planet carrier assembly member <b>36</b>. The planet carrier assembly member <b>36</b> includes a plurality of pinion gears <b>37</b> rotatably mounted on a carrier member <b>39</b> and engaged via splines with both the sun gear member <b>32</b> and the ring member <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The third planetary gear set <b>40</b> includes a sun gear member <b>42</b>, a ring gear member <b>44</b>, and a planet carrier assembly member <b>46</b>. The planet carrier assembly member <b>46</b> includes a plurality of pinion gears <b>47</b>, <b>48</b> rotatably mounted on a carrier member <b>49</b>. The pinion gears <b>47</b> are engaged via splines with the sun gear member <b>42</b>, and the pinion gears <b>48</b> are engaged via splines with the ring gear member <b>44</b>. The ring gear member <b>34</b> is integral with the ring gear member <b>44</b>. The third planetary gear set <b>40</b> is a compound planetary gear set.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The planetary gear arrangement also includes five selectable torque transmitting mechanisms <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, and <b>58</b>. The torque transmitting mechanisms <b>50</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> are rotating type torque transmitting mechanisms, commonly termed clutches. Clutches <b>50</b>, <b>54</b>, and <b>56</b> are commonly multi-plate clutch devices, for example, in a friction launch configuration. The torque transmitting mechanism <b>52</b> is a stationary type torque transmitting mechanism, commonly termed brake or reaction clutch. The torque transmitting mechanism <b>58</b> is a selectable one-way clutch (SOWC). The SOWC <b>58</b> may be a controllable mechanical diode clutch, a selectable roller clutch, or selectable sprag clutch design. The disclosure contemplates that other selectable (reversible) one-way clutches could be used as defined herein with the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The input shaft <b>17</b> is continuously connected with the ring gear member <b>24</b> and the output shaft <b>19</b> is continuously connected with the ring gear member <b>44</b>. The planet carrier assembly member <b>26</b> is selectively connectable with the sun gear member <b>42</b> through the clutch <b>50</b>. The sun gear member <b>32</b> is selectively connectable with a transmission housing <b>60</b> through the brake <b>52</b>. The planet carrier assembly member <b>26</b> is selectively connectable with the sun gear member <b>32</b> through the clutch <b>54</b>. The ring gear member <b>24</b> is selectively connectable with the planet carrier assembly member <b>46</b> through the clutch <b>56</b>. The planet carrier assembly member <b>36</b> is selectively connectable with the transmission housing <b>60</b> through the SOWC <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The transmission <b>14</b> includes a series of fluid circuits, such as channels within the transmission housing <b>60</b> and tubes outside of the transmission housing <b>60</b>, for routing fluid to appropriate areas of the transmission <b>14</b>. The fluid circuits supply hydraulic pressure to selectively operate the torque transmitting mechanisms <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, and <b>58</b>, i.e., the fluid is capable of activating and deactivating each of the torque transmitting mechanisms <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, and <b>58</b> independently. A hydraulic fluid delivery system <b>8</b>, commonly referred to as a valve body, is signally connected to a control module <b>5</b> to selectively open and close a number of valves to provide selectable fluid flow into the desired fluid circuit(s) to activate and deactivate the individual torque transmitting mechanisms <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, and <b>58</b> to create the commanded outcome, e.g., an appropriate torque multiplication or reduction.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The transmission control module <b>5</b> is signally connected to operate the valve body <b>8</b> and therefore the torque transmitting mechanisms <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, and <b>58</b>. The control module <b>5</b> receives an operator torque request <b>7</b> and vehicle operating parameters <b>9</b>, e.g., current engine torque output, wheel speed sensor output, and gear selection, to select appropriate torque transmitting mechanisms <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, and <b>58</b> to achieve a selected gear ratio for vehicle operation. The selected gear ratio can be selected from a series of look-up tables or computed based on operator torque request <b>7</b> and current vehicle operating parameters <b>9</b>. The control module <b>5</b> selects an appropriate amount of slip to provide smooth operation during gear transitions when one is commanded.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Control module, module, controller, control unit, processor and similar terms mean any suitable one or various combinations of one or more of Application Specific Integrated Circuit(s) (ASIC), electronic circuit(s), central processing unit(s) (preferably microprocessor(s)) and associated memory and storage (read only, programmable read only, random access, hard drive, etc.) executing one or more software or firmware programs, combinational logic circuit(s), input/output circuit(s) and devices, appropriate signal conditioning and buffer circuitry, and other suitable components to provide the described functionality. The control module <b>5</b> has a set of control algorithms, including resident software program instructions and calibrations stored in memory and executed to provide the desired functions. The algorithms are preferably executed during preset loop cycles. Algorithms are executed, such as by a central processing unit, and are operable to monitor inputs from sensing devices and other networked control modules, and execute control and diagnostic routines to control operation of actuators. Loop cycles may be executed at regular intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during ongoing engine and vehicle operation. Alternatively, algorithms may be executed in response to occurrence of an event.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the SOWC <b>58</b> in relation to components assembled within the transmission housing <b>60</b> including a control housing <b>105</b>, selector plate <b>115</b>, actuation mechanism <b>78</b>. The control housing <b>105</b> is a generally circular ring shaped device with an outer mechanism portion <b>62</b> and an opposed inner portion <b>64</b>. When assembled, the inner portion <b>64</b> accepts a portion of the SOWC <b>58</b> and an SOWC inner surface <b>66</b> that can be used as a ring gear. It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the SOWC <b>58</b> and the control housing <b>105</b> are cylindrical and shaped to replace exemplary existing hydraulically actuated friction clutch designs within the same space constraints of the transmission housing <b>60</b>. Utilizing the SOWC <b>58</b> within the transmission housing <b>60</b> can be beneficially accomplished by fitting the SOWC <b>58</b> into a preexisting design for a cylindrical clutch as disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The outer mechanism portion <b>62</b> houses the actuation mechanism <b>78</b> and return mechanism, as will be explained in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The actuation mechanism <b>78</b> engages and actuates the selector plate <b>115</b> though an actuation member <b>86</b>. A fluid feed tube <b>82</b> fluidly connects the transmission housing <b>60</b> to the control housing <b>105</b> for providing pressurized fluid to the actuation mechanism <b>78</b>. The control housing <b>105</b> includes an actuation recess <b>85</b> for providing an area in which the actuation member <b>86</b> can move.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The selector plate <b>115</b> is positioned between the control housing <b>105</b> and the SOWC <b>58</b>. The selector plate <b>115</b> includes the actuation member <b>86</b> and an activation notch <b>102</b>. The activation notch <b>102</b> is of a size to accept an actuation lever <b>112</b> from the SOWC <b>58</b>. The control housing <b>105</b> includes an SOWC recess <b>104</b> for accepting the actuation lever <b>112</b>. A snap ring <b>74</b> holds the SOWC <b>58</b> in the transmission housing <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the control housing <b>105</b>, the selector plate <b>115</b>, the actuation mechanism <b>78</b>, snap ring <b>76</b>, and a return mechanism <b>88</b>. The actuation mechanism <b>78</b> includes a piston housing <b>80</b>, fluid feed tube <b>82</b>, and actuation piston <b>84</b>. The fluid feed tube <b>82</b> fluidly connects the transmission housing <b>60</b> to the control housing <b>105</b> for selectively providing pressurized fluid from the valve body <b>8</b> to the piston housing <b>80</b> through hydraulic circuits. It will be apparent the fluid feed tube <b>82</b> can be unitary with the transmission housing and the control housing <b>105</b>. The piston housing <b>80</b> includes a wall shared with the actuation recess <b>85</b> whereat the actuation piston <b>84</b> is extendable therefrom. The actuation piston <b>84</b> is extendable from a retracted default position within the piston housing <b>80</b> to an extended actuation position that extends into the actuation recess <b>85</b> when an appropriate amount of fluid pressure is supplied.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The selector plate <b>115</b> is positioned between the control housing <b>105</b> and the SOWC <b>58</b> and is capable of rotational movement in relation to the control housing <b>105</b> thereby rotating the SOWC <b>58</b> from the default position to the actuation position. The actuation member <b>86</b> is engaged by the actuation piston <b>84</b> and resides in the actuation recess <b>85</b>. The actuation recess <b>85</b> can act as a stop at an opposing wall from the piston housing <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The SOWC <b>58</b> extends into the inner portion <b>64</b> of the control housing <b>105</b> when assembled. It will be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art that the SOWC <b>58</b> is positioned within transmission housing <b>60</b> in place of a conventional friction clutch.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A snap ring <b>76</b> secures the selector plate <b>115</b> to the control housing <b>105</b> and allows for rotation of the selector plate <b>115</b> in relation to the control housing <b>105</b> and the SOWC <b>58</b> when assembled therein. The return mechanism <b>88</b> is distally located from the actuation mechanism <b>78</b> and includes a return piston housing <b>90</b> for housing a return piston <b>92</b> and a biasing member <b>94</b>, e.g., a coil spring, a leaf spring, or other biasing member that is capable of extending the return piston <b>92</b> from a retracted position within the return piston housing <b>90</b>. The control housing <b>105</b> includes a return recess <b>95</b> having a shared wall with the return mechanism <b>88</b>. The return piston <b>92</b> acts upon a return member <b>96</b> that is a portion of the selector plate <b>115</b> for returning the selector plate <b>115</b> to the default position when hydraulic pressure is reduced from the piston housing <b>80</b>. The return recess <b>95</b> can act as a stop at an opposing wall from the return piston housing <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the SOWC <b>58</b> includes an actuation lever <b>112</b>. Selector plate <b>115</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes an activation notch <b>102</b> configured to accept actuation lever <b>112</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> additionally depicts an SOWC recess <b>104</b> located on the control housing <b>105</b> also for accepting actuation lever <b>112</b>. The activation notch <b>102</b> is approximately the same width as the actuation lever <b>112</b> to transmit movement of the selector plate <b>115</b> to the actuation lever <b>112</b>. The actuation lever <b>112</b> controls the engagement of the SOWC <b>58</b> in one of the default and actuation positions through rotation of a member selector ring, as will be discussed in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-1</figref> and <b>4</b>-<b>2</b>. The default position is a forward drive position, i.e., the SOWC <b>58</b> is locked to provide acceleration torque from the engine <b>10</b> and allowing slip in the opposite direction, e.g., during coasting and deceleration. The actuation position is a locked position that transmits drivetrain rotation through the SOWC <b>58</b> in both acceleration and deceleration directions.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-1</figref> and <b>4</b>-<b>2</b> depict one set of forward locking members <b>130</b> and rearward locking members <b>135</b> during operation of an exemplary SOWC <b>58</b> in the default and actuation positions <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> respectively. A method is depicted for controlling the position of member selector ring <b>154</b> in an exemplary two mode SOWC <b>58</b> using the actuation mechanism <b>78</b> and return mechanism <b>88</b> that is an integral part of the control housing <b>105</b> in an exemplary front wheel drive transmission. There are multiple sets of forward and rearward locking members <b>130</b>, <b>135</b> respectively, around the diameter of the SOWC <b>58</b> that the member selector ring <b>154</b> engages. It will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art the number of sets of forward and rearward locking members <b>130</b>, <b>135</b> respectively, can be variable depending on torque requirements for a specific application.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The member selector ring <b>154</b> is a generally ring shaped device slidably located between an outer casing <b>116</b> and an inner casing <b>118</b> of the SOWC <b>58</b>. The member selector ring <b>154</b> is integral to the actuation lever <b>112</b> such that the member selector ring <b>154</b> is moveable when the actuation lever <b>112</b> is moved. The outer and inner casings <b>116</b> and <b>118</b>, respectively, are able to rotate independently of each other. The inner casing <b>118</b> includes a plurality of recesses <b>110</b> capable of housing the forward locking member <b>130</b> and a rearward locking member <b>135</b> with each having a respective biasing member <b>140</b>. The biasing member <b>140</b> can be a torsion spring, a coil spring, constant force spring, or another spring that is capable of providing lift to one side of the forward and rearward locking members <b>130</b>, <b>135</b>. The outer casing <b>106</b> includes a plurality of opposing recesses <b>150</b> capable of accepting one side of the forward locking member <b>130</b> and one side of the rearward locking member <b>135</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4-1</figref> depicts the member selector ring <b>154</b> in the default position <b>106</b>. According to an exemplary embodiment, the default position <b>106</b> is actuated when actuation mechanism <b>78</b> has low pressure. The return mechanism <b>88</b> rotates the selector plate <b>115</b> via the return piston <b>92</b> by providing force at the return member <b>96</b> to overcome low pressure in actuation mechanism <b>78</b>. The selector plate <b>115</b> rotates in the direction of arrow <b>122</b> thereby causing the actuation lever <b>112</b> to rotate. The actuation lever <b>112</b> moves the member selector ring <b>154</b> to engage the rearward locking member <b>135</b> with a member selector actuator <b>120</b>. The member selector actuator <b>120</b> overcomes the force of the biasing member <b>140</b> thereby causing the rearward locking member <b>135</b> to disengage the opposing recess <b>150</b> and nestle into its associated recess <b>110</b>. The member selector actuator <b>120</b> remains over the rearward locking member <b>135</b> to retain the rearward locking member <b>135</b> within the recess <b>110</b> creating a partially engaged SOWC <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The outer casing <b>116</b> has the forward locking member <b>130</b> engaged in the opposing recess <b>150</b> to transfer the rotational motion between the outer casing <b>116</b> and the inner casing <b>118</b> when the inner casing is rotated in the direction of the forward locking member <b>130</b>, i.e., opposite of arrow <b>122</b>. The rotation of the inner casing <b>118</b> in the direction of the forward locking member <b>130</b> causes the rotational motion to be transferred to the outer casing <b>116</b> through the forward locking member <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The inner casing <b>118</b> is allowed to free wheel in relation to the outer casing <b>116</b> in the direction of the rearward locking member <b>135</b>, i.e., in the direction of arrow <b>122</b>, since the rearward locking member <b>135</b> is depressed into the recess <b>110</b>. The forward locking member <b>130</b> is depressed by the outer casing <b>116</b> into its associated recess as the relative movement of the outer casing <b>116</b> to the inner casing <b>118</b> creates enough force to overcome the biasing member <b>140</b>. Therefore the inner casing <b>118</b> is free to rotate in the direction of arrow <b>122</b> without engaging the outer casing <b>118</b> and thereby creates a neutral transmission state while in a forward driving gear during a deceleration event.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4-2</figref> depicts the member selector ring <b>154</b> in the actuation position <b>108</b>. According to an exemplary embodiment, the actuation position <b>108</b> occurs when the actuation mechanism <b>78</b> has been provided with pressurized hydraulic fluid. The actuation piston <b>84</b> engages the actuation member <b>86</b>. The actuation piston <b>84</b> is provided enough force to overcome the resistance of the biasing member <b>94</b> within the return mechanism <b>88</b> thereby rotating the member selector ring <b>154</b> in direction of arrow <b>124</b>. The member selector actuator <b>120</b> rotates to an intermediate position between the forward locking member <b>130</b> and the rearward locking member <b>135</b>. Upon reaching the intermediate position, the rearward locking member <b>135</b> can pivot and biasing member <b>140</b> biases the rearward locking member <b>135</b> into the associated opposing recess <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">With both the forward locking member <b>130</b> and the rearward locking member <b>135</b> engaged in respective opposing recesses <b>150</b>, the outer casing <b>116</b> and the inner casing <b>118</b> are locked in relation to one another, i.e., the SOWC <b>58</b> is fully engaged. Therefore, when the actuation position <b>108</b> is activated, the inner casing <b>118</b> provides direct transfer of rotational forces in both the direction of and opposite of arrow <b>124</b> thereby enabling torque transfer in a forward gear, a reverse gear, and during deceleration, in the form of engine braking, which is commonly known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In exemplary operation, an automatic control mode is used and the SOWC <b>58</b> is in the actuation position, the SOWC <b>58</b> can remain fully engaged so long as the speed and gear settings allow. An exemplary SOWC <b>58</b> can remain fully engaged continuously through operation, e.g., in parked, reverse, neutral, and first gear operation. For example, when a transmission <b>14</b> is shifted from park to reverse or to neutral, the SOWC <b>58</b> stays fully engaged with both the forward and rearward locking members <b>130</b>, <b>135</b>, respectively, to prepare for operation in the reverse gear. If the transmission <b>14</b> stays in the reverse gear, the SOWC <b>58</b> remains fully engaged.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">When a driver shifts the transmission into a drive gear, the SOWC <b>58</b> can stay fully engaged until the vehicle picks up speed in excess of a threshold speed. The threshold speed can be, for example, a predetermined threshold speed, determined from look-up tables, and calculated based upon vehicle operating conditions. Once the SOWC <b>58</b> exceeds the threshold speed, the default position is selected and the SOWC <b>58</b> becomes partially engaged. The SOWC <b>58</b> remains in the default position to act as a regular one-way clutch so long as the vehicle remains above the threshold low speed range. Additionally, a manual mode may be operator selected by engaging certain operational modes, e.g., a competitive/sport mode or a low gear is selected, the SOWC <b>58</b> may stay in the actuation position throughout the entire operation range, regardless of vehicle speed to allow for engine braking during deceleration in each forward gear.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Therefore operation of the SOWC <b>58</b> in an automatic transmission occurs by monitoring the operational mode of the SOWC <b>58</b> that is actuated between the default position <b>106</b> and the actuation position <b>108</b>. The valve body provides hydraulic fluid to the actuation mechanism housed within the control housing to actuate the selector plate. The selector plate is engaged with the SOWC <b>58</b> through the actuation member to select operation of the SOWC <b>58</b> between the default position and the actuation position.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an alternative embodiment wherein a valve body <b>200</b> is directly connected to the actuation mechanism <b>78</b> for providing hydraulic fluid thereto. Operation is similar as to that described above, however, the fluid channels and tubes to route the fluid to the actuation mechanism <b>78</b> are not necessary. A fluid feed tube <b>210</b> has a direct connection between the actuation mechanism <b>78</b> and the valve body <b>200</b> through the transmission housing. The fluid feed tube <b>210</b> can be an individual tube, e.g., similar to fluid feed tube <b>82</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, or can be unitary with the actuation mechanism <b>78</b> or the valve body <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It will be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art that the above description, in certain embodiments, can permit operation of the SOWC <b>58</b> within a conventional transmission housing <b>60</b> without any significant modifications thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The disclosure has described certain preferred embodiments and modifications thereto. Further modifications and alterations may occur to others upon reading and understanding the specification.
