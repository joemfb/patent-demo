<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a manufacturing method of a semiconductor device having a semiconductor element formed by using a droplet discharging method represented by an ink-jetting method, and to a technique to form a mask pattern, a contact hole, and a film of each portion of a semiconductor element.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is examined that a droplet discharging apparatus is used for forming a pattern of a thin film and a wiring used for a semiconductor element in order to realize low cost equipment and simplify the process in manufacturing a semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A contact hole of a semiconductor element is formed by a photolithography process in which resist is applied on an entire surface of the substrate, prebaked, an ultraviolet ray and the like are irradiated to the substrate through a mask pattern, and a resist pattern is formed by development. Then, an insulating film formed on a portion to be a contact hole is removed by etching with the resist pattern as a mask pattern, thus the contact hole is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, a film pattern of a desired shape is formed by etching a semiconductor film, an insulating film, a metal film and the like by using a resist pattern.</p>

<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2000-89213</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, in the conventional process for forming a film pattern, an insulating film having a contact hole, and the like, bulk of materials of the film pattern and the resist are wasted and a large number of steps are required for forming a mask pattern, which decreases throughput.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the case where the amount of application of resist and a surface condition of a base film are not controlled sufficiently when opening a contact hole, the resist spreads over the contact hole and a defective contact may occur.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention is made in view of the aforementioned problems to provide a manufacturing method of a substrate having a film pattern of an insulating film, a semiconductor film, a conductive film and the like through simple steps, and a manufacturing method of a low cost semiconductor device with high throughput and yield.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the invention, after a first protective film (hereinafter referred to as a mask pattern) which has low wettability is formed on a substrate, a highly wettable material is applied or discharged on an outer edge of the first mask pattern to form a film pattern and a substrate having the film pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to the invention, after the first mask pattern which has low wettability is formed on the substrate, a highly wettable material is applied or discharged on a region except for the first mask pattern to form a film pattern and a substrate having the film pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the invention, after the first mask pattern which has low wettability is formed on the substrate, a highly wettable material is applied or discharged in a region on which the first mask pattern is not formed to form a film pattern and a substrate having the film pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the invention, after the first mask pattern which has low wettability is formed on a thin film or a member, a second mask pattern which has high wettability is formed, the first mask pattern and a thin film or a member covered with the first mask pattern are removed, and an insulating film having a film pattern or a contact hole is formed. Note that the second mask pattern can be removed later.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The first mask pattern which has low wettability easily repels liquid while liquid spreads over the second mask pattern which has high wettability. Liquid solution as a material of for the second mask pattern is repelled in a semispherical shape on a surface of the first mask pattern, therefore, the second mask pattern can be formed in a self-aligned manner.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The first mask pattern which has low wettability can be formed by irradiating plasma fluoride to an insulating layer. The plasma fluoride can be generated in fluorine or fluoride atmosphere, or by using an electrode having a dielectric including fluoroplastic.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">For forming the first mask pattern which has low wettability, a material which has low wettability may be discharged or applied on a predetermined position. The material which has low wettability is, for example, a compound containing a fluorocarbon chain.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is preferable that a contact angle of the first mask pattern which has low wettability be larger than a contact angle of the second mask pattern which has high wettability, and a difference between these contact angles be 30&#xb0;, or preferably 40&#xb0; or more. As a result, each mask pattern can be formed in a self-aligned manner as the material of the second mask pattern is repelled in a semispherical shape on the surface of the first mask pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The second mask pattern is preferably used for a mask for forming a film pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The film pattern is an insulating film, a semiconductor film, a conductive film having desired shapes, or an insulating film having a contact hole. Typically, a gate insulating film, an interlayer insulating film, a protective film, an insulating film such as an insulting film having a contact hole, a semiconductor film of a channel forming region, a source region, and a drain region, and a conductive film such as a source electrode, a drain electrode, a wiring, a gate electrode, a pixel electrode, and an antenna are used. After removing the mask pattern, composition of the mask pattern still exists in the periphery of the film pattern (a region in which the mask pattern was formed).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The first mask pattern which has low wettability is formed by using a liquid phase method or a printing method. The liquid phase method includes the droplet discharging method, the ink-jetting method and the like representatively.</p>

The liquid phase method includes a droplet discharging method, an ink-jetting method, a spin coating method, a roll coating method, a slot coating method and the like representatively.</p>

The semiconductor element is, for example, a TFT, a field effect transistor (FET), a MOS transistor, a bipolar transistor, an organic semiconductor transistor, an MIM element, a memory element, a diode, a photoelectric converter, a capacitor, a resistor and the like.</p>

Moreover, as an insulating film having a film pattern and a contact hole can be formed without exposure and development processes using a resist mask pattern, therefore, the process can considerably be simplified as compared to a conventional technique.

As a thickness and a width of a pattern to be formed can be controlled according to a relative relationship of a nozzle diameter, an amount of the droplets to be discharged, and a moving rate of the nozzle and a substrate on which the discharged droplets are formed, those films can be formed at a desired position with high accuracy by discharge. Since a patterning process, namely the exposure and development processes using a mask pattern can be omitted, the process can considerably be simplified and cost can be reduced. By using the droplet discharging method, a pattern can be formed at an arbitrary position and a thickness and a width of the pattern can be controlled. Therefore, even a large semiconductor substrate of which one side is longer than 1 to 2 m can be manufactured at low cost with high yield.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In this manner, according to the invention, a film pattern, a substrate having the film pattern, an insulating film having a contact hole, and moreover a semiconductor element and a semiconductor device having these can be formed through a simple process with high precision. Furthermore, the invention can provide a manufacturing method of a semiconductor element and a semiconductor device at low cost with high throughput and high yield.</p>

<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Here, a silicon oxide film is formed by a CVD method as the first film.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The first mask pattern functions as a mask for forming a film pattern which is formed later. Therefore, it is preferable that the first mask pattern has low wettability.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The first mask pattern <b>103</b> is formed by forming an insulating layer which has high wettability at a predetermined position and irradiating fluorine plasma on the surface. Also, plasma treatment can be performed by providing an electrode having a dielectric and generating plasma so that the dielectric is exposed to the plasma using air, oxygen or nitrogen. In this case, the dielectric is not required to cover the whole surface of the electrode. As the dielectric, fluorine resin can be used. By using the fluorine resin, a CF<sub>2 </sub>bond is formed on the surface of the insulating layer, thereby the surface property is modulated and the wettability is lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">As a material for the insulating film, a material obtained by mixing water-soluble resin such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) in the solution of H<sub>2</sub>O and the like can be used.

Thereby the insulating layer can be formed at a predetermined position.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The first mask pattern <b>103</b> can be formed by applying or discharging a material which has low wettability. The material which has low wettability is typically a compound having a fluorocarbon chain. The compound having a fluorocarbon chain is, for example, silane coupling agent expressed by a chemical formula Rn&#x2014;Si&#x2014;X<sub>(4&#x2212;n)</sub>(n=1, 2, and 3). Here, R contains a relatively inactive group such as an alkyl group. Further, X denotes hydrolysable group which can be bonded by the condensation with absorptive water or hydroxyl group on a surface of a ground substance such as halogen, methoxy group, ethoxy group, or acetoxy group.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">By using fluorine silane coupling agent (fluoroalkyl silane (FAS)) having a fluoroalkyl group for R as a representative example of the silane coupling agent, the wettability can be lowered. R of FAS has a structure that can be expressed as (CF<sub>3</sub>) (CF<sub>2</sub>)<sub>x</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>y </sub>(x: an integer from 0 to 10, y an integer from 0 to 4). In the case where a plurality of R or X are bonded to Si, R or X may all be the same or different. Representatively, FAS is fluoroalkylsilane (hereinafter referred to as FAS) such as heptadecafluoro tetrahydrodecyl triethoxysilane, heptadecafluoro tetrahydrodecyl trichlorosilane, tridecafluoro tetrahydrooctcyl trichlorosilane, and triflouropropyl trimethoxysilane.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">As solvent which has low wettability, hydrocarbon solvent such as n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, n-decane, dicyclopentane, benzene, toluene, xylene, durene, indene, tetrahydronaphthalene, decahydronaphthalene, and squalene, or tetrahydrofuran and the like are used.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">As an example of a compound which has low wettability, a material (fluorine resin) having a fluorocarbon chain can be used. As fluorine resin, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE; polytetrafluoroethylene resin), perfluoroalkoxyalkane (PFA; tetrafluoroethylene perfluoroalkylvinylether copolymerization resin), perfluoroethylene propylene copolymer (PFEP; tetrafluoroethylene hexafluoropropylene copolymer resin), ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene copolymer (ETFE; tetrafluoroethylene-ethylene copolymer resin), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF; polyvinylidene fluoride resin), polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE; polytrifluorochloroethylene resin), ethylene-chlorotrifluoroethylene copolymer (ECTFE; polytrifluorochloroethylene-ethylene copolymer resin), polytetrafluoroethylene-perfluorodioxol copolymer (TFE/PDD), polyvinylfluoride (PVF; vinyl fluoride resin) and the like can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Next, a surface attached with a material which has low wettability is cleaned with ethanol, thereby a first mask pattern which is quite thin and has low wettability can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In the case of forming a film pattern having a fine shape, it is preferable that the first mask pattern <b>103</b> formed on the first film <b>102</b> has a closed curve shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. In this case, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, a material <b>111</b> which has high wettability is discharged inside the mask pattern having a closed curve shape, and then drying or baking treatment is performed. Accordingly, a film pattern <b>121</b> which has high wettability can be formed in an arbitrary shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, the mask pattern is removed and a compound <b>122</b> of the mask pattern exists on the surface of the thin film.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">A diameter of a nozzle used for the droplet discharging method is set 0.1 to 50 &#x3bc;m (preferably 0.6 to 26 &#x3bc;m) and the amount of the compound discharged from the nozzle is set 0.00001 to 50 pl (preferably 0.0001 to 10 pl). This amount increases in proportion to the diameter of the nozzle. Moreover, it is preferable that the object being processed and an discharging orifice of the nozzle be as close as possible for dropping a droplet at a desired position, which is preferably set about 0.1 to 2 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Note that viscosity of the compound used for the droplet discharging method is preferably 300 mPa&#xb7;s or less, or more preferably 50 mPa&#xb7;s or less for preventing drying and for smoothly discharging the compound from the discharging orifice. Note that the viscosity, surface tension and the like of the compound may be appropriately controlled according to solvent used and application.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the material <b>111</b> which has high wettability as compared to the first mask pattern is applied inside the first mask pattern <b>103</b> on the first film <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Here, a relation between the region which has low wettability and the region which has high wettability is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. The region which has low wettability (the first mask pattern <b>103</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>) is a region where a contact angle &#x3b8;<b>1</b> of liquid with respect to the surface of the first film <b>102</b> is large as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. On this surface, liquid is repelled in a semi-sphere shape. On the other hand, the region which has high wettability (a region formed of the material <b>111</b> which has high wettability in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) is a region where a contact angle &#x3b8;<b>2</b> of liquid with respect to the surface of the first film <b>102</b> is small. On this surface, liquid is likely to spread.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Therefore, in the case where the two regions having different contact angles are in contact with each other, a region having a relatively smaller contact angle becomes a region which has high wettability while a region having a larger contact angle becomes a region which has low wettability. In the case of applying or discharging solvent on these two regions, the solvent spreads on the surface of the region which has high wettability while it is repelled in a semi-sphere shape on the boundary between the region which has low wettability and the region which has high wettability.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">It is preferable that a difference between the contact angle &#x3b8;<b>1</b> of the region which has low wettability and the contact angle &#x3b8;<b>2</b> of the region which has high wettability be 30&#xb0;, or more preferably 40&#xb0; or more. As a result, a material of the region which has high wettability is repelled in a semi-sphere shape on the surface of the region which has low wettability, thereby each mask pattern can be formed in a self-aligned manner. Accordingly, among the substances described as the materials and the methods for forming the first mask pattern <b>103</b>, in the case where a difference between the contact angles is 30&#xb0; or more preferably 40&#xb0; or more, the region formed of a material having a smaller contact angle becomes a region which has high wettability while the region having a larger contact angle becomes a region which has low wettability. Similarly, among substances which are to be described later as the material <b>111</b> which has high wettability, in the case where a difference between the contact angles is 30&#xb0; or more preferably 40&#xb0; or more, the region formed of a material having a smaller contact angle becomes a region which has high wettability while the region formed of a material having a larger contact angle becomes a region which has low wettability.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In the case where the surface has projections and depressions, a contact angle becomes smaller in the region which has low wettability. That is, the wettability is lowered. In the region which has high wettability, on the other hand, the contact angle becomes smaller. That is, the wettability is heightened. Accordingly, by applying or discharging the material which has low wettability and the material which has high wettability on each surface having projections and depressions and performing baking treatment, a layer of which end portion is uniform can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">As the material <b>111</b> which has high wettability, an insulating material, a conductive material, and a semiconductor material each of which has high wettability as compared to the first mask patter can appropriately be used. The insulating material is, representatively, organic resin such as acryl resin, polyimide resin, melamine resin, polyester resin, polycarbonate resin, phenol resin, epoxy resin, polyacetal, polyether, polyurethane, polyamide (nylon), furan resin, and diallyl phthalate resin, and also siloxane polymer, polysilazane, PSG (Phosphor Silicate Glass), and BPSG (Boron Phosphorous Silicon Glass) can be used.</p>

<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Furthermore, a conductor dissolved or dispersed in solvent can be used as a representative of the conductive material. As the conductor, metal such as Ag, Au, Cu, Ni, Pt, Pd, Ir, Rh, W, Al, Ta, Mo, Cd, Zn, Fe, Ti, Si, Ge, Zr, and Ba, fine particles of silver halide, or dispersible nanoparticles can be used. Alternatively, ITO, ITO containing silicon oxide, organic indium, organotin, zinc oxide (ZnO), titanium nitride (TiN) used for a light-transmitting film, and the like can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Furthermore, a plurality of the aforementioned conductors that are dissolved or dispersed can be used as well.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">As a representative of the semiconductor material, an organic semiconductor material can be used. It is preferable that p-electron conjugated high molecular weight material having a conjugated double bond as its backbone be used as the organic semiconductor material. Representatively, a fusible high molecular weight material such as polythiophene, poly(3-alkylthiophene), polythiophene derivative, and pentacene can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">A material which has higher wettability as compared to the first mask pattern can be applied by the droplet discharging method, the ink-jetting method, the spin coating method, the roll coating method, the slot coating method and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Next, a film pattern <b>121</b> is formed by drying and baking the material which has higher wettability as compared to the first mask pattern as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>. Accordingly, in the case where the insulating material has high wettability, the film pattern is formed as an insulating layer having a desired shape. Further, in the case where the conductive material has high wettability, the film pattern is formed as a conductive layer having a desired shape. In the case where the semiconductor material has high wettability, the film pattern is formed as a semiconductor layer having a desired shape. Note that the solvent of the first mask pattern is evaporated in this step and the compound is left on the surface of the first film <b>102</b> or penetrates in the film. Note that the compound left on the surface of the first film <b>102</b> can be removed by a known etching method such as ashing using oxygen, wet etching, and dry etching. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, <b>122</b> denotes a compound of a mask pattern which penetrated in the first film <b>102</b>. In this step, drying and baking may be performed appropriately according to the material which has high wettability.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">A material which has high wettability may be applied after drying the solvent of the first mask pattern instead of the aforementioned step. That is, after forming the first mask pattern <b>103</b> by using a material which has low wettability on the first film <b>102</b>, the first mask pattern is dried as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</figref>. At this time, the compound of the first mask pattern is left on the surface of the first mask or penetrates in the film. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</figref>, <b>122</b> denotes a region in which the compound of the first mask pattern is penetrated. Next, a material which has high wettability as compared to the first mask pattern is discharged as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24C</figref>. In this case, the compound <b>122</b> of the first mask pattern is left in a region on which the first mask pattern was formed, therefore, a material which has higher wettability as compared to the first mask pattern is repelled and selectively applied as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24C</figref>. After this, the material which has higher wettability as compared to the first mask pattern is dried or baked appropriately to form the film pattern <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">By the aforementioned step, a film pattern having a desired shape can be formed without using a known photolithography process. Accordingly, the number of manufacturing steps can considerably be reduced.</p>

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34B</figref>, <b>1022</b> denotes a region in which the compound of the first mask pattern is penetrated in the first film. Next, the second solution which is lyophilic is applied as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34C</figref>. In this case, the compound <b>1022</b> of the first mask pattern is left in a region on which the first mask pattern was formed, therefore, the second solution is repelled and selectively applied as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34C</figref> After this, the second solution is dried and baked appropriately to form the second film pattern <b>1021</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">By the aforementioned steps, a film pattern having a desired shape can be formed without using a known photolithography process. Accordingly, the number of manufacturing steps can considerably be reduced.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">[Embodiment Mode 3]</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The following embodiment modes and embodiments are described with reference to Embodiment Mode 1. However, Embodiment Mode 2 can be applied appropriately.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">In this embodiment mode, steps of forming a film pattern having a desired shape using a first mask pattern which has low wettability and a second mask pattern which has high wettability is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref>. Note that the first mask pattern described in this embodiment mode is a mask pattern used for forming the second mask pattern. The second mask pattern is a mask pattern used for etching.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a first film <b>201</b> is formed on a first substrate <b>101</b> and a second film <b>202</b> is formed on the first film <b>201</b>. An appropriate material is used for the first film. As the second film, a similar material to that of the first film <b>102</b> in Embodiment Mode 1 can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Next, a first mask pattern <b>103</b> which has low wettability is formed on the second film <b>202</b> by applying a material which has low wettability by the droplet discharging method. At this time, a material which has high wettability is dried and baked in combination with the material which has low wettability.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Next, a material which has high wettability is applied to form a second mask pattern <b>212</b> which has high wettability as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. The material which has high wettability has higher wettability than the material which has low wettability, therefore, it is repelled by a portion which is in contact with the first mask pattern <b>103</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the material which has high wettability is applied in a region on which the first mask pattern is not formed. The material which has high wettability can be applied by the droplet discharging method, the ink-jetting method, the spin coating method, the roll coating method, the slot coating method and the like. After this a material which has high wettability is dried and baked as required. Consequently, the second mask pattern <b>212</b> as a mask pattern for etching can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the first mask pattern <b>103</b> is removed. In this embodiment mode, the first mask pattern <b>103</b> is removed by ashing. After this, an exposed region of the second film is etched by a known method such as dry etching and wet etching, thereby the film pattern <b>221</b> having a desired shape can be formed. In the case where the first mask pattern has a columnar or cylindrical shape, the film pattern is to have a contact hole.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, the film pattern <b>221</b> having a desired shape can be exposed by removing the second mask pattern <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">By the aforementioned process, a film pattern having a desired shape can be formed without using a known photolithography process.

<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Hereinafter described is a manufacturing method of a semiconductor element. Note that a TFT is taken as an example of a semiconductor element in this embodiment mode, however, the invention is not limited to this. An organic semiconductor transistor, a diode, an MIM element, a memory element, a photoelectric converter, a capacitor, a resistor and the like can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In this embodiment mode, steps of forming a channel-etch type TFT as a representative of an inverted staggered TFT as a semiconductor element using the invention are described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, a gate electrode <b>301</b> is formed on a substrate <b>101</b>. The gate electrode <b>301</b> is formed by the droplet discharging method, the printing method, an electric field plating method, a PVD method, and a CVD method. In the case of forming a conductive layer by using the PVD method and the CVD method, a mask pattern is formed on a conductive layer by the method in Embodiment Mode 3 or the photolithography process, thereby the gate electrode is formed by etching into a desired shape. In this embodiment mode, a compound containing a conductive material is selectively discharged on the substrate <b>101</b>. In this case, as the etching step using the mask pattern is not required, the manufacturing steps can considerably be simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">In the case of forming the gate electrode by the droplet discharging method, the compound discharged from an discharging orifice may be a conductor selected from the materials which have low wettability described in Embodiment Mode 1 dissolved or dispersed in solvent. Further, the gate electrode <b>301</b> can be formed by laminating conductive layers.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">It is preferable that the compound discharged from the discharging orifice be any one of gold, silver or copper dissolved or dispersed in solvent be used in consideration of the resistivity. More preferably, silver or copper which is low in resistance and cost is used. In the case of using copper, however, a barrier film is preferably provided in combination for preventing impurities. The solvent may be organic solvent such as esters such as butyl acetate, and ethyl acetate, alcohols such as isopropyl alcohol, and ethyl alcohol, organic solvent such as methyl ethyl ketone, and acetone, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">As a barrier film in the case of using copper as a wiring, an insulating or conductive substance containing nitrogen such as silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, aluminum nitride, titanium nitride, and tantalum nitride (TaN) are preferably used. The aforementioned substances may be formed by the droplet discharging method as well.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Note that viscosity of the compound used for the droplet discharging method is preferably 5 to 20 mPa&#xb7;s for preventing drying and for smoothly discharging the compound from the discharging orifice. It is preferable that the surface tension be 40 mN/m or less. Note that the viscosity, and the like of the compound may be appropriately controlled according to solvent used and application. As an example, the viscosity of the compound obtained by dissolving or dispersing indium tin oxide (ITO), zinc oxide (ZnO), indium zinc oxide (IZO), gallium-doped zinc oxide (GZO), and indium tin oxide containing silicon oxide, or organotin in solvent is 5 to 20 mPa&#xb7;s, the viscosity of the compound obtained by dissolving or dispersing silver in solvent is 5 to 20 mPa&#xb7;s, and the viscosity of the compound obtained by dissolving or dispersing gold in solvent is 10 to 20 mPa&#xb7;s.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">It is preferable that the diameter of particles of conductors be as small as possible for preventing clogging of the nozzle and for forming a fine pattern, although it is dependent on the diameter of each nozzle and a desired pattern shape. Preferably, diameter of the particle is 0.1 &#x3bc;m or less. The compound is formed by a known method such as an electrolyzing method, an atomizing method, and a wet reducing method. The particle size is generally about 0.5 to 10 &#x3bc;m. However, when the conductor is formed by gas evaporation method, a nano-molecule protected by a dispersion agent is about 7 nm, which is minute. When the surfaces of the nano-particles are covered by a coating agent, the nano-particles are not coagulated in the solvent. The nano-particles are dispersed stably at a room temperature. That is, the nano-particles exhibit substantially the same behavior as that of liquid. Therefore, it is preferable to use a coating agent.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">The step of discharging a compound may be performed under a low pressure. This is because subsequent steps of drying and baking can be omitted or shortened as solvent of the discharged compound is volatilized until it lands on the object being processed. After discharging a composition, one or both steps of drying and baking is carried out with laser irradiation, rapid thermal annealing, heating furnace, or the like under atmospheric pressure or low pressure. The steps of drying and baking are both heat treatment although their purposes, temperatures, and time differ. Drying is carried out, for example, at 100&#xb0; C. for 3 minutes and baking is carried out at 200 to 350&#xb0; C. for 15 to 120 minutes. In order to carry out the steps of drying and baking favorably, a substrate may be heated, of which temperature is set at 100 to 800&#xb0; C. (preferably, 200 to 350&#xb0; C.), though it depends on a material of the substrate and the like. Through this step, solvent in solution is volatilized or dispersant is removed chemically, and resin in the periphery cures and shrinks, thereby fusing and welding are accelerated. This step is carried out in an oxygen atmosphere, a nitrogen atmosphere, or in the air. However, this step is preferably carried out in an oxygen atmosphere in which solvent dissolved or dispersed with a metal element is easily removed.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Note that the conductive layer formed by the droplet discharging method is formed by randomly overlapping fine particles as conductors three-dimensionally. That is, the conductive layer is formed of three-dimensional agglomerate particles.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Accordingly, the surface thereof has fine projections and depressions. Further, as a grain diameter of the particles increases when the fine particles are baked by the heat of the light absorption layer and the heat retention time thereof. Therefore, a layer having large projections and depressions is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The laser light may be irradiated by using a continuous oscillation or pulse oscillation gas laser or a solid state laser. As the former gas laser, an excimer laser, a YAG laser, and the like are used while a laser using crystals such as YAG and YVO<sub>4 </sub>doped with Cr, Nd and the like is used as the latter solid state laser. In view of the absorption rate of the laser light, it is preferable to use a continuous oscillation laser. Further, what is called a hybrid laser irradiating method in which the pulse oscillation and the continuous oscillation are combined may be used as well. Although, depending on the heat resistance property of the substrate, it is preferable to apply heat treatment by irradiating laser light instantaneously for several micro seconds to several tens seconds. The rapid thermal annealing (RTA) is performed in an inert gas atmosphere by instantaneously applying heat for several micro seconds to several minutes by raising temperature rapidly using an infrared lamp or a halogen lamp for irradiating ultraviolet light to infrared light. This treatment is performed instantaneously, therefore, it is advantageous that only a thin film of the outermost surface can be substantially heated and an under-layer film is not affected.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Next, a gate insulating film <b>302</b> is formed on the gate electrode <b>301</b>. The gate insulating film <b>302</b> is formed of a single layer or a multi-layer structure of an insulating film containing silicon nitride, silicon oxide, and other silicon by using a thin film forming method such as the plasma CVD method or the sputtering method. It is preferable to form the gate insulating layer in lamination in the order of a silicon nitride film (a silicon nitride oxide film), a silicon oxide film, and a silicon nitride film (a silicon nitride oxide film) from a side in contact with the gate electrode layer. With this structure, the gate electrode is in contact with the silicon nitride film, therefore, a deterioration due to oxidization can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Next, the first semiconductor film <b>303</b> is formed on the gate insulating film <b>302</b>. As the first semiconductor film <b>303</b>, a film having any one of an amorphous semiconductor, a semi-amorphous semiconductor (also referred to as an SAS) in which an amorphous state and a crystalline state are mixed, a micro-crystalline semiconductor in which crystal grains of 0.5 to 20 nm can be observed in an amorphous semiconductor, and a crystalline semiconductor is used. In particular, a micro-crystalline state in which crystal grains of 0.5 to 20 nm can be observed is referred to as a micro crystal (&#x3bc;c). A film containing silicon, silicon germanium (SiGe) and the like can be formed of a semiconductor film in thickness of 10 to 60 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">An SAS has an intermediate structure between the amorphous structure and the crystalline structure (including a single crystalline and polycrystalline structures), which is a semiconductor having a third state that is stable in free energy. Also, SAS includes a crystalline region having a short-range order and lattice distortion. A crystalline region of 0.5 to 20 nm can be observed at least in a part of the film, and Raman spectrum is shifted to a low frequency side from 520 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>in the case where silicon is a main component. Diffraction peaks of (111) and (220) are measured by X-ray diffraction, which are caused by Si crystal grating. Also, hydrogen or halogen of at least 1 atomic % or more is included in order to terminate a dangling bond.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">An SAS is formed by depositing silicon gas by glow discharge (plasma CVD). The silicon gas is typically SiH<sub>4</sub>, as well as Si<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, SiH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, SiHCl<sub>3</sub>, SiCl<sub>4</sub>, SiF<sub>4 </sub>and the like. By diluting the silicon gas with hydrogen, or hydrogen and one or a plurality of noble gas elements such as helium, argon, krypton, and neon, SAS can be formed easily. The silicon gas is preferably diluted with a dilution ratio of 10 to 1000 times. The reaction production of a film by the glow discharge decomposition may be performed at a pressure of about 0.1 to 133 Pa. The glow discharge may be formed with a power of 1 to 120 MHz, more preferably with an RF power of 13 to 60 MHz. It is preferable that a temperature for heating the substrate be 300&#xb0; C. or less, more preferably 100 to 250&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Also, the crystalline semiconductor film can be formed by crystallizing an amorphous semiconductor film by heating or irradiating laser. Further, the crystalline semiconductor film may be formed directly. In this case, a fluorine gas such as GeF<sub>4 </sub>or F<sub>2 </sub>and a silane gas such as SiH<sub>4 </sub>and Si<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6 </sub>are used to form a crystalline semiconductor film directly by using heat or plasma.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Next, a conductive second semiconductor film <b>304</b> is formed. In the case of forming an n-channel type TFT, the conductive second semiconductor film <b>304</b> is added an element from group 15 of the Periodic Table of Elements, that is representatively phosphor or arsenic. In the case of forming a p-channel type TFT, an element from group 13 of the Periodic Table of Elements is added, that is representatively boron. The second semiconductor film <b>304</b> is deposited by the plasma CVD method by using a silicon gas added a gas containing elements of group 13 or 15 such as boron, phosphor, and arsenic. After forming the semiconductor film, the conductive second semiconductor film can be formed by applying solution containing elements of group 13 or 15 on the semiconductor film and irradiating laser light. As the laser light, laser light irradiated from a known pulse oscillation laser or a continuous oscillation laser is appropriately used.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Next, a first mask pattern <b>305</b> is formed on the conductive second semiconductor film <b>304</b> by the droplet discharging method. It is preferable that the first mask pattern <b>305</b> be formed of a heat resistant high molecular weight material which has an aromatic ring and heterocyclic ring as a main chain structure, has less aliphatic portion and contains hetero atom groups. Such a high molecular weight material is representatively polyimide or polybenzimidazole. In the case of using polyimide, a compound containing polyimide is discharged from a nozzle on the second semiconductor film <b>304</b> and baked at 200&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Next, a first semiconductor region <b>312</b> and a second semiconductor region <b>313</b> having desired shapes are formed by etching the first semiconductor film <b>303</b> and the second semiconductor film <b>304</b> by using the first mask pattern <b>305</b>.

The first mask pattern <b>305</b> is removed after etching.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Next, a source electrode and a drain electrode <b>314</b> are formed on the second semiconductor region <b>313</b> by discharging a conductive material by the droplet discharging method. As the conductive material, a material similar to the material of the gate electrode <b>301</b> dissolved or dispersed in solvent can be used. Here, a compound containing Ag (hereinafter referred to as Ag paste) is selectively discharged and drying and baking treatments are appropriately performed by irradiating laser light or by heat treatment to form each electrode in thickness of 600 to 800 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">By performing the baking treatment in O<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere, an organic substance such as binder (heat curable resin) and the like contained in the Ag paste is decomposed, thereby an Ag film containing few organic substances can be formed. Moreover, a surface of the film can be planarized. By discharging the Ag paste under a low pressure, solvent in the paste is evaporated and the subsequent heat treatment can be omitted or the heat treatment time can be shortened.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">The source electrode and the drain electrode <b>314</b> are formed by etching after depositing a conductive film in advance by the sputtering method and the like and forming a mask pattern by the droplet discharging method. The mask pattern can be formed by using the aforementioned material.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the first semiconductor region <b>312</b> is exposed by etching the second semiconductor region with the source electrode and the drain electrode <b>314</b> as masks. Here, the second semiconductor region separated by etching is denoted as a third semiconductor region <b>321</b>. For the etching condition, the aforementioned condition is appropriately applied. Further, in this embodiment mode, the second semiconductor region is etched by using the source electrode and the drain electrode, however, the invention is not limited to this step and the aforementioned mask patterns may be formed to be used for etching the semiconductor film.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Note that the first semiconductor region <b>312</b> can be formed by using an organic semiconductor material by the printing method, the spraying method, the spin coating method, the droplet discharging method and the like. In this case, as the aforementioned etching step is not required, the number of steps can be reduced. It is preferable that the organic semiconductor material used for the invention be a p-electron conjugated high molecular weight material having a conjugated double bond as its backbone. Representatively, a fusible high molecular weight material such as polythiophene, poly(3-alkylthiophene), polythiophene derivative, and pentacene can be used. As an organic semiconductor material that can be used in the invention, there is a material which can be used for forming a second semiconductor region by processing after depositing a fusible precursor. Such an organic semiconductor material which is formed through a precursor are polythienylene vinylene, poly(2,5-thienylene vinylene), polyacetylene, polyacetylene derivative, polyarylenevinylene, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">In transforming the precursor into an organic semiconductor, a reactive catalyst such as hydrogen chloride gas is added as well as heat treatment is applied.

The conductive layer functions as a contact layer, or a source electrode and a drain electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Moreover, a conductive layer formed of metal elements can be used instead of the third semiconductor region <b>321</b>. In this case, as most organic semiconductor materials have a p-type semiconductor which transports holes as carriers as a material to transport charges, it is preferable to use metal of which work function is high in order to obtain an ohmic contact with the semiconductor layer.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">In specific, metal, alloy or the like of gold, platinum, chromium, palladium, aluminum, indium, molybdenum, nickel and the like are preferable. By using a conductive paste using these metal or alloy materials, the conductive layer can be formed by the printing method, the roll coating method, and the droplet discharging method.</p>

Furthermore, such a structure can be employed that the source region and the drain region are formed at a certain distance without covering the gate electrode. In this structure, an off current can be reduced, therefore, in the case of using the TFT as a switching element of a display device, contrast can be improved. Moreover, a multi-gate TFT may be used that the second semiconductor region covers a plurality of gate electrodes. In this case also, the off current can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Next, it is preferable to deposit a passivation film on the source electrode and the drain electrode <b>314</b>.

<p id="p-0210" num="0209">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25A</figref>, the semiconductor region <b>603</b> is formed similarly to Embodiment Mode 7.

<p id="p-0212" num="0211">Next, the first mask pattern <b>612</b> which has low wettability is formed in a region where the source region and the drain region <b>611</b> and the gate insulating film <b>713</b> are overlapped as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25C</figref>. The first mask pattern <b>612</b> is provided for preventing the formation of an interlayer insulating film that is formed later, therefore, it is preferable to discharge the first mask pattern in a region where a contact hole and a connecting wiring are formed later.

<p id="p-0215" num="0214">In this embodiment mode, one mode of a droplet discharging apparatus which can be used for forming the mask pattern in the aforementioned embodiment modes is described. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, a region where one panel <b>1930</b> is formed on a substrate <b>1900</b> is shown by a dotted line.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">A droplet discharging apparatus <b>1905</b> has a head which includes a plurality of nozzles. In this embodiment mode, three heads (<b>1903</b><i>a</i>, <b>1903</b><i>b</i>, and <b>1903</b><i>c</i>) which has ten nozzles each are provided, however, the number of nozzles and heads can be set according to the process area and steps.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">Each head <b>1905</b> is connected to a control means <b>1907</b>. A computer <b>1910</b> controls the control means <b>1907</b>, thereby a programmed pattern can be drawn. A timing to draw may be, for example, determined on the basis of a marker <b>1911</b> formed on the substrate <b>1900</b> fixed on a stage <b>1931</b>. Alternatively, a base point may be determined on the basis of the edges of the substrate <b>1900</b>. This is detected by an image pickup means <b>1904</b> such as a CCD, and converted into a digital signal by an video signal processing means <b>1909</b>. The computer <b>1910</b> recognizes the digital signal and generates a control signal which is sent to the control means <b>1907</b>. When drawing a pattern in this manner, it is preferable that a distance between a surface to form a pattern and a distal end of a nozzle be 0.1 to 5 cm, preferably 0.1 to 2 cm, and more preferably about 0.1 mm. With a short distance like this, landing precision of the droplets is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">At this time, data on the pattern to be formed on the substrate <b>1900</b> is stored in a memory medium <b>1908</b>. On the basis of this data, a control signal is sent to the control means <b>1907</b>, which can control each head <b>1903</b><i>a</i>, <b>1903</b><i>b</i>, and <b>1903</b><i>c </i>independently. That is, each nozzle of the head <b>1903</b><i>a</i>, <b>1903</b><i>b</i>, and <b>1903</b><i>c </i>can discharge droplets of different materials. For example, the nozzles of the heads <b>1903</b><i>a </i>and <b>1903</b><i>b </i>discharge droplets containing an insulating material, and the nozzle of the head <b>1903</b><i>c </i>can discharge droplets containing a conductive material.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">Further, each nozzle of the head can also be controlled independently. As the nozzles can be controlled independently, droplets of different materials can be discharged from specific nozzles. For example, a nozzle for discharging droplets containing a conductive material and a nozzle for discharging droplets containing a material for an insulating material can be provided for the head <b>1903</b><i>a</i>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">Furthermore, in the case of applying the droplet discharging treatment on the large area such as a step of forming an interlayer insulating film, it is preferable to discharge droplets containing a material for an interlayer insulating film from all the nozzles. Further, it is preferable to discharge droplets containing a material for an interlayer insulating film from all the nozzles of the plurality of heads. Consequently, throughput can be improved. It is needless to say that the droplet discharging treatment can be applied to the large area by scanning a plurality of the nozzles each of which discharges droplets containing a material for an interlayer insulating film in the step of forming an interlayer insulating film.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">By scanning the head in zigzag or back and forth, a pattern can be formed on a large mother glass. At this time, it is preferable to scan the head and the substrate relatively a plurality of times. When scanning the head against the substrate, it is preferable to slant the head against a direction of movement.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">It is preferable that a width of the head be equivalent to a width of one panel when forming a plurality of panels from a large mother glass. This is because a pattern can be formed by one scanning against a region where one panel <b>1930</b> is formed, thus high throughput can be expected.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">The width of the head may be smaller than the width of the panel. At this time, a plurality of heads of which widths are small may be disposed in series to correspond to the width of one panel. By disposing a plurality of heads of which widths are small in series, a bending of the head can be prevented which is likely to occur as the width of the head becomes large. It is needless to say that a pattern can be formed by scanning a head of which width is small a plurality of times.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">It is preferable that a step of discharging droplets of the solution by the droplet discharging method be performed under a low pressure. This is because the solvent in the solution is evaporated before the discharged solution lands on the object being processed, thus steps of drying and baking of the solution can be omitted. Further, it is preferable to perform under a low pressure since an oxide film and the like are not formed on a surface of the conductor. A step of dropping the solution may be performed in a nitrogen atmosphere and an organic gas atmosphere as well.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">As the droplet discharging method, a piezoelectric method can be employed. The piezoelectric method is utilized for an ink jet printer for its superior controllability of droplets and high degree of freedom in the selection of ink. There are a vender type (representatively MLP (Multi Layer Piezo) type), a piston type (representatively an ML Chip (Multi Layer Ceramic Hyper Integrated Piezo Segments) type), a sidewall type and a roof wall type in the piezoelectric method. Depending on the solvent of the solution, the droplet discharging method using what is called a bubble jet (Japanese registered trademark) method (thermal method) may be used in which the solution is pushed out by generating bubbles by a heater.</p>
