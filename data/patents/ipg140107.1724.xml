<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a pressing member, an ultrasonic probe and an ultrasonic diagnosing device, and relates to a technique of enhancing the precision of an elastic image representing hardness and softness of a biomedical tissue of a subject by pressing the subject.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">An ultrasonic diagnosing device is a device for repetitively transmitting ultrasonic waves at a time interval to a subject through a probe which is contacted with the subject, receiving a time-series reflection echo signal emitted from the subject, and achieving a grayscale tomogram, for example, a monochromatic B mode image on the basis of the reflection echo signal.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There has been proposed a technique of measuring the displacement of a biomedical tissue of a subject on the basis of the time-series reflection echo signal emitted from the subject, acquiring elastic information such as hardness, softness, strain, elasticity modulus, etc. of the biomedical tissue from the measured displacement and constructing a color elastic image from the acquired elastic information in the ultrasonic diagnosing device as described above (for example, see Patent Document 1).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Patent Document 1: JP-2005-66041</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, when uniformity of stress field generated in the tissue is low, the pressed tissue is pushed out into a press-weak region. This being pushed out prevents the stress from coming down to a deep region, which may cause occurrence of noises in the elastic image. Therefore, even when uniform press is applied, the region area of the elastic image which can be normally acquired is reduced, and thus the efficiency of the image diagnosis is lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In (Patent Document 1), a flat-plate type press plate is mounted on a probe so that a broad region of the subject can be uniformly pressed. However, the same problem may occur in the end region of the press plate, and it is still required to make an effort of further improving the press plate.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, the present invention has an object to achieve an elastic image having high precision by enabling a subject to be uniformly pressed.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to solve the problem, a pressing member according to the present invention is constructed as follows. That is, the pressing member that is detachably mounted in an ultrasonic probe to press a subject is provided with a first member for transferring pressing force in a direction parallel to a pressing direction to the subject and a second member for transferring pressing force in a direction different from the pressing direction.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to solve the problem, an ultrasonic probe according to the present invention is constructed as follows. That is, the probe is equipped with a pressing portion for pressing a subject, and the pressing portion has a first member for transferring pressing force in a direction parallel to the pressing direction to the subject, and a second member for transferring the pressing force in a direction different from the pressing direction.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, in order to solve the problem, an ultrasonic diagnosing device of the present invention is constructed as follows. That is, the ultrasonic diagnosing device is equipped with an ultrasonic probe having an ultrasonic transmission/reception face for repetitively transmitting ultrasonic waves to a subject and receiving time-series reflection echo signal corresponding to the transmission of the ultrasonic waves, a tomogram constructing portion for constructing a tomogram of a biomedical tissue of the subject on the basis of the time-series reflection echo signal, an elastic image constructing portion for measuring the displacement of the biomedical tissue of the subject on the basis of the time-series reflection echo signal to acquire elastic information and construct an elastic image, and a display portion for displaying an image constructed by the tomogram constructing portion and the elastic image constructing portion, wherein the ultrasonic probe is equipped with a pressing portion for pressing a subject, and the pressing portion has a first member for transferring pressing force in a direction parallel to the pressing direction to the subject, and a second member for transferring the pressing force in a direction different from the pressing direction.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the pressing member, the ultrasonic probe and the ultrasonic diagnosing device of the present invention, the subject can be uniformly pressed, and thus a high-precision elastic image can be achieved. Accordingly, the image diagnosis can be efficiently performed.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">First, examples of an ultrasonic probe (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;probe&#x201d;) and an ultrasonic diagnosing device to which the present invention is applied will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a block diagram showing an example of the construction of the probe and the ultrasonic diagnosing device to which the present invention is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, an ultrasonic diagnosing device <b>1</b> is equipped with a probe <b>10</b> which is used in contact with a subject <b>5</b>, a transmission portion <b>12</b> for repetitively transmitting ultrasonic waves to a subject through the probe <b>10</b> at a time interval, a reception portion <b>14</b> for receiving a time-series reflection echo signal occurring from the subject, and a phasing adding portion <b>16</b> for phasing and adding the received reflection echo signal to generate RF signal frame data in time-series.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">There are further provided a tomogram constructing portion <b>18</b> for constructing a grayscale tomogram of the subject, for example, a monochromatic tomogram on the basis of the RF signal frame data from the phasing and adding portion <b>16</b>, and an elastic image constructing portion <b>20</b> for measuring the displacement of the biomedical tissue of the subject from the RF signal frame data of the phasing and adding portion <b>16</b> to achieve elastic data and constructing a color elastic image. An image combining portion <b>22</b> for combining the monochromatic tomogram and the color elastic image and an image display portion <b>24</b> for displaying the combined composite image are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The probe <b>10</b> is formed by arranging an acoustic lens and plural transducers, and has a function of performing electrical beam-scanning to transmit/receive ultrasonic waves to/from the subject through the transducers. Furthermore, the probe <b>10</b> is used under the state that the pressing plate is mounted on the probe, or used under the state that the probe <b>10</b> is equipped with the pressing plate.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The transmission portion <b>12</b> has a function of generating a wave transmitting pulse for driving the probe <b>10</b> to generate ultrasonic waves, and also setting the convergent point of the transmitted ultrasonic waves to some depth. Furthermore, the reception portion <b>14</b> amplifies the reflection echo signal received in the probe <b>10</b> by a predetermined gain to generate an RF signal, that is, a wave reception signal.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The phasing and adding portion <b>16</b> receives the RF signal amplified in the reception portion <b>14</b> to control the phase, and forms ultrasonic beams for one point or plural convergent points to generate RF signal frame data.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The tomogram constructing portion <b>18</b> is configured to contain a signal processor <b>30</b> and a monochromatic scan converter <b>32</b>. Here, the signal processor <b>30</b> receives the RF signal frame data from the phasing and adding portion <b>16</b> and executes signal processing such as gain compensation, log compression, wave detection, edge enhancement, filter processing, etc. to achieve tomogram data. The monochromatic scan converter <b>32</b> is configured to contain an A/D converter for converting tomogram data from the signal processor <b>30</b> to a digital signal, a frame memory for storing plural converted tomogram data in time-series, and a controller. The monochromatic scan converter <b>32</b> achieves as one image tomographic frame data in the subject which are stored in the frame memory by the controller, and converts the achieved tomographic frame data to a signal to be read out in synchronism with television.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Furthermore, the elastic image constructing portion <b>20</b> is constructed to contain an RF signal selecting portion <b>34</b>, a displacement measuring portion <b>35</b>, a pressure measuring portion <b>36</b>, an elastic data calculator <b>37</b>, an elastic signal processor <b>38</b> and a color scan converter <b>39</b>, and it is provided at the rear stage of the phasing and adding portion <b>16</b> while branched from the phasing and adding portion <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The RF signal selecting portion <b>34</b> is configured to contain a frame memory and a selecting portion. The RF signal selecting portion <b>34</b> stores the plural RF signal frame data from the phasing and adding portion <b>16</b> into the frame memory, and selects a pair of, that is, two RF signal frame data from the stored RF signal frame data group through the selecting portion. For example, the RF signal selecting portion <b>34</b> successively stores into the frame memory the RF signal frame data which are generated from the phasing and adding portion <b>16</b> in time-series, that is, on the basis of the frame rate of the image, and selects the presently stored RF signal frame data (N) as first data in accordance with an instruction from the controller <b>26</b>, and at the same time selects one RF signal frame data (X) from RF signal frame data group (N-<b>1</b>, N-<b>2</b>, N-<b>3</b>, . . . , N-M) which were stored in past times. Here, N, M, X represent index numbers allocated to the RF signal frame data, and they are assumed to be natural numbers.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The displacement measuring portion <b>35</b> determines the displacement, etc. of the biomedical tissue from a pair of RF signal frame data. For example, the displacement measuring portion <b>35</b> executes one-dimensional or two-dimensional correlation processing on the one pair of data selected by the RF signal selecting portion <b>34</b>, that is, the RF signal frame data (N) and the RF signal frame data (X) to determine a one-dimensional or two-dimensional displacement distribution concerning the displacement of the biomedical tissue corresponding to each point of the tomogram and the displacement vector, that is, the direction and the magnitude of the displacement. Here, for example, a block matching method is used for detection of the displacement vector. According to the block matching method, an image is divided to blocks each comprising N&#xd7;N pixels, a block in a region of interest is noted, a block which is most approximate to the block being noted is found from a previous frame, and a sample value is determined on the basis of the block concerned by the predictive coding, that is, the difference.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The pressure measuring portion <b>36</b> measures and estimates the pressure in the body cavity of a diagnosis site of the subject <b>5</b>. For example, a pressure measuring portion having a pressure sensor is secured to the probe <b>10</b> or the pressing plate which is used in contact with the surface of the body of the subject, and a stress distribution is applied to the inside of the body cavity of the diagnosis site of the subject by pressurizing or reducing the pressure of the head of the probe <b>10</b> and the pressing plate. At this time, the pressure sensor measures and holds the pressure applied to the surface of the body by the probe head and the pressing plate at any time phase.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The elastic data calculator <b>37</b> calculates the strain or elasticity modulus of the biomedical tissue corresponding to each point on the tomogram on the basis of the measurement value, for example, the displacement vector from the displacement measuring portion <b>35</b> and the pressure value from the pressure measuring portion <b>36</b>, and generates an elastic image signal, that is, elastic frame data on the basis of the strain or the elasticity modulus.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">At this time, the data of the strain is calculated by spatially differentiating the movement amount, that is, the displacement of the biomedical tissue. The data of the elasticity modulus is calculated by diving the variation of the pressure by the variation of the movement amount. For example, when the displacement measured by the displacement measuring portion <b>35</b> is represented by &#x394;L and the pressure variation measured by the pressure measuring portion <b>36</b> is represented by &#x394;P, the strain (S) can be calculated by spatially differentiating &#x394;L, and thus it is calculated by using the equation of S=&#x394;L/&#x394;X. Furthermore, Young's modulus is known as the elasticity modulus corresponding to the strain, and the Young's modulus Ym is calculated according to the equation of Ym=(&#x394;P)/(&#x394;L/L). That is, the Young's modulus corresponds to the ration of the simple pressure applied to an object and the strain per unit length in the pressure applying direction. The elasticity modulus of the biomedical tissue corresponding to each point of the tomogram is determined from this Young's modulus, and thus the two-dimensional elastic image data can be sequentially achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The elastic data processor <b>38</b> is configured to contain a frame memory and an image processor, and it stores into the frame memory elastic frame data which are output from the elastic data calculator <b>37</b> in time-series, and executes image processing on the stored frame data through the image processor in response to an instruction from the controller <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The color scan converter <b>39</b> executes the conversion to hue information on the basis of the elastic frame data from the elastic data processor <b>38</b>. That is, it executes the conversion to light's three primary colors, that is, red (R) green (G), blue (B) on the basis of the elastic frame data. For example, elastic data having large strain is converted to a red color code, and elastic data having small strain is converted to a blue color code.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the ultrasonic diagnosing device of the present invention, an accommodating portion for accommodating at least one pressing plate which is detachably mounted on the probe described below is provided in the neighborhood of a probe holder or to the side surface of the device or the like, for example. The pressing plate accommodating portion is designed to have a shape like a basket or box or a shape like a hook which is inserted through a hole portion of the pressing plate described later to hold the pressing plate, whereby the pressing member can be taken in and out freely.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the image pickup operation of an elastic image by using the ultrasonic diagnosing device as described above, when uniformity of a stress field generated in the tissue is low, the pressed tissue is pushed out into a press-weak area, and noise may occur in the elastic image. This phenomenon will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a diagram showing a model in which a target having uniform hardness is pressed by using the probe <b>10</b>. The contact area of the probe <b>10</b> to the subject, that is, the pressing area is small, and thus a displacement vector faces the outside in a region <b>506</b>. Accordingly, the pressed tissue at the center portion is pushed out to the non-pressed region, so that noises are induced at both the side regions <b>510</b> of the elastic image displayed on the image display portion <b>24</b>. Furthermore, the stress to be applied to a deep region is prevented from coming down to the deep region by the above fleeing, so that noise is induced in a deep region <b>511</b> of the elastic image. Therefore, even when uniform pressing is applied, the area of the region in which a normal elastic image <b>512</b> can be achieved is reduced. That is, the normal region of the elastic image displayed on the image display portion <b>24</b> is narrowed. The above-described problem associated with the elastic image is solved by the pressing member, the probe and the ultrasonic diagnosing device of the present invention described below, and some embodiments will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">(First Embodiment)</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A first embodiment according to the present invention will be described. First, the shape of the pressing member of this embodiment will be described. The pressing member of this embodiment is characterized by comprising a first member for transferring pressing force in a direction parallel to the pressing direction to the subject, and a second member for transferring pressing force in a direction different from the pressing direction.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The second member is preferably designed as follows. That is, it is formed so as to extend to the edge portion of the first member. Furthermore, it is designed so that the transferring direction of the pressing force faces the center portion side of the first member so as to intersect with the pressing direction. Furthermore, considering the perspective of the subject, the second member is formed so as to press a part of the subject pressed by the first member so that the part of the subject is prevented from being pushed out in a direction different from the pressing direction.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Furthermore, considering the perspective of the contact face of the pressing member to the subject, the first member has a first face vertical to the pressing direction, and the second member has a second face perpendicular to the direction different from the pressing direction. That is, the contact face is formed so that the vertical direction of at least a partial face thereof is different from the vertical direction of the other remaining face thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">An example in which a plate-shaped member is used as the pressing member will be described below, and thus the pressing member will be referred to as pressing plate.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows an example of the pressing plate of this embodiment. FIG. <b>1</b>A(<i>a</i>) is a top view of the pressing plate <b>100</b>, FIG. <b>1</b>A(<i>b</i>) is a bottom view of the pressing plate <b>100</b>, FIG. <b>1</b>A(<i>c</i>) is a cross-sectional view of the pressing plate <b>100</b> taken at a position indicated by a one-dotted chain line A when viewed in the minor axis direction, FIG. <b>1</b>A(<i>d</i>) is a cross-sectional view of the pressing plate <b>100</b> at a position indicated by a one-dotted chain line when viewed in the major axis direction. The pressing plate <b>100</b> is formed of material such as plastic, polyvinyl based material or the like, for example. The pressing plate <b>100</b> is designed to be larger in dimension than the probe <b>10</b> in the major and minor axes of the probe <b>10</b> so that the pressing plate <b>100</b> can press the subject over a broader area than the ultrasonic wave transmission/reception face <b>11</b> of the probe <b>10</b>, and the edge portion of the pressing plate <b>100</b> is designed in a substantially rectangular shape or the like so that the four corners thereof are rounded. The shape of the edge portion of the pressing plate may be set to another shape, and for example it may be circular, elliptic or polygonal.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The lower surface of the pressing plate is the surface which comes into contact with the body surface of the subject. As shown in FIG. <b>1</b>A(<i>b</i>), the lower surface of the pressing plate <b>100</b> has a flat face (first face) <b>70</b> at the center portion thereof, and a slant face <b>71</b> (second face) that extends to the edge portion of the flat face <b>70</b> and intersects with the flat face <b>70</b>. That is, the slant face <b>71</b> is designed to be oblique to the flat face <b>70</b> so that the vertical direction (the direction of the normal line) of the slant face <b>71</b> intersects with the vertical direction (the direction of the normal line) of the flat face <b>70</b> (that is, the slant face <b>71</b> faces the center portion side of the lower surface of the pressing plate). This design makes the lower surface of the pressing plate in a concave shape. The slant face <b>71</b> may be flat or concaved. Or, it may contain a flat face and a concave face in mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The length in the major direction of the flat face <b>70</b> of the pressing plate <b>100</b> is set to be equal to or longer than the length in the major direction of the probe <b>10</b>. The intersection angle between the slant face <b>71</b> and the flat face <b>71</b> is set in the range from 90 to 180 degrees. The width of the slant face <b>71</b> may be set to several mm to several cm which is in the same level as the width in the minor direction of the probe <b>10</b>, however, it may be set in accordance with the site of the subject. Likewise, the width of the flat face <b>70</b> from the side surface of the probe <b>10</b> to the slant face <b>71</b> may be set in the range from several mm to several cm, however, it may be set in accordance with the site of the subject.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The slant face <b>71</b> may be formed at at least a part of the edge portion of the pressing plate <b>100</b>, however, it is preferable that the slant face <b>71</b> is formed on the whole periphery of the edge portion of the pressing plate <b>100</b>. Particularly, in the case of the pressing plate <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the slant face <b>71</b> is formed at both the sides in each of the minor axis direction and the major axis direction along each axis direction, and this it is suitable for a linear type probe. That is, the slant face <b>71</b> formed along the minor axis direction of the pressing plate <b>100</b> is formed obliquely to the flat face <b>70</b> so as to face the center portion side in the major axis direction of the pressing plate <b>100</b>, and the slant face <b>71</b> formed along the major direction of the pressing plate <b>100</b> is formed obliquely to the flat face <b>70</b> so as to face the center portion side in the minor axis direction of the pressing plate <b>100</b>. The slant face <b>71</b> may be formed along any one of the minor axis direction and the major axis direction of the pressing plate <b>100</b>, or may be formed at only one side in one axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the above embodiment, the lower surface of the pressing plate has the flat face and the slant face. However, it may be designed in other shapes. For example, the lower surface of the pressing plate may be designed in a concaved shape at least a part of which varies smoothly. That is, at least one of the flat face <b>70</b> and the slant face <b>71</b> may be designed to have a concave shape at least a part of which varies smoothly. Conversely, it may be designed to have a convex shape at least a part of which varies smoothly. That is, at least one of the flat face <b>70</b> and the slant face <b>71</b> may be designed to have a convex shape at least a part of which varies smoothly. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> shows these examples. In the example of each pressing plate shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, the display of the fixing portion mounted on the upper surface is omitted, and the cross-section in the major axis direction is shown when viewed in the major axis direction. With respect to a pressing plate <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> of FIG. <b>1</b>D(<i>a</i>), only the slant face <b>71</b> has a smooth concave shape. With respect to a pressing plate <b>100</b>-<b>2</b> of FIG. <b>1</b>D(<i>b</i>) both the flat face <b>70</b> and the slant face <b>71</b> have a smooth concave shape and they are smoothly connected to each other, thereby forming a smooth concave shape as a whole. With respect to a pressing plate <b>100</b>-<b>3</b> of FIG. <b>1</b>D(<i>c</i>), only the slant face <b>71</b> has a smooth convex shape. With respect to a pressing plate <b>100</b>-<b>4</b> of FIG. <b>1</b>D(<i>d</i>), both the flat face <b>70</b> and the slant face <b>71</b> have a smooth convex shape, and they are smoothly connected and form a smooth convex shape as a whole. In any case, the same is applied to the minor axis direction of the pressing plate.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Furthermore, a hole portion <b>72</b> is provided to a part of the pressing plate <b>100</b> so that an acoustic lens, that is, an ultrasonic wave transmission/reception face <b>11</b> of the probe <b>10</b> can be disposed. The probe <b>10</b> transmits/receives ultrasonic waves through this hole portion <b>72</b> to/from the subject. That is, it is configured so that the ultrasonic wave transmission/reception face <b>11</b> of the probe <b>10</b> is brought into direct contact with the subject through the hole portion <b>72</b>. The hole portion in which the ultrasonic wave transmission/reception face is disposed is preferably formed substantially at the center of the pressing plate, and the hole portion <b>72</b> is formed substantially at the center of the flat portion <b>70</b> in the pressing plate <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. The surface of the ultrasonic wave transmission/reception face <b>11</b> may also serve as at least a part of the flat face <b>70</b>. That is, the pressing plate <b>100</b> may be constructed so that the ultrasonic wave transmission/reception face <b>11</b> constitutes a part of the flat face <b>70</b> of the pressing plate <b>100</b>. Furthermore, by setting the ultrasonic wave transmission/reception face <b>11</b> to the flat face <b>70</b>, the pressing plate <b>100</b> which does not have the flat face <b>70</b>, but has only the slant face <b>71</b> may be constructed.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The upper surface of the pressing plate is equipped with a fixing portion through which the pressing plate is detachably mounted on the probe. This fixing portion has at least one side surface fixing portion for fixing the arrangement position in the side surface direction of the probe while sandwiching the probe therein. At least one side surface fixing portion has a fitting portion which is fitted to at least a part of the side surface of the probe to fix the arrangement position in the insertion direction of the probe. By the fixing portion having the above structure, the relative position in the minor axis direction and the major axis direction between the probe and the pressing plate is fixed by the side surface fixing portion, and the relative position in the probe insertion direction between the probe and the pressing plate is fixed by the fitting portion, whereby the pressing plate is mounted on the probe.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the example of the fixing portion shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a pair of counter plates <b>73</b> as the side surface fixing portion are formed and disposed in each of the major axis direction and the minor axis direction while the hole portion <b>72</b> in which the probe <b>10</b> is disposed is sandwiched therebetween, and a projecting portion <b>74</b> as a fitting portion is formed at the hole portion <b>72</b> side of each of the pair of counter plates <b>73</b>-<i>a</i>. The two pairs of counter plates <b>73</b> clamp and hold the probe <b>10</b> disposed in the hole portion <b>72</b> in the major axis direction and the minor axis direction, whereby the relative positions in the minor axis direction and the major axis direction between the probe <b>10</b> and the pressing plate <b>100</b> are fixed. Furthermore, the projecting portions <b>74</b> are fitted to recesses <b>75</b> of the probe <b>10</b>, whereby the relative position in the probe insertion direction between the probe <b>10</b> and the pressingplate <b>100</b> is fixed. If each counterplate <b>74</b> is formed of a material such as plastic, polyvinyl or the like, it would be easy to slightly deform the counter plates by the force having the same level as human power to fit the projecting portions <b>74</b> to the recesses <b>75</b> of the probe <b>10</b>. The pressing plate <b>100</b> can be easily mounted on and detached from the probe <b>10</b> by the fixing portion having the structure as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The back surface of each counter plate may be provided with an antiskid grip to be gripped by a hand. FIGS. <b>1</b>C(<i>a</i>) (<i>b</i>) show an example of the structure of the antiskid grip. FIGS. <b>1</b>C(<i>a</i>) (<i>b</i>) are diagrams showing the probe <b>10</b> on which the pressing plate <b>100</b> is mounted when the probe <b>10</b> is viewed in the major axis direction and in the minor axis direction, respectively. An examiner grips the antiskid grips <b>76</b> and presses the subject through the pressing plate <b>100</b>. In order to make it easy to grasp the antiskid grips <b>76</b>, the back surfaces of the counter plates <b>73</b> may be designed to have a concave shape <b>77</b> which is matched with the shape of a finger. The antiskid grip <b>76</b> may be provided to the back surface of at least one counter plate. Furthermore, the back surface of the counter plate may be designed to have a concave shape <b>77</b> with omitting the antiskid grip <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Furthermore, the conventional probe is provided with a projecting portion for making the ultrasonic wave scan direction recognizable, and the fixing portion of the pressing plate may have a structure which enables an examiner to grasp the projecting portion even under the state that the pressing plate is mounted on the probe. The example of this structure is shown in FIG. <b>1</b>C(<i>c</i>) (<i>d</i>). FIG. <b>1</b>C(<i>c</i>) is a diagram showing an example in which one of the counter plates has a structure covering the projecting portion <b>77</b>, and is views of the probe <b>10</b> in which the pressing plate <b>100</b> is mounted, the views being taken in the major axis direction (upper diagram) and in the minor axis direction (lower diagram), respectively. In this structure, a raised portion <b>78</b> occurs at the outside of the counter plate <b>73</b> covering the projecting portion <b>77</b>, and thus the examiner can recognize this raised portion <b>78</b> as a substitute of the projecting portion <b>77</b>. Furthermore, FIG. <b>1</b>C(<i>d</i>) shows a diagram showing a structure in which the counter plate <b>73</b> avoids the projecting portion <b>77</b>, and shows the probe <b>10</b> having the pressing plate <b>100</b> mounted thereon when the probe <b>10</b> is viewed in the major axis direction (upper diagram) and in the minor direction (lower diagram). In this structure, the counter plate <b>73</b> avoids the projection portion <b>77</b>, and holds the side surface of the probe at only the portion between the projection portion <b>77</b> and the pressing plate <b>100</b>. Therefore, the examiner can directly recognize the projection portion <b>77</b> of the probe.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">At least a part of the pressing plate is constructed by a deformable member, and at least a part of the slant face of the edge portion is configured to be deformable to a desired shape. Copper, iron, aluminum or the like may be used as the deformable material. By forming the pressing plate of the deformable member, the edge portion of the pressing plate can be deformed so that the slant angle of the edge portion is matched with the shape of the body surface of the subject. By using the pressing plate as described above, the examiner can deform the surface of the lower surface of the pressing plate in conformity with the shape of the body surface of the subject, whereby the body surface of the subject can be effectively pressed. Particularly, by adopting the material (plastic, foamed polystyrene or the like) or the structure (the boundary portion between the flat portion and the edge portion is thinned) that can be easily deformed by minute force having the same level as pressing and in which the deformation is within the plastic deformation range, the lower surface shape of the pressing plate and the slant angle of the slant face of the edge portion is automatically deformed simultaneously with the pressing while following the shape of the body surface of the subject, and also the shape of the lower surface of the pressing plate is returned to the original one simultaneously with release of the pressing. As a result, even the same pressing plate can be flexibly adapted to different body surface shapes, so that the burden of exchanging the pressing plate can be reduced, and further the efficiency of the image diagnosis can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Furthermore, the edge portion (second member) having the slant face may be configured to be detachable from the flat portion (first member) having the flat face. Plural kinds of edge portions having different slant faces are prepared in advance, and an edge portion having a slant face conformed to the body surface shape of the subject is selected and mounted to the flat portion. By using the thus-constructed pressing plate, the pressing plate can be flexibly adapted to the different body surface shapes of the subject.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Next, the state that the pressing plate is detachably mounted on the ultrasonic wave transmission/reception surface side of the probe will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows an example in which the pressing plate <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is mounted on the probe <b>10</b>. FIG. <b>1</b>B(<i>a</i>) is a view taken in the major axis direction, FIG. <b>1</b>B(<i>b</i>) is a cross-sectional view in the minor axis direction at a position indicated by a one-dotted chain line when viewed in the minor axis direction, FIG. <b>1</b>C(<i>c</i>) is a perspective view showing the lower surface of the pressing member <b>100</b> and the ultrasonic wave transmission/reception face <b>11</b>. The two pairs of counter plates <b>73</b> in the minor axis direction and in the major axis direction sandwich the probe <b>10</b> among them to fix the relative positions in the respective directions so that the ultrasonic wave transmission/reception face <b>11</b> is disposed in the hole portion <b>72</b> and slightly projects from the lower face of the pressing plate <b>100</b>. The projecting portions <b>74</b> at the inside of the counter plates <b>73</b>-<i>a </i>are fitted to the recesses <b>75</b> of the probe <b>10</b>, whereby the relative position in the insertion direction between the probe and the pressing plate is fixed. The pressing plate <b>100</b> is fixed to the probe <b>10</b> as described above. The examples of the pressing plate shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1C</figref>, <b>1</b>D can be mounted to the probe <b>10</b> in the same manner.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Under the state that the pressing plate <b>100</b> is mounted on the probe <b>10</b>, the vertical direction of the surface of at least a part of the lower surface of the pressing plate <b>100</b> is different from the vertical direction of the ultrasonic wave transmission/reception face <b>11</b>. For example, the lower surface of the pressing plate <b>100</b> has the flat face <b>70</b> along the ultrasonic wave transmission/reception face <b>11</b> and the slant face <b>71</b> having an angle different from the flat face <b>70</b> with respect to the ultrasonic wave transmission/reception face <b>11</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the slant face <b>71</b> is inclined to the center portion side of the ultrasonic wave transmission/reception face <b>11</b> with respect to the flat face <b>70</b> so that the vertical direction of the slant face <b>71</b> intersects with the vertical direction of the flat face <b>70</b>. Furthermore, the flat face <b>70</b> is parallel to the ultrasonic wave transmission/reception face <b>11</b>. In the foregoing description, the pressing plate is detachably mounted on the probe. However, the probe may be configured to be equipped with each pressing plate described above in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Next, the aspect of the variation of the tissue of the subject when the subject <b>5</b> is pressed by using the pressing plate <b>100</b> as described above will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) shows the probe <b>10</b> having the pressing plate <b>100</b> mounted thereon when the probe <b>10</b> is viewed in the major direction, and shows the aspect of the displacement vector in a pressed tissue of the subject <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">By using the pressing plate <b>100</b>, the subject <b>5</b> is pressed vertically to the surface with which the probe <b>10</b> is in contact together with the acoustic lens as the ultrasonic wave transmission/reception face <b>11</b>, the strain and the elasticity modulus of the biomedical tissue corresponding to each point on the tomogram are calculated from the displacement vector indicated by an arrow <b>102</b> which is calculated from the reflection echo signal received by the probe <b>10</b>, and the pressure value from the pressure measuring portion <b>36</b>, and then the elastic image signal, that is, the elastic frame data are generated on the basis of the strain and the elasticity modulus. On the basis of the elastic frame data, the elastic image corresponding to the region <b>104</b> is displayed on the image display portion <b>24</b>. This subject <b>5</b> is assumed to have uniform hardness.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In this embodiment, the surface area of the subject <b>5</b> under press is more increased as compared with the case where the subject <b>5</b> is pressed by only the probe <b>10</b> by using the pressing plate <b>100</b>. Furthermore, the shape of the pressing plate <b>100</b> is set so that the center portion thereof is set to a flat shape and the edge portion thereof has a shape facing the inside (that is, the center portion side of the probe <b>10</b>). Therefore, the displacement vector faces the inside (that is, the center portion side of the probe <b>10</b>) in the region <b>105</b> of the edge portion, and it faces the same direction as the pressing direction in the deep region <b>106</b>. The region of the center portion is pressed inwardly (that is, to the center portion side of the probe <b>10</b>) by the displacement vector <b>102</b> of the region <b>105</b> of the edge portion, and thus the tissue is suppressed from fleeing outwardly (to the edge portion side of the probe <b>10</b>) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, so that the stress effectively comes down to the deep portion.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Accordingly, the pressing plate <b>100</b> keeps the pressing direction to be vertical to the surface with which the probe <b>10</b> comes into contact, and also the edge portion region is pressed to the center portion side of the probe <b>10</b>, whereby the region of the elastic image <b>108</b> displayed on the image display portion <b>24</b> is broadened in the major axis direction of the probe <b>10</b>. Furthermore, stress which is sufficient to achieve the elastic image <b>108</b> can be applied at the deep portion, and thus an elastic image <b>108</b> which is broad in the depth direction can be achieved. In order to make the difference from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> easily understandable, the partial regions corresponding to the partial regions <b>510</b>, <b>511</b> and <b>512</b> of the elastic image of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> are represented by the same region numbers while the region numbers are written in parentheses. That is, by using the pressing plate of this embodiment, the normal elastic image can be achieved in all the regions <b>510</b> to <b>512</b>. Accordingly, the elastic image which is normally displayed is broadened and thus the image diagnosis can be efficiently performed.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">(Second Embodiment)</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Next, a second embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>) shows the probe <b>10</b> on which the pressing plate <b>100</b> is mounted when the probe <b>10</b> is viewed in the major axis direction. A pressing plate <b>110</b> having an arcuate lower surface is detachably secured to the ultrasonic wave scanning face side of the probe <b>10</b>. The difference from the first embodiment resides in that the pressing plate <b>110</b> has an arcuate shape.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The arcuate pressing plate <b>110</b> is designed so that the slant angle gradually grows steeper to the subject side as the position shifts to the edge portion, and the contact surface with the subject <b>5</b> has a concave shape. For example, the pressing plate has a concave curve as shown in FIG. <b>1</b>D(<i>b</i>). Therefore, the displacement vector <b>102</b> of the edge portion is inclined to the inside (that is, the center portion side of the probe <b>10</b>) as compared with the displacement vector <b>102</b> at the center portion.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As described above, the region <b>111</b> at the center portion is pressed inwardly (that is, to the center portion side of the probe <b>10</b>) by the displacement vector <b>102</b> of the regions of the edge portions. Therefore, in the region <b>111</b> at the center portion, the displacement vector <b>102</b> is kept vertical to the ultrasonic wave transmission/reception face <b>11</b> at the shallow portion (that is, the portion near to the probe <b>10</b>) and the deep portion (that is, the portion far away from the probe <b>10</b>). Furthermore, in the regions other than the region <b>111</b> of the center portion, the displacement vector <b>102</b> in the pressing direction gradually becomes vertical to the ultrasonic wave transmission/reception face <b>11</b> as the position approaches to the region <b>106</b> of the deep portion.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Accordingly, as in the case of the first embodiment, the pressing direction is kept to be vertical to the surface with which the probe <b>10</b> is in contact over a broad range, whereby the normal region of the elastic image <b>109</b> displayed on the image display portion <b>24</b> is broadened in the major axis direction and the deep direction of the probe <b>10</b>. In order to make the difference from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> easily understandable, the partial regions corresponding to the partial regions <b>510</b>, <b>511</b> and <b>512</b> of the elastic image of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> are represented by the same region numbers while the region numbers are written in parentheses. Accordingly, the normally displayed elastic image is broader, and thus the image diagnosis of the inside of the subject <b>5</b> can be efficiently performed.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The probe may be designed to be equipped with the pressing plate of this embodiment in advance as in the case of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">(Third Embodiment)</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Next, a third embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3(</figref><i>a</i>) (<i>b</i>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>) shows a pressing plate <b>152</b> for pressing the subject <b>5</b> and the probe <b>10</b> when they are viewed in the major axis direction. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>b</i>) shows the pressing plate <b>152</b> and the probe <b>10</b> when they are viewed in the minor axis direction. The flat-plate type pressing plate <b>152</b> is detachably secured to the ultrasonic wave scanning face side of the probe <b>10</b>. The difference from the first embodiment and the second embodiment resides in that the pressing plate <b>152</b> is of a flat-plate type and the size of the pressing plate is suitable for the site being examined of the subject <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">An observation site <b>150</b> of the subject <b>5</b> is abreast, for example. The pressing plate <b>152</b> has the size suitable for the observation site <b>150</b>, and the surface area of the pressing face is larger than the case where the observation site <b>150</b> is pressed in the major axis and minor axis directions by only the probe <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">When no pressing plate is provided, there is a case where the ultrasonic wave irradiation direction of the probe <b>10</b> and the pressing direction are not coincident with each other. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>c</i>) shows the probe <b>10</b> under the state that no pressing plate is provided when the probe <b>10</b> is viewed in the minor axis direction. The width in the minor axis direction of the probe <b>10</b> is equal to about 1 cm, and the pressing face is not fixed, so that the ultrasonic wave irradiation direction <b>160</b> is fluctuated, so that the ultrasonic wave irradiation direction <b>160</b> and the pressing direction <b>162</b> are hardly coincident with each other. Therefore, according to this embodiment, by increasing the surface area of the pressing face as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>b</i>), the direction of pressing the subject <b>5</b> by the probe <b>10</b> is set to be vertical to the ultrasonic wave transmission/reception face <b>11</b>, and the subject <b>5</b> is pressed so that the ultrasonic wave scanning direction <b>160</b> and the pressing direction <b>162</b> are coincident with each other. Accordingly, the elastic image can be stably achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The probe may be configured to be equipped with the pressing plate of this embodiment as in the case of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">(Fourth Embodiment)</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">With respect to the pressing plate <b>152</b> of the third embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3(</figref><i>a</i>) (<i>b</i>), the pressing force is strong at the center portion <b>156</b>, however, the pressing force may be reduced at the edge portions <b>154</b>. Therefore, the elastic image of the depth region of the center portion <b>156</b> is clearly displayed, however, the elastic image of the depth region of each edge portion <b>154</b> may be disturbed.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Therefore, a fourth embodiment as an improvement of the third embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3(</figref><i>d</i>)(<i>e</i>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>d</i>) shows a pressing plate <b>158</b> for pressing the subject <b>5</b> and the probe <b>10</b> when they are viewed in the major axis direction. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>e</i>) shows the pressing plate <b>158</b> and the probe <b>10</b> when they are viewed in the minor axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The difference from the third embodiment resides in that the pressing plate <b>158</b> is designed in such a cup-shape as to be curved to the subject side in both the minor axis direction and the major axis direction and wrap the observation site <b>150</b>. By using this pressing plate <b>158</b>, the stress force is strong not only at the center portion <b>162</b>, but also at the edge portions <b>160</b>. This principle of pressing is identical to that of the first embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>), and the displacement vector faces the inside (that is, the center portion side of the probe <b>10</b>) in the region <b>160</b> of the edge portion, and faces the same direction as the pressing direction in the deep region. Furthermore, the region <b>162</b> of the center portion is pressed inwardly (that is, to the center portion side of the probe <b>10</b>) by the displacement vector <b>102</b> of the regions of the edge portions, and thus the stress loss is small, so that sufficiently large stress is applied even in the deep region. As a result, a proper elastic image can be achieved. The pressing plate <b>158</b> may be designed in a spherical shape, an ellipsoidal shape or a substantially conical shape so that the pressing plate <b>158</b> can be brought into close contact with the observation site of the subject <b>5</b> in connection with the shape of the body surface of the observation site of the subject <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As described above, the pressing direction is kept to be vertical to the surface with which the probe comes into contact, whereby the region of the elastic image displayed on the image display portion <b>24</b> can be broadened in the major axis direction or in the depth direction. Accordingly, the normally displayed elastic image is broadened, and thus the image diagnosis can be efficiently performed.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The probe may be configured to be equipped with the pressing plate of this embodiment in advance as in the case of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">(Fifth Embodiment)</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Next, a fifth embodiment according to the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4(</figref><i>a</i>) (<i>b</i>) shows a pressing plate <b>200</b> for pressing the subject <b>5</b> and the probe <b>10</b> when they are viewed in the major axis direction. An observation site <b>206</b> of the subject <b>5</b> corresponds to a part of the neck of the subject <b>5</b>, for example. The difference from the first to fourth embodiments resides in that a deformable member <b>208</b> formed of a material which efficiently propagates ultrasonic waves therethrough is inserted between the pressing plate <b>200</b> and the observation site <b>206</b> of the subject <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>) is a diagram for clarifying the effect of the present invention in this embodiment. When no deformable member <b>208</b> is provided as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>), a gap occurs between the observation site <b>206</b> of the subject <b>5</b> and the pressing plate <b>200</b>. Therefore, the region <b>204</b> of the center portion is normally pressed by the pressing plate <b>200</b>, however, a gap occurs in the region of each edge portion, so that the region of the edge portion is not pressed in close contact with the pressing plate <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>b</i>) shows the construction that the gap regions <b>202</b> are embedded with the deformable member <b>208</b>. The deformable member <b>208</b> is formed of a gel material or the like through which ultrasonic waves are passed, and it is secured to the surface of the pressing plate <b>200</b>. By using the deformable member <b>208</b>, the gap regions <b>202</b> occurring in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>) are embedded, and the pressing plate <b>200</b> is brought into close contact with the observation site <b>206</b> of the subject <b>5</b> through the deformable member <b>208</b>. Accordingly, the subject <b>5</b> can be uniformly pressed inwardly (that is, to the center portion side of the probe <b>10</b>) under the state that the pressing plate <b>200</b> is brought into close contact with the subject <b>5</b>. Therefore, as in the case of each of the above-described embodiments, the region of the elastic image <b>108</b> displayed on the image display portion <b>24</b> can be broadened in the depth direction. That is, even at a site which is more slender than the width of the major axis of the probe <b>5</b> like the observation site <b>206</b> of the subject <b>5</b>, the elastic image which is normally displayed at the deep portion can be broadened by using the deformable member, and thus the image diagnosis can be efficiently performed.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">An existing product formed of polymer gel for acoustic coupling &#x201c;Sonagel&#x201d; (produced by Takiron Co., Ltd.) or the like may be used as an example of the deformable member <b>208</b>. Furthermore, a bag filled with liquid may be used. Still furthermore, by fixing the deformable member as described above to the pressing plate, the pressing plate and the deformable member are constructed as one unit.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">(Sixth Embodiment)</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Next, a sixth embodiment according to the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a pressing plate <b>250</b> having a convex shape for pressing the body surface of the subject <b>5</b> and a convex type probe <b>11</b> when the pressing plate and the convex type probe are viewed in the major axis direction. The difference from the first to fifth embodiments resides in that a pressing plate <b>250</b> adapted to the convex type probe <b>11</b> as one type probe <b>10</b> is provided. The lower surface of the pressing plate <b>250</b> has a plane which is substantially coincident with the curvature of the ultrasonic wave transmission/reception face of the convex type probe <b>11</b>. For example, the pressing plate has a convex surface as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(D)</figref> (<i>d</i>), for example. That is, the lower surface of the pressing plate <b>250</b> as the contact surface with the subject <b>5</b> has the surface having substantially the same shape as the ultrasonic wave transmission/reception face of the convex type probe <b>11</b>, and it is designed in a convex shape so as to project to the subject <b>5</b> side. Accordingly, the convex type probe <b>11</b> and the lower surface of the pressing plate <b>250</b> are brought into close contact with the subject <b>5</b> to press the subject <b>5</b>, whereby the elastic image can be efficiently displayed by using even the convex type probe <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The probe may be configured to be equipped with the pressing plate of this embodiment in advance as in the case of the first embodiment.</p>

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Next, a seventh embodiment according to the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>a</i>) is a diagram showing the outlook of a transrectal ultrasonic probe. When the examiner grips a probe grip portion <b>302</b> and inserts a body insertion portion <b>300</b> into the rectum, the ultrasonic wave transmission/reception face comes into contact with the inner surface of the rectum of the subject <b>5</b>. A biplane type ultrasonic wave transmission/reception portion <b>304</b> and a ultrasonic wave transmission/reception portion <b>306</b> are disposed in the body insertion portion <b>300</b>, and a monochromatic tomogram and a color elastic image are generated on the basis of reflection echo signals received from the respective ultrasonic wave transmission/reception portions. A pressing mechanism as shown in Patent Document 2 is equipped in the probe, and a switch (not shown) as an interface for operating the pressing mechanism is provided to the probe grip portion <b>302</b>. The examiner may operate the switch by his/her finger with which the probe grip portion <b>302</b> is gripped, thereby controlling the pressing of the inner surface of the rectum.</p>

<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The bag <b>315</b> which is in contact with the rectum, the prostate <b>308</b> of the subject <b>5</b> is set to a state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>b</i>) when the bag <b>315</b> is expanded, and it can press the target over a broad area by the ultrasonic wave transmission/reception face, so that the pressing can be efficiently performed till the deep region. Furthermore, at any position of the ultrasonic wave transmission/reception face, the bag <b>315</b> is expanded in the vertical direction (the normal-line direction) to the face concerned. Therefore, the subject <b>5</b> can be uniformly pressed at any position in any direction, and thus the uniformity of the image quality can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">(Eighth Embodiment)</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Next, an eight embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>a</i>) shows the pressing plate for pressing the subject <b>5</b> and the probe <b>10</b> when they are viewed in the major axis direction. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>b</i>) shows the pressing plate and the probe <b>10</b> when they are viewed in the minor axis direction. The difference from each of the above-described embodiments resides in that the side surfaces of the probe <b>10</b> are provided with a structure that the edge portion of the pressing plate (the second member) is divided into plural parts and these parts can be opened/closed. That is, both the side surfaces in the minor axis direction of the probe <b>10</b> are provided with retractable pressing plate edge portions <b>51</b>-<i>a </i>and <b>51</b>-<i>b </i>respectively, and both the side surfaces in the major axis direction of the probe <b>10</b> are provided with retractable pressing plate edge portions <b>52</b>-<i>a </i>and <b>52</b>-<i>b</i>. The pressing plate edge portions <b>51</b>-<i>a </i>and <b>51</b>-<i>b </i>have the same-level width as the width in the minor direction of the probe <b>10</b>, and the pressing plate edge portions <b>52</b>-<i>a </i>and <b>52</b>-<i>b </i>have the same-level width as the width in the major axis direction of the probe <b>10</b>. The contact surface of the press plate edge portion with the subject may be designed in a flat shape or in a curved shape, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an example in which the contact surface concerned has a curved surface which is concaved to the subject <b>5</b> side. Furthermore, one end of each pressing plate edge portion is retractably connected to the side surface of the flat portion (first member) <b>50</b> through a hinge or the like. The flat portion <b>50</b> is formed so as to extend to the side surface in the neighborhood of the acoustic lens of the probe <b>10</b>, that is, the ultrasonic wave transmission/reception face <b>11</b>. The opening/closing of the edge portions of the pressing plate may be performed independently of one other or interlockingly with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">When the pressing plate is not being used, each edge portion of the pressing plate is kept folded toward the probe <b>10</b> side, and under this state the probe <b>10</b> is brought into contact with the subject <b>5</b> as in the case of the probe having no pressing plate. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7(</figref><i>c</i>) (<i>d</i>) shows the state that the pressing plate is being used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>c</i>) shows the pressing plate and the probe <b>10</b> under the state that the pressing plate edge portions are unfolded when they are viewed in the major axis direction. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>d</i>) shows the pressing plate and the probe <b>10</b> under the state that the pressing plate edge portions are unfolded when they are viewed in the minor axis direction. The edge portions <b>51</b>-<i>a</i>, <b>51</b>-<i>b</i>, <b>52</b>-<i>a</i>, <b>52</b>-<i>b </i>of the pressing plate are tilted at an angle of &#x3b8; from the side surface of the probe <b>10</b> to the subject <b>5</b> side, and form the whole of the pressing plate together with the flat portion <b>50</b>. This angle &#x3b8; is preferably variable in accordance with the curved surface shape of the body surface of the subject. For example, it can be implemented by a structure in which a proper angle is selected from preset angles of plural stages and fixed. Specifically, in the case of a linear probe <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the angle &#x3b8; is preferably set to 90 degrees or more because the tissue of the subject is pressed inwardly (that is, to the center portion side of the probe <b>10</b>). In the case of the convex type probe shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the angle &#x3b8; at which the pressing plate edge portion of the side surface of the probe in the minor axis direction is tilted is preferably set to be less than 90 degrees. Furthermore, it is preferable that the pressing plate edge portion of the side surface in the major axis direction of the convex type probe is divided to plural parts in the major axis direction, and these parts are tilted at 90 degrees or more from the side surface in the major axis direction of the probe and fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As described above, according to the pressing plate structure of this embodiment, a work of mounting the pressing plate separately can be omitted. By unfolding the pressing plate edge portions in the course of the image pickup operation of tomograms, elastic images of the same site can be sequentially picked up. Conversely, by folding the pressing plate edge portions in the course of the image pickup operation of elastic images, tomograms of the same site can be sequentially picked up. Therefore, the image diagnosis can be efficiently performed.</p>

<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Next, a ninth embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8(</figref><i>a</i>) (<i>b</i>) show the pressing plate <b>100</b> for pressing the subject <b>5</b> and the probe <b>10</b> when they are viewed in the major axis direction. The difference from each of the above-described embodiments resides in that the pressing plate is provided with a puncture guide portion having a guide hole which penetrates through the pressing plate to guide a puncture needle. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the same pressing plate <b>100</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) is used. However, the pressing plate of this embodiment is not limited to the pressing plate <b>100</b>, and the puncture guide portion may be provided to pressing plates having other shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>a</i>), the pressing plate <b>100</b> is equipped with a puncture guide portion <b>60</b> on the side surface side in the minor axis direction of the probe <b>10</b>. A guide hole <b>62</b> for guiding a puncture needle <b>61</b> is provided to the center portion of the puncture guide portion <b>60</b> so as to penetrate through the pressing plate, and the puncture needle <b>61</b> is inserted into the subject <b>5</b> by inserting the puncture needle <b>61</b> through the guide hole <b>62</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>b</i>) shows an example in which the puncture needle <b>61</b> is inserted into the guide hole <b>62</b> of the puncture guide portion <b>60</b> and the puncture needle <b>61</b> is inserted till a puncture site <b>63</b> of the subject <b>5</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows an example in which the puncture guide portion <b>60</b> is provided to one side surface in the minor axis direction of the probe <b>10</b>. However, the puncture guide portion <b>60</b> may be provided to the opposite side surface side in the minor axis direction, or to one side surface side in the major axis direction, or plural puncture guide portions <b>60</b> may be provided to plural places.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The puncture guide portion <b>60</b> may be disposed on the pressing plate <b>100</b> while it has a mechanism for varying the guide angle of the puncture needle <b>61</b> in accordance with the position of the puncture site <b>63</b> (for example, plural guide holes which are different in angle are provided as disclosed in Patent Document 3). When the puncture site <b>63</b> is located at a deep portion, the puncture needle <b>61</b> is fixed in proximity to the side surface in the minor axis direction of the probe <b>10</b> so that the guide angle is small with respect to the side surface in the minor axis direction of the probe <b>10</b>. Conversely, when the puncture site <b>63</b> is located at a shallow portion, the puncture needle <b>61</b> is fixed so as to be kept at a distance from the side surface in the minor axis direction of the probe <b>10</b> so that the guide angle is large with respect to the side surface in the minor axis direction of the probe <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The probe may be configured to be equipped with the pressing plate having the puncture guide portion of this embodiment in advance as in the case of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As described above, according to the pressing plate structure of this embodiment, the puncture can be performed while the pressing plate does not obstruct, and also the puncture can be performed while properly guided. Therefore, the image diagnosis and the remedy and tissue diagnosis based on puncture can be efficiently performed.

<p id="p-0106" num="0106">(Tenth Embodiment)</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0107">Next, a tenth embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the same transrectal ultrasonic probe as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>a</i>) shows the transrectal ultrasonic probe when it is viewed in the major axis direction thereof. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>b</i>) is a view taken from the tip of the body insertion portion <b>300</b> in the minor axis direction. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>c</i>) is a view taken in the major axis direction of the body insertion portion <b>300</b>. In the transrectal ultrasonic probe shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the ultrasonic wave transmission/reception face <b>315</b> is brought into contact with the inner surface of the rectum of the subject <b>5</b>, and the body insertion portion <b>300</b> has the ultrasonic wave transmission/reception face on which the biplane type ultrasonic transmission/reception portions <b>304</b> and <b>306</b> are disposed as in the case of the transrectal ultrasonic probe shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0108">The housing at the ultrasonic wave transmission/reception portion side of the body insertion portion <b>300</b> also functions as the first member of the pressing plate, and both the side surfaces of the body insertion portion <b>300</b> are provided with movable pressing plate edge portions (second members) <b>315</b>-<i>a </i>and <b>315</b>-<i>b</i>. One end of each pressing plate edge portion is movably connected to the side surface of the body insertion portion <b>300</b> through a hinge. The surfaces of the pressing plate edge portions <b>315</b><i>a </i>and <b>315</b>-<i>b </i>at the body insertion portion side are joined to bag portions <b>316</b>-<i>a </i>and <b>316</b>-<i>b</i>, respectively. The bag portion <b>316</b> is joined to the pressing plate edge portion <b>315</b> and the body insertion portion <b>300</b> and disposed therebetween. By injecting liquid or gas into the bag portion <b>316</b>, the pressing plate edge portions <b>315</b> are spread out and set to the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9(</figref><i>b</i>) (<i>c</i>). Furthermore, by exhausting liquid or gas from the bag portion <b>316</b>, the pressing plate edge portions <b>315</b> are folded and retracted to the position indicated by a dashed line shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9(</figref><i>b</i>) (<i>c</i>). The bag portion <b>316</b> is connected to a pump (not shown) disposed at the outside of the subject through a tube <b>312</b>, and the injection or exhaust of liquid or gas into or from the bag portion <b>316</b> is carried out by the pump.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0109">Before the body insertion portion <b>300</b> is inserted into the rectum of the subject <b>5</b>, each pressing plate edge portion <b>315</b> is folded, and the body insertion portion <b>300</b> is kept in a substantially cylindrical shape so as to be easily inserted. After the body insertion portion <b>300</b> is inserted into the rectum and the ultrasonic wave transmission/reception face comes into contact with the inner surface of the rectum, liquid or gas is injected into the bag portion <b>316</b> to spread out the pressing plate edge portions <b>315</b>. The spread-out pressing plate edge portions <b>315</b> expands the contact area with the inner surface of the rectum, and thus the inner surface of the rectum can be effectively pressed. After the image pickup operation, the liquid or gas is exhausted from the bag portion <b>316</b>, and thus the pressing plate edge portions <b>315</b> are folded and returned to the original positions. Under this state, the body insertion portion <b>300</b> is take out to the outside of the rectum.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0110">It may be possible that the pressing plate end portions <b>315</b> are not provided, and only the bag portion <b>316</b> is provided and expanded to form a broad-range contact surface, thereby pressing the inner surface of the rectum.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0111">As described above, according to the pressing plate structure of this embodiment, the transrectal ultrasonic probe is provided with the pressing plate edge portions, whereby the transrectal ultrasonic probe can be easily inserted and taken out and also the stress in the rectum can be efficiently performed. Accordingly, the image diagnosis of the rectum can be efficiently performed.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0112">The embodiments of the present invention have been described. However, the pressing plate, the ultrasonic probe and the ultrasonic diagnosing device of the present invention are not limited to the contents disclosed in the description of the embodiments, and other embodiments can be adopted within the subject matter of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0113">For example, in the description of each embodiment, with respect to the pressing to the subject <b>5</b>, an examiner may press the subject <b>5</b> while viewing elastic images displayed on the image display portion <b>24</b> and manually carrying out minute adjustment, or the probe <b>10</b> may be equipped with a pressing motor to automatically press the subject <b>5</b> by driving the motor as disclosed in Patent Document 2. When the pressing is carried out by driving the motor, the driving operation of the motor may be controlled in accordance with the type of the pressing plate.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0114">Furthermore, when a pressing plate having a sharp slope at the edge portion thereof is used, the probe <b>10</b> is greatly moved up and down so that the elastic image of the region of the deep portion is efficiently displayed, and when a relatively small pressing plate is used, the probe <b>10</b> is finely vibrated.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0115">Still furthermore, the mode in which the pressing plate is detachable from the probe <b>10</b> and the mode in which the probe and the pressing plate are formed integrally with each other are adopted in the description of the above-described embodiments. However, these modes may be reversed and applied.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0116">In the description of some embodiments, a hole is formed at apart(for example, the center portion) of the pressing plate so that the acoustic lens of the probe <b>10</b>, that is, the ultrasonic wave transmission/reception face <b>11</b> can be disposed in the pressing plate. However, it is unnecessary to provide a hole to the pressing plate insofar as the pressing plate is constructed by a member through which ultrasonic waves are transmitted.</p>
