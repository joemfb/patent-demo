<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Magnetic recording continues trend toward higher recording densities, with magnetic recording densities having already reached 500-600 Gb/in2 using traditional perpendicular magnetic recording technology. Energy assisted magnetic recording (EAMR) is used to further increase magnetic recording densities.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> respectively depict top and side views of a portion of a conventional energy assisted magnetic recording (EAMR) transducer <b>102</b>. For clarity, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> are not to scale. The illustrated EAMR transducer <b>102</b> may be used in writing a recording media (now shown) and typically receives light, or energy, from a conventional laser (not shown) when performing such write processes.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As shown, the EAMR transducer <b>102</b> includes a conventional waveguide <b>110</b> having cladding <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> and core <b>118</b>, a grating <b>106</b>, a near-field transducer (NFT) <b>104</b>, a coil <b>108</b>, and a pole <b>112</b>. Generally, light from a laser (not shown) is incident on the grating <b>106</b>, which couples the light to a waveguide <b>110</b>. Light is guided by the waveguide <b>110</b> to the NFT <b>104</b> near the air-bearing surface (ABS). The NFT <b>104</b>, in turn, focuses the light to a magnetic recording medium, such as a disk.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">During operation, light from the laser is received by the EAMR transducer <b>102</b> through the grating <b>106</b>, where the waveguide <b>110</b> directs light from the grating <b>106</b> to the NFT <b>104</b>. The NFT <b>104</b> focuses the light from the waveguide <b>110</b> and heats a small region of the magnetic recording medium. The EAMR transducer <b>102</b> magnetically writes data to the heated region of the recording media by energizing the pole <b>112</b> by way of the coil <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When conventionally fabricating a writer pole such as the pole <b>112</b>, the seed milling process involved during fabrication may be difficult to perform due to the writer pole being built on a bevel. An example of this is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which provides a tilted scanning electron microscope (Tilted-SEM) image <b>200</b> of an exemplary pole that is plated on a bevel <b>202</b> with height of 500 nm and an angle of 35 degrees. While seed material used during fabrication may be fully removed at the bottom <b>204</b> of the bevel <b>202</b>, full removal of seed material remaining on the slope <b>206</b> of the bevel <b>202</b> usually requires a seed milling process. Unfortunately, based on such factors as angle of control, mill power, and mill time, the seed milling process performed may result in adverse, over milling of the write pole.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Consider for example where a 30 nm seed layer is used in conventionally fabricating. A seed milling process having a mill time of 240 s at a mill power of 407 W (e.g., including 60 s 10 degree mill and 180 s 75 degree mill) is typically required for full removal of the 30 nm seed layer. While this amount of mill time and mill power would usually result in the removal the 30 nm seed layer, it would also result in a certain amount of over mill at the bottom of the pole. Though the resulting over mill would typically be tolerable for pole fabrication based on an Alumina platform, such results would be intolerable for pole fabrication based on a SiO<sub>2 </sub>platform. Based on SiO<sub>2</sub>'s mill rate, which is generally 2-3 faster than that of Alumina, a mill time of 240 s at a mill power of 407 W would likely cause undesirable over milling at bottom of the pole and may even lead to core damage (e.g., damage to the core <b>118</b>).</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth, such as examples of specific layer compositions and properties, to provide a thorough understanding of various embodiment of the present invention. It will be apparent however, to one skilled in the art that these specific details need not be employed to practice various embodiments of the present invention. In other instances, well known components or methods have not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring various embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The terms &#x201c;over,&#x201d; &#x201c;under,&#x201d; &#x201c;between,&#x201d; and &#x201c;on&#x201d; as used herein refer to a relative position of one media layer with respect to other layers. As such, for example, one layer disposed over or under another layer may be directly in contact with the other layer or may have one or more intervening layers. Moreover, one layer disposed between two layers may be directly in contact with the two layers or may have one or more intervening layers. In contrast, a first layer &#x201c;on&#x201d; a second layer is in contact with that second layer. Additionally, the relative position of one layer with respect to other layers is provided assuming operations are performed relative to a substrate without consideration of the absolute orientation of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Systems and methods for fabricating a microelectric device are provided herein. In particular, various embodiments provide systems and methods for fabricating a magnetic recording pole (also referred to as a &#x201c;write pole&#x201d; or &#x201c;writer pole&#x201d;) for a magnetic recording head, such as an energy assisted magnetic recording (EAMR) head commonly used in a disk storage device.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">For example, systems and methods may fabricate a magnetic recording pole plated on a thin seed layer of CoNiFe (e.g., 10 nm). Such a pole structure, having a thin seed layer, can reduce the seed mill time and better control the amount of over milling when fabricating a magnetic recording pole. This may be particularly useful for magnetic recording poles based SiO2, which tend to have a faster mill rate than Alumina.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to some embodiments, during fabrication of a magnetic recording pole, a wafer may be patterned to have different seed thickness over the field area and the device area (which comprises the pole location). For example, over the field area of the wafer, a seed layer having a thickness of approximately 40 nm may be utilized for plating purposes, while over the device area of the wafer, a seed layer having thickness of approximately 10 nm may be utilized for the writer pole. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> provides a microscope image <b>300</b> of an exemplary wafer, where the device area (designated as area &#x2018;a&#x2019;) has a seed thickness of 10 nm, while the field area (designated as area &#x2018;b&#x2019;) has a seed thickness of 40 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Subsequently, while the seed layer over the field area may be removed by wet etch, the seed layer over the device may be removed by milling. With use of a seed layer of 10 nm over the device area, the seed layer over the device area can be milled at a miller power of 100 W, with 125 s of mill time 10 degrees and 340 s of mill time at 75 degrees. Accordingly, various embodiments may permit for less mill time and/or mill power than used during conventional fabrication of magnetic recording pole. Additionally, the reduction in mill time and/or mill power for some embodiments may enable seed layer removal during fabrication of an EAMR SiO<sub>2</sub>-based device without damage to the core of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to one embodiment, a method is provided comprising: forming a layer of SiO2 over a substrate layer of a wafer; forming a first seed layer over the layer of SiO2; forming at least one magnetic pole layer over a portion of the first seed layer; and removing a remaining portion of the first seed layer not disposed under the at least one magnetic pole layer. For some embodiments, the substrate layer may comprise NiCr, and 2.3T CoNiFe. For some such embodiments, the NiCr may measure 2 nm or more in thickness, while the 2.3T CoNiFe may measure 10 nm or more in thickness. The resulting magnetic pole layer may comprise a layer of NiFe (e.g., 1.6T NiFe) disposed over a layer of CoNiFe (e.g., 2.3T CoNiFe).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">For some embodiments, the formation of the magnetic pole layer may comprise: (a) forming a second seed layer over the first seed layer, wherein the second seed layer comprises a trench exposing at least a portion of the first seed layer through the trench; (b) forming a first patterned resist layer in the trench over the first seed layer, wherein the first patterned resist layer is configured to define at least a portion of the at least one magnetic pole layer in the trench; (c) forming a patterned magnetic layer at least in the trench over the first seed layer such that the patterned magnetic layer is defined by the first patterned resist layer and the patterned magnetic layer is at least disposed in the trench over the first seed layer; (d) removing the patterned resist layer; and (e) removing a first portion of the patterned magnetic layer such that a second portion of the patterned magnetic layer remains disposed in the trench and over the first seed layer, whereby the second portion forms the at least one magnetic pole layer. Depending on the embodiment, the second seed layer may comprise CoNiFe (e.g., 2.3T CoNiFe) and may have a thickness of approximately 30 nm or more.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">For various embodiments, forming the second seed layer may comprise: (a) forming a second patterned resist layer over the first seed layer, wherein the second patterned resist layer is configured to define the second seed layer with the trench; (b) forming a patterned non-magnetic material layer over at least the first seed layer such that the patterned non-magnetic layer is defined by the second patterned resist layer; and (c) removing the second patterned resist layer such that the patterned non-magnetic layer remains disposed over the first seed layer, wherein the patterned non-magnetic layer that remains forms the second seed layer with the trench.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-11</figref> are diagrams illustrating exemplary structures form by a method for fabricating a magnetic recording pole in accordance with some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Starting with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the fabrication of a magnetic recording pole may begin with structure <b>400</b> that comprises a core <b>406</b>, a layer <b>404</b> of SiO<sub>2 </sub>disposed over the core <b>406</b>, and a first seed layer <b>402</b> disposed over the layer <b>404</b> of SiO<sub>2</sub>. For some embodiments, the core <b>406</b> may comprise a material known to be suitable in fabricating magnetic recording heads, such as TaO<sub>x</sub>. For instance, the core <b>406</b> may comprise a 120 nm layer of TaO<sub>x</sub>. The first seed layer <b>402</b> may comprise NiCr, CoNiFe or some other suitable seed material. For example, the first seed layer <b>402</b> may comprise 2 nm NiCr and 2.3T CoNiFe. Depending on the embodiment, the first seed layer <b>402</b> may measure approximately 10 nm or more in thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, structure <b>400</b> may subsequently processed to form structure <b>500</b>, which comprises a structure <b>506</b> similar to structure <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> (i.e., core <b>406</b>, a layer of SiO<sub>2 </sub>disposed over the core <b>406</b>, and a first seed layer <b>402</b> disposed over the layer of SiO<sub>2</sub>), a patterned photoresist layer <b>502</b> disposed over the structure <b>506</b>, and a second seed layer <b>504</b> disposed over the structure <b>506</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The patterned photoresist layer <b>502</b> may comprise material commonly used in forming patterned photoresist layers including, for example, Poly(methyl glutarimide) (PMGI). The formation of the patterned photoresist layer <b>502</b> may be in accordance with various methods of photolithography known in the art. Additionally, for some embodiments, the patterned photoresist layer <b>502</b> may be replaced by a similarly patterned resist layer formed using a non-photolithographic method known in the art. Similar to the first seed layer <b>402</b>, the second seed layer <b>504</b> may comprise CoNiFe and, in particular, may comprise 2.3T CoNiFe. Depending on the embodiment, the second seed layer <b>504</b> may measure approximately 30 nm or more in thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to some embodiments, the second seed layer <b>504</b> may be formed such that it is defined by (e.g., patterned according to) the patterned photoresist layer <b>502</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the patterned photoresist layer <b>502</b> may be used to define a trench in the second seed layer <b>504</b>. Subsequently, when the patterned photoresist layer <b>502</b> is removed from structure <b>500</b> (e.g., by an etch process), structure <b>600</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> may result, where structure <b>600</b> comprises the second seed layer <b>504</b> having a trench <b>602</b> exposing a portion <b>604</b> (e.g., an outward-facing surface) of the first seed layer <b>402</b> (which is disposed under the second seed layer <b>504</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, structure <b>600</b> may be further processed to form structure <b>700</b>, which comprises a structure <b>708</b> similar to structure <b>600</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, and a second patterned photoresist layer <b>702</b> disposed in the trench (e.g., trench <b>602</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) of the second seed layer <b>504</b> and over the portion (e.g., portion <b>604</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) of the first seed layer <b>402</b> exposed through the trench. According to some embodiments, the second patterned photoresist layer <b>702</b> may be configured to define the magnetic recording pole to be fabricated at location <b>704</b> (also commonly referred to as the &#x201c;device area&#x201d;). The area outside of the pole location <b>704</b> may be generally regarded as field area <b>706</b>. The second patterned photoresist layer <b>702</b>, like the patterned photoresist layer <b>502</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, may comprise material commonly used in forming patterned photoresist layers, such as Poly(methyl glutarimide) (PMGI).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Subsequently, the patterned photoresist layer <b>702</b> may be used in forming a patterned magnetic layer that comprises the magnetic recording pole. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, where structure <b>700</b> is further processed to form structure <b>800</b>. As depicted, structure <b>800</b> comprises a structure <b>804</b> similar to structure <b>700</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, and a patterned magnetic layer <b>702</b> formed over the second seed layer <b>504</b> in the field area <b>706</b> and over the first seed layer <b>402</b> at pole location <b>704</b>. In various embodiments, the patterned magnetic layer <b>702</b> may be a bi-layer EP2 plating, which possibly comprises a layer of 1.6T NiFe disposed over 2.3T CoNiFe.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Once the second patterned photoresist layer <b>702</b> is removed from structure <b>800</b> (e.g., by an etch process), the exposed portions of the first seed layer <b>402</b> (which are exposed by the photoresist removal) may be milled. In accordance with various embodiments, the presence of the first seed layer <b>402</b> in structure <b>800</b> may provide protection to the core <b>406</b> as the first seed layer <b>402</b> is milled. An example of this protection is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, which depicts an exemplary structure (structure <b>900</b>) formed from structure <b>800</b> after the removal of the second patterned photoresist layer <b>702</b> and the milling of the first seed layer <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, structure <b>900</b> comprises two trenches over <b>902</b> milled portions of the layer <b>906</b> of SiO<sub>2</sub>, and a milled first seed layer <b>904</b> having missing portions in comparison to the first seed layer <b>402</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-8</figref>. In accordance with some embodiments, the over milling of the first seed layer <b>402</b> of structure <b>800</b> may result in the milled portion of the layer <b>906</b> of SiO<sub>2</sub>. Structure <b>900</b> illustrates how despite the over milling of the first seed layer <b>404</b> in structure <b>800</b>, the presence of the first seed layer <b>402</b> results in only some of the layer <b>404</b> of SiO<sub>2 </sub>to be removed (rather than all layer <b>404</b> being removed), thereby keeping the core <b>406</b> protected from the mill process.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Next, structure <b>1000</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> may be formed from structure <b>900</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Specifically, structure <b>1000</b> may be formed by forming a third patterned photoresist layer <b>1006</b> that protects portions of the patterned magnetic layer <b>802</b> in structure <b>900</b> disposed in the trench (e.g., <b>602</b>) and portions of the milled first seed layer <b>904</b> in structure <b>900</b> at pole location <b>704</b>, and subsequently etching those portions of field area <b>706</b> of structure <b>900</b> not protected by the third patterned photoresist layer <b>1006</b>. In accordance with some embodiments, etching field area <b>706</b> of structure <b>900</b> in this manner may result in removal of portions of the patterned magnetic layer <b>802</b> in field area <b>706</b>, removal of the second seed layer <b>504</b> in the field area <b>706</b>, and removal of portions of the milled first seed layer <b>904</b> disposed in field area <b>706</b>. Additionally, in accordance with some embodiments, the removal of portions of the milled first seed layer <b>904</b> from structure <b>900</b> may result in some portions of the milled first seed layer <b>904</b> remaining in field area <b>706</b> (shown as etched first seed layer <b>1004</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). As noted herein, the third patterned photoresist layer <b>1006</b> utilized may comprise material commonly used in forming patterned photoresist layers, such as Poly(methyl glutarimide) (PMGI).</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Thereafter, structure <b>1100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> may be formed by removing the etched first seed layer <b>1004</b> and the third patterned photoresist layer <b>1006</b> from structure <b>1000</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.

In accordance with some embodiments, the removal of the etched first seed layer <b>1004</b> from structure <b>1000</b> may result in portions of the layer <b>906</b> of SiO<sub>2 </sub>also being removed, thereby resulting in the layer <b>1102</b> of SiO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a flowchart <b>1200</b> illustrating an exemplary method for fabricating a magnetic recording pole in accordance with some embodiments.
