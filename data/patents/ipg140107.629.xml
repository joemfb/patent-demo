<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is the U.S. national stage application which claims priority under 35U.S.C. &#xa7;371 to International Patent Application No.: PCT/AU2009/001336, filed on Oct. 9, 2009, which claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119, to Australian Patent Application No.: 2008905253, filed on Oct. 10, 2008, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein their entireties.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a stud frame and a formwork panel unit constructed from the stud frame.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Concrete buildings are commonly constructed by erecting formwork panels which are filled with concrete. A known system utilises pairs of fibre cement sheets spaced apart with stud frames. The panels are placed in position forming the walls and other components of the building and the space between the panels is then filled with concrete. The fibre panels remain in place and can be painted or otherwise finished once the joints between the panels have been flushed.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Given the increasing cost of resources, the ability to provide panels of this type which require lower volumes of steel without a reduction in overall strength, is of particular importance. Reducing the volume of steel members joining the pairs of fibre sheets also allows for better flow of concrete between the panels during construction.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention relates to the stud frames used to join the fibre cement sheets in order to provide such a reduction in steel volume.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a stud frame comprising:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0007">a first side member;</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0008">a second side member; and</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0009">a plurality of sets of interconnecting members extending from the first side member to the second side member such that when a first side panel is secured to the first side member and a second side panel is secured to the second side member the first and second side members lie in a plane perpendicular to the side panels;</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0010">wherein each set includes:
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0011">at least one interconnecting member having a second end connected to the second side member offset longitudinally from a first end thereof in a first direction;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0012">at least one interconnecting member having a second end connected to the second side member offset longitudinally from the first end thereof in a second opposite direction; and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0013">at least one interconnecting member extending from the first end thereof on one longitudinal side of the first side member to the second end thereof on an opposite longitudinal side of the second side member.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0014">Preferably there is provided a first interconnecting member having a second end connected to the second side member offset longitudinally from a first end thereof in a first direction, a second interconnecting member having a second end connected to the second side member offset longitudinally from the first end thereof in a second opposite direction and a third interconnecting member extending from the first end thereof on one longitudinal side of the first side member to the second end thereof on an opposite longitudinal side of the second side member.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0015">Preferably the first interconnecting member extends between first longitudinal sides of the first and second side members and the second interconnecting member extends between second longitudinal sides of the first and second side members.</p>

<p id="p-0011" num="0017">In one embodiment, the first and second ends of the third interconnecting member lie in the same transverse plane. The first and second ends of the third interconnecting member preferably lie in the same plane as the first end of the first interconnecting member.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0018">In a preferred embodiment, there is provided first and second sets of interconnecting members of alternating configuration wherein:</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0019">the first interconnecting member of the first set extends between first longitudinal sides of the first and second side members and the first interconnecting member of the second set extends between second longitudinal sides of the first and second side members;</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0020">the second interconnecting member of the first set extends between second longitudinal sides of the first and second side members and the second interconnecting member of the second set extends between first longitudinal sides of the first and second side members; and</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0045">Referring to the Figures there is shown a stud frame <b>10</b> for constructing a formwork panel unit <b>12</b>. The stud frame <b>10</b> comprises a first side member <b>14</b> connected to and spaced apart from a second side member <b>16</b> by a plurality of interconnecting members <b>18</b>. The first side member <b>14</b> and the second side member <b>16</b> are arranged parallel to each other. Each of the side members comprise an elongate planar member having transversely extending flanges <b>19</b> along longitudinal edges thereof. The flanges <b>19</b> of the first side member <b>14</b> are directed inwardly towards the second side member <b>16</b> and the flanges of the second side member <b>16</b> are directed inwardly towards the first side member <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0046">The formwork panel unit <b>12</b> is constructed by securing a first side panel <b>20</b> to the first side members <b>14</b> of a plurality of stud frames <b>10</b> and securing a second side panel <b>22</b> to the second side members <b>16</b> of said plurality of stud frames <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0047">The interconnecting members <b>18</b> are angled from the perpendicular to the side members <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> such that, when connected, a relatively rigid formation connecting between the first and second side members <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> results.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0048">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 6</figref>, the interconnecting members <b>18</b> are provided in sets along the length of the first side members <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> (as can be seen for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Each set comprises a first interconnecting member <b>34</b>, a second interconnecting member <b>36</b> and a third interconnecting member <b>38</b>. The interconnecting members <b>18</b> are provided as a wire formed from a suitable metal such as steel. The steel wires are secured to the first and second side members <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> by an appropriate means, such as welding.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0049">Each interconnecting member <b>18</b> includes a first end <b>40</b> extending from the first side member <b>14</b> and a second end <b>42</b> secured to the second side member <b>16</b>. The second end <b>42</b> of the first interconnecting member <b>34</b> is connected to the second side member <b>16</b> offset longitudinally from the first end <b>40</b> in a first direction. The second end <b>42</b> of the second interconnecting member <b>36</b> is offset longitudinally from the first end <b>40</b> in a second opposite direction. The first and second interconnecting members <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> are provided on opposite longitudinal sides of the side members <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>. That is, the first and second interconnecting members <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> are located on opposite sides of the side members <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> and angled in opposite directions to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0050">The third interconnecting member <b>38</b> extends from the first end <b>40</b> thereof on one longitudinal side of the first side member <b>14</b> to an opposite longitudinal side of the second side member <b>16</b>. That is, the third interconnecting member <b>38</b> extends transversely across the side members <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0051">In the embodiment shown, the first end <b>40</b> of the first interconnecting member <b>34</b> and the second end of the second interconnecting member <b>36</b> lie generally in the same transverse plane (that is, a plane being transverse to the longitudinal axes of the side members <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>). The second end <b>42</b> of the first interconnecting member <b>34</b> and the first end <b>40</b> of the second interconnecting member <b>36</b> also lie generally in the same transverse plane.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0052">Also, the first and second ends <b>42</b> of the third interconnecting member <b>38</b> lie in a single transverse plane, being the same transverse plane as the first end <b>40</b> of the first interconnecting member <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0053">The sets of interconnecting members <b>18</b> may be provided in alternating configurations. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a first set <b>44</b> and a second set <b>46</b>. In the first set, the first interconnecting member <b>34</b> extends between first longitudinal sides of the first and second side members <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> and the second interconnecting member <b>36</b> extends between second longitudinal sides of the first and second side members <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>. The third interconnecting member <b>38</b> extends from the second longitudinal side of the first side member <b>14</b> to the first longitudinal side of the second side member <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0054">In the second set <b>46</b>, the first interconnecting member <b>34</b> extends between second longitudinal sides of the first and second side member <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> and the second interconnecting member <b>36</b> extends between first longitudinal sides of the first and second side members <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>. The third interconnecting member <b>38</b> extends from the first longitudinal side of the first side member <b>14</b> to the second longitudinal side of the second side member <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0055">In use, one or more formwork panel units <b>12</b> are secured adjacent each other such that the first side panels <b>20</b> of each of the formwork panel units <b>12</b> abut to form a first side surface and the second side panels <b>22</b> of each of the formwork panel units <b>12</b> abut to form a second side surface. Concrete is then poured between the first and second side surfaces and allowed to set. The interconnecting members <b>18</b> form reinforcing in the set concrete. The use of interconnecting members in the form of wires has the advantage that the creation of air pockets during pouring is minimized allowing for even distribution of the concrete.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a support track <b>50</b> for use with the stud frame <b>10</b> of the present invention. The support frame <b>50</b> comprises a pair of elongate members <b>52</b> arranged parallel to each other and secured to a concrete slab <b>54</b>. The elongate members <b>52</b> comprise lengths of C-channel secured such that the distance between the outer edges of the C-channels is generally the distance between the first and second side panels <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>. The formwork panel units <b>12</b> can therefore be placed onto the support track <b>50</b> such that the support track <b>50</b> is received between the first and second side panels <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a pair of adjacent formwork panel units <b>12</b> each having a joiner member <b>56</b>.

<p id="p-0049" num="0058">The first joiner member <b>59</b> extends outwardly from the side member <b>14</b> or <b>16</b> generally parallel to the side member. The first joiner member <b>59</b> includes a turned up edge <b>60</b> that is connected to the flange <b>19</b> of the side member <b>14</b> by appropriate means, such as welding. The second joiner member <b>58</b> extends outwardly from the side member <b>14</b> or <b>16</b> generally parallel thereto and also includes an upturned edge secured to the flange <b>19</b> of the side member by welding. The first joiner member <b>59</b> extends beyond the edge of the side panel <b>20</b> and includes an upturned distal edge <b>61</b>. When the formwork panel units <b>12</b> are placed adjacent each other, the first joiner member <b>59</b> engages with the second joiner member <b>58</b>. The engagement of the joiner members <b>56</b> thereby seal across the join of adjacent side panels <b>20</b>.</p>
