<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method and apparatus is described to process an incoming telephone call. The method may comprise, at a recipient telephone system, receiving the incoming call including speech and identifying when a Do-Not-Disturb option is set. The Do-Not-Disturb option may identify that a user has requested not to receive telephone calls. Content analysis may be performed to identify content of the speech and a reference database may be interrogated based on the content to identify an associated rule. Thereafter, the Do-Not-Disturb option may be selectively overridden based on the associated rule. The content analysis may comprise performing speech recognition on the speech to obtain a reference word/phrase and interrogating the reference database with the word/phrase to identify the associated rule. A method of configuring a Do-Not-Disturb option in a telephone system is also described that allows a user to define reference words and associated rules.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application relates to a method and apparatus to process an incoming telephone call. In an example embodiment, the method and apparatus may process an incoming call based on whether or not a Do-Not-Disturb option is enabled in a telephone communication system.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A Do-Not-Disturb (DND) feature in a telephone system allows a user to divert all incoming calls to a voicemail box without ringing the user's telephone. This feature allows a user to avoid being disturbed by the telephone call. Typically, when a user enables DND functionality, incoming calls are routed by a separate Private Branch Exchange (PBX) system to a separate and independent voicemail system. The PBX and voicemail system reside on two separate servers.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an example embodiment, a method and system is described to process an incoming telephone call that is received via a communication network. In the following detailed description of example embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the example method, device and system may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of this description.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows architecture of a prior art system <b>100</b> to process incoming telephone calls. The system <b>100</b> is shown to include a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) phone <b>102</b>, a telephone <b>104</b> (which may be a cellular telephone, a wired or landline telephone, or the like), a computer <b>106</b> (e.g. a personal computer including a soft-phone, an email client, and/or Instant Message client), or any other devices <b>108</b> capable of establishing telephonic communications. The devices <b>102</b>-<b>108</b>, may communicate via one or more networks <b>110</b> with a Private Branch Exchange (PBX) <b>114</b> located at customer premises <b>112</b>. The PBX <b>114</b> is shown to service a plurality of telephone endpoints (telephones) <b>116</b>.<b>1</b>-<b>116</b>.<i>n </i>at the customer premises <b>112</b> where a separate and independent voicemail system <b>118</b> is also provided. In the prior art system <b>100</b>, when any user associated with a telephony endpoint <b>116</b>.<b>1</b>-<b>116</b>.<i>n </i>activates a Do-Not-Disturb (DND) feature <b>120</b>, incoming calls from the network <b>110</b> for that user are routed directly by the PBX to the voicemail system <b>118</b> (a voicemail box of the user). Thus, the Do-Not-Disturb feature <b>120</b> identifies when a user services by the PBX <b>114</b> has requested not to receive telephone calls.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Example Content Sensitive Do-Not-Disturb</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, reference <b>200</b> generally indicates a telephone call management device, in accordance with an example embodiment. The device <b>200</b> is shown to include a telephony interface <b>202</b> which interfaces the device <b>200</b> to a telephone network, for example the telephone network <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The telephone network may include a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) network, systems requiring traditional circuit transmissions of a Plain Old Telephone System (POTS), a Local Area Network (LAN) providing telephony communications, a Wide Area Network (WAN) providing telephony communications, or the like. The device <b>200</b> is also shown to include a Do-Not-Disturb identification module <b>204</b>, a voicemail module <b>206</b>, a call routing module <b>208</b> (e.g., providing PBX functionality), an analysis module in the example form of a speech recognition module <b>210</b>, an integration and control module <b>212</b>, and a reference database <b>214</b>. Further, in order to allow a user to configure reference words and rules, as described in more detail below, a configuration module <b>218</b> and a configuration interface <b>220</b> are provided. In an example embodiment the speech recognition module <b>210</b> may be an Adaptive Speech Recognition (ASR) and it will be appreciated that any of the modules of the device <b>200</b> may be implemented in hardware or software. However, it should be understood by inclusion that any reference to speech recognition is interchangeable with natural language recognition (or any other speech recognition technology) and the reference words (&#x201c;hot words&#x201d;) may constitute a phrase that is then recognized.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As described in more detail below, the interrogation and control module <b>212</b> may identify when a Do-Not-Disturb option is set on the device <b>200</b>. The Do-Not-Disturb option identifies that a user of a telephony endpoint serviced by the device <b>200</b> has requested not to receive telephone calls. The device <b>200</b> may then selectively override the Do-Not-Disturb option based on content of an incoming telephone call provided by a voice path <b>216</b>. In an example embodiment, the device <b>200</b> may programmatically override the Do-Not-Disturb option. It should also be noted that the device <b>200</b> may be deployed in devices such as a home telephone answering machine which may only provide a single (or a few) telephone endpoint as well as in any devices deployed in an office environment servicing multiple telephone endpoints.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a reference table <b>300</b> including a plurality of personal profiles <b>302</b>.<b>1</b>-<b>302</b>.<i>m </i>may be provided. Each personal profile <b>302</b>.<b>1</b>-<b>302</b>.<i>m </i>may include &#x201c;hot words&#x201d; or reference words <b>304</b>, and each reference word <b>304</b> may have an associated rule <b>306</b>. In use, as described in more detail below, the interrogation and control module <b>212</b> may extract or identify content of speech in the voice path <b>216</b> of an incoming call and identify an associated reference word <b>304</b> and its corresponding rule <b>306</b> may then be executed. Thus, the device <b>200</b> allows selective overriding of a Do-Not-Disturb option based on a reference word spoken by an incoming caller. As described in more detail below, a user associated with a personal profile <b>302</b>.<b>1</b>-<b>302</b>.<i>m </i>may define his/her own hot words and associated or corresponding rules. Further, it will be appreciated that the embodiments are not restricted to a single word. One or more words (e.g., forming phrase) may be recognized and be provided in the table <b>300</b>. Furthermore it should be recognized that the device <b>200</b> may contain global words and rules which apply to all users and that a system administrator may have the ability to modify the global words and phrases and/or the words and phrases associated with each user.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an integrated voicemail and PBX system <b>400</b>, in accordance with an example embodiment. The system <b>400</b> provides a single integrated unit including a PBX module <b>402</b> and a voicemail module <b>404</b>. Unlike the prior art system <b>100</b> where the PBX <b>114</b> and the voicemail system <b>118</b> are provided as two separate units in two separate boxes (e.g. on two separate servers), the system <b>400</b> is fully integrated within a single device or server. Accordingly, in use, calls received by the system <b>400</b> are not routed from a PBX to a separate voicemail system thereby preventing a call from being re-routed to a telephony endpoint <b>116</b>.<b>1</b>-<b>116</b>.<i>n </i>once a feature such as Do-Not-Disturb has been activated. Thus, in accordance with an example embodiment, the PBX and the voicemail components are fully integrated. This can be achieved either by systems/components which are co-located on the same server or via two servers attached to the same network <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Accordingly, in an example embodiment, an incoming call received by the system <b>400</b> may be recorded by the voicemail module <b>404</b> (e.g., when the Do-Not-Disturb option is active). However, as the PBX module <b>402</b> and the voicemail module <b>404</b> are tightly integrated, the call may then, while the voicemail module <b>404</b> is recording the incoming call, be routed or patched through to an associated telephony endpoint <b>116</b>.<b>1</b>-<b>116</b>.<i>n</i>. For example, the system <b>400</b> may include the device <b>200</b> which allows selective overriding of the Do-Not-Disturb option based on reference words (e.g., provided in the table <b>300</b>). When the system <b>400</b> includes the device <b>200</b>, the voicemail module <b>404</b> may correspond to the voicemail module <b>206</b> to provide a single integrated voicemail module. Thus, the system <b>400</b> may be interfaced to a regular telephony trunk as shown by arrow <b>406</b> and connected via a telephony network <b>408</b> (see arrow <b>410</b>) to the plurality of telephony endpoints <b>116</b>.<b>1</b>-<b>116</b>.<i>n. </i></p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, reference <b>500</b> generally indicates a method, in accordance with an example embodiment, of processing an incoming call in a telephony device. The method <b>500</b> may be performed on the device <b>200</b> and, accordingly, is described by way of example with reference to the device <b>200</b>. As shown at block <b>502</b>, an incoming call may be received (see voice path <b>216</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and a determination may then be made (see decision block <b>504</b>) if a Do-Not-Disturb option associated with the telephony endpoint to which the incoming call is bound is active. As shown at block <b>506</b>, if the Do-Not-Disturb function is not active, then the telephone call may be patched through to the associated telephone endpoint by a PBX (e.g. the PBX <b>402</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Thus, in an example embodiment, when the Do-Not-Disturb option is not active at a PBX, incoming calls may be handled or processed in a conventional fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">However, when the Do-Not-Disturb option is active, content analysis may be performed on speech of the incoming telephone call (see block <b>508</b>) while the message is being recorded by, for example, the voicemail module <b>404</b>. For example, as described in more detail below, speech recognition may be performed on speech of a person making the incoming call to obtain at least one reference word. In an example embodiment, adaptive speech recognition may be performed thus providing a textual input from an audio input. It is however to be appreciated that the analysis may instead be performed in the audio domain.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As shown at block <b>510</b>, the method <b>500</b> may interrogate a reference database (e.g. the reference database <b>214</b>) to identify a rule associated with the speech content. For example, when adaptive speech recognition is used to obtain a textual equivalent of the speech, reference words or hot words may be identified and the database <b>214</b> may be interrogated to identify whether or not the reference words are present in the relevant personal profile <b>302</b>.<b>1</b>-<b>302</b>.<i>m </i>(see table <b>300</b>). If a particular reference word is not found in the reference database <b>214</b>, the call may be processed in a conventional fashion where it is communicated to the voicemail module <b>404</b> to record a voicemail message (see block <b>516</b>). However, if the reference word (or a reference phrase) are identified in the personal profile <b>302</b>.<b>1</b>-<b>302</b>.<i>m</i>, an associated rule <b>306</b> may then be identified and any action associated with the rule may be performed. In an example embodiment, the reference words may be stored in an XML format in the database <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown at decision block <b>512</b>, if the associated rule stipulates that the Do-Not-Disturb option should be overridden, then the incoming call may be patched through to the associated telephone endpoint as shown at block <b>514</b>. If, for example, a user at the telephone endpoint is currently busy with another telephone call, the method <b>500</b> may communicate an indication to the user that another call is pending. For example, the method <b>500</b> may provide an audio communication to the user at a reduced volume level that is lower than the volume level of the voice communication of the other telephone call to inform the user of the incoming call. Thus, the method <b>500</b> may provide a &#x201c;whisper&#x201d; mode whereby the user at the telephony endpoint is advised of a new incoming call. Examples of other rules may include but is not limited to transferring the caller to the called destination, transferring the caller to another extension which is best suited to handle the case, or invoke phone screening feature to facilitate potential manual cancellation of the DND feature.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Returning to decision block <b>512</b>, if, however, the rule stipulates that the Do-Not-Disturb option should not be overridden then the method <b>500</b> may perform an action associated with the rule. For example, the rule may stipulate or specify that the incoming call should continue to be processed by a voicemail system such as the voicemail module <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">It will be appreciated that the selective overriding of the Do-Not-Disturb option may be performed at multiple levels. For example, specific reference words within the incoming telephone call may correspond to or be associated with different rules. For example, assuming the device <b>200</b> is deployed in a medical doctor environment, any caller using the word &#x201c;heart attack&#x201d; may result in the method <b>500</b> overriding the Do-Not-Disturb option irrespective of who the caller is. However, in an example embodiment, the reference words may identify the caller (e.g., be a caller's name) and, thus, when a call is received from a particular caller identified in the reference database <b>214</b>, the Do-Not-Disturb option may be selectively overridden. Thus, a user may define when the Do-Not-Disturb option is overridden based on an identity of the caller and/or the actual content of the speech.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Reference <b>600</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) generally indicates a method, in accordance with an example embodiment, for processing an incoming telephone call. As shown at block <b>602</b>, an incoming call may be received and the call may be patched through to a voicemail system when a Do-Not-Disturb option is active (see block <b>604</b>). In addition to communicating the incoming voice call to the voicemail system, the incoming call may be patched through (e.g. using a conference in feature) to a speech recognition module (e.g. the speech recognition module <b>210</b>) as shown at block <b>606</b>. Thus, in an example embodiment, the method may be deployed in legacy systems (e.g., the system <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) using existing conference functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Thereafter, as shown at block <b>608</b>, speech recognition (e.g. adaptive speech recognition) may be performed to identify reference words or phrases in the incoming speech. The reference words or phrases may identify a caller and/or a content of a message communicated by the caller. Once the reference words have been identified, as described hereinbefore, the method <b>600</b> may interrogate a reference database with the reference words (see block <b>610</b>). Thereafter a rule is identified that is associated with the reference words as shown at block <b>612</b>. As shown at block <b>614</b>, the Do-Not-Disturb option may be overridden. In an example embodiment, the method <b>600</b> may be deployed in a conventional or prior art PBX system connected to a conventional voicemail system.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In an example embodiment, the telephony interface <b>202</b> may communicate the incoming call (e.g. which may be communicated using Real Time Transport Protocol (RTP Control Protocol or RTCP)) to the speech recognition module <b>210</b>. Prior to performing speech recognition, the actual call content (e.g. the actual voice or speech message communicated by the sender) may then be extracted from the total incoming call. Thus, in an embodiment, incoming audio or speech content (in digital or analog form) may be processed or transformed into a textual equivalent of the speech. It is however to be appreciated that the embodiments are not limited to algorithms that convert the reference words into text. In certain embodiments, the device <b>200</b> may work directly from audio words or phrases without the conversion to text. Thus, identification of one or more reference words (e.g., forming a phrase) may be performed in the audio domain where a voice message/speech is analyzed to identify one or more reference words. Based on processing in the audio domain, the Do-Not-Disturb option may be overridden.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an example embodiment, the speech recognition may be language sensitive or provide a facility to define more than one language associated with the reference words. For example, the speech recognition module <b>210</b> may identify a source of an incoming telephone call and associate a particular language with the source of the incoming call. For example, if it is determined from caller identification information that the incoming message is a voice message from a person in France, then a French language profile, including French reference words, may be retrieved from the database <b>214</b>. In an example embodiment, a user may be prompted to identify which particular language they are communicating the message in.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, reference <b>700</b> generally indicates a method, in accordance with an example embodiment, to configure a Do-Not-Disturb option in a telephone device. For example, the method <b>700</b> may be used to define the reference words or keywords and the associated actions in the table <b>300</b> of the device <b>200</b>. It will, however, be appreciated that a single predefined single reference rule or action may be provided which merely overrides the Do-Not-Disturb option. However, in addition to or instead of overriding the Do-Not-Disturb option, other actions may be defined. For example, the method <b>700</b> may be deployed in the device <b>200</b> which may include the configuration module <b>218</b> and the configuration interface <b>220</b>. For example, as shown at block <b>702</b>, the user may dial in or call the device <b>200</b> and identify that the user wishes to configure his/her personal profile (e.g. personal profiles <b>302</b>.<b>1</b>-<b>302</b>.<i>m</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The method <b>700</b> may then identify the user (as shown at block <b>704</b>) and receive at least one reference word from the user as shown at block <b>706</b>. Thereafter, optionally, speech recognition may be performed to obtain a text equivalent of the referenced audio words received in speech from the user (see block <b>708</b>). Optionally, the user may then define at least one associated action or rule that is associated with the reference word or words. For example, the action may be a call forwarding action, a Do-Not-Disturb override action, a voice mail action, or the like (see block <b>710</b>). Once the reference word or words and the associated action have been identified, they may be stored in the corresponding user's personal profile (see table <b>300</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and block <b>712</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">It will be appreciated that multiple modalities may be provided to allow the user to configure his/her personal profile. For example, the configuration interface <b>220</b> may include a web interface that allows the user to communicate with the device <b>200</b> via the Internet. A web-based Graphical User Interface may thus be provided where the user may then, after entering a username and a password, configure the particular reference word or words which are then stored in the reference database <b>214</b>. In an example embodiment, the configuration interface <b>220</b> may include an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system which provides the user with a series of prompts to enable the user to define reference words or hot words as well as associated actions/rules such as overriding the Do-Not-Disturb option. In an example embodiment, a user may be presented with a Telephony User Interface (TUI) menu. For example the menu may prompt a user: &#x201c;To listen to your voicemail messages please press 1; to set your personal preferences, please press 2; etc. . . . .&#x201d; The user may then select the personal preferences option and be presented with a relevant menu. For example, the user may be prompted: &#x201c;To change your outgoing message please press 1; to set your &#x201c;hot words&#x201d; please press 2; etc. . . . . &#x201d; If the user chooses the &#x201c;hot words&#x201d; option, he/she may record a sequence of &#x201c;hot words&#x201d; which are automatically stored in his or her personal profile and associated with his or her mailbox.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring for example to the system <b>400</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), when including the device <b>200</b>, the speech recognition module <b>210</b> allows a user to utilizes natural language capabilities to instruct the system <b>400</b> via a spoken sentence. For example after authentication the user may hear a short prompt: &#x201c;Please specify your command&#x201d;. In response the user may say &#x201c;Please configure my three &#x201c;hot words&#x201d; to be &#x201c;Jones&#x201d;, &#x201c;Heart&#x201d;, and &#x201c;status&#x201d;. The system <b>400</b> may then play back to the caller a confirmation message: &#x201c;You have asked to configure three &#x201c;hot words&#x201d;: &#x201c;Jones&#x201d;, &#x201c;Heart&#x201d;, and &#x201c;status&#x201d;. If this is correct please acknowledge or say modify.&#x201d; Once the user acknowledges that the system <b>400</b> has properly recorded the three &#x201c;hot words&#x201d;, the &#x201c;hot words&#x201d; may be stored in the user's personal profile (e.g., see table <b>300</b>) and associated with his/her mailbox. As mentioned above, the system <b>400</b> may provide the user with the ability to program rules for the reference words. For example, the user may mark as urgent any call from Joe's phone that includes the words &#x201c;Dinner&#x201d; and &#x201c;at&#x201d;, or messages that include &#x201c;blood test results&#x201d; regardless of the who the caller is.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">If the caller utters any of the reference words, the interrogation and control module <b>212</b> may notify the PBX module <b>402</b>, which may then temporarily disable the Do-Not-Disturb option, and the voice PBX module <b>402</b> may call the original called party. The call would then ring at the associated telephony endpoint device and, if user answers the call, the caller may be transferred and connected to the original called party. However, if the call is not answered by the user, then the caller may continue with the voice message. Although the various modules are shown as separate blocks it is to be understood that one or more of the modules may be combined or integrated. For example, the interrogation and control module <b>212</b>, the speech recognition module <b>210</b>, and the configuration module <b>218</b> may form part of the voicemail module <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In example embodiment, the system <b>400</b> may call the user at a per-configured alternative telephone number (e.g., home telephone number or cellular telephone number) and, when the user answers the call, the voicemail module <b>404</b> may complete the transfer of the incoming call. In this example embodiment PBX module <b>402</b> does not need to temporarily disable the DND mode.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Thus, example embodiments may allow alerting and receiving of calls by a user in Do-Not-Disturb mode based on the use of pre-configured reference word or words or &#x201c;hot words&#x201d; identified in speech of a caller while leaving a voice message. The user may, for example, create rules based on a combination of the reference words and the identity of the caller.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a diagrammatic representation of machine in the example form of a computer system <b>800</b> within which a set of instructions, for causing the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed herein, may be executed. In alternative embodiments, the machine operates as a standalone device or may be connected (e.g., networked) to other machines. In a networked deployment, the machine may operate in the capacity of a server or a client machine in server-client network environment, or as a peer machine in a peer-to-peer (or distributed) network environment.
