<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an electronic oil pump and a method of controlling an engine to which lubricant is supplied by the oil pump.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Snowmobiles conventionally have a lubrication system that uses an oil pump that is mechanically driven by an engine of the snowmobile. This type of oil pump is generally referred to as a mechanical oil pump.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">When the engine operates on a four-stroke principle, the lubricant is stored in an oil tank that is usually connected or integrated to the engine, such as an oil pan. The mechanical oil pump pumps the lubricant from the oil tank to make it circulate through the engine. After circulating through the engine, the lubricant is returned to the oil tank.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When the engine operates on a two-stroke principle, the lubricant is stored in an oil tank that is usually spaced apart from the engine. The mechanical oil pump pumps the lubricant from the oil tank to the crankcase of the engine. From the crankcase, the lubricant flows to the cylinders where it is combusted with a mixture of fuel and air. Since the lubricant is combusted by the engine, the oil tank occasionally needs to be refilled with lubricant for the engine to operate properly.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">By having the mechanical oil pump driven by the engine, the amount of lubricant being pumped is directly proportional to the speed of the engine. Therefore, the faster the engine turns, the more lubricant is being pumped by the mechanical oil pump, and the relationship between engine speed and the amount of lubricant being pumped is a linear one. However, the actual lubricant requirements of an engine, especially in the case of an engine operating on a two-stroke principle, are not linearly proportional to the engine speed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Some mechanical oil pumps driven by the engine are also linked to the throttle lever that is operated by the driver of the vehicle, such that the position of the throttle lever adjusts the output of the mechanical oil pump. Although this provides for an improved supply of lubricant to the engine, it does not account for other factors which affect the actual lubricant requirements of the engine such as ambient air temperature and altitude.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For a two-stroke engine, the actual lubricant requirement depends, at least in part, on the power output of the engine, not only engine speed. The higher the power output, the more lubricant is required. There are instances during the operation of the two-stroke engine where the engine speed is high, but where the power output of the engine is low. In such instances, the mechanical oil pump driven by the engine provides a lot of lubricant even though the actual requirements are low. One such instance is when the track of the snowmobile is slipping on a patch of ice. In this instance the engine speed is high due to the slippage, but the actual power output is low. There are other instances where the actual lubricant requirements are lower than what would be provided by a mechanical oil pump driven by the engine. For example, at start-up, all of the lubricant that was present in the engine when it was stopped has accumulated at the bottom of the crankcase. The accumulated lubricant would be sufficient to lubricate the engine for the first few minutes of operation, however the mechanical oil pump, due to its connection to the engine, adds lubricant regardless. Therefore, in the case of an engine operating on the two-stoke principle, using a mechanical oil pump results in more lubricant being consumed by the engine than is actually required. This also results in a level of exhaust emissions that is higher than a level of exhaust emissions that would result from supplying the engine with its actual lubricant requirements since more lubricant gets combusted than is necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The actual lubricant requirements of an engine for a snowmobile are also a function of one or more of the altitude at which the snowmobile is operating, the engine temperature, and the position of the throttle lever, to name a few. Since snowmobiles are often operated in mountainous regions and that temperatures can vary greatly during the winter, the actual lubricant requirements of the engine can be significantly affected by these factors and therefore need to be taken into account. Conventional snowmobile lubrication systems using mechanical oil pumps, due to the linear relationship between the engine speed and the amount of lubricant being pumped, cannot take these into account.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the prior art, mechanisms were provided on some snowmobiles which would modify the amount of lubricant provided by the oil pump per engine rotation. These mechanisms provided two (normal/high, or normal/low) or three (normal/high/low) oil pump settings. Although these settings provided some adjustment in the amount of lubricant being provided to the engine by the oil pump, since the pump is still mechanically connected to the engine, the relationship is still a linear one, and thus does not address all of the inconveniences described above. The settings simply provide consistently more or less lubricant, as the case may be, than at the normal settings.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, there is a need for an oil pump that can provide an engine, such as the engine of a snowmobile, with an amount of lubricant that is at or near the actual lubricant requirements of the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">There is also a need for an oil pump that can supply lubricant to an engine, such as the engine of a snowmobile, non-linearly with respect to the engine speed and other factors.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Finally, since snowmobiles are used during the winter, the low ambient temperature causes the lubricant to be very viscous when the engine is first started and becomes less viscous as the engine warms up (thereby warming the lubricant), thus affecting the efficiency with which the lubricant can be pumped. Therefore, when the lubricant has a high viscosity, the oil pump may be unable to supply the amount of lubricant necessary for the proper operation of the engine under certain conditions. Also, different lubricants, at the same temperature, have different viscosities. Therefore, similar issues may be associated with lubricants having a normally high viscosity.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Therefore, there is also a need for an oil pump that can take into account varying lubricant viscosities and a method of use thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is an object of the present invention to ameliorate at least some of the inconveniences present in the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is also an object of the present invention to provide an electronic oil pump that can provide a feedback signal representative of lubricant viscosity.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The feedback signal corresponds to a stroke time of the electronic oil pump. A longer stroke time is representative of a higher oil viscosity.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is another object to provide a method of controlling an engine to which lubricant is supplied by the electronic oil pump. By being able to determine a viscosity of the lubricant from the stroke time of the oil pump, an electronic control unit (ECU) associated with the engine limits the maximum engine speed of the engine to a level at which lubricant can be sufficiently provided by the oil pump. More specifically, from the stroke time, the ECU can determine the cycle time of the pump (stroke time plus return time) and therefore the maximum frequency of operation of the oil pump. The ECU can then limit the maximum speed of the engine such that it is at or below an engine speed for which this maximum frequency of operation of the oil pump can supply a sufficient amount of lubricant.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one aspect, the invention provides an electronic oil pump adapted to be controlled by an electronic control unit (ECU).

The piston carrier moves with the at least one piston between the full stroke position and the fully retracted position. A stopper is disposed in the body. The stopper is made of electrically conductive material. The piston carrier contacts the stopper when the at least one piston is in the full stroke position. A housing houses the actuator. The housing is made of electrically conductive material. The first element is the stopper and the second element is the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an additional aspect, at least one fastener fastens the housing to the body. The at least one fastener is made of electrically conductive material. The second lead is electrically connected to the at least one fastener.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a further aspect, the body is made of electrically insulating material.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an additional aspect, a pole is disposed between the actuator and the piston carrier. The pole is made of electrically conductive material. The piston carrier contacts the pole when the at least one piston is in the fully retracted position. A third electrical lead is electrically connected to the piston carrier for electrically connecting the piston carrier to the ECU. When the at least one piston is in the fully retracted position, an electrical path between the second and third electrical leads is closed. When the at least one piston is in a position other than the fully retracted position, the electrical path between the second and third electrical leads is opened.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a further aspect, a spring is disposed between the piston carrier and the stopper. The spring biases the piston carrier toward the fully retracted position. A cap is disposed on an end of the spring between the spring and the stopper. The cap is made of electrically insulating material. The cap provides electrical insulation between the stopper and the spring.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an additional aspect, the cap is a first cap, and the actuator includes a plunger engaging the piston carrier. The oil pump also has a third electrical lead electrically connected to the piston carrier for electrically connecting the piston carrier to the ECU, and a second cap disposed on an end of the plunger between the plunger and the piston carrier. The second cap being made of electrically insulating material. The second cap providing electrical insulation between the piston carrier and the actuator. When the at least one piston is in the fully retracted position, an electrical path between the second and third electrical leads is closed. When the at least one piston is in a position other than the fully retracted position, the electrical path between the second and third electrical leads is opened.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a further aspect, a third electrical lead is connected to a third element of the pump for electrically connecting the third element to the ECU. When the at least one piston is in the fully retracted position, an electrical path between the second and third electrical leads is closed. When the at least one piston is in a position other than the fully retracted position, the electrical path between the second and third electrical leads is opened.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an additional aspect, the at least one outlet includes a first pair of outlets.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In a further aspect, the at least one outlet further includes a second pair of outlets.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an additional aspect, the actuator includes an electromagnetic coil.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In another aspect, the invention provides a method of controlling an engine having an electronic oil pump supplying lubricant thereto. The electronic oil pump includes an actuator operatively connected to at least one piston. The method comprises: causing the actuator to move the at least one piston toward a full stroke position; sending a signal to an electronic control unit (ECU) when the at least one piston reaches the full stroke position; determining a time taken to reach the full stroke position based on the signal; estimating a time for returning the at least one piston to a fully retracted position based on the time taken to reach the full stroke position; determining a cycle time of the pump based the time taken to reach the full stroke position and the estimated time for returning the at least one piston to the fully retracted position; returning the at least one piston to the fully retracted position; and limiting a maximum allowable engine speed based at least in part on the cycle time.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a further aspect, the actuator includes an electromagnetic coil. Causing the actuator to move the at least one piston toward a full stroke position includes applying a current to the electromagnetic coil. Returning the at least one piston to the fully retracted position includes stopping to apply the current to the electromagnetic coil.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an additional aspect, the method further comprises applying the current to the electromagnetic coil for longer than is necessary to move the at least one piston toward the full stroke position.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a further aspect, the method further comprises operating the engine in a fault mode if the signal is not received by the ECU within a predetermined amount of time.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In yet another aspect, the invention provides another method of controlling an engine having an electronic oil pump supplying lubricant thereto.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The present invention will be described in combination with a snowmobile. However it is contemplated that at least some aspects of the present invention could be used in other applications.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a snowmobile <b>10</b> including a forward end <b>12</b> and a rearward end <b>14</b> which are defined consistently with a travel direction of the snowmobile <b>10</b>. The snowmobile <b>10</b> includes a frame <b>16</b> which includes a tunnel <b>18</b> and an engine compartment <b>20</b>. A front suspension <b>22</b> is connected to the frame. The tunnel <b>18</b> generally consists of one or more pieces of sheet metal bent to form an inverted U-shape. The tunnel <b>18</b> extends rearwardly along the longitudinal centerline <b>61</b> of the snowmobile <b>10</b> and is connected at the front to the engine compartment <b>20</b>. An engine <b>24</b>, which is schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is carried by the engine compartment <b>20</b> of the frame <b>16</b>. A steering assembly (not indicated) is provided, in which two skis <b>26</b> are positioned at the forward end <b>12</b> of the snowmobile <b>10</b> and are attached to the front suspension <b>22</b> through a pair of front suspension assemblies <b>28</b>. Each front suspension assembly <b>28</b> includes a ski leg <b>30</b>, a pair of A-arms <b>32</b> and a shock absorber <b>29</b> for operatively connecting the respective skis <b>26</b> to a steering column <b>34</b>. Other types of front suspension assemblies <b>28</b> are contemplated, such as a swing-arm or a telescopic suspension. A steering device such as a handlebar <b>36</b>, positioned forward of a rider, is attached to the upper end of the steering column <b>34</b> to allow the rider to rotate the ski legs <b>30</b> and thus the skis <b>26</b>, in order to steer the snowmobile <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">An endless drive track <b>65</b> is positioned at the rear end <b>14</b> of the snowmobile <b>10</b>. The endless drive track <b>65</b> is disposed generally under the tunnel <b>18</b>, and is operatively connected to the engine <b>24</b>. The endless drive track <b>65</b> is driven to run about a rear suspension assembly <b>42</b> for propelling the snowmobile <b>10</b>. The rear suspension assembly <b>42</b> includes a pair of slide rails <b>44</b> in sliding contact with the endless drive track <b>65</b>. The rear suspension assembly <b>42</b> also includes one or more shock absorbers <b>46</b> which may further include a coil spring (not shown) surrounding the individual shock absorbers <b>46</b>. Suspension arms <b>48</b> and <b>50</b> are provided to attach the slide rails <b>44</b> to the frame <b>16</b>. One or more idler wheels <b>52</b> are also provided in the rear suspension assembly <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">At the front end <b>12</b> of the snowmobile <b>10</b>, fairings <b>54</b> enclose the engine <b>24</b>, thereby providing an external shell that not only protects the engine <b>24</b>, but can also be decorated to make the snowmobile <b>10</b> more aesthetically pleasing. Typically, the fairings <b>54</b> include a hood (not indicated) and one or more side panels which can be opened to allow access to the engine <b>24</b> when this is required, for example, for inspection or maintenance of the engine <b>24</b>. In the particular snowmobile <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the side panels can be opened along a vertical axis to swing away from the snowmobile <b>10</b>. A windshield <b>56</b> is connected to the fairings <b>54</b> near the front end <b>12</b> of the snowmobile <b>10</b>. Alternatively the windshield <b>56</b> can be connected directly to the handlebar <b>36</b>. The windshield <b>56</b> acts as a wind screen to lessen the force of the air on the rider while the snowmobile <b>10</b> is moving.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A straddle-type seat <b>58</b> is positioned atop the frame <b>16</b>. A rear portion of the seat <b>58</b> may include a storage compartment or can be used to accommodate a passenger seat (not indicated). Two footrests <b>60</b> are positioned on opposite sides of the snowmobile <b>10</b> below the seat <b>58</b> to accommodate the driver's feet.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the lubrication system of the snowmobile <b>10</b> includes an oil tank <b>70</b> and an electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A. The oil tank <b>70</b> is disposed in the engine compartment <b>20</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and is shaped so as to fit between the various other components located in the engine compartment <b>20</b>. The oil tank <b>70</b> is preferably fixed to the frame <b>18</b> and is preferably positioned slightly behind the engine <b>24</b>. Since the oil tank <b>70</b> is not directly connected to the engine <b>24</b>, the oil tank <b>70</b> is partially isolated from the vibration generated by the engine <b>24</b>. The oil tank <b>70</b> is preferably made of plastic. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a portion <b>74</b> of the oil tank <b>70</b> is translucent to permit visible inspection as to the level of lubricant in the oil tank <b>70</b>. Level markers <b>76</b> provide a visual indication as to the relative level of lubricant in the tank <b>70</b>. A cap <b>78</b> is provided to open or close an oil filling opening (not shown) on the oil tank <b>70</b>. A hose <b>80</b> extends from an upper portion of the oil tank <b>70</b> to a component of the engine <b>24</b>, such as a water pump (not shown), to provide lubricant thereto. When the oil tank <b>70</b> is filled up above the level of the upper end of the hose <b>80</b>, the hose <b>80</b> is filled with lubricant. The lubricant present in the hose <b>80</b> is then gradually fed by gravity to the component to which the hose <b>80</b> is connected. The volume of lubricant in the hose <b>80</b> is preferably sufficient to provide lubricant to the component until the oil tank <b>70</b> is once again filled up above the level of the upper end of the hose <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As can also be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A is disposed externally of the oil tank <b>70</b>. An inlet <b>82</b> of the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A is connected directly to a bottom of the oil tank <b>70</b> on a side of the oil tank <b>70</b> opposite the side of the oil filling opening. The inlet <b>82</b> is preferably connected to the lowest point of the oil tank <b>70</b>. The electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A has four outlets <b>84</b>, <b>86</b>. The two outlets <b>84</b> are connected to hoses <b>88</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the hoses <b>88</b> are connected to the two exhaust valves <b>90</b> of the engine <b>24</b> (one exhaust valve <b>90</b> per cylinder <b>92</b>.) to supply lubricant thereto. One possible construction of the exhaust valves <b>90</b> is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,244,227, issued Jun. 12, 2001, incorporated herein by reference. It should be understood that other constructions of the exhaust valves <b>90</b> are contemplated which would not deviate from the present invention. The two outlets <b>86</b> are connected to hoses <b>94</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the hoses <b>94</b> are connected to the crankcase <b>96</b> of the engine <b>24</b>. Each hose <b>94</b> fluidly communicates with a crank chamber (not shown) inside the crankcase <b>96</b> (one crank chamber per cylinder <b>92</b>) to supply lubricant to the crankshaft bearings (not shown) and the other components located therein. It should be understood that should the engine <b>24</b> have more or less cylinders <b>92</b>, that the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A would have a number of outlets <b>84</b> and <b>86</b> that correspond to the number of cylinders. For example, should the engine <b>24</b> have three cylinders <b>92</b>, then the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A would have three outlets <b>84</b> and three outlets <b>86</b>. It is also contemplated that two electronic oil pumps <b>72</b>A could be used should the number of outlets become too great for a single electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A. It is also contemplated that the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A could provide lubricant only to the cylinders <b>92</b> (via the crankcase <b>96</b>) and that the exhaust valves <b>90</b> would be lubricated in some other way. In this case, an electronic oil pump <b>72</b>C having only two outlets <b>86</b> (for an engine <b>24</b> having two cylinders <b>92</b>) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> would be used. It is also contemplated that the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A could provide lubricant to other components and parts of the engine <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, a cooling system, an exhaust system, and a positioning of the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A relative to these systems will be described. The cooling system has a coolant tank (not shown) that supplies coolant to the remainder of the system via pipe <b>98</b>. Coolant can also flow back to the coolant tank via the pipe <b>98</b> when the coolant expands in the cooling system as the temperature of the coolant increase. Similarly, gas bubbles in the coolant system can flow to the coolant tank via pipe <b>98</b>. Coolant in the system flows in coolant hose <b>100</b> to T-connector <b>102</b>, and from T-connector <b>102</b> to coolant hose <b>104</b>. From coolant hose <b>104</b>, coolant enters coolant passages (not shown) inside the engine <b>24</b> thereby absorbing heat from the engine <b>24</b>. The coolant then exits the engine <b>24</b> via coolant hose <b>106</b>. From coolant hose <b>106</b>, the coolant enters a thermostat <b>108</b>. When the temperature of the coolant is below a predetermined temperature, the thermostat directs the coolant back to coolant hose <b>100</b>, and from there the coolant is re-circulated through the engine <b>24</b> as described above. When the temperature of the coolant is above the predetermined temperature, the thermostat <b>108</b> prevents the coolant from entering coolant hose <b>100</b> and redirects the coolant to coolant hose <b>110</b>. It is contemplated that the thermostat <b>108</b> could redirect only a portion of the coolant to coolant hose <b>110</b> and let a remainder of the coolant flow to coolant hose <b>100</b>. From coolant hose <b>110</b>, the coolant flows to a first heat exchanger <b>112</b> to be cooled. The first heat exchanger <b>112</b> forms the upper central part of the tunnel <b>18</b>. From the first heat exchanger <b>112</b>, the coolant flows to coolant hose <b>114</b>. From coolant hose <b>114</b>, the coolant flows to a second heat exchanger <b>116</b> (the majority of which is hidden by engine <b>24</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) located in the rear portion of the engine compartment <b>20</b> to be further cooled. It is contemplated that the first and second heat exchangers <b>112</b>, <b>116</b> cooled be located elsewhere on the snowmobile <b>10</b> and that only one of the first and second heat exchangers <b>112</b>, <b>116</b> could be used. From the second heat exchanger <b>116</b>, coolant flows to coolant hose <b>118</b>. From coolant hose <b>118</b>, coolant flows to T-connector <b>102</b>, to coolant hose <b>104</b>, to the engine <b>24</b> to coolant hose <b>106</b> and back to thermostat <b>108</b> as described previously. The thermostat <b>108</b> causes the coolant to flow through the first and second heat exchangers <b>112</b>, <b>116</b> until the temperature of the coolant is once again below the predetermined temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The exhaust system receives exhaust gases from the exhaust ports <b>120</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) of the engine <b>24</b>. The exhaust valves <b>90</b> regulate the flow of the exhaust gases through the exhaust ports <b>120</b>. An exhaust manifold (not shown) is connected to the exhaust ports <b>120</b>. The exhaust gases flow from the exhaust ports, through the exhaust manifold to a muffler <b>122</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). From the muffler <b>122</b> the exhaust gases flow through an exhaust pipe (not shown) to the atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A is disposed in proximity to heat generating components of the snowmobile <b>10</b>. These heat generating components include coolant hoses <b>110</b> and <b>114</b>, heat exchanger <b>116</b>, muffler <b>122</b>, and engine <b>24</b>. The coolant hoses <b>110</b> and <b>114</b>, and heat exchanger <b>116</b> generate heat due to the hot coolant flowing through them. The muffler <b>122</b> generates heat due to the hot exhaust gases flowing through it. The engine <b>24</b> generates heat due to the combustion events taking place inside the cylinders <b>92</b>. The electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A is located proximate enough to these heat generating components that the heat generated by them, when the snowmobile <b>10</b> is in operation, heats up the lubricant contained in the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A. Therefore, by being heated, the lubricant maintains a viscosity level that allows it to be easily pumped by the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A. It is contemplated that locating the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A in proximity to at least one of these heat generating components could be sufficient to maintain the viscosity level of the lubricant in the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, details of the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A will be described. The electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A is what is know as a reciprocating solenoid pump. The electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A has a body <b>124</b> having the inlet <b>82</b> and the outlets <b>84</b>, <b>86</b> integrally formed, over-molded, or press fit therewith. The body <b>124</b> is preferably made of plastic or other electrically insulating material. It is contemplated that the body could be made of an electrically conductive material covered with an electrically insulating material. Alternatively, the body could be made of an electrically conductive material and be provided with a sleeve therein made of electrically insulating material. As can be seen, the outlets <b>86</b> are larger than the outlets <b>84</b>. This is because more lubricant needs to be supplied to the cylinders <b>92</b> by the outlets <b>86</b> than needs to be supplied to the exhaust valves <b>90</b> by the outlets <b>84</b>. Two O-rings <b>126</b> are provided around the inlet <b>82</b> to prevent lubricant present in the oil tank <b>70</b> to seal the connection between the inlet <b>82</b> and the oil tank <b>70</b>. A filter <b>128</b> is disposed in the inlet <b>82</b> to prevent debris from entering the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A. A stopper <b>130</b> is inserted in the body <b>124</b> centrally of the outlets <b>84</b>, <b>86</b>. A first electrical lead <b>131</b> electrically connects the stopper <b>130</b> to the ECU <b>160</b>. It should be understood that the first electrical lead <b>131</b> may not connect the stopper <b>130</b> directly to the ECU <b>160</b>. An O-ring <b>132</b> disposed around the stopper <b>130</b> seals the connection between the stopper <b>130</b> and the body <b>124</b>. Check valves <b>134</b> are disposed in the passage of the outlets <b>84</b> to prevent lubricant from entering the body <b>124</b> via the outlets <b>84</b>. Similarly, check valves <b>136</b> are disposed in the passage of the outlets <b>86</b> to prevent lubricant from entering the body <b>124</b> via the outlets <b>86</b>. The check valves <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> are sized according to the size of their corresponding outlets <b>84</b>, <b>86</b>. A piston carrier <b>138</b> has four pistons <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> thereon. As can be seen the pistons <b>142</b> are larger than the pistons <b>140</b>. The pistons <b>142</b> are used to pump lubricant through the larger outlets <b>86</b>, and the pistons <b>140</b> are used to pump lubricant through the smaller outlets <b>84</b>. A spring <b>144</b> is disposed between the piston carrier <b>138</b> and the stopper <b>130</b>. A cap <b>145</b>, made of plastic or other electrically insulating material, is disposed at the end of the spring <b>144</b>, between the spring <b>144</b> and the stopper <b>130</b>. The piston carrier <b>138</b> is connected to a plunger <b>149</b> of an armature <b>150</b>. The plunger <b>149</b> extends through a pole <b>146</b>. An O-ring <b>148</b> is provided around the pole <b>146</b> to prevent lubricant present in the body <b>124</b> from leaking into the section of the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A that is opposite the side of the pole <b>146</b> where the piston carrier <b>138</b> is connected (i.e. to the left of the pole <b>146</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>). The armature <b>150</b> is made of magnetizable material such as iron. The armature <b>150</b> is slidably disposed inside a sleeve <b>152</b>. The sleeve <b>152</b> is disposed in the center of a coil bobbin <b>154</b> and is press-fitted over the pole <b>146</b>. The coil bobbin <b>154</b> has a coil <b>156</b> wound around it. The ends of the coil <b>156</b> are connected to connector <b>158</b> which is used to connect the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A to the electronic control unit (ECU) <b>160</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The coil bobbin <b>154</b> is disposed inside a solenoid housing <b>162</b>. The solenoid housing <b>162</b> is made of electrically conductive material. A washer <b>164</b> is disposed between the coil bobbin <b>154</b> and the end of the solenoid housing <b>162</b>. A spring <b>166</b> is disposed between the armature <b>150</b> and the sleeve <b>152</b>. Three threaded fasteners <b>168</b> are used to fastened the solenoid housing <b>162</b> to the body <b>124</b>. When the solenoid housing <b>162</b> is fastened to the body <b>124</b>, all of the components shown therebetween in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, except connector <b>158</b>, are housed inside the volume created by the solenoid housing <b>162</b> and the body <b>124</b>. A second electrical lead <b>169</b> electrically connects one of the fasteners <b>168</b> to the ECU <b>160</b>. It should be understood that the second electrical lead <b>169</b> may not connect the one of the fasteners <b>168</b> directly to the ECU <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A operates as follows. Lubricant enters the body <b>124</b> via inlet <b>82</b>. Current is applied to the coil <b>156</b> via the ECU <b>160</b>, as will be described in greater detail below. The current applied to the coil <b>156</b> generates a magnetic field. The armature <b>150</b> slides towards the body <b>124</b> (to the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>) under the effect of the magnetic field. The piston carrier <b>138</b> and the pistons <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> move together with the armature <b>150</b>. This movement of the armature also causes spring <b>144</b> to be compressed between the piston carrier <b>138</b> and the cap <b>145</b> and stopper <b>130</b>. The movement of the pistons <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> towards the body <b>124</b> compresses the lubricant contained in the body <b>124</b> and causes the lubricant to be expelled from the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A through the outlets <b>84</b>, <b>86</b>, via the check valves <b>134</b>, <b>136</b>. When the portion of the piston carrier <b>138</b> which houses the spring <b>144</b> makes contact with the stopper <b>130</b>, an electrical path is created between the leads <b>131</b> and <b>169</b>, thus closing the circuit formed by the leads <b>131</b> and <b>169</b>, the pump <b>72</b>A and the ECU <b>160</b>. This signals the ECU <b>160</b> that the pump <b>72</b>A has reached its full stroke position. Thus, the ECU <b>160</b> can determine the time it takes to reach the full stroke position by calculating the time elapsed between the time when current is applied to the coil <b>156</b> to the time when the electrical path between the leads <b>131</b> and <b>169</b> is closed. When the piston carrier <b>138</b> reaches this position, the lubricant has been expelled from the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A. The ECU <b>160</b> then stops applying current to the coil <b>156</b> which then no longer creates a magnetic field. Since the armature no longer applies a force to compress the spring <b>144</b>, the spring <b>144</b> expands, thereby returning the pistons <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>, the piston carrier <b>138</b>, and the armature <b>150</b> to their initial positions (towards the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>) and opening the electrical path between the leads <b>131</b> and <b>169</b>. The cap <b>145</b> provides electrical insulation between the stopper <b>130</b> and the spring <b>144</b>, thereby preventing electrical connection between the leads <b>131</b> and <b>169</b> when the pump <b>72</b>A is not in its full stroke position. The spring <b>166</b> prevents the armature <b>150</b> from hitting the end of the sleeve <b>152</b>, which would generate noise and potentially damage the armature <b>150</b>, and counteracts the force of the spring <b>144</b> to place the armature <b>150</b> in the correct initial position. By returning to their initial positions, the pistons <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> create a suction inside the body <b>124</b>. The suction <b>124</b>, along with gravity, causes more lubricant to flow inside the body <b>124</b> via the inlet <b>82</b>. The check valves <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> prevent the lubricant that was expelled from the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A from re-entering the body via outlets <b>84</b>, <b>86</b>. Once the armature <b>150</b> returns to its initial position, the ECU <b>160</b> applies current to the coil <b>156</b> and the cycle is repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">It is contemplated that other types of electronic oil pumps could be used. For example, the armature <b>150</b> of the reciprocating electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A described above could be replaced with a permanent magnet. In this embodiment, applying current in a first direction to the coil <b>156</b> causes movement of the permanent magnet, and therefore of the pistons <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>, in a first direction, and applying current in a second direction to the coil <b>156</b> causes movement of the permanent magnet in a second direction opposite the first one. Therefore, by being able to control the movement of the permanent magnet in both direction, this type of pump provides additional control over the reciprocating motion of the pump when compared to the solenoid pump <b>72</b>A described above.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the pump <b>72</b>A, pump <b>72</b>B. The pump <b>72</b>B has all of the elements of the pump <b>72</b>A with the addition of a cap <b>151</b> and a third lead <b>139</b>. The third lead <b>139</b> electrically connects the piston carrier <b>138</b> to the ECU <b>160</b>. It should be understood that the third electrical lead <b>139</b> may not connect the piston carrier <b>138</b> directly to the ECU <b>160</b>. The cap <b>151</b>, which is made of plastic or other electrically insulating material, is disposed at the end of the plunger <b>149</b>, between the plunger <b>149</b> and the piston carrier <b>138</b>. When the piston carrier <b>138</b> makes contact with the pole <b>146</b>, an electrical path is created between the leads <b>139</b> and <b>169</b>, thus closing the circuit formed by the leads <b>139</b> and <b>169</b>, the pump <b>72</b>A and the ECU <b>160</b>. This signals the ECU <b>160</b> that the pump <b>72</b>B has reached its fully retracted position. The cap <b>151</b> provides electrical insulation between the piston carrier <b>138</b> and the plunger <b>149</b>, thereby preventing electrical connection between the leads <b>139</b> and <b>169</b> when the pump <b>72</b>B is not in its fully retracted position. Thus, the ECU <b>160</b> can determine the time it takes to reach a full stroke by calculating the time elapsed between the time when the electrical path between the leads <b>139</b> and <b>169</b> is opened to the time when the electrical path between the leads <b>131</b> and <b>169</b> is closed. Similarly, the ECU <b>160</b> can determine the time it takes to reach the fully retracted position by calculating the time elapsed between the time when the electrical path between the leads <b>131</b> and <b>169</b> is opened to the time when the electrical path between the leads <b>139</b> and <b>169</b> is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As described above, the ECU <b>160</b> is electrically connected to the connector <b>158</b> of the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A to supply current to the coil <b>156</b> and the ECU <b>160</b> also receives a feedback from the oil pump <b>72</b>A via leads <b>131</b> and <b>169</b>. The ECU <b>160</b> is connected to a power source <b>161</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) and, based on inputs from one or more of the various sensors described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, regulates when current from the power source <b>161</b> needs to be applied to the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A such that the proper amount of lubricant is supplied to the cylinders <b>92</b> of the engine <b>94</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, an engine speed sensor (RPM sensor) <b>170</b> is connected to the engine <b>24</b> and is electrically connected to the ECU <b>160</b> to provide a signal indicative of engine speed to the ECU <b>160</b>. The engine <b>24</b> has a toothed wheel (not shown) disposed on and rotating with a shaft of the engine <b>24</b>, such as the crankshaft (not shown) or output shaft (not shown). The engine speed sensor <b>170</b> is located in proximity to the toothed wheel (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> for example) and sends a signal to the ECU <b>160</b> each time a tooth passes in front it. The ECU <b>160</b> then determines the engine rotation speed by calculating the time elapsed between each signal. An air temperature sensor (ATS) <b>172</b> is disposed in an air intake system of the engine <b>24</b>, preferably in an air box (not shown), and is electrically connected to the ECU <b>160</b> to provide a signal indicative of the ambient air temperature to the ECU <b>160</b>. A throttle position sensor (TPS) <b>174</b> is disposed adjacent a throttle body or carburetor (not shown), as the case may be, of the engine <b>24</b> and is electrically connected to the ECU <b>160</b> to provide a signal indicative of the position of the throttle plate inside the throttle body or carburetor to the ECU <b>160</b>. An air pressure sensor (APS) <b>176</b> is disposed in an air intake system of the engine <b>24</b>, preferably in an air box (not shown), and is electrically connected to the ECU <b>160</b> to provide a signal indicative of the ambient air pressure to the ECU <b>160</b>. A coolant temperature sensor (CTS) <b>178</b> is disposed in the cooling system of the engine <b>24</b>, preferably in one of coolant hoses <b>100</b>, <b>104</b>, or <b>106</b>, and is electrically connected to the ECU <b>160</b> to provide a signal indicative of the temperature of the coolant to the ECU <b>160</b>. It is contemplated that the CTS <b>178</b> could be integrated to the thermostat <b>108</b>. A counter <b>180</b> is electrically connected to the ECU <b>160</b>. The counter <b>180</b> can be in the form of a timer and provide a signal indicative of time to the ECU <b>160</b>. The counter <b>180</b> could also count the number of times the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A has been actuated. The counter <b>180</b> could also be linked to the engine <b>24</b> to provide a signal indicative of the number of rotations of a shaft of the engine <b>24</b> to the ECU <b>160</b>. It is contemplated that the RPM sensor <b>170</b> could integrate the function of the counter <b>180</b> to provide a signal indicative of the number of rotations of a shaft of the engine <b>24</b> to the ECU <b>160</b> in addition to the signal indicative of engine speed. It is also contemplated that there could be two (or more) counters <b>180</b>, one acting as a timer, and the other counting the number of rotations of the engine <b>24</b> or the number of times the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A has been actuated.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A has an inherent time delay that is determined by an elapsed time from the time an electric current is received by the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A from the ECU <b>160</b> to the time that lubricant is actually initially expelled from the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A. Due to manufacturing tolerances, this time delay varies from one electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A to the other. Therefore, the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A has a specific time delay <b>182</b> associated therewith. The time delay <b>182</b> is stored on a computer readable storage medium, such as a bar code or a RFID tag, associated with the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A. The time delay <b>182</b> is provided to the ECU <b>160</b> and is taken into account when regulating the application of current to the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A such that the actual operation of the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A corresponds to the desired operation of the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A as calculated by the ECU <b>160</b>. An example as to how this is achieved for fuel injectors, and which could be adapted for use on electronic oil pumps, is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,164,984, issued Jan. 16, 2007, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. In oil pump <b>72</b>B, this time delay does not need to be provided since the time at which lubricant is actually initially expelled from the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>B corresponds to when the electrical path between the leads <b>139</b> and <b>169</b> is opened.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Due to manufacturing tolerances, the amount of lubricant being expelled per stroke by the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A varies from one electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A to the other. Therefore, the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A has a specific pump output <b>183</b> associated therewith that corresponds to the actual amount of lubricant being expelled per stroke by the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A. The pump output <b>183</b> is stored on a computer readable storage medium, such as a bar code or a RFID tag, associated with the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A. The computer readable storage medium could be the same as the one used for the time delay <b>182</b> or could be a different one. The pump output <b>183</b> is provided to the ECU <b>160</b> and is taken into account when regulating the application of current to the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A such that the actual operation of the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A corresponds to the desired operation of the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A as calculated by the ECU <b>160</b>. It is contemplated that only one of the time delay <b>182</b> and the pump output <b>183</b> may be provided for the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a method of controlling the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A will be described. A method of operating the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>B is the same as the method of operating the electronic oil pump <b>72</b>A, unless specifically explained otherwise below.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The method is initiated at step <b>200</b>, once the key (not shown) is inserted in the snowmobile <b>10</b> or once the engine <b>24</b> is started. In the present method, a boolean variable called &#x201c;Cold Limit&#x201d; is used to indicate whether the lubricant being used by the pump <b>72</b>A has a viscosity which is higher than expected during normal operation of the snowmobile <b>10</b>. A &#x201c;Cold Limit&#x201d; which is set to &#x201c;true&#x201d; indicates such a higher viscosity. A &#x201c;Cold Limit&#x201d; which is &#x201c;false&#x201d; indicates that the lubricant has a viscosity within a range which is expected during normal operation of the snowmobile. As previously explained, a low lubricant temperature would result in a high viscosity of the lubricant (herein the name &#x201c;Cold Limit&#x201d;). Although the name of the boolean variable &#x201c;Cold Limit&#x201d; suggests a relationship with temperature, it should be understood that using a lubricant which has a high viscosity, even at normal operating temperatures of lubricant in a snowmobile <b>10</b>, could also result in the boolean variable &#x201c;Cold Limit&#x201d; being set to &#x201c;true&#x201d; during the present method. At step <b>202</b>, the boolean variable &#x201c;Cold Limit&#x201d; is set to false since no data is available at this point to determine otherwise. Then at step <b>204</b>, the ECU limits the maximum engine speed to a value of A RPM, which corresponds to an engine speed limit during normal operation of the snowmobile <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">At step <b>206</b>, the ECU <b>160</b> then applies current to the coil <b>156</b> of the oil pump <b>72</b>A. Then at step <b>208</b>, the ECU <b>160</b> determines if a signal which indicates that the circuit including the leads <b>131</b> and <b>169</b> is closed is received within a predetermined time limit t<b>1</b>. As previously described, this signal is indicative that the that the pump <b>72</b>A has reached its full stroke position. If the signal is not received within t<b>1</b>, then at step <b>210</b> the ECU <b>160</b> stops applying current to the coil <b>156</b> of the oil pump <b>72</b>A to return the oil pump <b>72</b>A to its fully retracted position. Since not receiving a signal within t<b>1</b> at step <b>208</b> indicates that the oil pump <b>72</b><i>a </i>is unable to reach its full stroke position, and therefore unable to efficiently pump lubricant, at step <b>212</b> the ECU <b>160</b> enters a fault operation mode. The problem could be that one of the components of the pump <b>72</b>A is faulty or that the lubricant inside the oil pump <b>72</b>A is too viscous for the oil pump <b>72</b>A to pump the lubricant. The fault operation mode limits the performance of the engine <b>24</b> so as to prevent damaging the engine <b>24</b>. It is contemplated that the ECU <b>160</b> could also enter a fault mode if a signal which indicates that the circuit including the leads <b>131</b> and <b>169</b> is closed is received in less than another predetermined time limit, which would indicate that there is no lubricant present in the oil pump <b>72</b>A. If at step <b>208</b>, a signal is received within the time t<b>1</b>, then the ECU <b>160</b> continues to step <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">At step <b>214</b>, the ECU <b>214</b> determines the estimated cycle time (ECT). The estimated cycle time corresponds to the sum of the time it took the pump <b>72</b>A to reach its full stroke position (full stroke time, FST) and of the estimated time it will take the pump <b>72</b>A to reach it fully retracted position (estimated return time, ERT). The full stroke time is determined from the time it took to receive the signal from the circuit including the leads <b>131</b> and <b>169</b> that the circuit is closed as described above. The estimated return time is determined from various experimentally determined maps stored in the ECU <b>160</b> or other electronic storage devices accessible by the ECU <b>160</b>. The maps provide estimated return times for various full stroke times. Should the full stroke time not correspond to a value in the maps, the ECU <b>160</b> can interpolate the estimated return time from two known values in the maps. As previously described, a long full stroke time is indicative of a high lubricant viscosity. A high lubricant viscosity, as should be understood, makes it more difficult for the pump <b>72</b>A to suck lubricant back inside the pump <b>72</b>A. Therefore, the longer the full stroke time is, the longer the estimated return is. In a method using the oil pump <b>72</b>B, the estimated return time only needs to be determined in this manner (i.e. using maps) the first time step <b>214</b> is performed. When the step <b>214</b> is subsequently performed, the estimated return time used is the time elapsed between the circuit including the leads <b>131</b> and <b>169</b> becoming opened and the circuit including the leads <b>139</b> and <b>169</b> becoming closed. As should be understood, the estimated cycle time determined at step <b>214</b> determines the maximum frequency at which the pump <b>72</b>A can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">From step <b>214</b>, the ECU <b>160</b> continues to step <b>216</b> and determines if the &#x201c;Cold Limit&#x201d; variable has a value of &#x201c;true&#x201d;. The first time step <b>216</b> is performed, the value of the &#x201c;Cold Limit&#x201d; variable is &#x201c;false&#x201d; and the method continues to step <b>222</b> where the ECU <b>160</b> stops applying current to the coil <b>156</b> of the oil pump <b>72</b>A to return the oil pump <b>72</b>A to its fully retracted position. When step <b>216</b> is subsequently performed, if the value of the &#x201c;Cold Limit&#x201d; variable is &#x201c;true&#x201d; as a result of step <b>230</b> described below, then the ECU <b>160</b> continues to step <b>218</b>. As previously described, when the &#x201c;Cold Limit&#x201d; variable is &#x201c;true&#x201d;, it is as a result of the lubricant having a high viscosity, which can be caused by the lubricant being at a low temperature. As should be understood, the viscosity of the lubricant can therefore be reduced by heating the lubricant. As described in more detail in PCT application no. PCT/US2008/055477, published as WO 2009/002572 A1 on Dec. 31, 2008, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference, by continuing to apply current to the coil <b>156</b> after the pump <b>72</b>A has reached its full stroke position, the coil <b>156</b> generates heat which can help reduce the viscosity of the lubricant. At step <b>218</b>, the ECU <b>160</b> determines a maximum amount of time (power-on time, POT) for which the current can be applied to the coil <b>156</b> of the pump <b>72</b>A before having to return the oil pump <b>72</b>A to its fully retracted position in order to initiate the next pumping cycle. The power-on time corresponds to the difference between the calculated cycle time (CCT) and the estimated cycle time (ECT) determined at step <b>214</b>. The calculated cycle time is the cycle time at which the pump <b>72</b>A needs to be operated in order to supply the amount of lubricant required by the engine <b>24</b> at the current operating conditions. The ECU <b>160</b> uses the signals received from at least some of the sensors described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, including the engine speed sensor <b>170</b>, to calculate the calculated cycle time. International publication WO 2009/002572 A1 describes some methods in which the cycle time can be calculated by the ECU <b>160</b>, but other methods are contemplated. Generally, the faster the engine speed is, the shorter the calculated cycle time will be, however the relationship between the engine speed and the calculated cycle time does not need to be a linear one. From step <b>218</b>, the ECU <b>160</b> continues to step <b>220</b> where it determines if the amount of time elapsed since the current has been applied to the coil <b>156</b> of the pump <b>72</b>A (time t<b>2</b>) is greater than or equal to the power-on time. If it is not, then the ECU <b>160</b> will continue to loop back to step <b>220</b> until that is the case. Once the time t<b>2</b> is greater than or equal to the power-on time, the ECU <b>160</b> continues to step <b>222</b> where the ECU <b>160</b> stops applying current to the coil <b>156</b> of the oil pump <b>72</b>A to return the oil pump <b>72</b>A to its fully retracted position.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">From step <b>222</b>, the ECU <b>160</b> continues to step <b>224</b>. At step <b>224</b> the ECU <b>160</b> determines if the amount of time elapsed since step <b>222</b> (time t<b>3</b>) is greater than the estimated return time determined at step <b>214</b>. As should be understood, the time t<b>3</b> also corresponds to the amount of time elapsed since the circuit including the leads <b>131</b> and <b>169</b> has been opened. If at step <b>224</b>, the time t<b>3</b> is greater than the estimated return time, then the ECU <b>160</b> continues to step <b>232</b>. If at step <b>224</b>, the time t<b>3</b> is not greater than the estimated return time, then at step <b>226</b> the ECU <b>160</b> determines if the estimated cycle time determined at step <b>214</b> is greater than the calculate cycle time (which is calculated as described above with respect to step <b>218</b>). If the estimated cycle time is not greater than the calculated cycle time, then the pump <b>72</b>A can adequately supply lubricant to the engine <b>24</b> under the current operating conditions (i.e. the pump <b>72</b>A can perform a complete pumping cycle faster than what is required) and the ECU <b>160</b> returns to step <b>224</b>. If however, the estimate cycle time is greater the calculated cycle time, then the pump <b>72</b>A cannot adequately supply lubricant to the engine <b>24</b> (i.e. the pump <b>72</b>A cannot perform a complete pumping cycle within the required amount of time) and the ECU <b>160</b> continues to step <b>228</b>. At step <b>228</b> the ECU reduces the maximum allowable engine speed by an amount of B RPM (10 RPM for example), and then sets the &#x201c;Cold Limit&#x201d; variable to &#x201c;true&#x201d; such that when the method subsequently comes to step <b>216</b>, steps <b>218</b> and <b>220</b> will be performed to warm the lubricant as described above. From step <b>230</b>, the ECU <b>160</b> returns to step <b>224</b> and if the time t<b>3</b> is not greater than the estimated return time, then step <b>226</b> is performed again. If the engine <b>24</b> was previously operating at a speed greater than the maximum allowable engine speed calculated at step <b>228</b>, then the engine speed has been reduced and therefore the calculated cycle time should have increased. If at step <b>226</b> the estimated cycle time is still not greater than the calculated cycle time, then step <b>228</b> is repeated. Step <b>228</b> will continue to be performed until either the time t<b>3</b> is greater than the estimated return time (step <b>224</b>) or the estimated cycle time is greater than the calculated cycle time (step <b>226</b>), whichever occurs first.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In a method using the oil pump <b>72</b>B, step <b>224</b> could be replace by a step where the ECU <b>160</b> determine if a signal indicative that the circuit including the leads <b>139</b> and <b>169</b> has been closed has been received. If this circuit is opened, then the ECU <b>160</b> continues to step <b>226</b> and if it is closed the ECU <b>160</b> continues to step <b>232</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Once it is determined at step <b>224</b> that the time t<b>3</b> is greater than the estimated return time, then at step <b>232</b> the ECU determines if the maximum allowable engine speed is less than the engine speed limit during normal operation of the snowmobile <b>10</b> of A RPM. If it is not less than A RPM, then the ECU <b>160</b> continues to step <b>236</b>, set the value of the variable &#x201c;Cold Limit&#x201d; to false, and then returns to step <b>206</b> where it will apply current to the coil <b>156</b> of the pump <b>72</b>A at the beginning of the next pumping cycle. If the maximum allowable engine speed is less than A RPM, the ECU will increase the maximum allowable engine speed by a predetermined amount of C RPM (but without exceeding A RPM), so as to gradually increase the maximum allowable engine speed each time step <b>234</b> is performed. From step <b>234</b> the ECU <b>160</b> returns to step <b>206</b> where it will apply current to the coil <b>156</b> of the pump <b>72</b>A at the beginning of the next pumping cycle.</p>
