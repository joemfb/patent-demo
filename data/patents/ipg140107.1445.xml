<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many optical fiber connectors include a lens and a blind hole behind the lens. The bind hole receives an optical fiber. The lens receives and guides light from/to the optical fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Injection molding is a popular method of fabricating optical fiber connectors. The mold used includes a core pin to form the blind hole. During the injection molding process, however, the core pin may be bent by impact or by the pressure of the introduced molding material, thus producing a blind hole which is misaligned or otherwise out of specification.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, it is desirable to provide an optical fiber connector, which can overcome or at least alleviate the limitations described.</p>

In this embodiment, each of the first receiving groove portions <b>226</b> are deeper and wider than the second receiving groove portions <b>228</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another embodiment, the first recesses <b>222</b> and the second recesses <b>224</b> can be omitted. The receiving grooves <b>220</b> extend from the second side surface <b>14</b> to the inner side surface <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Each of the two optical fibers <b>30</b> is received in a receiving groove <b>220</b> and is aligned with an optical lens <b>18</b>. Each optical fiber <b>30</b> includes a main portion <b>34</b> which is substantially circular in section, and a concentric front portion <b>32</b>. The main portion <b>34</b> consists of a core portion and a cladding portion surrounding the core portion. The front portion <b>32</b> consists of the core portion exposed, and the front portion <b>32</b> has a certain critical length. The first receiving groove portion <b>226</b> conforms to the main portion <b>34</b> and is configured for receiving the main portion <b>34</b>. The second receiving groove portion <b>228</b> is sized to match the front portion <b>32</b> and is configured for receiving the front portion <b>32</b>.</p>
