<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">With reference to the Figures, a safety needle assembly <b>10</b> is shown which generally includes a hub <b>12</b>, to which is fixed a needle <b>14</b>, and a shield <b>16</b>. The needle <b>14</b> may be of any known type and includes a distal end <b>18</b>, formed for insertion into a patient, a proximal end <b>20</b>, and a lumen <b>22</b> extending therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As used herein, the term &#x201c;distal&#x201d;, and derivatives thereof, refers to a direction towards a patient during use, while, the term &#x201c;proximal&#x201d;, and derivatives thereof, refers to a direction away from a patient during use.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the shield <b>16</b> is moveable relative to the hub <b>12</b>, particularly from a first position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, where the shield <b>16</b> covers the distal end <b>18</b> of the needle <b>14</b>, to a second position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, where the distal end <b>18</b> of the needle <b>14</b> is exposed and not covered by the shield <b>16</b>. In the second position, the needle <b>14</b> is available for use.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a first embodiment of the subject invention, it is preferred that the shield <b>16</b> be maintained in the first position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. To this end, a first magnetic element <b>24</b> is fixed to the hub <b>12</b> and a second magnetic element <b>26</b> is fixed to the shield <b>16</b>. The first and second magnetic elements <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> are configured so as to define a repulsive force therebetween which urges the first and second magnetic elements <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> apart. For example, the magnetic poles of the first and second magnetic elements <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> may be arranged to coact so as to generate the repulsive force. The repulsive force urges the shield <b>16</b> towards the first, shielding position.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, features are defined on the hub <b>12</b> and/or the shield <b>16</b> which limit the extent of distal movement of the shield <b>16</b> relative to the hub <b>12</b>. In this manner, excessive distal movement of the shield <b>16</b>, which may lead to separation of the shield <b>16</b> from the hub <b>12</b>, may be avoided. By way of non-limiting example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the features may include at least one first detent <b>28</b> formed on the hub <b>12</b> and at least one second detent <b>30</b> formed on the shield <b>16</b>. The first and second detents <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> may be configured to interferingly engage and limit the extent of distal movement of the shield <b>16</b> relative to the hub <b>12</b>. The first and second detents <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> are configured to limit movement of the shield <b>16</b> to a position coinciding with the first, shielding position. It is noted that aperture <b>32</b> is defined in the shield <b>16</b> through which the needle <b>14</b> passes with the shield <b>16</b> moving from the first to the second positions. The distal end <b>18</b> of the needle <b>14</b> may be located in the aperture <b>32</b> in the first, shielding position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The distal end <b>18</b> of the needle <b>14</b> may be shielded with the distal end <b>18</b> of the needle <b>14</b> being located in the aperture <b>32</b>, yet proximally of distalmost end <b>34</b> of the shield <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">To facilitate manufacturing, the first and second detents <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> may be formed as cooperating threads which permit threading of the shield <b>16</b> onto the hub <b>12</b> with the second detent <b>30</b> ultimately completely by-passing the first detent <b>28</b>. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, various configurations of the first and second detents <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> may be utilized in connection with the subject invention.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Preferably, the first and second magnetic elements <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> are axially aligned to maintain proper magnetic polar alignment. More preferably, the first and second magnetic elements <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> are annularly formed to minimize any effect due to rotational displacement of the hub <b>12</b> and/or the shield <b>16</b>. The first and second magnetic elements <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> may be located on the respective peripheries of the hub <b>12</b> and the shield <b>16</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>. More particularly, the second magnetic element <b>26</b> may be fixed to a proximal end <b>36</b> of the shield <b>16</b> with the first magnetic element <b>24</b> being fixed to an outwardly protruding flange <b>38</b>. Alternatively, as shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref>, the first and second magnetic elements <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> may be fixed to internal faces of the hub <b>12</b> and the shield <b>16</b>. More particularly, the first magnetic element <b>24</b> may be fixed to distal face <b>40</b> of the hub <b>12</b>. The distal face <b>40</b> circumscribes the needle <b>14</b>. The second magnetic element <b>26</b> may be fixed to proximal face <b>42</b> which circumscribes the aperture <b>32</b>. In both configurations, the first and second magnetic elements <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> are preferably axially aligned.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The first and second magnetic elements <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> may be fixed to the hub <b>12</b> and to the shield <b>16</b> in any known manner. For example, the first and second magnetic elements <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> may be molded, e.g., overmolded, to the hub <b>12</b> and the shield <b>16</b>, respectively. Fusion, e.g., ultrasonic or laser welding, or adhesion may be also utilized. Further, mechanical connection, such as by press fit or interference fit, may be also utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">With the safety needle assembly <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref>, the needle <b>14</b> is initially covered with the shield <b>16</b> being in the first, shielding position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref>. In this manner, the needle <b>14</b> is completely covered prior to use. The hub <b>12</b> may be provided with needle mounting features <b>44</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), such as threads and/or a surface configuration (e.g., a Luer surface), configured for mounting the safety needle assembly <b>10</b> onto a medical injector. With the needle mounting features <b>44</b>, the safety needle assembly <b>10</b> may be formed to be removable after use. Alternatively, the safety needle assembly <b>10</b> may be rigidly fixed to a medical injector, such as by adhesion or fusion, or formed integral with the barrel or other component of a medical injector. Preferably, with the needle mounting features <b>44</b> being provided, the hub <b>12</b> is engaged to cause mounting of the safety needle assembly <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">With the safety needle assembly <b>10</b> being prepared and ready for injection, the shield <b>16</b> is applied to a patient's skin with pressure being applied to the hub <b>12</b> through the corresponding injector. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 6</figref>, with a predetermined level of force, the repulsive force generated between the first and second magnetic elements <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> is overcome and the hub <b>12</b> is moved distally relative to the shield <b>16</b>. With the hub <b>12</b> moving distally relative to the shield <b>16</b>, the needle <b>14</b> becomes exposed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 6</figref>. This exposure also allows insertion of the needle <b>14</b> into a patient. The repulsive force generated by the first and second magnetic elements <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> is surmountable by a predetermined amount of force applied to the hub <b>12</b> relative to the shield <b>16</b>. Once injection is complete, and the pressing force is removed from the hub <b>12</b>, the shield <b>16</b> is urged distally relative to the hub <b>12</b> under force of movement of the repulsive force generated by the first and second magnetic elements <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> to return to the first, shielding position.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-16</figref>, a third magnetic element <b>46</b> may be provided on the hub <b>12</b> or the shield <b>16</b> to provide different modes of operation of the safety needle assembly <b>10</b>. It is preferred that the third magnetic element <b>46</b> be located on the hub <b>12</b> or the shield <b>16</b> at a location diametrically opposite the first or second magnetic element <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>. In addition, the third magnetic element <b>46</b> is configured to provide an opposite magnetic pole from the corresponding magnetic element located on the hub <b>12</b> or the shield <b>16</b> with the third magnetic element <b>46</b>. Thus, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-12</figref>, the third magnetic element <b>46</b> may be fixed to the hub <b>12</b> with the first magnetic element <b>24</b> with the first and third magnetic elements <b>24</b>, <b>46</b> having opposite magnetic poles facing the shield <b>16</b>. In this manner, rotational alignment of the second magnetic element <b>26</b> with the first or third magnetic element <b>24</b>, <b>46</b> will result in magnetic attraction or repulsion, depending on the polarity of the aligned magnetic elements. Thus, where initial exposure of the needle <b>14</b> is desired, the shield <b>16</b> may be rotationally aligned so as to generate a magnetic attractive force between the second and third magnetic elements <b>26</b>, <b>46</b>, resulting in the shield <b>16</b> being drawn to the hub <b>12</b>. In this manner, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, the shield <b>16</b> is in the second position with the needle <b>14</b> being exposed for use. The shield <b>16</b> may be rotationally adjusted relative to the hub <b>12</b> so that the second magnetic element <b>26</b> aligns with the first magnetic element <b>24</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, resulting in a magnetically repulsive force being generated therebetween and the shield <b>16</b> being urged away from the hub <b>12</b> to the first, shielding position. To limit inadvertent rotation of the shield <b>16</b> relative to the hub <b>12</b>, one or more releasable retaining arrangements <b>48</b> may be provided between the shield <b>16</b> and the hub <b>12</b>, such as a releasable tongue and groove arrangement. The releasable retaining arrangements <b>48</b> may be positioned to provide releasable retention with the magnetic elements aligned as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 11</figref>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the third magnetic element <b>46</b> may be mounted onto the shield <b>16</b> with the second magnetic element <b>26</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-16</figref>. Here, the third magnetic element <b>46</b> is formed to have the opposite magnetic polarity from the second magnetic element <b>26</b> facing the hub <b>12</b>. Rotational adjustment of the shield <b>16</b> relative to the hub <b>12</b> shall result in movement of the shield <b>16</b> between the first position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>) and the second position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>), in the same manner as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Various quantities and configurations of the magnetic elements may be utilized. Preferably, the first-third magnetic elements <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>46</b> are not annular shaped in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-16</figref>. In all other respects, considerations discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref> apply equally to the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-16</figref>.</p>
