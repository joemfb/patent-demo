<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a) on Patent Application No. 2010-031529 filed in Japan on Feb. 16, 2010, the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an illuminating device for illuminating an irradiation target such as a document, an image-reading apparatus provided with the illuminating device, and an image-forming apparatus provided with the image-reading apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This type of illuminating device is used mounted on, for example, an image-reading apparatus, is provided with a plurality of light-emitting elements (e.g., LEDs) that are arranged in a line parallel to a main-scanning direction for reading a document, and illuminates a document using these light-emitting elements. The image-reading apparatus repeatedly scans a document illuminated by the illuminating device in the main-scanning direction, and, at the same time, scans the document also in a sub-scanning direction, thereby reading the entire document. An image of this read document is output to a printer or the like, and recorded on recording paper.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In such an illuminating device, as the number of the light-emitting elements increases, a higher illuminance can be achieved. However, because of a high unit cost of the light-emitting element, it is desirable to reduce the number of the light-emitting elements to reduce the cost and also the power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Also, the light-emitting elements have a narrow directivity, the light intensity of the light-emitting elements in the optical axis direction is strong, and the light intensity decreases as the light deviates from the optical axis, and thus uneven illumination in which the bright spot of the light-emitting elements is reflected in a document reading range readily occurs, and it is desirable to reduce uneven illumination.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to solve such problems, JP 2005-102112A (Patent Document 1) discloses a technique in which a condensing element is provided in the light-emitting direction of the respective light-emitting elements, such that almost all of the light emitted from the light-emitting elements is caused to be incident on the incident-side lens of the condensing element and are emitted from the condensing element onto a document reading range, or such that, by forming a prismatic surface in a part of the condensing element or providing a reflecting plate as a separate element from the condensing element, light that has been transmitted through the condensing element is reflected by the prismatic surface or the reflecting plate so as to allow the light to be emitted toward the document reading range, thereby reducing the light loss. Such reduction of the light loss enables reduction of the number of light-emitting elements.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Also in JP 2001-343531A (Patent Document 2), in a configuration in which light of the light-emitting elements is emitted onto an irradiation target via a light guide plate, the light emitting face of the light guide plate is given a light diffusing function to diffuse light by the light emitting face of the light guide plate, thereby reducing uneven illumination on the irradiation target. With such a configuration, even though the number of light-emitting elements is small, uneven illumination hardly occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, in the technique of Patent Document 1, although the light loss can be reduced, no particular measure to reduce uneven illumination is disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Also in Patent Document 2, while uneven illumination on the irradiation target is reduced by diffusing light by the light emitting face of the light guide plate, the light loss increases due to such diffusion of light, which results in a significant decrease in the irradiation light amount onto the irradiation target.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention was arrived at in view of the above-described conventional problem, and it is an object thereof to provide an illuminating device capable of effectively reducing the light loss while suppressing uneven illumination by a plurality of light-emitting elements, an image-reading apparatus including such an illuminating device, and an image-forming apparatus including such an image-reading apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to solve the above issues, an illuminating device of the present invention includes a plurality of light-emitting elements arranged in a line, the illuminating device illuminating an irradiation target by irradiating the irradiation target with light that is emitted from the light-emitting elements via a first and a second optical paths, in which a light diffusing portion for diffusing light is provided in one of the first optical path and the second optical path, and an irradiation light amount of said one of the first optical path and the second optical path in which the light diffusing portion is provided is larger than an irradiation light amount of the other optical path.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Here, the bright spots of the light-emitting elements are more readily reflected by the irradiation target with one of the first optical path and the second optical path having a larger irradiation light amount on the irradiation target than with the other optical path having a smaller irradiation light amount, and thus uneven illumination tends to be aggravated. Therefore, the light diffusing portion is provided in one of the first optical path and the second optical path having a larger irradiation light amount on the irradiation target to diffuse light, thereby reducing uneven illumination in the irradiation target.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Also, with the illuminating device of the present invention, the first optical path may be an optical path in which light emitted from the light-emitting elements is irradiated on the irradiation target directly or after having been transmitted through a light-transmitting member, and the second optical path may be an optical path in which light emitted from the light-emitting elements is reflected by a reflecting member and irradiated on the irradiation target.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In such a configuration, the first optical path is a straight optical path in which light emitted from the light-emitting elements reaches the irradiation target directly or after having been transmitted through a light-transmitting member, and the second optical path is a bent optical path in which light emitted from the light-emitting elements is reflected by the reflecting member and reaches the irradiation target, these optical paths being mutually different.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">For example, the light diffusing portion is provided in the first optical path in which light emitted from the light-emitting elements is irradiated on the irradiation target directly or after having been transmitted through the light-transmitting member. Here, assuming that the irradiation light amount irradiated on the irradiation target via the straight optical path is larger than the irradiation light amount irradiated on the irradiation target via the other bent optical path, the light diffusing portion is provided in the straight optical path.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Furthermore, the illuminating device of the present invention may include a light-transmitting member that guides light emitted from the light-emitting elements toward the irradiation target; and a reflecting member that reflects light that is emitted from the light-emitting elements and transmitted through the light-transmitting member to illuminate the irradiation target, in which the first optical path may be an optical path in which light emitted from the light-emitting elements is transmitted through the light-transmitting member and irradiated on the irradiation target, and the second optical path may be an optical path in which light emitted from the light-emitting elements is transmitted through the light-transmitting member, reflected by the reflecting member and irradiated on the irradiation target.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">That is, the first optical path is a straight optical path in which light emitted from the light-emitting elements is transmitted through the light-transmitting member and irradiated on the irradiation target, and the second optical path is a bent optical path in which light is emitted from the light-emitting elements, transmitted through the light-transmitting member, reflected by the reflecting member and reaches the irradiation target. These optical paths are mutually different.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">For example, the light diffusing portion is provided in the first optical path in which light emitted from the light-emitting elements is transmitted through the light-transmitting member and irradiated on the irradiation target. Also in this case, assuming that the irradiation light amount irradiated on the irradiation target via the straight optical path is larger than the irradiation light amount irradiated on the irradiation target via the other bent optical path, the light diffusing portion is provided in the straight optical path.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Also, the illuminating device of the present invention may include two lines of light-emitting elements, each line including a plurality of light-emitting elements arranged in a line, in which said one of the first optical path and the second optical path may be an optical path in which light emitted from one of the two lines is irradiated on the irradiation target, and the other optical path may be an optical path in which light emitted from the other line is irradiated on the irradiation target.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In this manner, the first optical path and the second optical path are formed also in a configuration in which two lines of light-emitting elements are included, each line including a plurality of light-emitting elements arranged in a line. Therefore, the light diffusing portion is provided in one of the first optical path and the second optical path having a larger irradiation light amount on the irradiation target.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Also, with the illuminating device of the present invention, the light diffusing portion may be provided in a portion of the light-transmitting member that is closer to the irradiation target than to the light-emitting elements.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the case where the light diffusing portion is provided near the irradiation target in this manner, light that is transmitted through the light diffusing portion is incident on the irradiation target before being diffused over a wider area. In this case, although part of the light is reflect toward the light source side on the inner face of the light diffusing portion, such light is reflected again at a portion of the light-transmitting member on the light source side where the light diffusing portion is not provided. Therefore, the amount of light loss is small.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Alternatively, with the illuminating device of the present invention, the light diffusing portion is provided in a portion of the light-transmitting member that is closer to the light-emitting elements than to the irradiation target.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the case where the light diffusing portion is provided near the light-emitting elements in this manner, light that is transmitted thorough the light diffusing portion is incident on the irradiation target after being diffused over a wider area. In this case, since the distance to the irradiation target is made longer, it is possible to irradiate the irradiation target with light more diffused.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Thus, the degree of diffusion of light incident on the irradiation target can be set by adjusting the position of the light diffusing portion.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Also, with the illuminating device of the present invention, the light diffusing portion may be formed by roughening a surface of a light-transmitting member provided in an optical path having a larger irradiation light amount on the irradiation target, applying a coat of light dispersion paint to the surface of the light-transmitting member, or dispersing light dispersing particles in the light-transmitting member.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Any of roughening the surface of the light-transmitting member, application of a coat of light dispersion paint to the surface of the light-transmitting member, or dispersing light dispersing particles in the light-transmitting member may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Meanwhile, an image-reading apparatus of the present invention includes the illuminating device of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Moreover, an image-forming apparatus of the present invention includes the image-reading apparatus of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">These image-reading apparatus and image-forming apparatus of the present invention also exhibit the same working effects as the illuminating device of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In this manner, accordingly to the present invention, with one of the first optical path and the second optical path having a larger irradiation light amount on the irradiation target, the bright spots of the light-emitting elements are readily reflected by the irradiation target, but the light diffusing portion is provided in one of the first optical path and the second optical path having a larger irradiation light amount on the irradiation target, and thus light is diffused and uneven illumination is reduced.</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view showing an image-forming apparatus provided with an image-reading apparatus to which an illuminating device according to a first embodiment of the present invention has been applied. An image-forming apparatus <b>100</b> is a so-called multifunction peripheral having a scanner function, a copy function, a printer function, and a facsimile function, for example. The image-forming apparatus <b>100</b> transmits an image of a document read by an image-reading apparatus <b>41</b> to the outside (this function corresponds to a scanner function), and forms and records on recording paper, in color or monochrome, an image of the read document or an image received from the outside (this function corresponds to a copy function, a printer function, and a facsimile function).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The image-forming apparatus <b>100</b> is provided with a laser exposure device <b>1</b>, development apparatuses <b>2</b>, photosensitive drums <b>3</b>, charging units <b>5</b>, cleaner devices <b>4</b>, an intermediate transfer belt device <b>8</b>, a fixing device <b>12</b>, a paper transport path S, a paper feed tray <b>10</b>, a paper discharge tray <b>15</b>, and the like, in order to print an image on recording paper.</p>

Accordingly, four development apparatuses <b>2</b>, four photosensitive drums <b>3</b>, four charging units <b>5</b>, and four cleaner devices <b>4</b> are arranged so as to form four types of toner images corresponding to the respective colors. Respectively corresponding to black, cyan, magenta, and yellow, they form four image stations Pa, Pb, Pc, and Pd.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The photosensitive drums <b>3</b> have photosensitive layers on their surfaces. The charging units <b>5</b> are charging means for uniformly charging the surfaces of the photosensitive drums <b>3</b> to a predetermined potential. As the charging units <b>5</b>, a contact-type charging unit using a roller or brush, or a charger-type charging unit is used.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The laser exposure device <b>1</b> is a laser scanning unit (LSU) provided with laser diodes and reflecting mirrors, and causes the charged surfaces of the photosensitive drums <b>3</b> to be exposed to light according to image data to form electrostatic latent images corresponding to the image data on the charged surfaces.</p>

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The intermediate transfer belt <b>7</b> is obtained by forming a film having a thickness of approximately 100 &#x3bc;m to 150 &#x3bc;m into an endless belt.

The intermediate transfer rollers <b>6</b> are rollers including a base that is made of a metal (e.g., stainless steel) shaft having a diameter of 8 to 10 mm, and an electrically conductive elastic material (e.g., EPDM, urethane foam, etc.) that covers the surface of the shaft. In order to transfer the toner images, a high-voltage transfer bias (a high voltage of the opposite polarity (+) to the charge polarity (&#x2212;) of the toner) is applied to the intermediate transfer rollers <b>6</b>, and the electrically conductive elastic material enables a high voltage to be uniformly applied to recording paper.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In this manner, the toner images on the surfaces of the photosensitive drums <b>3</b> are superimposed on the intermediate transfer belt <b>7</b>, and form a color toner image represented by the image data.

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The toner image on the intermediate transfer belt <b>7</b> may not be completely transferred by the secondary transfer apparatus <b>11</b> to the recording paper, and toner may remain on the intermediate transfer belt <b>7</b>.

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Next, the image-reading apparatus <b>41</b> and a document-transporting apparatus <b>42</b> will be described in detail. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional view showing the image-reading apparatus <b>41</b> and the document-transporting apparatus <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The rear side of the document-transporting apparatus <b>42</b> is axially supported by a hinge (not shown) on the rear side the image-reading apparatus <b>41</b>, and the document-transporting apparatus <b>42</b> is opened or closed by lifting or lowering its front portion. When the document-transporting apparatus <b>42</b> is opened, a platen glass <b>44</b> of the image-reading apparatus <b>41</b> is exposed, and a document is placed on the platen glass <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The image-reading apparatus <b>41</b> is provided with the platen glass <b>44</b>, a first scanning unit <b>45</b>, a second scanning unit <b>46</b>, an imaging lens <b>47</b>, a charge coupled device (CCD) <b>48</b>, and the like. The first scanning unit <b>45</b> is provided with an illuminating device <b>51</b> and a first reflecting mirror <b>52</b>. While the first scanning unit <b>45</b> is moving at a constant speed V by a distance according to the document size in a sub-scanning direction Y, the document on the platen glass <b>44</b> is exposed to light by the illuminating device <b>51</b> and the reflected light is reflected by the first reflecting mirror <b>52</b> and guided to the second scanning unit <b>46</b>, and, thus, the image on the document surface is scanned in the sub-scanning direction Y. The second scanning unit <b>46</b> is provided with a second reflecting mirror <b>53</b> and a third reflecting mirror <b>54</b>. While the second scanning unit <b>46</b> is moving following the first scanning unit <b>45</b> at a speed V/2, the reflected light from the document is reflected by the second reflecting mirror <b>53</b> and the third reflecting mirror <b>54</b> and guided to the imaging lens <b>47</b>. The imaging lens <b>47</b> condenses the reflected light from the document onto the CCD <b>48</b>, and forms the image on the document surface on the CCD <b>48</b>. The CCD <b>48</b> repeatedly scans the image on the document in the main-scanning direction, and outputs analog image signals for one main scanning line after each scan.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The first and the second scanning units <b>45</b> and <b>46</b> respectively include pulleys (not shown). A wire (not shown) is wound around these pulleys, the wire is driven by a stepping motor, and, thus, the first and the second scanning units <b>45</b> and <b>46</b> are moved in synchronization.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Furthermore, the image-reading apparatus <b>41</b> can read not only a document that is being stopped but also an image on the surface of a document that is being transported by the document-transporting apparatus <b>42</b>. In this case, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the first scanning unit <b>45</b> is moved to a reading range below a document-reading glass <b>65</b>, and the second scanning unit <b>46</b> is positioned according to the position of the first scanning unit <b>45</b>. Then, in this state, the document-transporting apparatus <b>42</b> starts to transport the document.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In the document-transporting apparatus <b>42</b>, a pickup roller <b>55</b> is pressed against a document on a document tray <b>56</b> and rotated, the document is drawn in and transported, the leading edge of the document is collided with registration rollers <b>62</b> and its position is adjusted. After the adjustment, the document is passed through a point between the document-reading glass <b>65</b> and a reading guide plate <b>66</b> and discharged from paper discharge rollers <b>58</b> onto a paper discharge tray <b>49</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">While the document is being transported, the illuminating device <b>51</b> of the first scanning unit <b>45</b> illuminates the document surface via the document-reading glass <b>65</b>, the reflected light from the document surface is guided by the reflecting mirrors <b>52</b> to <b>54</b> of the first and the second scanning units <b>45</b> and <b>46</b> to the imaging lens <b>47</b>. The reflected light is condensed by the imaging lens <b>47</b> onto the CCD <b>48</b>, the image on the document surface is formed on the CCD <b>48</b>, and, thus, the image on the document surface is read.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Furthermore, when reading the back face of the document, an intermediate tray <b>67</b> is rotated about a shaft <b>67</b><i>a </i>as indicated by the dotted line, the paper discharge rollers <b>58</b> are stopped during discharge of the document from the paper discharge rollers <b>58</b> onto the paper discharge tray <b>49</b>, and, thus, the document is received by the intermediate tray <b>67</b>. Then, the paper discharge rollers <b>58</b> are rotated in reverse, the document is guided via a reverse transport path <b>68</b> to the registration rollers <b>62</b>, and, thus, the front and the back of the document are reversed. Then, as in the case of the image on the front face of the document, the image on the back face of the document is read, the intermediate tray <b>67</b> is returned to its position indicated by the solid line, and the document is discharged from the paper discharge rollers <b>58</b> onto the paper discharge tray <b>49</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In this manner, the image on the document surface thus read by the CCD <b>48</b> is output from the CCD <b>48</b> as analog image signals, and these analog image signals are A/D converted into digital image signals. These digital image signals are subjected to various types of image processing and then transmitted to and received by the laser exposure device <b>1</b> of the image-forming apparatus <b>100</b>, the image is recorded on recording paper in the image-forming apparatus <b>100</b>, and this recording paper is output as a photocopied document.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The document on the platen glass <b>44</b> or the document-reading glass <b>65</b> is illuminated by the illuminating device <b>51</b> of the first scanning unit <b>45</b>. Here, it is desirable to reduce the light loss by causing almost all of the light emitted from an LED array <b>71</b> of the illuminating device <b>51</b> to be incident on the document.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Also, as described in detail later, while the LED array <b>71</b> is configured by arranging a plurality of LEDs in a line, the directivity of the LEDs is narrow, and uneven illumination in which the bright spot of the LEDs are reflected in the document readily occurs. Therefore, it is desirable to suppress this uneven illumination.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Thus, the illuminating device <b>51</b> of this embodiment includes a light-guiding member (light-transmitting member) <b>72</b> that guides the light emitted from the LED array <b>71</b> directly toward the document and also toward a reflecting plate <b>73</b>, and the light-reflecting plate <b>73</b> that reflects the light guided by the light-guiding member <b>72</b> toward the document. That is, a first optical path in which light travels from the LED array <b>71</b> to the document while being transmitted through the light-guiding member <b>72</b> and a second optical path in which light travels from the LED array <b>71</b> to the document while being transmitted through the light-guiding member <b>72</b> and reflected by the light-reflecting plate <b>73</b> are set. The document is thus illuminated by light via mutually different paths, namely, the first optical path and the second optical path. In this manner, almost all of the light emitted from the LED array <b>71</b> is caused to be incident on the document, and thus the light loss can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Furthermore, a light diffusing portion is provided on a surface portion of the light-guiding member <b>72</b> through which light in the first optical path is transmitted, the light in the first optical path is appropriately diffused by the light diffusing portion, and the diffused light is irradiated onto the document, thereby reducing uneven illumination on the document.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Next, the configuration of the illuminating device <b>51</b> of the first embodiment will be described in detail. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional view schematically showing the first scanning unit <b>45</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a perspective view schematically showing the first scanning unit <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">As clearly seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the first scanning unit <b>45</b> is provided with the illuminating device <b>51</b>, the first reflecting mirror <b>52</b>, and a moving scanning frame <b>74</b>. The illuminating device <b>51</b> and the first reflecting mirror <b>52</b> are mounted on the moving scanning frame <b>74</b>, both ends of the moving scanning frame <b>74</b> are slidably supported, and the moving scanning frame <b>74</b> is moved in the sub-scanning direction Y by the pulley, the wire, and the stepping motor.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The illuminating device <b>51</b> is provided with a substrate <b>75</b>, the LED array <b>71</b> mounted on the substrate <b>75</b>, the light-guiding member <b>72</b> supported by the substrate <b>75</b> in a fixed manner, and the reflecting plate <b>73</b>. All of the substrate <b>75</b>, the LED array <b>71</b>, the light-guiding member <b>72</b>, and the reflecting plate <b>73</b> are arranged such that their longitudinal direction is in the main-scanning direction X for reading a document MS, and have a length similar to that of the reading range in the main-scanning direction X.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The LED array <b>71</b> is configured from a plurality of LEDs <b>76</b> that are arranged in a line in the main-scanning direction X on the substrate <b>75</b>. Each LED <b>76</b> is connected to a wiring pattern of the substrate <b>75</b>, and the wiring pattern of the substrate <b>75</b> is connected via a harness (not shown) to a driver circuit (not shown) mounted on the moving scanning frame <b>74</b>. This driver circuit supplies electrical power via the harness and the wiring pattern of the substrate <b>75</b> to each LED <b>76</b>, and turns the LED <b>76</b> on and off.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The light-guiding member <b>72</b> is made of translucent synthetic resin (polycarbonate, acrylic, etc.) or glass, and has a direct emitting portion <b>77</b> that is disposed between the LED array <b>71</b> and an illumination range k centered about a document reading reference position on the surface of the platen glass <b>44</b> and the document-reading glass <b>65</b>, and an indirect emitting portion <b>78</b> that is disposed between the reflecting plate <b>73</b> and the LED array <b>71</b>. The direct emitting portion <b>77</b> and the indirect emitting portion <b>78</b> are linked to each other and formed in one piece, and the direct emitting portion <b>77</b> and the indirect emitting portion <b>78</b> cover the surface side of the substrate <b>75</b>. The direct emitting portion <b>77</b> covers a portion obliquely above the substrate <b>75</b>, that is, a portion on the side of the illumination range k, and the indirect emitting portion <b>78</b> covers a portion on the left of the substrate <b>75</b>, that is, a portion on the side of the reflecting plate <b>73</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Furthermore, the indirect emitting portion <b>78</b> includes a stepped portion <b>78</b><i>a </i>on its inner side, and this stepped portion <b>78</b><i>a </i>abuts against an end portion of the substrate <b>75</b>, such that the indirect emitting portion <b>78</b> is supported by the substrate <b>75</b> in a fixed manner. The left end side of the direct emitting portion <b>77</b> is linked to the indirect emitting portion <b>78</b>, a leg portions <b>77</b><i>b </i>at a right end <b>77</b><i>a </i>is mounted and fixed on the substrate <b>75</b>, and the direct emitting portion <b>77</b> is supported by the substrate <b>75</b> in a fixed manner.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The inner faces (the light incident faces facing the LED array <b>71</b>) of the direct emitting portion <b>77</b> and the indirect emitting portion <b>78</b> are flat faces. The light incident faces of the direct emitting portion <b>77</b> and the indirect emitting portion <b>78</b> are arranged at mutually different positions around the LED array <b>71</b>, and the LED array <b>71</b> is disposed on the side of an inner angle defined by these light incident faces. Here, the inner angle is an angle of less than 180&#xb0; formed by the light incident faces.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Furthermore, the outer faces (the light emission faces facing the illumination range k and the reflecting plate <b>73</b>) of the direct emitting portion <b>77</b> and the indirect emitting portion <b>78</b> are convex faces. The outer convex faces of the direct emitting portion <b>77</b> and the indirect emitting portion <b>78</b> are formed so as to condense light transmitted through the direct emitting portion <b>77</b> and light transmitted through the indirect emitting portion <b>78</b> and reflected by the reflecting plate <b>73</b> onto the illumination range k.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In addition, a light diffusing portion <b>70</b> is provided on an outer face (convex face ) of the direct emitting portion <b>77</b>. For example, in the case where the light-guiding member <b>72</b> is a molded item of polycarbonate having light transmission properties, the light diffusing portion <b>70</b> is formed by molding the convex face of the direct emitting portion <b>77</b> to be a roughened surface. More specifically, an asperity is etched into a portion on the inner side of the mold of the light-guiding member <b>72</b>, the portion corresponding to the convex face of the direct emitting portion <b>77</b>, and the convex face of the direct emitting portion <b>77</b> is roughened by the asperity in the portion on the inner side of the mold during molding, thereby forming the light diffusing portion <b>70</b>. Alternatively, an asperity on the inner side portion of the mold can be formed by sandblasting, in which iron powder or glass powder is blasted onto the inner side portion. The dimension of the asperity can be adjusted by changing the diameter or the blasting pressure of the iron powder or glass powder, and the width and the depth of the asperity are set to 0.5 &#x3bc;m to 10 &#x3bc;m, approximately.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Alternatively, the convex face of the direct emitting portion <b>77</b> may be formed as a smooth face by the mold, and the convex smooth face may be thereafter roughened by sandblasting.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Alternatively, the convex face of the direct emitting portion <b>77</b> may be formed as a smooth face by the mold, and a coat of paint having light dispersion properties may be applied to the convex face so as to provide the light diffusing portion <b>70</b>. Favorable examples of the paint include paints that contain silica, barium sulfate, calcium carbonate, titanium white, glass beads, resin beads or the like for diffusing light, in a volatile solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Furthermore, instead of providing the light diffusing portion <b>70</b> on the convex face of the direct emitting portion <b>77</b>, particles or powders having light dispersion properties may be dispersed in the direct emitting portion <b>77</b>. Such particles or powders having light dispersion properties can be dispersed by mixing such particles or powders into a molten resin serving as the material for the direct emitting portion <b>77</b> before molding the direct emitting portion <b>77</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Furthermore, in the illuminating device <b>51</b>, a slit St in the main-scanning direction X is formed between the LED array <b>71</b> and the reflecting plate <b>73</b>. The illumination range k is set directly above the slit St, and the first reflecting mirror <b>52</b> is positioned directly below the slit St. The light-guiding member <b>72</b> is provided on the side of the LED array <b>71</b> with respect to the slit St.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">A light emission face <b>76</b><i>a </i>of each LED <b>76</b> of the LED array <b>71</b> faces the reflecting plate <b>73</b>, and the optical axes of the LEDs <b>76</b> point to the left (to the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, that is, in Y axis direction). The light emission range of each LED <b>76</b> is up to approximately 90&#xb0; in every direction from the optical axis of the LED <b>76</b> centered about this optical axis. Furthermore, the surface of the substrate <b>75</b> is white, and light emitted from each LED <b>76</b> is reflected by the surface of the substrate <b>75</b>. Accordingly, almost all of the light from each LED <b>76</b> is emitted in a range a having an angle of 90&#xb0; defined by the surface of the substrate <b>75</b> and a perpendicular plane perpendicular to the surface of the substrate <b>75</b> that passes through the LED <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Furthermore, the reflecting plate <b>73</b> has a first reflecting face <b>73</b><i>a </i>and a second reflecting face <b>73</b><i>b</i>. The first reflecting face <b>73</b><i>a </i>and the second reflecting face <b>73</b><i>b </i>are inclined upward such that light emitted from the LED array <b>71</b> can be reflected toward the illumination range k. Furthermore, the second reflecting face <b>73</b><i>b </i>is slightly bent with respect to the first reflecting face <b>73</b><i>a</i>, and the orientation of the second reflecting face <b>73</b><i>b </i>is changed.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Furthermore, the first reflecting mirror <b>52</b> is disposed so as to be parallel to the main-scanning direction X and inclined at 45&#xb0; with respect to the scanning face (the surface of the platen glass <b>44</b> and the document-reading glass <b>65</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In the thus configured illuminating device <b>51</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when the LED array <b>71</b> on the substrate <b>75</b> emits light, the light emitted from the LED array <b>71</b> is incident on the light incident face of the direct emitting portion <b>77</b> of the light-guiding member <b>72</b>, transmitted through the direct emitting portion <b>77</b>, condensed by the outer convex face of the direct emitting portion <b>77</b> and diffused by the light diffusing portion <b>70</b> having a convex face, and irradiated on the illumination range k centered about the document reading reference position on the surface of the platen glass <b>44</b> and the document-reading glass <b>65</b>.</p>

The light via the second optical path d also illuminates the illumination range k.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Furthermore, when light emitted from the LED array <b>71</b> is transmitted through the indirect emitting portion <b>78</b> of the light-guiding member <b>72</b>, condensed by the outer convex face of the indirect emitting portion <b>78</b>, and incident on the second reflecting face <b>73</b><i>b </i>of the reflecting plate <b>73</b>, the light is reflected by the second reflecting face <b>73</b><i>b</i>, and incident on an illumination range ks at a position 5 mm higher than the surface of the platen glass <b>44</b> and the document-reading glass <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Taking an optical path from the LED array <b>71</b> via the indirect emitting portion <b>78</b> and then the second reflecting face <b>73</b><i>b </i>to the illumination range k as an auxiliary optical path ds, this auxiliary optical path ds is also an optical path that is bent at the second reflecting face <b>73</b><i>b </i>and longer than the first optical path D. Light via the auxiliary optical path ds illuminates the illumination range ks at a position 5 mm higher than the surface of the document-reading glass <b>65</b>. The illumination range ks at the position 5 mm higher than the surface of the document-reading glass <b>65</b> is set by slightly bending the second reflecting face <b>73</b><i>b </i>with respect to the first reflecting face <b>73</b><i>a </i>as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Accordingly, the illumination range k centered about the document reading reference position on the surface of the platen glass <b>44</b> and the document-reading glass <b>65</b> is illuminated with light in the straight first optical path D transmitted through the direct emitting portion <b>77</b>, and is illuminated with light in the second optical path d transmitted through the indirect emitting portion <b>78</b> and reflected by the first reflecting face <b>73</b><i>a </i>of the reflecting plate <b>73</b>. Accordingly, the surface of the document MS is illuminated with a large amount of light.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Also, the illumination range ks at a position 5 mm higher than the surface of the platen glass <b>44</b> and the document-reading glass <b>65</b> is illuminated with light in the auxiliary optical path ds transmitted through the indirect emitting portion <b>78</b> and reflected by the second reflecting face <b>73</b><i>b </i>of the reflecting plate <b>73</b>. Accordingly, even when the surface of the document is lifted from the surface of the platen glass <b>44</b> and the document-reading glass <b>65</b>, this surface is illuminated. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in a state where a book is opened and placed on the platen glass <b>44</b>, the pages are lifted from the platen glass <b>44</b> at a portion MS<b>1</b> where the book is bound. Here, light in the auxiliary optical path ds reaches the lifted pages, and illuminates the lifted pages.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Furthermore, the direction in which light transmitted through the direct emitting portion <b>77</b> is incident on the illumination range k is different from the direction in which light reflected by the reflecting plate <b>73</b> is incident on the illumination range k. Accordingly, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, even in a state where a trailing edge portion m of the document MS is positioned in the illumination range k, and light reflected by the first reflecting face <b>73</b><i>a </i>of the reflecting plate <b>73</b> is incident on the trailing edge portion m of the document MS, forming the shadow of the trailing edge portion m, the shadow disappears due to light transmitted through the direct emitting portion <b>77</b> being incident the trailing edge portion m. That is to say, the trailing edge portion m of the document MS is irradiated with illuminating light from the front and light from the rear, and, thus, the shadow of the trailing edge portion m of the document MS is not formed, and no shadow is formed on an image of a document read by the CCD <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the direct emitting portion <b>77</b> covers a portion obliquely above the LED array <b>71</b>, and the indirect emitting portion <b>78</b> covers a portion on the left of the LED array <b>71</b>, so almost all of the light emitted from the LED array <b>71</b> in a range a having an angle of 90&#xb0; is irradiated onto the illumination range k via the first optical path D and the second optical path d. Thus the light loss is kept low.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In addition, since the surface of the substrate <b>75</b> is a white surface, light reflected by the surface of the substrate <b>75</b> is incident on the illumination range k via the first optical path D and the second optical path d, which also keeps the light loss low.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Light emitted from the LED array <b>71</b> is irradiated onto the document MS or a page of a book on the platen glass <b>44</b> or the document-reading glass <b>65</b> via the light-guiding member <b>72</b> or the light-reflecting plate <b>73</b>. Then, reflected light from the document MS or the page of the book passes through the slit St, and is reflected by the first reflecting mirror <b>52</b>. The reflected light is emitted toward the second reflecting mirror <b>53</b> of the second scanning unit <b>46</b> through an opening portion on the side wall of the moving scanning frame <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Here, the direct emitting portion <b>77</b> condenses light incident on the inner flat face of the direct emitting portion <b>77</b> and causes the light to be incident on the illumination range k, and therefore, as the area of the inner flat face of the direct emitting portion <b>77</b> increases, the amount of light irradiated on the illumination range k from the direct emitting portion <b>77</b>, that is, the irradiation light amount from the first optical path D, increases.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Similarly, the indirect emitting portion <b>78</b> condenses light incident on the inner flat face of the indirect emitting portion <b>78</b> and causes the light to be incident on the illumination range k, and therefore, as the area of the inner flat face of the indirect emitting portion <b>78</b> increases, the amount of light irradiated on the illumination range k from the indirect emitting portion <b>78</b>, that is, the irradiation light amount from the second optical path d, increases.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Accordingly, by appropriately setting the area of the inner flat face of the direct emitting portion <b>77</b> and the area of the inner flat face of the indirect emitting portion <b>78</b>, the ratio between the irradiation light amount from the first optical path D and the irradiation light amount from the second optical path d can be adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Specifically, by setting the area of the indirect emitting portion <b>78</b> interposed between the LED array <b>71</b> and the light-reflecting plate <b>73</b> to be smaller than the area of the direct emitting portion <b>77</b>, the ratio between the irradiation light amount from the second optical path d and the irradiation light amount from the first optical path D can be set to, for example, 4:6, approximately. Also as described above, in order to irradiate the trailing edge portion m of the document MS with irradiation light from the front and light from the rear so as not to form the shadow of the trailing edge portion m of the document MS, it is preferable to set the ratio between the irradiation light amount from the second optical path d and the irradiation light amount from the first optical path D to approximately 4.5:5.5.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Next, the light diffusing portion <b>70</b> in the outer face (convex face) of the direct emitting portion <b>77</b> will be described in detail. The light diffusing portion <b>70</b> appropriately diffuses light in the first optical path D as described above, and causes the diffused light to be incident on the illumination range k centered about the document reading reference position on the surface of the platen glass <b>44</b> and the document-reading glass <b>65</b>, and reduces uneven illumination on the document MS.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">First, since the ratio between the irradiation light amount from the second optical path d and the irradiation light amount from the first optical path D is set to 4:6 to 5:5, it is possible to say that the light diffusing portion <b>70</b> in the convex face of the direct emitting portion <b>77</b> is provided in the optical path, of the first optical path D and the second optical path d, that has a larger irradiation light amount.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The reason for this is as follows. With illumination via the first optical path D having the larger irradiation light amount, the bright spots of the LEDs <b>76</b> are readily reflected by the document MS, which aggravates uneven illumination, so the light in the first optical path D is diffused by the light diffusing portion <b>70</b> so as to eradicate the bright spots of the LEDs <b>76</b> on the document MS. Also, with illumination via the second optical path d having a smaller irradiation light amount, the bright spots of the LEDs <b>76</b> are hardly reflected by the document MS, so that no light diffusing portion is provided so as not to increase the light loss.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Here, the relation between the irradiation light amount from the LEDs <b>76</b> to the document MS and uneven illumination will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a graph showing a result of analyzing the correspondence between the distance of the optical path from the LEDs <b>76</b> to the document MS and the irradiation light amount on the document MS using analysis simulation software. In the simulation using this analysis simulation software (Light Tools manufactured by Optical Research Associates), a virtual image-reading apparatus <b>100</b> is configured on the computer, the distance of the optical path from the LEDs <b>76</b> to the document MS placed on the surface of the platen glass <b>44</b> and the document-reading glass <b>65</b> (the optical axis of the LED <b>76</b>) H is varied in increments of 2 mm in a range of 6 mm to 18 mm, and the distribution in the main scanning direction X of the irradiation light amount on the document MS is obtained for each optical axis distance H varied in increments of 2 mm. That is, the optical axis distance H from the LEDs <b>76</b> to the document MS is varied in increments of 2 mm so as to vary the irradiation light amount on the document MS, and the distribution in the main scanning direction X of the irradiation light amount on the document MS is obtained for each optical axis distance H.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Note that the pitch P of the LEDs <b>76</b> is set to 16 mm. Also, the light flux of the LED <b>76</b> is 7.81 [lm (lumen)] (a luminosity of 1900 [mcd (milicandela)]).</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In the graph in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, characteristic curves G<b>1</b> to G<b>7</b> each indicating distribution of the irradiation light amount in the main scanning direction X are shown for the respective optical axis distances H obtained by varying the optical axis distance H in increments of 2 mm. As clearly understood by comparing these characteristic curves G<b>1</b> to G<b>7</b> with each other, as the optical axis distance H becomes shorter, the irradiation light amount on the document MS increases.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Also, as the optical axis distance H becomes shorter, that is, as the irradiation light amount on the document MS increases, the irradiation light amount on the document MS fluctuates more greatly. The fluctuation cycle of the irradiation light amount matches the pitch P of the LEDs <b>76</b>, and the irradiation light amount becomes maximal on the optical axes of the LEDs <b>76</b> and becomes minimal at the midpoints between adjacent LEDs <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In the case where the optical axis distance H is short and the irradiation light amount on the document MS is large, so that the irradiation light amount greatly fluctuates, the bright spots of the LEDs <b>76</b> are reflected by the surface of the document MS in the positions where the optical axes of the LEDs <b>76</b> intersect the surface of the document MS, and uneven illumination is aggravated.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Note that instead of varying the optical axis distance H, also by varying the emitted light amount of the LEDs <b>76</b> while maintaining the optical axis distance H at a fixed value, the irradiation light amount fluctuates. That is, as the emitted light amount of the LEDs <b>76</b> increases, the irradiation light amount on the document MS increases, and the fluctuation of the irradiation light amount on the document MS becomes greater. As a result, the bright spots of the LEDs <b>76</b> are reflected by the surface of the document MS in the positions where the optical axes of the LEDs <b>76</b> intersect the surface of the document MS.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">In this manner, uneven illumination occurs on the document MS illuminated by the LEDs <b>76</b>, and therefore it is preferable to clarify the acceptable limit of the uneven illumination. Therefore, the uneven illumination was subjected to the following evaluation.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">First, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, uneven illumination is defined. On the document MS illuminated by the LEDs <b>76</b>, dark and light conditions are alternately repeated in the uneven illumination cycle T in the main scanning direction X.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">The uneven illumination cycle T is the same as the LED pitch P. The unevenness of illumination M [%] is expressed as (L<b>1</b>-L<b>2</b>)/L<b>3</b>(%), where L<b>1</b> [lx (lux)] is the maximum value of the irradiation light amount, L<b>2</b> [lx (lux)] is the minimum value of the irradiation light amount, and L<b>3</b> [lx (lux)] is the average value of the irradiation light amounts. The inter-unevenness distance N [mm] represents the interval between the maximum value and the minimum value of the irradiation light amount in the uneven illumination cycle T, and corresponds to half of the pitch P (mm). Furthermore, the amplitude K [%] is (L<b>1</b>-L<b>3</b>)/L<b>3</b> (%).</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In the evaluation of the uneven illumination, 31 patterns of images were created by varying the values of the uneven illumination cycle T and the amplitude K [%] shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, and evaluated. The images were created by a personal computer, and printed with a printer. The color tone of the printed image was set to gray. Various printed images created as above were checked visually by a large number of test subjects, and a determination was made as to whether the uneven density (uneven density corresponding to uneven illumination) on the printed image is acceptable. More specifically, with the use of a gray chart having the same tone as the images, a sample of an acceptable limit of uneven density (uneven illumination) and a sample of a limit of sufficiently-acceptable uneven density (uneven illumination) were prepared, and the images are checked visually by a large number of test subjects. The results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a chart showing the uneven illumination cycle T, amplitude K [%], inter-unevenness distance N [mm] and unevenness M [%] calculated from these values, and determination results of the printed image. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a graph prepared based on the values in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, in which the vertical axis marks the unevenness M [%] and the horizontal axis marks the inter-unevenness distance N [mm].</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Note that in the determination column in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> and the graph in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, &#x201c;&#x2218;&#x201d; means &#x201c;uneven density (uneven illumination) is sufficiently acceptable&#x201d;, &#x201c;&#x394;&#x201d; means &#x201c;uneven density (uneven illumination) is at the acceptable limit&#x201d;, and &#x201c;x&#x201d; means &#x201c;uneven density (uneven illumination) is not acceptable&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the determination that uneven density (uneven illumination) is not acceptable (determined as &#x201c;x&#x201d;) was made in the range of N/2-5.5 (see &#x3b2; in FIG. <b>11</b>)&#x3c;M, the determination that uneven density (uneven illumination) is at the acceptable limit (determined as &#x201c;&#x394;&#x201d;) was made in the range of N/2-7.5 (see y in FIGS. <b>11</b>)&#x3c;M&#x3c;N/2-5.5 (see light dotted portion in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>), and the determination that uneven density (uneven illumination) is sufficiently acceptable (determined as &#x201c;&#x2218;&#x201d;) was made in the range of M&#x3c;N/2-7.5 (see dark dotted portion in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Next, an analysis simulation in which the unevenness M [%] and the inter-unevenness distance N [mm] are analyzed to specify the range of the (LED pitch P)/(optical axis distance H) will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">In an analysis simulation, a virtual image-reading apparatus was realized on the computer using an analysis simulation software (Light Tools manufactured by Optical Research Associates), and the unevenness M [%] and the inter-unevenness distance N [mm] were analyzed while varying the values of the LED pitch P (4 mm to 24 mm) and the optical axis distance H (4 mm to 19 mm). The value of P/H was determined based on the determination criteria shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> with respect to the unevenness M [%] and the inter-unevenness distance N [mm] thus analyzed.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Note that when several example values of the LED pitch P and the optical axis distance H used in the analysis simulation were set in a real image-reading apparatus for verification, the unevenness M [%] and the inter-unevenness distance N [mm] obtained with the real image-reading apparatus were almost the same as those obtained in the analysis simulation.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Based on this, it was confirmed that the virtual image-reading apparatus realized on the computer using the analysis simulation software is almost equivalent to the real image-reading apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a diagram illustrating the conditions of the analysis simulation. In the analysis simulation, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a light source <b>211</b> was configured such that <b>20</b> LED elements <b>212</b>, each including a light-emitting face E<b>2</b> that performs top-face light emission, are arranged in a line, and are disposed such that their optical axis L is perpendicular to an irradiated face G&#x2032; of a document G. Also, the light flux of a single LED element <b>212</b> (one LED element <b>212</b>) was set to 7.81 [lm (lumen)] (a luminosity of 1900 [mcd (milicandela)]).</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 to 15</figref> show graphs, each illustrating, at one of the LED pitch values employed in the analysis simulation, the irradiation light amount [lx] on the irradiated face G&#x2032; of the document G with respect to the distance in the main scanning direction [mm] at several values of the optical axis distance H. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref> show graphs for the LED pitch P of 8 mm and 10 mm, respectively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref> show graphs for the LED pitch P of 12 mm and 14 mm, respectively, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref> show graphs for the LED pitch P of 16 mm and 18 mm, respectively. In each graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 to 15</figref>, the optical axis distance H is set to 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, 12 mm, 14 mm, 16 mm and 18 mm as examples. Graphs of other optical axis distances H are not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Among the graphs, the graph in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> with the LED pitch P set to 16 mm is used to describe below an example of automatically determining the uneven illumination when the optical axis distance H is 6 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a diagram illustrating the unevenness M [%] in the case where the LED pitch P is 16 mm, the optical axis distance H is 6 mm and light-emitting elements arranged in a single line are used.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">In the case where the LED pitch P is 16 mm and the optical axis distance H is 6 mm, it is understood from the graph in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> that the maximum value L<b>1</b> of the irradiation light amount on the irradiated face G&#x2032; of the document G is 40000 [lx], the minimum value L<b>2</b> is 20000 [lx], and the average value L<b>3</b> is 30000 [lx]. When these values are assigned to the expression for obtaining the unevenness M [%], (L<b>1</b>-L<b>2</b>)/L<b>3</b> described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the unevenness M [%] is calculated to be 66.7 [%]. Also, since the LED pitch P is 16 mm, the inter-unevenness distance N [mm] is 8 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">When the unevenness M [%]=66.7 [%] and the inter-unevenness distance N [mm]=8 mm obtained in this manner are applied to the graph showing the relation between the unevenness M [%] and the inter-unevenness distance N [mm] as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, such values fall within the range of N/2-5.5 (see <b>6</b> in FIG. <b>11</b>)&#x3c;M. As a result, P/H (16 mm/6 mm=2.67) is determined to be unacceptable uneven illumination (determined as &#x201c;x&#x201d;). The tables in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref> show the results of the determination similarly performed on other values of the LED pitch P and the optical axis distance H as well.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows the determination results of P/H in the case where the LED pitch P is varied from 4 mm to 11 mm in increments of 1 mm, and the optical axis distance H is varied from 4 mm to 24 mm in increments of 1 mm. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows the determination results of P/H in the case where the LED pitch P is varied from 12 mm to 19 mm in increments of 1 mm, and the optical axis distance H is varied from 4 mm to 24 mm in increments of 1 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>, when the relation of P/H&#x3e;0.83 is satisfied, it is determined that the uneven illumination is not acceptable (determined as &#x201c;x&#x201d;), when the relation of 0.71&#x3c;P/H&#x2266;0.83 is satisfied, it is determined that the uneven illumination is at the acceptable limit (determined as &#x201c;&#x394;&#x201d;), and when the relation of P/H&#x2266;0.71 is satisfied, it is determined that the uneven illumination is sufficiently acceptable (determined as &#x201c;&#x2218;&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Based on the above, it is understood that uneven illumination can be suppressed if the light-emitting element pitch P and the optical axis distance H satisfy the relation of P/H&#x2266;0.83. Thus, when the value of one of the light-emitting element pitch P and the optical axis distance H is known, the other can be easily set by setting the other such that the relation of M&#x2266;N/2-5.5 is satisfied, since it is sufficient to insert the light-emitting element pitch P or the optical axis distance H into the relational expression of P/H&#x2266;0.83 when setting the light-emitting element pitch P and the optical axis distance H. For example, when the optical axis distance H is obtained by inserting the light-emitting element pitch P into the relational expression, it is sufficient to set the optical axis distance H to the value of (P/0.83) or a value not less than and as close as possible to the value of (P/0.83), from the viewpoint of setting the largest-possible irradiation light amount on the irradiated face G&#x2032; of the document G. On the other hand, when the light-emitting element pitch P is obtained by inserting the optical axis distance H into the relational expression, it is sufficient to set the light-emitting element pitch P to the value of (H&#xd7;0.83) or a value not more than and as close as possible to the value of (H&#xd7;0.83), from the viewpoint of setting the smallest-possible number of light-emitting elements.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">In addition, it is understood that uneven illumination can be effectively prevented if the light-emitting element pitch P and the optical axis distance H satisfy the relation of P/H&#x2266;0.71. Thus, when the value of one of the light-emitting element pitch P and the optical axis distance H is known, the other can be easily set by setting the other such that the relation of M&#x2266;N/2-7.5 is satisfied, since it is sufficient to insert the light-emitting element pitch P or the optical axis distance H into the relational expression of P/H&#x2266;0.71 when setting the light-emitting element pitch P and the optical axis distance H. For example, when the optical axis distance H is obtained by assigning the light-emitting element pitch P to the relational expression, it is sufficient to set the optical axis distance H to the value of (P/0.71) or a value not less than and as close as possible to the value of (P/0.71), from the viewpoint of setting the largest-possible irradiation light amount on the irradiated face G&#x2032; of the document G. On the other hand, when the light-emitting element pitch P is obtained by inserting the optical axis distance H into the relational expression, it is sufficient to set the light-emitting element pitch P to the value of (H&#xd7;0.71) or a value not more than and as close as possible to the value of (H&#xd7;0.71), from the viewpoint of setting the smallest-possible number of light-emitting elements.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Note that although a configuration in which light-emitting elements are arranged in a single line as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is employed in the analysis simulation described above, any arrangement configuration of the light-emitting elements may be employed for the analysis simulation if such an arrangement configuration may generate the unevenness M [%] and the inter-unevenness distance N [mm].</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">For example, also when the analysis simulation is performed on a configuration that includes first and second LED arrays <b>91</b> and <b>92</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 and 30</figref>, which will described in detail later, similar simulation results are obtained.</p>

<p id="p-0165" num="0164">In the first and the second LED arrays <b>91</b> and <b>92</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, the positions and the pitch in which the LEDs are disposed are the same. With such a configuration as well, the maximum value L<b>1</b> of the irradiation light amount on the irradiated face G&#x2032; of the document G is 80000 [lx], the minimum value L<b>2</b> is 40000 [lx], and the average value L<b>3</b> is 60000 [lx]. When these values are assigned to the expression for obtaining the unevenness M [%] described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, (L<b>1</b>-L<b>2</b>)/L<b>3</b>, the unevenness M [%] is calculated to be 66.7 [%].</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">In this manner, a configuration in which the positions and the pitch in which the LEDs in the first and the second LED arrays <b>91</b> and <b>92</b> are disposed are the same can attain the same unevenness M [%] as that of a configuration in which the LEDs are arranged in a single line as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Consequently, also when the analysis simulation is performed on the configuration in which the positions and the pitch in which the LEDs are disposed are the same, the same unevenness M [%] as that of the configuration in which the LEDs are arranged in a single line is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Also, in the analysis simulation, while the light flux of a single LED (one LED) is set to 7.81 [lm] (a luminosity of 1900 [mcd]), even if the light flux of a single LED was set to a larger or smaller value, the same unevenness M [%] was obtained due to the same reasons as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">In other words, regardless of the arrangement configuration or the light amount of the light-emitting element, if the relation of P/H&#x2266;0.83 is satisfied, uneven illumination can be suppressed to a degree acceptable for practical use. Furthermore, if the relation of P/H&#x2266;0.71 is satisfied, uneven illumination can be effectively prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Incidentally, in the illuminating device <b>51</b> of the first embodiment, for example, the pitch P of the LEDs <b>76</b> is set to 16 mm. In this case as well, when the above condition, P/H&#x2266;0.83 or P/H&#x2266;0.71, is satisfied, it is possible to make the uneven illumination difficult to perceive.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">Therefore, in the illuminating device <b>51</b>, the optical axis distance H is set such that the above condition, P/H&#x3c;0.83 or P/H&#x3c;0.71, is satisfied with respect to the second optical path d. As a result, uneven illumination on the document MS due to light incident from the second optical path d does not occur.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">However, taking into consideration that the irradiation light amount from the first optical path D is larger than the irradiation light amount from the second optical path d, and the ratio between the former irradiation light amount and the latter irradiation light amount is set to approximately 4:6 or that the optical axis distance H is short, if light emitted from the LED array <b>71</b> is directly incident on the document MS from the first optical path D, the irradiation light amount from the first optical path D greatly fluctuates, so that uneven illumination is readily perceived.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref>, the degree of fluctuation in the main scanning direction X of the irradiation light amount on the document MS from the second optical path d is small, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref>, the degree of fluctuation in the main scanning direction X of the irradiation light amount on the document MS from the first optical path D is great In this case, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20C</figref>, the sum of the irradiation light amounts from the first optical path D and the second optical path d is incident on the document MS, so that uneven illumination is readily perceived.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">However, in the first embodiment, since the light diffusing portion <b>70</b> is provided on the outer convex face of the direct emitting portion <b>77</b>, light in the first optical path D is diffused by the light diffusing portion <b>70</b>, and the diffused light in the first optical path D is incident on the document MS. For this reason, uneven illumination on the document MS due to light incident from the first optical path D does not occur.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref>, the degree of fluctuation in the main scanning direction X of the irradiation light amount on the document MS from the second optical path d is small, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref>, the degree of fluctuation in the main scanning direction X of the irradiation light amount on the document MS from the first optical path D is small. Accordingly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21C</figref>, the degree of fluctuation of the sum of the irradiation light amounts from the first optical path D and the second optical path d is also small, so that uneven illumination is difficult to perceive.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">That is, light in the first optical path D having a larger irradiation light amount is diffused by the light diffusing portion <b>70</b>, and the diffused light in the first optical path D is caused to be incident on the document MS. Therefore the uneven illumination is reduced and the bright spots of the LEDs <b>76</b> are not reflected by the document MS.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Also, since light in the second optical path d having a smaller irradiation light amount causes little uneven illumination, a light diffusing portion is not provided in the second optical path d. Therefore, wasteful light loss is not increased.</p>

<p id="p-0178" num="0177">In such a configuration as well, light in the first optical path D can be diffused by the light diffusing portion <b>70</b> in the inner flat face of the direct emitting portion, thereby reducing uneven illumination.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">Also, when compared with the light diffusing portion <b>70</b> provided in the outer face (convex face) of the direct emitting portion <b>77</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the light diffusing portion <b>70</b> of this modified example is provided in a position that is close to the LEDs <b>76</b> and far from the document MS. Therefore, when compared with light in the first optical path D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, light in the first optical path D that has passed through the light diffusing portion <b>70</b> is diffused over a wider area and incident on the document MS.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">In contrast, the light diffusing portion <b>70</b> provided on the outer face (convex face) of the direct emitting portion <b>77</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is provided in a position that is close to the document MS and far from the LEDs <b>76</b>. Therefore, when compared with light in the first optical path D of this modified example, light in the first optical path D that has passed through the light diffusing portion <b>70</b> is incident on the document MS before being diffused over a wider area.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Consequently, it is possible to set the extent of diffusion of light incident on the document MS by adjusting the position of the light diffusing portion <b>70</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0183" num="0182">In such a configuration, taking the optical path from the LED array <b>71</b> via the direct emitting portion <b>77</b> to the illumination range k as a first optical path D, the first optical path D is the shortest straight optical path from the LED array <b>71</b> to the illumination range k.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">In addition, the light emitted from the LED array <b>71</b> is incident on the first reflecting face <b>73</b><i>a </i>of the light-reflecting plate <b>73</b>, is reflected by it, and then incident on the illumination range k. Taking the optical path from the LED array <b>71</b> via the first reflecting face <b>73</b><i>a </i>to the illumination range k as a second optical path d, the second optical path d is an optical path that is bent at the first reflecting face <b>73</b><i>a </i>and longer than the first optical path D.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">Furthermore, light emitted from the LED array <b>71</b> is incident on the second reflecting face <b>73</b><i>b </i>of the light-reflecting plate <b>73</b>, is reflected by it, and then is incident on the illumination range ks whose position is 5 mm higher than the surface of the platen glass <b>44</b> and the document-reading glass <b>65</b>. Taking the optical path from the LED array <b>71</b> via the second reflecting face <b>73</b><i>b </i>to the illumination range k as an auxiliary optical path ds, the auxiliary optical path ds is also an optical path that is bent at the second reflecting face <b>73</b><i>b </i>and longer than the first optical path D.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">As the area of the inner flat face of the direct emitting portion <b>77</b> increases, the irradiation light amount from the first optical path D increases. Therefore the ratio between the irradiation light amount from the second optical path d and the irradiation light amount from the first optical path D is set to approximately 4.5:5.5 by appropriately adjusting and setting the area of the direct emitting portion <b>77</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">Consequently, illumination via the first optical path D generates a large irradiation light amount, and thus the bright spots of the LEDs <b>76</b> are readily reflected by the document MS, thereby aggravating uneven illumination.

<p id="p-0218" num="0217">The illuminating device <b>51</b>F is used mounted on the first scanning unit <b>45</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, similarly to the illuminating device <b>51</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and includes a first LED array <b>91</b>, a second LED array <b>92</b>, substrates <b>95</b> and <b>96</b> on which the first and the second LED arrays <b>91</b> and <b>92</b> are respectively mounted, and a light diffusing portion <b>93</b>. That is, the illuminating device <b>51</b>F includes two lines of light-emitting elements (the first and the second LED arrays <b>91</b> and <b>92</b>), each line including a plurality of light-emitting elements arranged in a line.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">Here, the substrates <b>95</b> and <b>96</b> are provided inclined in order to direct the light-emitting direction of the first and the second LED arrays <b>91</b> and <b>92</b> on the substrates <b>95</b> and <b>96</b> toward the illumination range k on the surface of the platen glass <b>44</b> and the document-reading glass <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">The light diffusing portion <b>93</b> is formed by, for example, processing the surface of a light-transmissive plate (light-transmitting member) <b>94</b> made of a glass plate, resin plate or the like having light transmission properties. This processing is performed by forming an asperity in a portion on the inner side of the mold corresponding to the surface of the light-transmissive plate <b>94</b>, or applying a coat of paint having light dispersion properties to the surface of the light-transmissive plate <b>94</b>. Alternatively, particles having light dispersion properties may be dispersed in the light-transmissive plate <b>94</b>, thereby forming the entire light-transmissive plate <b>94</b> as the light diffusing portion <b>93</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">In this illuminating device <b>51</b>F, an optical path from the LED array <b>91</b> on the left side to illumination range k (document MS) is taken as a first optical path D, and an optical path from the LED array <b>92</b> on the right side to the document MS is taken as a second optical path d. Then, the irradiation light amount from the first optical path D is set to be larger than the irradiation light amount from the second optical path d.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">For example, the emitted light amounts of the first and the second LED arrays <b>91</b> and <b>92</b> are set to be equal, the distance of the first optical path D is set to be shorter than that of the second optical path d, and the irradiation light amount from the first optical path D is set to be larger than the irradiation light amount from the second optical path d.

Alternatively, while the distance of the first optical path D is set to be longer than that of the second optical path d, the emitted light amount of the first LED array <b>91</b> is set to be significantly larger that the emitted light amount of the second LED array <b>92</b>, so as to set the irradiation light amount from the first optical path D to be larger than the irradiation light amount from the second optical path d.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">As a result of the irradiation light amount irradiated on the document MS via the first optical path D being set to be larger than the irradiation light amount irradiated on the document MS via the second optical path d in this manner, the irradiation light amount from the first optical path D greatly fluctuates if light in the first optical path D is not diffused, and thus uneven illumination is readily perceived. Also, even though light in the second optical path d is not diffused, the fluctuation of the irradiation light amount can be made small by setting the irradiation light amount from the second optical path d to be appropriately small, and thus it is possible to make the uneven illumination hard to perceive.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">In the illuminating device <b>51</b>F, the light diffusing portion <b>93</b> is provided between the first LED array <b>91</b> on the left side and the document MS, that is, in the first optical path D, and therefore light in the first optical path D having a larger irradiation light amount is diffused by the light diffusing portion <b>93</b>, thereby enabling to sufficiently suppress uneven illumination due to light irradiated from the first optical path D. Also, since the light diffusing portion is not provided in the second optical path d having a smaller irradiation light amount, wasteful light loss is not increased.</p>

<p id="p-0228" num="0227">The method of setting the irradiation light amount from the first optical path D to be larger than the irradiation light amount from the second optical path d is the same as that of the illuminating device <b>51</b>F of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0231" num="0230">Note that in the foregoing embodiments, although in the LED array <b>71</b>, a plurality of the LEDs <b>76</b> are arranged in a single line in the main scanning direction X, there is no limitation to this.
