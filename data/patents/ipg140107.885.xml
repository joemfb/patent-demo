<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Reference will now be made in detail to the presently preferred embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present inventive concept relates to a method and apparatus to conveniently combine a mint dispenser (either liquid or solid) with a toothpick so that a user can both use the toothpick as well as eat mints (or drink liquid mint or other liquid). The dispenser can be disposable. The inventive concept described herein can also be used as a pipette which can be used to dispense medicine.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a front view of a combination toothpick and mint dispenser, according to an embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A combination toothpick and mint dispenser <b>100</b> has a narrow toothpick tip <b>105</b> which can be used as a toothpick. The dispenser <b>100</b> can be made entirely of plastic. The dispenser <b>100</b> has a chamber <b>101</b> to store the mints (liquid or solid) and a lid <b>102</b> which can seal the chamber <b>101</b> thereby protecting the contents inside. An opening <b>103</b> on top of the chamber <b>101</b> allows the contents (mints) to be poured outside of the chamber (or sucked) into a user's mouth. When the lid <b>102</b> is secured onto the chamber <b>101</b> the contents of the chamber should be airtight. A fin <b>104</b> is used to allow the user to easily grip and open the lid <b>102</b> using the user's tongue, fingers, or teeth. A hinge <b>107</b> allows the lid <b>102</b> to open and close (when closed the lid <b>102</b> fits onto the opening <b>103</b>). A shaft <b>106</b> runs from the chamber <b>101</b> to the toothpick tip <b>105</b>. The shaft <b>106</b> can be solid for when solid mints are stored inside the chamber <b>211</b> and are removed by opening the lid <b>200</b>. Alternatively, the shaft <b>106</b> can also be hollow, for when liquid is stored in the chamber <b>211</b> and can be sucked through the shaft <b>203</b> and out through a bottom of the shaft. In the latter embodiment, the toothpick tip <b>105</b> can be broken off by the user to expose the shaft <b>106</b> (in this case hollow) so the liquid can be sucked out.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A lid <b>200</b> is adapted to snap fit to seal the chamber <b>211</b> thereby seal the contents thereof. A neck <b>201</b> connects (attaches) the lid <b>200</b> to the dispenser <b>202</b>. A shaft <b>203</b> is in the center of the chamber <b>211</b>. An inner indent <b>204</b> and an outer indent <b>205</b> are molded on the lid <b>200</b> and are adapted to snap (friction) fit onto a chamber perimeter <b>206</b>. A lid gap <b>209</b> is a gap between the inner indent <b>204</b> and the outer indent <b>205</b> and is adapted to receive the perimeter <b>206</b>. Outer fins <b>207</b> are located on the outer indent <b>205</b> and inner fins <b>208</b> are located on the inner indent <b>204</b> which are adapted to snap onto perimeter fins <b>210</b> on the perimeter <b>206</b>. The outer fins <b>207</b> provide a greater surface area and should typically make it easier for a user to open the lid <b>200</b> by grabbing onto the outer fins <b>207</b> with the user's fingers, tongue, teeth, etc. With the lid <b>200</b> open, the chamber <b>211</b> is exposed to the air thereby allowing the contents therein to be removed.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, a distance between a center of the shaft <b>203</b> and a center of the lid <b>300</b> is 0.45 inches and a radius of the outer indent of the lid is 0.175 inches. It is noted that all measurements described herein merely reflect one embodiment, but the inventive concepts described herein can be constructed using other measurements as well. The measurements used herein are merely one example. All measurements herein are shown in inches.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a side view of a closed combination toothpick and mint dispenser with solid mints, according to an embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Mints <b>400</b> (also known as refreshments) are shown in a chamber and can be removed by opening a lid on top of the dispenser (the lid being described herein). The shaft in this embodiment would typically be solid, although in another embodiment the shaft can be hollow although the mints would typically be too large to suck through the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a side view of a closed combination toothpick and mint dispenser with liquid mint, according to an embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Liquid refreshment <b>401</b> (mouthwash, medicine, liquor, etc.) is located in the chamber. The liquid used herein can also be medicine (e.g., antibiotic, cough medicine, etc.) There are numerous possible embodiments for use with liquid refreshment. A lid (as described herein) can be used, which can be opened and the liquid can be sucked out directly from the chamber (without going through the shaft). Alternatively, no lid can be present (the chamber is molded closed) and the only way to access the liquid <b>401</b> would be for the user to suck it out of the shaft (this will be discussed below in more detail). Alternatively, a lid (as described herein) can be used in combination with a hollow shaft (as described herein), and the user can choose whether to open the lid and remove the liquid that way or to leave the lid shut and suck the liquid out of the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">While the liquid refreshment <b>401</b> may possibly seep down the shaft (even when the bottom of the shaft is sealed), the viscosity of the liquid refreshment may prevent the liquid refreshment <b>401</b> from falling down into the shaft until a user intentionally breaks a seal on a bottom of the shaft and sucks the liquid refreshment <b>401</b> out through an opening on the bottom of the shaft (the opening passing through the length of the shaft making the shaft hollow like a straw). Alternatively, a chamber membrane can be used to prevent the liquid refreshment <b>401</b> from falling down into the shaft (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A</figref>, <b>7</b>B and their respective descriptions).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The term &#x201c;refreshment&#x201d; can refer to either solid mint(s) or any suitable liquid. The bottom of the shaft in both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> can typically have a pointed end (a toothpick). The toothpick can be made of plastic or alternatively a wooden toothpick can be used which can be inserted into an opening at a bottom of the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a front view of a combination toothpick and mint dispenser with a bottom opening, according to an embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A hollow shaft <b>501</b> is used so that a user can suck out contents of the chamber (typically liquid) through the shaft <b>501</b> and out a bottom opening in the shaft <b>501</b> (the top being the lid). Toothpick tip <b>500</b> can be intentionally broken off a bottom of the shaft <b>501</b> by the user, thereby exposing the hollow shaft <b>501</b> and allowing the user to suck out the liquid from the chamber through the bottom of the shaft. While an opened lid is shown in this Figure, in the embodiment with a hollow shaft so that the liquid can be sucked out the shaft, an openable lid can be optional (alternatively a top of the chamber can be permanently sealed or molded shut).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a side view of a combination toothpick and mint dispenser with a bottom opening, according to an embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a further embodiment, contents of in the chamber can be sucked through a hollow shaft <b>600</b> and out an opening in a bottom of the hollow shaft <b>600</b>. A removable shaft plug <b>601</b> is physically narrower than the dimensions of a bottom of the hollow shaft <b>600</b> so that the shaft plug <b>601</b> can be removed from the hollow shaft <b>600</b> simply by a user removing it with his or her fingers. The shaft plug <b>601</b> can also serve as a toothpick (either while attached to the shaft <b>600</b> or after being removed from the shaft <b>600</b>). Once the shaft plug <b>601</b> is removed, liquid from the chamber can then be sucked out of the opening in the bottom of the hollow shaft <b>600</b>. In this embodiment, the chamber can be molded closed (sealed) without an openable lid (since the liquid should be sucked out the shaft <b>600</b>), although in an alternate embodiment a lid (as described herein) can be used giving the user the option of whether to remove the liquid by opening the lid or sucking it out of the shaft <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> is a side view of a combination toothpick and dispenser with a chamber membrane and edible tip, according to an embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A chamber membrane <b>700</b> can be used to separate the liquid (not pictured in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>) in the chamber from the shaft so that the liquid is prevented from seeping into and down the shaft. The chamber membrane <b>700</b> can be made from an easily breakable material, such as a thin layer of plastic or rubber. A user can eat (for break) off an edible tip <b>703</b> which can be made of any edible material such as chocolate, wax, etc., thereby exposing the hollow shaft. The user can then suck air out of the shaft which will then cause the chamber membrane <b>700</b> to break, thereby causing the liquid (not pictured in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>) to flow into the shaft. The user can continue to suck the shaft which causes the liquid to flow through the shaft and out of an end of the shaft and thus into the user's mouth.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Note that the lid is open in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, this is because without a flow of air into the chamber, it may be difficult or impossible to suck the liquid out of the chamber and through the shaft. Thus, the user should typically position the lid (which can be in both an open and a closed position) into the open position when the user wishes to suck the liquid out of the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> is a side view of a combination toothpick and dispenser with a hydrophobic membrane, broken chamber membrane, and liquid, according to an embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Instead of the lid, a hydrophobic membrane <b>701</b> (for example polytetrafluoroethylene or GE Nylon) can be used to cover the top of the chamber. The hydrophobic membrane can be a permeable membrane of that type that can let air into the chamber while preventing the liquid <b>702</b> in the chamber from passing through the hydrophobic membrane (even when the liquid is positioned directly adjacent to the hydrophobic membrane). Using the hydrophobic membrane obviates the need for the user to physically open a lid on the chamber (thus in this embodiment, no lid would be needed or used on the chamber), as air can pass from outside the chamber through the hydrophobic membrane into the chamber thereby preventing a vacuum condition from existing inside the chamber which would prevent the liquid from exiting through the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> shows the combination toothpick and dispenser with the edible tip <b>703</b> broken off and a broken chamber membrane <b>700</b> (not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> because it is covered by liquid <b>702</b>). The chamber membrane <b>700</b> may break automatically upon breaking off of the edible tip <b>703</b> or may require more force such as a sucking force by the user from the end <b>704</b> of the tip in order to break the chamber membrane. The liquid <b>702</b> can then flow through the shaft (either freely or by force of sucking from the end <b>704</b>) and out the end <b>704</b> and into the user's mouth.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It is noted that all features described herein can be combined with one-another to create embodiments using any combination of the features described herein. It is further noted that the devices described herein can be entirely made of plastic or other suitable material and such devices can be made using known manufacturing processes such as injection molding.</p>
