<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention is in the field of capacitive sensing devices and, in particular, touch screens.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Computing devices, such as notebook computers, mobile communication devices, and portable entertainment devices (such as handheld video game devices, multimedia players, and the like) have user-interface devices that facilitate interaction between the user and the computing device. One type of user-interface device that has become common is a touch-sensor pad (also known as a &#x201c;touchpad&#x201d;). A touchpad replicates mouse X/Y movement by using two defined axes, which contain a collection of sensor elements that detect the position of a conductive object such as a finger. Mouse right/left button clicks can be replicated by electromechanical switches, located in the vicinity of the touchpad, or by tapping commands on the touchpad itself. The touchpad provides a user-interface device for performing such functions as positioning a cursor and selecting an item on a display.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One type of touchpad operates by way of capacitance sensing utilizing capacitance sensors. The capacitance detected by a capacitance sensor changes as a function of the proximity of a conductive object to the sensor. The conductive object can be, for example, a stylus or a user's finger. In a touch-sensor device, a change in capacitance detected by each sensor in the X and Y dimensions of the sensor array, due to the proximity or movement of a conductive object, can be measured by a variety of methods, such as with self-capacitance or mutual-capacitance sensing techniques. Regardless of the method, usually an electrical signal representative of the capacitance detected by each capacitance sensor is processed by a processing device, which in turn converts these electrical signals into numeric values representative of the position of the conductive object in relation to the touch-sensor pad in the X and Y dimensions. A transparent touch screen, touch-sensor strip, slider, or button operates on the same capacitance-sensing principle.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A touch screen is described herein. The touch screen is configured to have an array of conductive, optically transmissive sensor elements coupled to sensor circuitry. The sensor elements are disposed over a display to have a single layer of conductive, optically transmissive material positioned over substantially all of the pixels of the display to provide a more consistent light path for the entire display. The array of sensor elements may be configured with at least a sensor row axis and a sensor column axis, both axes rotated or skewed from a pixel row axis and pixel column axis of the display.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth, such as specific sensor element shapes, in order to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that embodiments of the present invention may be practiced without adhering to these specific details. In other instances, well-known aspects of capacitance sensor array assembly, such as layer lamination operations and capacitance sensing circuitry topologies, are not described in detail in order to not unnecessarily obscure embodiments of the present invention. Furthermore, it is to be understood that the various embodiments shown in the figures are illustrative representations and are not necessarily drawn to scale.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The appearances of the phrase &#x201c;in an embodiment&#x201d; in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily referring to the same embodiment of the invention. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, materials, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. It should also be understood that specific embodiments may be combined where not mutually exclusive.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The terms &#x201c;over,&#x201d; &#x201c;under,&#x201d; &#x201c;between,&#x201d; and &#x201c;on&#x201d; as used herein refer to a relative position of one member with respect to other members. As such, for example, one member disposed over or under another member may be directly in contact with the other member or may have one or more intervening members. Moreover, one member disposed between members may be directly in contact with the two members or may have one or more intervening members. In contrast, a first member &#x201c;on&#x201d; a second member is in contact with that second member. Additionally, the relative position of one member with respect to other members is provided assuming operations are performed relative to a substrate without consideration of the absolute orientation of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an embodiment, a touch screen includes capacitance sensor elements disposed over a display such that a single layer of optically transmissive conductive material is positioned over substantially all of the pixels of the display. This may provide a consistent light path for an entire display screen or provide a single light path, for uniform transmission, across the entire display screen. Artifacts resulting from multiple light paths with multiple levels of attenuation, variations in refractive index, etc. may be greatly reduced or even eliminated. The single layer of optically transmissive conductive material may eliminate difficult alignment operations typical for touch screen assemblies including multiple sensor layers.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A plan view of an exemplary capacitance sensor array <b>100</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A first substrate contains the column sensor elements <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> electrically coupled to each other by a column interconnect <b>117</b> and further coupled to a column I/O <b>115</b> to form a column oriented along the Y-axis. This first substrate is aligned to a second substrate containing row sensor elements <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> electrically coupled to each other by a row interconnect <b>107</b> and further coupled to a row I/O <b>110</b> to form a row oriented along the X-axis. The aligned substrates may be bonded to one another by an insulator on the order of 200 micrometer (&#x3bc;m) thick, to form a laminate. It should be noted that in the field of capacitive touch screens, the term &#x201c;layer&#x201d; is generally used to refer to a side of a non-conductive substrate upon which transparent conductive material is disposed. As depicted, the primary sensor elements are rhombus shaped and overlap only at the vertices along a row or column to limit the parasitic capacitance (C<sub>p</sub>) caused by the overlap of the first and second layer.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an embodiment, the capacitance sensor array <b>100</b> is rotated in the directions indicated by the arrows depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, so that the row and column axes of the array are skewed from the pixel row and pixel column axes of a display. For example, the nominally orthogonal row and column axes of the sensor array may be rotated by an amount less than 90 degrees so as to orient an edge of the capacitance sensor to be substantially parallel with the edges of pixels (or subpixels) rather than coincident with the columns and rows of pixels creating the display.

<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts an expanded view of a portion <b>150</b> of the capacitance sensor array <b>100</b> overlaying RGB pixels <b>160</b> of a liquid crystal display (LCD). To form a projected capacitance touch screen, a capacitance sensor array is positioned over a display. While the capacitance sensor array for touch screens is generally made of a non-opaque conductive material, the conductive material may not be completely transparent and different combinations of material in the light path may cause image artifacts across the viewable area of the display screen, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In an embodiment, the row corresponding to sensor elements <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, row I/O <b>110</b> and row interconnect <b>107</b> is to be skewed by a rotation angle with respect to the X-axis of the display (i.e., display horizontal row dimension) while the column corresponding to the sensor elements <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> and column interconnect <b>117</b> is to be skewed with respect to the Y-axis of the display (i.e., display vertical column dimension). Therefore, with rhombus shaped sensor elements as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the edges having lengths L<sub>1 </sub>and L<sub>2 </sub>of sensor element <b>106</b> are to be oriented in directions parallel to the display vertical and horizontal rather than extending &#x3b8; (&#x2212;&#x3b8;) off the display horizontal.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a further embodiment, in a touch screen, a capacitance sensor array is oriented to a display so that the spaces between adjacent sensor elements are disposed between, but not overlapping, the light emitting portions of pixels (or subpixels) of the display. In one implementation, the sensor elements have dimensions that are a multiple of the pixel-pitch of the display. In a further embodiment, a space between an edge of a first sensor element in a row dimension of the array, and adjacent to an edge of a second sensor element in a column dimension of the array, has a width less than or equal to a pixel-mask width of the display. Such dimensions may be achieved by utilizing a single layer of conductive material (i.e., a single-substrate process). In one particular implementation, all the sensor elements are coupled together to form a plurality of rows disposed along one axis and a plurality of columns disposed along a second axis where the number of sensor elements in each row or column are not uniform.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Other embodiments include a method implemented by a computer, microcontroller, microprocessor, or similar for determining a location of a touch on a touch screen by performing a rotational transform of one or more coordinates of a capacitance sensor array representing a location of a sensed touch. The rotational transform may be based on the orientation of the display screen relative to the orientation of the capacitance sensor array to determine one or more coordinates of the display screen corresponding to the sensed touch, as discussed in further detail elsewhere herein.</p>

Using a single layer of transmissive conductive material (e.g., ITO) may allow a reduction in the various dimensions and tolerances of the sensor array. Use of a single layer of transmissive conductive material for each sensor of the sensor array may also avoid a potential non-uniformity between transparent conductive coatings applied to a first and second substrate which might lead to a difference in light transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, a plurality of capacitance sensor elements is configured into a sensor array <b>300</b>. Sensor array <b>300</b> is two-dimensional, but one-dimensional arrays, as well as n-dimensional arrays having more than two dimensions are other embodiments. The sensor array layer may be contained on a substrate, such as substrate <b>301</b>. The substrate <b>301</b> may be any optically transmissive and insulative substrate, such as but not limited to, quartz, sapphire, glass, plastic and polymer/resins.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an embodiment, individual sensor elements, such as sensor elements <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>316</b> and <b>318</b> are configured as polygons of an optically transmissive conductive material. Any material known to be transmissive over at least a portion of the wavelength band emitted by the display to be paired with the sensor array <b>300</b> may be employed for the sensor elements. In one embodiment, individual sensor elements are formed of an optically transmissive conductive material, such as, but not limited to indium tin oxide (ITO), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS), carbon nanotubes, conductive ink, graphite/graphene and the like. In a further embodiment, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, all sensor elements of a sensor array are formed of a same layer of optically transmissive conductive material. Using a single layer of ITO, for example, may allow the various dimensions and tolerances of the sensor array to be more readily achieved with existing manufacturing equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Sensor elements of a sensor array may be coupled into either a row or a column by an interconnect, such as column interconnect <b>307</b> or row interconnect <b>317</b> in sensor array <b>300</b>. The dashed lines depicted to be coincident with interconnects of the rows (e.g., <b>307</b>) designate a row pitch, P<sub>row</sub>. Similarly, dashed lines depicted coincident with interconnects of the column (e.g., <b>317</b>) designate a column pitch, P<sub>col</sub>. In particular embodiments, P<sub>row </sub>and P<sub>col </sub>are nominally 5 mm to ensure reasonable centroid calculation from a touch sensed by self- or mutual-capacitance.

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">While the row pitch and column pitch of the sensors may be on the order of millimeters, the spacing between nearest neighbor sensor elements may be significantly smaller. In a particular embodiment, the spacing, S<sub>2</sub>, between nearest neighbor sensor elements is less than or equal to a pixel-mask width of a display with which the substrate <b>301</b> is to be paired to form a projected capacitance touch screen, as discussed further elsewhere herein.

As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, a same layer(s) of transmissive conductive material forms all of the capacitance sensor elements of the array. For example, sensor elements <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>316</b> and <b>318</b> are depicted as a same layer of material. Row interconnect <b>317</b>, as depicted, may be of the same layer of transmissive conductive material (e.g., indium tin oxide (ITO), conductive ink, or graphite) as that employed for the sensor elements <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>316</b> and <b>318</b>. Column interconnect <b>307</b>, disposed over the row interconnect <b>317</b> is made of a second layer of conductive material, separated from row interconnect <b>317</b> by an insulative spacer <b>350</b>. The second layer of conductive material providing the column interconnect <b>307</b> may be coupled directly to the sensor elements <b>306</b> and <b>308</b> with vias <b>309</b> extending through the insulative spacer <b>350</b>. In particular embodiments, row interconnect <b>317</b> is of a second optically transmissive conductive material, such as ITO formed over the first layer. In alternate embodiments however, row interconnect <b>317</b> and column interconnect <b>307</b> may be of an optically opaque conductive material, such as, but not limited to, carbon, polysilicon, aluminum, gold, silver, titanium, tungsten, tantalum, indium, tin, or copper. As discussed in further detail elsewhere herein, the presence of optically opaque interconnect may nonetheless induce few, if any, visible artifacts in the touch screen. Insulative spacer <b>350</b> may be any optically transparent insulator, such as, but not limited to silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, polymers, and the like. In one embodiment, the thickness of insulative spacer <b>350</b> is approximately 50 nanometer (nm) thick.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A single layer sensor array, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, can be challenging to utilize for capacitance sensing because the insulative spacer <b>350</b> is so thin. Because capacitance is inversely proportional to the spacing between plates of the capacitor, reducing the thickness of the insulative spacer between overlapping interconnects from a typical laminate thickness of 200 &#x3bc;m to the exemplary 50 nm insulative spacer <b>350</b> would increase C<sub>p </sub>by a factor of approximately 4000. However, the single layer pattern depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> may be employed for capacitance sensing arrays in those embodiments where the spacing, S<sub>2</sub>, between the sensor elements is much smaller than typical laminated structures.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Because alignment issues associated with the lamination process may be avoided when a single layer is utilized for all sensor elements, the spacing, S<sub>2</sub>, may be greatly reduced. As the sensor element spacing, S<sub>2</sub>, decreases, the size of the interconnects <b>307</b> and <b>317</b> decrease and therefore the area where column interconnect <b>307</b> overlaps row interconnect <b>317</b> (i.e., the &#x201c;crossover&#x201d; area) also decreases. The area reduction, depending on magnitude, may compensate for the capacitance increase caused by the thin insulative spacer <b>350</b> relative to a thick lamination. In this manner, C<sub>p </sub>can be made small enough for self- or mutual-capacitance sensing. For this reason it may be advantageous to make the widths of the interconnects <b>307</b> and <b>317</b> as narrow as practical, so that it is all the more advantageous to utilize a material having a lower resistance than typical optically transmissive conductors, like ITO, for at least the column interconnect <b>307</b>. In one exemplary embodiment, where the spacing S<sub>2 </sub>(d) is approximately 10 &#x3bc;m, the area (A) where column interconnect <b>307</b> overlaps row interconnect <b>317</b> becomes approximately 0.0002 mm<sup>2 </sup>and the dielectric constant of the insulative spacer <b>350</b> may be approximate 4.5 (e.g., silicon dioxide). Neglecting fringing capacitance, C<sub>p </sub>for each crossover of a sensor array may be then approximated by the parallel plate relationship:</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The sensor elements of the array may be configured such that the number of sensor elements along an X-axis substantially parallel with a width dimension of the substrate containing the array remains constant across a Y-axis, extending along a height dimension of the substrate. An exemplary embodiment of such a configuration is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. The row axis, being defined by sensors which are electrically coupled, is rotated from the X-axis, defined to be parallel the length of the substrate <b>301</b>. The column axis, substantially orthogonal to the row axis, is similarly rotated away from the height dimension of substrate <b>301</b> oriented parallel to the Y-axis, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. With such an orientation of the sensor elements with respect to the substrate <b>301</b>, the number of sensor elements in a sensor column differs between sensor columns (i.e., the columns are of varying lengths). For example, one column including sensor elements <b>306</b> and <b>308</b> is coupled to a column I/O <b>310</b>. The column I/O <b>310</b> is therefore coupled to a column with a two-sensor length. Another column, coupled to a column I/O <b>305</b>, has a length of four sensors. Similarly, the number of sensor elements in a sensor row may differ between sensor rows (i.e., the rows are of varying lengths). Indeed, certain rows or columns may have a length of one sensor (e.g., a single sensor is coupled to a signal I/O routed to sensing circuitry). In the particular embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, both the columns and rows are variable lengths to accommodate the depicted orientation of sensor elements and consistency in the number of sensor elements with respect to the X- and Y-axes of the substrate <b>301</b>. As discussed in further detail elsewhere herein, the column and row I/O extending from the rotated column and row axes of the array, respectively, are coupled to one or more drive and/or sense circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In particular embodiments, each sensor element of the two-dimensional sensor array <b>300</b> is patterned into a polygon where at least one edge of the polygon is substantially parallel to a width or height of the substrate <b>301</b>. In one such embodiment, the polygon is a rhombus. In another embodiment, the polygon is four sided with orthogonal sides, so that all edges of the polygon are parallel to either the width or height of the substrate <b>301</b>. For example, the polygons may be squares, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, or may be rectangles, depending on the edge dimensions selected (e.g., lengths L<sub>2 </sub>and L<sub>1 </sub>of capacitance sensor element <b>318</b>). In a specific embodiment, individual sensor elements are sized based on the pixel-pitch of a display with which the sensor array <b>300</b> is to be paired, as discussed in further detail elsewhere herein. In one embodiment, the polygon side lengths L<sub>1 </sub>and L<sub>2 </sub>are both equal to a multiple of the pixel- or subpixel-pitch. These lengths may therefore vary considerably as a matter of design choice. However, in one exemplary embodiment, the lengths L<sub>1 </sub>and L<sub>2 </sub>are both equal to 54 times the pixel-pitch to span approximately 54 pixels between opposite edges of sensor element <b>318</b>. Depending on the resolution of a display and the desired sensor size, a sensor element may, for example, have a side length (L<sub>1 </sub>or L<sub>2</sub>) between about 1 mm and approximately 7 mm, but these lengths may also be outside this range in other embodiments. In still further embodiments, the sensor elements at the perimeter edge of the array, such as capacitance sensor elements <b>308</b>, <b>318</b> and <b>306</b>, are a polygon of the same number of sides as a sensor element within the interior of the array, such as sensor element <b>316</b>. This is in contrast to an array where perimeter sensor elements are truncated to be parallel to an edge of a substrate in a manner which reduces the number of sides and surface area of the sensor element.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts an expanded view of a portion <b>400</b> of sensor array <b>300</b> overlaying pixels <b>460</b> of a display. Pixels <b>460</b> may be of any display technology having pixels, such as a plasma display, a cathode ray tube (CRT) or LCD. In the particular embodiment depicted, pixels <b>460</b> are RGB pixels of an LCD. As depicted, pixels <b>460</b> each have a border and may further have a sub-pixel border. Between the pixels is a dark space, which is a result of the pixel-mask. The dark space has a dimension, S<sub>3</sub>, equal to the pixel-mask width. Depending on the resolution and technology of the display, pixels <b>460</b> have a particular pixel-pitch and pixel mask width, S<sub>3</sub>. Also dependent on the technology of the display, pixels <b>460</b> have a particular height <b>455</b> and width (which may be a function of the sub-pixel width <b>456</b>), defining the particular shape of a pixel and/or sub-pixel border. LCD structures may use a mix of pixel elements, such as squares, rectangles, stripes, etc. As a color pixel, these may exist as groups of three (RGB), four (RGBW) or other combinations of sub-pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In particular embodiments, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the edges of substantially all the sensor elements in the sensor array are aligned coincident with a pixel-mask so each sensor element edge (i.e., side) is substantially parallel with borders of pixels <b>460</b> (or sub-pixel borders) of the display that is paired with the two-dimensional sensor array <b>300</b>. In further embodiments, the sensor array spacing S<sub>2 </sub>is made to be less than or equal to the pixel-mask width S<sub>3</sub>. In this manner, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, sensor elements <b>308</b>, <b>318</b>, <b>316</b> and <b>306</b> form a single layer of transmissive conductive material over pixels <b>460</b> of the display. The spaces between the individual sensor elements then fall within the dark space of the pixel-mask width S<sub>3</sub>, between pixels, and do not overlap the light emitting portion of any pixels. This ensures light from every pixel in the display travels through a uniform light path, including a single layer of optically transmissive conductive material. The uniform light path so provided may greatly reduce or eliminate artifacts associated with multiple light paths (i.e., having differing amounts of conductive material to pass through). Because the light from every pixel of the display passes through a single layer of conductive material, the attenuation of pixel light may be significantly less than for configurations where optical paths are through a plurality of conductive material layers.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, because the sensor elements <b>308</b>, <b>318</b>, <b>316</b> and <b>306</b> are aligned with the length and height dimensions of the substrate <b>301</b> (with the sensor rows and columns rotated), the substrate <b>301</b> may merely be cut to the dimensions of the display and the X and Y axes corresponding to the width and height of the substrate may then be aligned with the X and Y axes corresponding to the columns and rows of the pixels of the display. For embodiments where the sensor elements have dimensions L<sub>1 </sub>and L<sub>2 </sub>matched to the pixel-pitch of the display, alignment of the substrate <b>301</b> places all sensor elements <b>308</b>, <b>318</b>, <b>316</b> and <b>306</b> in proper position to be disposed above every pixel of the display occupying the same display area as the sensor elements. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, such an alignment places the rectangular sensor elements <b>308</b>, <b>318</b>, <b>316</b> and <b>306</b> coincident with, or parallel to, the pixel mask or pixel/sub-pixel borders. Because the rows and columns of the sensor array are rotated relative to the length and height dimensions of substrate <b>301</b>, when assembled, the sensor row axis is also non-parallel with the pixel row axis of the display. Similarly the sensor column axis is non-parallel with the pixel column axis of the display.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In an alternate embodiment, the substrate <b>301</b> containing the matrix of capacitance touch sensor elements <b>300</b> may be the upper substrate of the LCD itself, whereupon the pixel mask and front electrode of the LCD are actually deposited on the opposite side of the substrate <b>301</b>. Since the pixel mask and sensor elements are deposited or otherwise formed on the same base substrate, they may share common references and fiducial marks to ensure alignment between the pixel mask borders and the locations of the sensor elements. Such patterning onto a common substrate eliminates an alignment step in a manufacturing process wherein a separate substrate <b>301</b> would be positioned above the pixels of the associated LCD or other display.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As further depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the crossover of column interconnect <b>307</b> over row interconnect <b>317</b> is substantially between pixels (or sub-pixels), in the dark space of the pixel-mask. As such, whether column interconnect <b>307</b> and row interconnect <b>317</b> are of optically transmissive material or of opaque material may be of little consequence to the display quality. Thus, in particular embodiments, at least one interconnect layer, such as column interconnect <b>307</b>, is of an optically opaque conductive material. A conductive material free from transparency constraints may be easier to form on the single optically transmissive conductive layer (e.g., in a single substrate process), relatively cheaper to form, and better performing (e.g., lower resistance) than optically transmissive materials.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A touch screen may further include a number of additional layers or substrates beyond the display layer and the sensor array layer depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. For example, a touch screen may further include any mix of glass, polymer, and polarizer layers over the display layer and/or the sensor array layer and may further include circuitry layers containing drive circuitry, sensing circuitry and various other signal filtering, conditioning, multiplexing and demultiplexing circuitry. Alternatively, any such circuitry may be contained in or mounted on the sensor array layer, as a design choice. A touch screen may further include a protective cover sheet, which may be coated to provide a low friction and scratch preventive surface. A touch screen may further include a variety of adhesive layers to bond functional layers into a strong laminate. The adhesive layer(s) may be optically transmissive glue having a refractive index matched to reduce the light loss and effect of topographical variations on the final image quality of the touch screen.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In another aspect of the present invention, the touch screen employing the display and sensor layers depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is operated to determine display coordinates of a touch sensed at coordinates of the capacitance sensor array. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts a Flowchart <b>500</b> representing a series of exemplary operations for performing a particular computer implemented method to determine such display coordinates.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The computer implemented method <b>500</b> begins with operation <b>510</b>, where sensor circuitry coupled to the sensor array of the touch screen via row and/or column I/O begins scanning the rows and/or columns for a change in capacitance indicative of a touch. Depending on the embodiment, the sensor array <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, when paired with a display screen, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, may be configured for self capacitance sensing or mutual capacitance sensing or any other sensing method known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Generally, for self capacitance sensing the sensor elements within each row or column are coupled together and operate as one sensor element. The columns and rows of sensor elements form a grid array with each element representing a different column, row coordinate in the sensor array coordinate space. The center of each row provides a reference location used in calculation of the Y-axis portion of a coordinate on the screen, and the center of each column provides a reference location used in calculation of the X-axis portion of the coordinate. At operation <b>510</b>, the capacitive sensing circuit monitors changes in capacitance that occur as sensed from each row and/or column I/O. Capacitance measurements may be performed by any method known in the art. For example, a sensor may be charged and then discharged to measure the charge stored on the sensor. As the capacitance increases when a finger is present, more charge can be stored by the charging process allowing more charge to be measured in the discharge process. This measurement process may be repeated for each row or column until all rows or columns are sampled, at which point the measured results are evaluated for the presence of a touch at operation <b>515</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an alternative embodiment, where the sensor array <b>300</b> is configured for mutual-capacitance sensing, either the columns or rows of sensor elements are driven by a drive circuitry while the approximately orthogonal columns or rows are coupled to a sensing circuitry. The crossover points between the rows and columns form a capacitively-coupled node having a unique column, row coordinate in the sensor array coordinate space. Each driven row or column is electrically coupled to an AC voltage source. During operation <b>510</b>, charge is driven into one driven line at a time, and through the mutual capacitance at the crossovers, some portion of the charge is passed to the sensor elements of the opposite axis where it may be measured. At operation <b>510</b>, the sensing circuit measures each sensor intersection for mutual capacitance in a manner similar to that described for self-capacitance sensing embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">At operation <b>515</b> the presence of one or more touch events is determined by comparison of the measured charge to a previously determined non-touch baseline level for each sensor or sensor intersection. For either self- or mutual-capacitance sensing, analysis of the magnitude of change in capacitance at the sensor column, row, or intersection where a capacitance change occurs, may identify one or more touch events. If no touch event is detected (<b>515</b>) and scanning remains enabled (<b>545</b>), the scan operation <b>510</b> is repeated. If a touch event is detected, processing continues at operation <b>520</b>. At operation <b>520</b>, the coordinates, in the sensor array space, of the one or more sensed touches are determined. This coordinate determination may be done by any method known in the art, for example by a centroid calculation.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">With the coordinates within the sensor array determined, the coordinates are then transformed at operation <b>525</b> into the coordinate space of the display screen for correlation with location specific interface information displayed on the display screen. In particular embodiments, operation <b>525</b> includes a rotational transform to convert each coordinate determined in the coordinate space of the sensor array to a coordinate in the display screen coordinate space. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the rows and columns of the sensor array <b>300</b> are rotated and offset relative the X-axis and Y-axis defining the width and height of the substrate <b>301</b>, respectively. Upon pairing of the substrate <b>301</b> with a display screen to have the substrate <b>301</b> X-axis aligned with pixel rows of the display and the substrate <b>301</b> Y-axis aligned with pixel columns of the display, the rows and columns of the sensor array <b>300</b> are rotated relative to the row and column coordinates of the display pixels. A rotational transform of the received coordinates (e.g., representing calculated row and column location in the sensor array) may be performed based on a relationship between the orientation of the display screen and the orientation of the capacitance sensor array to map the sensor coordinates determined to have a touch event to display coordinates. In a particular embodiment, the rotational transform is an angular math transform between the sensor array coordinate space and the display coordinate space. This transform can be very accurately applied knowing the layouts and dimensions of both the sensor array and display given the alignment tolerance between the display layer and single sensor array layer may be made very small. In particular embodiments, operation <b>525</b> may further include a scaling and offset correction of the sensor coordinate(s). With the display coordinates corresponding to one or more touch events determined by the rotational transform, the location of one or more touch events may be output at operation <b>535</b> to a downstream processing module. If scanning remains enabled, as validated by operation <b>545</b>, the panel is scanned again for touches at operation <b>510</b>.

In another embodiment, the electronic system <b>600</b> also includes non-capacitance sensor elements <b>670</b> coupled to the processing device <b>610</b> via bus <b>671</b>.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Processing device <b>610</b> may include internal oscillator/clocks <b>606</b> and communication block <b>608</b>. The oscillator/clocks block <b>606</b> provides clock signals to one or more of the components of processing device <b>610</b>. Communication block <b>608</b> may be used to communicate with an external component, such as a host processor <b>650</b>, via host interface (I/F) <b>651</b>. Alternatively, processing device <b>610</b> may also be coupled to embedded controller <b>660</b> to communicate with the external components, such as host processor <b>650</b>. Interfacing to the host processor <b>650</b> can be through various methods.

In some instances, it may be beneficial for the processing device <b>610</b> to do both touch-sensor and keyboard control operations, thereby freeing up the embedded controller <b>660</b> for other housekeeping functions. In another exemplary embodiment, interfacing is done using a universal serial bus (USB) interface directly coupled to the host processor <b>650</b> via host interface <b>651</b>. Alternatively, the processing device <b>610</b> may communicate to external components, such as the host processor <b>650</b>, using industry standard interfaces, such as USB, PS/2, inter-integrated circuit (I2C) bus, or system packet interfaces (SPI).

The standard-mouse compatible mode utilizes the HID class drivers already built into the Operating System (OS) software of host processor <b>650</b>. These drivers enable the processing device <b>610</b> and sensing device to operate as a standard pointer control user interface device, such as a two-button PS/2 mouse.

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Embodiments of the method and apparatus described herein may be implemented in a fully self-contained touch screen which outputs fully processed X/Y movement and gesture data signals or data commands to a host. The method and apparatus may also be implemented in a mode which outputs X/Y movement data and also finger presence data to a host, and where the host processes the received data to detect gestures. The method and apparatus may also be implemented in mode which outputs raw capacitance data to a host, where the host processes the capacitance data to compensate for quiescent and stray capacitance, and calculates X/Y movement and detects gestures by processing the capacitance data. Alternatively, the method and apparatus may be implemented in a mode which outputs pre-processed capacitance data to a host, where the touchpad processes the capacitance data to compensate for quiescent and stray capacitance, and the host calculates X/Y movement and detects gestures from the pre-processed capacitance data.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The electronic system that includes the embodiments described herein may be implemented in a mobile handset (e.g., cellular or mobile phone) or other electronic devices where the touch screen may operate either as a touch-sensor pad for x/y positioning and gesture recognition, or as a keypad or other arrays of touch-sensor buttons and/or sliders. Alternatively, the touch screen, although configured to operate in the two modes, may be configured to be used only as a keypad, or only as a touch-sensor. Alternatively, the electronic device may be used in other applications, such as a personal data assistant (PDA), a kiosk, a keyboard, a television, a remote control, a monitor, a handheld multi-media device, a handheld video player, a handheld gaming device, or a control panel.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Capacitance sensor <b>601</b> may be integrated into the processing device <b>610</b>, or alternatively, in a separate IC. Alternatively, descriptions of capacitance sensor <b>601</b> may be generated and compiled for incorporation into other integrated circuits. For example, behavioral level code describing capacitance sensor <b>601</b>, or portions thereof, may be generated using a hardware description language, such as VHDL or Verilog, and stored to a machine-accessible medium (e.g., Flash ROM, CD-ROM, hard disk, floppy disk, or the like). Furthermore, the behavioral level code can be compiled into register transfer level (&#x201c;RTL&#x201d;) code, a netlist, or even a circuit layout and stored to a machine-accessible medium. The behavioral level code, the RTL code, the netlist, and the circuit layout all represent various levels of abstraction to describe capacitance sensor <b>601</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In one embodiment, capacitance sensor <b>601</b> is a capacitive sense relaxation oscillator (CSR). The CSR may include a current-programmable relaxation oscillator, an analog multiplexer, digital counting functions, and high-level software routines to compensate for environmental and physical sensor element variations.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">It should be noted that there are various known methods for measuring capacitance. Although some embodiments described herein are described using a relaxation oscillator, the present embodiments are not limited to using relaxation oscillators, but may include other methods, such as current versus voltage phase shift measurement, resistor-capacitor charge timing, capacitive bridge divider, charge transfer, sigma-delta modulators, charge-accumulation circuits, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The current versus voltage phase shift measurement may include driving the capacitance through a fixed-value resistor to yield voltage and current waveforms that are out of phase by a predictable amount. The drive frequency can be adjusted to keep the phase measurement in a readily measured range. The resistor-capacitor charge timing may include charging the capacitor through a fixed resistor and measuring timing on the voltage ramp. Small capacitance values may use very large resistors for reasonable timing. The capacitive bridge divider may include driving the capacitor under test through a fixed reference capacitor. The reference capacitor and the capacitor under test form a voltage divider. The voltage signal may be recovered with a synchronous demodulator, which may be done in the processing device <b>610</b>. The charge transfer may be conceptually similar to an R-C charging circuit. In this method, C<sub>P </sub>is the capacitance being sensed. C<sub>SUM </sub>is the summing capacitor, into which charge is transferred on successive cycles. At the start of the measurement cycle, the voltage on C<sub>SUM </sub>is discharged. The voltage on C<sub>SUM </sub>increases exponentially (and only slightly) with each clock cycle. The time for this voltage to reach a specific threshold is measured with a counter.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Thus, a touch screen including sensor elements disposed over a display such that a single layer of optically transmissive conductive material is positioned over each pixel of the display has been described. Although the present disclosure has been described in language specific to structural features or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the invention defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or acts described. The specific features and acts disclosed are to be understood merely as particularly graceful implementations of the claimed invention provided in an effort to illustrate rather than limit the present disclosure.</p>
