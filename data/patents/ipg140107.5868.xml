<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to computing devices. More particularly, the present invention provides a system including a plurality of computer modules that can independently operate to provide backup capability, dual processing, and the like. Merely by way of example, the present invention is applied to a modular computing environment for desk top computers, but it will be recognized that the invention has a much wider range of applicability. It can be applied to a server as well as other portable or modular computing applications.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many desktop or personal computers, which are commonly termed PCs, have been around and used for over ten years. The PCs often come with state-of-art microprocessors such as the Intel Pentium&#x2122; microprocessor chips. They also include a hard or fixed disk drive such as memory in the giga-bit range. Additionally, the PCs often include a random access memory integrated circuit device such as a dynamic random access memory device, which is commonly termed DRAM. The DRAM devices now provide up to millions of memory cells (i.e., mega-bit) on a single slice of silicon. PCs also include a high resolution display such as cathode ray tubes or CRTs. In most cases, the CRTs are at least 15 inches or 17 inches or 20 inches in diameter. High resolution flat panel displays are also used with PCs.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many external or peripheral devices can be used with the PCs. Among others, these peripheral devices include mass storage devices such as a Zip&#x2122; Drive product sold by Iomega Corporation of Utah. Other storage devices include external hard drives, tape drives, and others. Additional devices include communication devices such as a modem, which can be used to link the PC to a wide area network of computers such as the Internet. Furthermore, the PC can include output devices such as a printer and other output means. Moreover, the PC can include special audio output devices such as speakers the like.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">PCs also have easy to use keyboards, mouse input devices, and the like. The keyboard is generally configured similar to a typewriter format. The keyboard also has the length and width for easily inputting information by way of keys to the computer. The mouse also has a sufficient size and shape to easily move a curser on the display from one location to another location.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Other types of computing devices include portable computing devices such as &#x201c;laptop&#x201d; computers and the like. Although somewhat successful, laptop computers have many limitations. These computing devices have poor display technology. In fact, these devices often have a smaller flat panel display that has poor viewing characteristics. Additionally, these devices also have poor input devices such as smaller keyboards and the like. Furthermore, these devices have limited common platforms to transfer information to and from these devices and other devices such as PCs.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Up to now, there has been little common ground between these platforms including the PCs and laptops in terms of upgrading, ease-of-use, cost, performance, and the like. Many differences between these platforms, probably somewhat intentional, have benefited computer manufacturers at the cost of consumers. A drawback to having two separate computers is that the user must often purchase both the desktop and laptop to have &#x201c;total&#x201d; computing power, where the desktop serves as a &#x201c;regular&#x201d; computer and the laptop serves as a &#x201c;portable&#x201d; computer. Purchasing both computers is often costly and runs &#x201c;thousands&#x201d; of dollars. The user also wastes a significant amount of time transferring software and data between the two types of computers. For example, the user must often couple the portable computer to a local area network (i.e., LAN), to a serial port with a modem, and then manually transfer over files and data between the desktop and the portable computer. Alternatively, the user often must use floppy disks to &#x201c;zip&#x201d; up files and programs that exceed the storage capacity of conventional floppy disks, and transfer the floppy disk data manually.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another drawback with the current model of separate portable and desktop computer is that the user has to spend money to buy components and peripherals which are duplicated in at least one of these computers. For example, both the desktop and portable computers typically include hard disk drives, floppy drives, CD-ROMs, computer memory, host processors, graphics accelerators, and the like. Because program software and supporting programs generally must be installed upon both hard drives in order for the user to operate programs on the road and in the office, hard disk space is often wasted.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One approach to reduce some of these drawbacks has been the use of a docking station with a portable computer. Here, the user has the portable computer for &#x201c;on the road&#x201d; use and a docking station that houses the portable computer for office use.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Similar to separate desktop and portable computers, there is no commonality between two desktop computers. To date, most personal computers are constructed with a single motherboard that provides connection for CPU and other components in the computer. Dual CPU systems have been available through Intel's slot 1 architecture. For example, two Pentium II cartridges can be plugged into two &#x201c;slot 1&#x201d; card slots on a motherboard to form a Dual-processor system. The two CPU's share a common host bus that connects to the rest of the system, e.g. main memory, hard disk drive, graphics subsystem, and others. Dual CPU systems have the advantage of increased CPU performance for the whole system. Adding a CPU cartridge requires no change in operating systems and application software. However, dual CPU systems may suffer limited performance improvement if memory or disk drive bandwidth becomes the limiting factor. Also, dual CPU systems have to time-share the processing unit in running multiple applications. CPU performance improvement efficiency also depends on software coding structure. Dual CPU systems provide no hardware redundancy to help fault tolerance. In running multiple applications, memory and disk drive data throughput will become the limiting factor in improving performance with multi-processor systems.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention generally relates to computer interfaces. More specifically, the present invention relates to an interface channel that interfaces two computer interface buses that operate under protocols that are different from that used by the interface channel.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Interfaces coupling two independent computer buses are well known in the art. A block diagram of a computer system utilizing such a prior art interface is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a primary peripheral component interconnect (PCI) bus <b>505</b> of a notebook PC <b>500</b> is coupled to a secondary PCI bus <b>555</b> in a docking system <b>550</b> (also referred to as docking station <b>550</b>) through high pin count connectors <b>501</b> and <b>502</b>, which are normally mating connectors. The high pin count connectors <b>501</b> and <b>502</b> contain a sufficiently large number of pins so as to carry PCI bus signals between the two PCI buses without any translation. The main purpose for interfacing the two independent PCI buses is to allow transactions to occur between a master on one PCI bus and a target on the other PCI bus. The interface between these two independent PCI buses additionally includes an optional PCI to PCI bridge <b>560</b>, located in the docking station <b>550</b>, to expand the add on capability in docking station <b>550</b>. The bridge <b>560</b> creates a new bus number for devices behind the bridge <b>560</b> so that they are not on the same bus number as other devices in the system thus increasing the add on capability in the docking station <b>550</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">An interface such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> provides an adequate interface between the primary and secondary PCI buses. However, the interface is limited in a number of ways. The interface transfers signals between the primary and secondary PCI buses using the protocols of a PCI bus. Consequently, the interface is subject to the limitations under which PCI buses operate. One such limitation is the fact that PCI buses are not cable friendly. The cable friendliness of the interface was not a major concern in the prior art. However, in the context of the computer system of the present invention, which is described in the present inventor's (William W. Y. Chu's) application for &#x201c;Personal Computer Peripheral Console With Attached Computer Module&#x201d; filed concurrently with the present application on Sep. 8, 1998 and incorporated herein by reference, a cable friendly interface is desired for interfacing an attached computer module (ACM) and a peripheral console of the present invention. Furthermore, as a result of operating by PCI protocols, the prior art interface includes a very large number of signal channels with a corresponding large number of conductive lines (and a similarly large number of pins in the connectors of the interface) that are commensurate in number with the number of signal lines in the PCI buses which it interfaces. One disadvantage of an interface having a relatively large number of conductive lines and pins is that it costs more than one that uses a fewer number of conductive lines and pins. Additionally, an interface having a large number of conductive lines is bulkier and more cumbersome to handle. Finally, a relatively large number of signal channels in the interface renders the option of using differential voltage signals less viable because a differential voltage signal method would require duplicating a large number of signal lines. It is desirable to use a low voltage differential signal (LVDS) channel in the computer system of the present invention because an LVDS channel is more cable friendly, faster, consumes less power, and generates less noise, including electromagnetic interferences (EMI), than a PCI channel. The term LVDS is herein used to generically refer to low voltage differential signals and is not intended to be limited to any particular type of LVDS technology.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the present invention, a technique including a method and device for multi-module computing is provided. In an exemplary embodiment, the present invention provides a system including a plurality of computer modules that can independently operate to provide backup capability, dual processing, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a specific embodiment, the present invention provides a computer system for multi-processing purposes. The computer system has a console comprising a first coupling site and a second coupling site, e.g., computer module bay. Each coupling site comprises a connector. The console is an enclosure that is capable of housing each coupling site. The system also has a plurality of computer modules, where each of the computer modules is coupled to one of the connectors. Each of the computer modules has a processing unit, a main memory coupled to the processing unit, a graphics controller coupled to the processing unit, and a mass storage device coupled to the processing unit. Each of the computer modules is substantially similar in design to each other to provide independent processing of each of the computer modules in the computer system.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an alternative specific embodiment, the present invention provides a multi-processing computer system. The system has a console comprising a first coupling site and a second coupling site. Each coupling site comprises a connector. The console is an enclosure that is capable of housing each coupling site. The system also has a plurality of computer modules, where each of the computer modules is coupled to one of the connectors. Each of the computer modules has a processing unit, a main memory coupled to the processing unit, a graphics controller coupled to the processing unit, a mass storage device coupled to the processing unit, and a video output coupled to the processing unit. Each of the computer modules is substantially similar in design to each other to provide independent processing of each of the computer modules in the computer system. A video switch circuit is coupled to each of the computer modules through the video output. The video switch is configured to switch a video signal from any one of the computer modules to a display.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Numerous benefits are achieved using the present invention over previously existing techniques. In one embodiment, the invention provides improved processing and maintenance features. The invention can also provide increased CPU performance for the whole system. The invention also can be implemented without changes in operating system and application software. The present invention is also implemented using conventional technologies that can be provided in the present computer system in an easy and efficient manner.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In another embodiment, the invention provides at least two users to share the same modular desktop system. Each user operates on a different computer module. The other peripheral devices, i.e. CDROM, printer, DSL connection, etc. can be shared. This provides lower system cost, less desktop space and more efficiency. Depending upon the embodiment, one or more of these benefits can be available. These and other advantages or benefits are described throughout the present specification and are described more particularly below.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In still further embodiments, the present invention provides methods of using multiple computer modules.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present invention encompasses an apparatus for bridging a first computer interface bus and a second computer interface bus. where each of the first and second computer interface buses have a number of parallel multiplexed address/data bus lines and operate at a clock speed in a predetermined clock speed range having a minimum clock speed and a maximum clock speed. The apparatus comprises an interface channel having a clock line and a plurality of bit lines for transmitting bits; a first interface controller coupled to the first computer interface bus and to the interface channel to encode first control signals from the first computer interface bus into first control bits to be transmitted on the interface channel and to decode second control bits received from the interface channel into second control signals to be transmitted to the first computer interface bus; and a second interface controller coupled to the interface channel and the second computer interface bus to decode the first control bits from the interface channel into third control signals to be transmitted on the second computer interface bus and to encode fourth control signals from the second computer interface bus into the second control bits to be transmitted on the interface channel.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one embodiment, the first and second interface controllers comprise a host interface controller (HIC) and a peripheral interface controller (PIC), respectively, the first and second computer interface buses comprise a primary PCI and a secondary PCI bus, respectively, and the interface channel comprises an LVDS channel.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present invention overcomes the aforementioned disadvantages of the prior art by interfacing two PCI or PCI-like buses using a non-PCI or non-PCI-like channel. In the present invention, PCI control signals are encoded into control bits and the control bits, rather than the control signals that they represent, are transmitted on the interface channel. At the receiving end, the control bits representing control signals are decoded back into PCI control signals prior to being transmitted to the intended PCI bus.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The fact that control bits rather than control signals are transmitted on the interface channel allows using a smaller number of signal channels and a correspondingly small number of conductive lines in the interface channel than would otherwise be possible. This is because the control bits can be more easily multiplexed at one end of the interface channel and recovered at the other end than control signals. This relatively small number of signal channels used in the interface channel allows using LVDS channels for the interface. As mentioned above, an LVDS channel is more cable friendly, faster, consumes less power, and generates less noise than a PCI bus channel, which is used in the prior art to interface two PCI buses. Therefore, the present invention advantageously uses an LVDS channel for the hereto unused purpose of interfacing PCI or PCI-like buses. The relatively smaller number of signal channels in the interface also allows using connectors having smaller pins counts. As mentioned above an interface having a smaller number of signal channels and, therefore, a smaller number of conductive lines is less bulky and less expensive than one having a larger number of signal channels. Similarly, connectors having a smaller number of pins are also less expensive and less bulky than connectors having a larger number of pins.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, the present invention encompasses an apparatus for bridging a first computer interface bus and a second computer interface bus, in a microprocessor based computer system where each of the first and second computer interface buses have a number of parallel multiplexed address/data bus lines and operate at a clock speed in a predetermined clock speed range having a minimum clock speed and a maximum clock speed. The apparatus comprises an interface channel having a clock channel and a plurality of bit channels for transmitting bits; a first interface controller coupled to the first computer interface bus and to the interface channel to encode first control signals from the first computer interface bus into first control bits to be transmitted on the interface channel and to decode second control bits received from the interface channel into second control signals to be transmitted to the first computer interface bus; and a second interface controller coupled to the interface channel and the second computer interface bus to decode the first control bits from the interface channel into third control signals to be transmitted on the second computer interface bus and to encode fourth control signals from the second computer interface bus into the second control bits to be transmitted on the interface channel.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, the first and second interface controllers comprise a host interface controller (HIC) and a peripheral interface controller (PIC), respectively, the first and second computer interface buses comprise a primary PCI and a secondary PCI bus, respectively, and the interface channel comprises an LVDS channel.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In a preferred embodiment, the interface channel has a plurality of serial bit channels numbering fewer than the number of parallel bus lines in each of the PCI buses and operates at a clock speed higher than the clock speed at which any of the bus lines operates. More specifically, the interface channel includes two sets of unidirectional serial bit channels which transmit data in opposite directions such that one set of bit channels transmits serial bits from the HIC to the PIC while the other set transmits serial bits from the PIC to the HIC. For each cycle of the PCI clock, each bit channel of the interface channel transmits a packet of serial bits.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The HIC and PIC each include a bus controller to interface with the first and second computer interface buses, respectively, and to manage transactions that occur therewith. The HIC and PIC also include a translator coupled to the bus controller to encode control signals from the first and second computer interface buses, respectively, into control bits and to decode control bits from the interface channel into control signals. Additionally, the HIC and PIC each include a transmitter and a receiver coupled to the translator. The transmitter converts parallel bits into serial bits and transmits the serial bits to the interface channel. The receiver receives serial bits from the interface channel and converts them into parallel bits.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to the present invention, a technique including a method and device for securing a computer module using a password in a computer system is provided. In an exemplary embodiment, the present invention provides a security system for an attached computer module (&#x201c;ACM&#x201d;). In an embodiment, the ACM inserts into a Computer Module Bay (CMB) within a peripheral console to form a functional computer.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a specific embodiment, the present invention provides a computer module. The computer module has an enclosure that is insertable into a console. The module also has a central processing unit (i.e., integrated circuit chip) in the enclosure. The module has a hard disk drive in the enclosure, where the hard disk drive is coupled to the central processing unit. The module further has a programmable memory device in the enclosure, where the programmable memory device can be configurable to store a password for preventing a possibility of unauthorized use of the hard disk drive and/or other module elements. The stored password can be any suitable key strokes that a user can change from time to time. In a further embodiment, the present invention provides a permanent password or user identification code stored in flash memory, which also can be in the processing unit, or other integrated circuit element. The permanent password or user identification code is designed to provide a permanent &#x201c;finger print&#x201d; on the attached computer module.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a specific embodiment, the present invention provides a variety of methods. In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method for operating a computer system such as a modular computer system and others. The method includes inserting an attached computer module (&#x201c;ACM&#x201d;) into a bay of a modular computer system. The ACM has a microprocessor unit (e.g., microcontroller, microprocessor) coupled to a mass memory storage device (e.g., hard disk). The method also includes applying power to the computer system and the ACM to execute a security program, which is stored in the mass memory storage device. The method also includes prompting for a user password from a user on a display (e.g., fiat panel, CRT). In a further embodiment, the present method includes a step of reading a permanent password or user identification code stored in flash memory, or other integrated circuit element. The permanent password or user identification code provides a permanent finger print on the attached computer module. The present invention includes a variety of these methods that can be implemented in computer codes, for example, as well as hardware.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Numerous benefits are achieved using the present invention over previously existing techniques. The present invention provides mechanical and electrical security systems to prevent theft or unauthorized use of the computer system in a specific embodiment. Additionally, the present invention substantially prevents accidental removal of the ACM from the console. In some embodiments, the present invention prevents illegal or unauthorized use during transit. The present invention is also implemented using conventional technologies that can be provided in the present computer system in an easy and efficient manner.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">According to the present invention, a technique including a method and device for multi-module computing is provided. In an exemplary embodiment, the present invention provides a system including a plurality of computer modules that can independently operate to provide backup capability, dual processing, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a simplified diagram of a computer system <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. This diagram is merely an illustration and should not limit the scope of the claims herein. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize other variations, modifications, and alternatives. The computer system <b>100</b> includes an attached computer module (i.e., ACM) <b>113</b>, a desktop console <b>101</b>, among other elements. The computer system also has another ACM module <b>117</b>. Each ACM module has a respective slot <b>121</b>, <b>119</b>, which mechanically houses and electrically couples each ACM to the computer console. Also shown is a display <b>111</b>, which connects to the console. Additionally, keyboard <b>109</b> and mouse <b>115</b> are also shown. A second display <b>102</b>, keyboard <b>105</b>, and mouse <b>107</b> can be coupled to the console in some optional embodiments to allow more than one user to operate the computer system. The computer system is modular and has a variety of components that are removable. Some of these components (or modules) can be used in different computers, workstations, computerized television sets, and portable or laptop units.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the present embodiment, each ACM <b>113</b> includes computer components as will be described below, including a central processing unit (&#x201c;CPU&#x201d;). IDE controller, hard disk drive, computer memory, and the like. The computer module bay (i.e., CMB) <b>121</b> is an opening or slot in the desktop console. The CMB houses the ACM and provides communication to and from the ACM. The CMB also provides mechanical protection and support to the ACM. The CMB has a mechanical alignment mechanism for mating a portion of the ACM to the console. The CMB further has thermal heat dissipation sinks, electrical connection mechanisms, and the like. Some details of the ACM can be found in co-pending patent application Ser. Nos. 09/149,882 and 09/149,548 filed Sep. 8, 1998, commonly assigned, and hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In a specific embodiment, the present multiple computer module system has a peripheral console that has two or more computer bays that can receive a removable computer module or ACM. Multiple computer module system can function as a personal computer with only one ACM and the peripheral console. The second and additional ACM can be added later to increase overall system performance and reliability. The ACM operates independently as self-contained computer, communicates with each other through a high-speed serial communication and share most peripheral devices within the peripheral console. Each ACM controls its independent graphics subsystem and drives separate video output signals. A practical implementation is a dual ACM system. In a dual ACM system, two monitors can be used to display the two ACMs' graphics outputs at the same time. For a single monitor, a RGB switch is used to switch between the video outputs of the two ACMs and can be controlled by a command from the user. Similarly, input devices (i.e. keyboard and mouse) are switched between the two computer systems with a command from the user. Command from the user can be in the form of either a dedicated key on the keyboard or a special icon on the screen that the mouse can click on.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In most embodiments, the ACM includes an enclosure such as the one described with the following components, which should not be limiting:</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">1) A CPU with cache memory;</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">2) Core logic device or means;</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">3) Main memory;</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">4) A single primary Hard Disk Drive (&#x201c;HDD&#x201d;) that has a security program;</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">5) Flash memory with system BIOS and programmable user password;</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">6) Operating System, application software, data files on primary HDD;</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">7) An interface device and connectors to peripheral console;</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">8) A software controllable mechanical lock, lock control means, and other accessories.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The ACM connects to a peripheral console with power supply, a display device, an input device, and other elements. Some details of these elements with the present system are described in more detail below. In a dual ACM system, the primary ACM can connect directly to the peripheral board in the peripheral console. The second ACM can connect either directly or indirectly to the peripheral board. For indirect connection, a receptacle board is added to allow a cable connection to the peripheral board. This is to facilitate the mechanical positioning of the second ACM inside the computer chassis. The receptacle board approach can even be used for the primary ACM if a high bandwidth peripheral bus, e.g. PCI Bus, is not connected from the primary ACM to the peripheral board.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The shared peripheral console has a chassis and a motherboard that connects the following devices:</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">1) Input means, e.g. keyboard and mouse,</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">2) Display means, e.g. RGB monitor,</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">3) Add-on means, e.g. PCI add-on slots,</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">4) Two Computer Module Bays (CMB) with connectors to two ACMs,</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">5) A serial communication Hub controller that interfaces to serial communication controller of both ACMs,</p>

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">7) Communication device, e.g. modem,</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">8) Power supply, and others.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The computer bay is an opening in the peripheral console that receives an ACM. CMB provides mechanical protection to ACM, mechanical alignment for connector mating, mechanical locking system to prevent theft and accidental removal, and connectors at the end of the opening for connecting to ACM. The interface bus between ACM and the peripheral console has a video bus, peripheral connections, serial communication connection, control signals and power connection. Video bus includes video output of graphics devices, i.e. analog RGB and control signals for monitor. Power connection supplies the power for ACM.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">An implementation of peripheral sharing is the use of Ethernet controllers to bridge the communication between the two ACMs. Some of the peripheral devices residing in the peripheral console are shown in the simplified diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As shown, the diagram is merely an illustration which should not limit the scope of the claims herein. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many other variations, alternatives, and modifications.

The method then has the user try later <b>431</b>, once the missing or malfunctioning module has been replaced or repaired. Next, the method determines if there is sufficient storage available in the other computer module for the backup files. If so, the method goes to the next step.

<p id="p-0115" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a block diagram of one embodiment of a computer system <b>600</b> using the interface of the present invention. Computer system <b>600</b> includes an attached computer module (ACM) <b>605</b> and a peripheral console <b>610</b>, which are described in greater detail in the application of William W. Y. Chu for &#x201c;Personal Computer Peripheral Console With Attached Computer Module&#x201d; filed concurrently with the present application on Sep. 8, 1998 and incorporated herein by reference. The ACM <b>605</b> and the peripheral console <b>610</b> are interfaced through an exchange interface system (XIS) bus <b>615</b>. The XIS bus <b>615</b> includes power bus <b>616</b>, video bus <b>617</b> and peripheral bus (XPBus) <b>618</b>, which is also herein referred to as an interface channel. The power bus <b>616</b> transmits power between ACM <b>605</b> and peripheral console <b>610</b>. In a preferred embodiment power bus <b>616</b> transmits power at voltage levels of 3.3 volts, 5 volts and 12 volts. Video bus <b>617</b> transmits video signals between the ACM <b>605</b> and the peripheral console <b>610</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the video bus <b>617</b> transmits analog Red Green Blue (RGB) video signals for color monitors, digital video signals (such as Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) Plug and Display's Transition Minimized Differential Signaling (TMDS) signals for flat panel displays), and television (TV) and/or super video (S-video) signals. The XPBus <b>618</b> is coupled to host interface controller (HIC) <b>619</b> and to peripheral interface controller (PIC) <b>620</b>, which is also sometimes referred to as a bay interface controller.</p>

<p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a more detailed block diagram of one embodiment of an HIC <b>905</b> and a PIC <b>955</b> of the present invention. HIC <b>905</b> includes a peripheral component interconnect (PCI) bus controller <b>910</b>, an XPBus controller <b>915</b>, a phase lock loop (PLL) clock <b>920</b> and an input/output (<b>10</b>) control <b>925</b>. Similarly, PIC <b>955</b> includes a PCI bus controller <b>960</b>, an XPBus controller <b>965</b>, a PLL clock <b>970</b> and an I/O control <b>975</b>. PCI bus controllers <b>910</b> and <b>960</b> are coupled to the primary and secondary PCI buses <b>930</b> and <b>980</b>, respectively, and manage PCI transactions on the primary and secondary PCI buses <b>930</b> and <b>980</b>, respectively. Similarly, XPBus Controllers <b>915</b> and <b>965</b> are coupled to XPBus <b>990</b>. XPBus controller <b>915</b> drives the PCK line <b>991</b> and PD[0::3] and PCN lines <b>992</b> while XPBus controller <b>965</b> drives the PCKR lines <b>993</b>, the PDR[0::3] and PCNR lines <b>994</b> and the RESET# line <b>995</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">PCI bus controller <b>910</b> receives PCI clock signals from the primary PCI bus <b>930</b> and is synchronized to the PCI clock. However, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the XPBus controller <b>915</b> is asynchronous with the PCI bus controller <b>910</b>. Instead, the XPBus controller receives a clock signal from the PLL clock <b>920</b> and is synchronized therewith. PLL clock <b>920</b> generates a clock signal independent of the PCI clock. The asynchronous operation of the PCI bus and the XPBus allows the PCI Bus to change in frequency. for example as in a power down situation, without directly affecting the XPBus clocking In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the PLL clock <b>920</b> generates a clock signal having a frequency of 66 MHz, which is twice as large as the 33 MHz frequency of the PCI clock. (The clock signal generated by the PLL clock may have a clock speed different from, including lower than, 66 MHz. For example, in another embodiment, which is discussed in greater detail below, the PLL clock <b>920</b> generates a clock signal having a frequency of 132 MHz.)</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The XPBus <b>990</b> operates at the clock speed generated by the PLL clock <b>920</b>. Therefore, PCK, the clock signal from the XPBus controller <b>915</b> to XPBus controller <b>965</b> has the same frequency as the clock signal generated by PLL clock <b>920</b>. XPBus controller <b>965</b> receives the PCK signal after it has been buffered and operates at the clock speed of PCK. The buffered version of the clock signal PCK is used to generate the clock signal PCKR, the clock signal form the XPBus controller <b>965</b> to XPBus controller <b>915</b>. Accordingly, PCKR also has the same frequency as that generated by the PLL clock <b>920</b>. The synchronous operation of PCK and PCKR provides for improved reliability in the system. In another embodiment, PCKR may be generated independently of PCK and may have a frequency different from that of PCK. It is to be noted that even when PCKR is generated from PCK, the slew between PCK and PCKR cannot be guaranteed because of the unknown cable length used for the XPBus. For a cable that is several feet long, the cable propagation delay alone can be several nano seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, PLL clock <b>970</b> is asynchronous with the XPBus controller <b>965</b>.

Additionally. control encoder &#x26; merge data path unit <b>1025</b> receives control signals from CPU CNTL &#x26; GPIO latch/driver <b>1090</b>, which is coupled to the CPU and north bridge (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). Control encoder &#x26; merge data path unit <b>1025</b> encodes PCI control signals as well as CPU control signals and north bridge signals into control bits, merges these encoded control bits and transmits the merged control bits to transmitter <b>1030</b>, which then transmits the control bits on the data lines PD<b>0</b> to PD<b>3</b> and control line PCN of the XPBus. Examples of control signals include PCI control signals and CPU control signals. A specific example of a control signal is FRAME# used in PCI buses. A control bit, on the other hand is a data bit that represents a control signal. Control decoder &#x26; separate data path unit <b>1024</b> receives control bits from receiver <b>1040</b> which receives control bits on data lines PDR<b>0</b> to PDR<b>3</b> and control line PCNR of the XPBus. Control decoder &#x26; separate data path unit <b>1024</b> separates the control bits it receives from receiver <b>1040</b> into PCI control signals, CPU control signals and north bridge signals, and decodes the control bits into PCI control signals, CPU control signals, and north bridge signals all of which meet the relevant timing constraints.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Transmitter <b>1030</b> receives multiplexed parallel address/data (AID) bits and control bits from translator <b>1020</b> on the AD[31::0] out and the CNTL out lines, respectively. Transmitter <b>1030</b> also receives a clock signal from PLL <b>1050</b>. PLL <b>1050</b> takes a reference input clock and generates PCK that drives the XPBus. PCK is asynchronous with the PCI clock signal and operates at 106 MHz, twice the speed of the PCI clock of 33 MHz. The higher speed is intended to accommodate at least some possible increases in the operating speed of future PCI buses. As a result of the higher speed, the XPBus may be used to interface two PCI or PCI-like buses operating at 106 MHz rather than 33 MHz or having 104 rather than 32 multiplexed address/data lines.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The multiplexed parallel A/D bits and some control bits input to transmitter <b>1030</b> are serialized by parallel to serial converters <b>1032</b> of transmitter <b>1030</b> into 10 bit packets. These bit packets are then output on data lines PD<b>0</b> to PD<b>3</b> of the XPBus. Other control bits are serialized by parallel to serial converter <b>1033</b> into 10 bit packets and send out on control line PCN of the XPBus.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">A 10&#xd7; multiplier <b>1031</b> receives PCK, multiplies it by a factor of 10 and feeds a clock signal 10 times greater than PCK into the parallel to serial converters <b>1032</b> and <b>1033</b>. The parallel to serial converters <b>1032</b> and <b>1033</b> perform bit shitting at 10 times the PCK rate to serialize the parallel bits into 10 bit packets. As the parallel to serial converters <b>1032</b> and <b>1033</b> shift bits at 10 times the PCK rate, the bit rate for the serial bits output by the parallel to serial converters is 10 times higher than PCK rate, i.e., 1060 MHz. However, the rate at which data packets are transmitted on the XPBus is the same as the PCK rate, i.e., 106 MHz. As the PCI buses operate at a clock and bit rate of 33 MHz, the XPBus has a clock rate that is twice as large and a bit rate per bit line (channel) that is 100 times as large as that of the PCI buses which it interfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Receiver <b>1040</b> receives serial bit packets on data lines PDR<b>0</b> to PDR<b>3</b> and control line PCNR. Receiver <b>1040</b> also receives PCKR on the XPBus as well as the clock signal PCK from PLL <b>1050</b>. The synchronizer (SYNC) <b>1044</b> of receiver <b>1040</b> synchronizes the clock signal PCKR to the locally generated clock signal, PCK, in order to capture the bits received from the XPBus into PCK clock timing.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Serial to parallel converters <b>1042</b> convert the serial bit packets received on lines PDR<b>0</b> to PDR<b>3</b> into parallel address/data and control bits that are sent to decoders <b>1023</b> and <b>1028</b> and control decoder and separate data path unit <b>1024</b>, respectively. Serial to parallel converter <b>1043</b> receives control bit packets from control line PCNR, converts them to parallel control bits and sends the parallel control bits to control decoder &#x26; separate data path <b>1024</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">A 10&#xd7; multiplier <b>1041</b> receives PCKR, multiplies it by a factor of 10 and feeds a clock signal 10 times greater than PCKR into the serial to parallel converters <b>1042</b> and <b>1043</b>. Because the bits on PDR<b>0</b> to PDR<b>3</b> and PCNR are transmitted at a bit rate of 10 times the PCKR rate, the serial to parallel converters <b>1042</b> and <b>1043</b> perform bit shifting at 10 times the PCKR rate to convert the 10 bit packets into parallel bits. It is to be noted that the rate at which bit packets are transmitted on the XPBus is the same as the PCKR rate, i.e., 106 MHz. The parallel data and control bits are thereafter sent to decoders <b>1023</b> and <b>1028</b> by way of the AD[3::0] in line and to control decoder &#x26; separate data path unit <b>1024</b> by way of CNTL in lines, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Reset control unit <b>1045</b> of HIC <b>1000</b> receives the signal RESET#, which is an independent system reset signal, on the reset line RESET#. Reset control unit <b>1045</b> then transmits the reset signal to the CPU CNTL &#x26; GPIO latch/driver unit <b>1090</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">As may be noted from the above, the 32 line host and secondary PCI buses are interfaced by 10 XPBus lines (PD<b>0</b>, PD<b>1</b>, PD<b>2</b>, PD<b>3</b>, PCN, PDR<b>0</b>, PDR<b>1</b>, PDR<b>2</b>, PDR<b>3</b>, PCNR). Therefore, the interface channel, XPBus, of the present invention uses fewer lines than are contained in either of the buses which it interfaces, namely the PCI buses. XPBus is able to interface such PCI buses without backup delays because the XPBus operates at a clock rate and a per line (channel) bit rate that are higher than those of the PCI buses.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In addition to receiving a reset signal, the CPU CNTL &#x26; GPIO latch/driver <b>1090</b> is responsible for latching input signals from the CPU and north bridge and sending the signals to the translator. It also takes decoded signals from the control decoder &#x26; separate data path unit <b>1024</b> and drives the appropriate signals for the CPU and north bridge.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, video serial to parallel converter <b>1080</b> is included in HIC <b>1000</b>. In another embodiment, video serial to parallel converter <b>1080</b> may be a separate unit from the HIC <b>1000</b>. Video serial to parallel converter <b>1080</b> receives serial video data on line VPD and a video clock signal VPCK from line VPCK of video bus <b>1081</b>. It then converts the serial video data into 16 bit parallel video port data and the appropriate video port control signals, which it transmits to the graphics controller (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) on the video port data [0::15] and video port control lines, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">HIC <b>1000</b> handles the PCI bus control signals and control bits from the XPBus representing PCI control signals in the following ways:</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">1. HIC <b>1000</b> buffers clocked control signals from the host PCI bus, encodes them into control bits and sends the encoded control bits to the XPBus;</p>

<p id="p-0140" num="0139"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a detailed block diagram of one embodiment of the PIC of the present invention. PIC <b>1100</b> is nearly identical to HIC <b>1000</b> in its function, except that HIC <b>1000</b> interfaces the host PCI bus to the XPBus while PIC <b>1100</b> interfaces the secondary PCI bus to the XPBus. Similarly, the components in PIC <b>1100</b> serve the same function as their corresponding components in HIC <b>1000</b>. Reference numbers for components in PIC <b>1100</b> have been selected such that a component in PIC <b>1100</b> and its corresponding component in HIC <b>1000</b> have reference numbers that differ by 500 and have the same two least significant digits. Thus for example, the bus controller in PIC <b>1100</b> is referenced as bus controller <b>1110</b> while the bus controller in HIC <b>1000</b> is referenced as bus controller <b>1010</b>. As many of the elements in PIC <b>1100</b> serve the same functions as those served by their corresponding elements in HIC <b>1000</b> and as the functions of the corresponding elements in HIC <b>1000</b> have been described in detail above, the function of elements of PIC <b>1100</b> having corresponding elements in HIC <b>1000</b> will not be further described herein. Reference may be made to the above description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> for an understanding of the functions of the elements of PIC <b>1100</b> having corresponding elements in HIC <b>1000</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">As suggested above, there are also differences between HIC <b>1000</b> and PIC <b>1100</b>. Some of the differences between HIC <b>1000</b> and PIC <b>1100</b> include the following. First, receiver <b>1140</b> in PIC <b>1100</b>, unlike receiver <b>1040</b> in HIC <b>1000</b>, does not contain a synchronization unit. As mentioned above, the synchronization unit in HIC <b>1000</b> synchronizes the PCKR clock to the PCK clock locally generated by PLL <b>1050</b>. PIC <b>1100</b> does not locally generate a PCK clock and therefore, it does not have a locally generated PCK clock with which to synchronize the PCK clock signal that it receives from HIC <b>1000</b>. Another difference between PIC <b>1100</b> and HIC <b>1000</b> is the fact that PIC <b>1100</b> contains a video parallel to serial converter <b>1189</b> whereas HIC <b>1000</b> contains a video serial to parallel converter <b>1080</b>. Video parallel to serial converter <b>1189</b> receives 16 bit parallel video capture data and video control signals on the Video Port Data [0::15] and Video Port Control lines, respectively, from the video capture circuit (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) and converts them to a serial video data stream that is transmitted on the VPD line to the HIC. The video capture circuit may be any type of video capture circuit that outputs a 16 bit parallel video capture data and video control signals. Another difference lies in the fact that PIC <b>1100</b>, unlike HIC <b>1000</b>, contains a clock doubler <b>1182</b> to double the video clock rate of the video clock signal that it receives. The doubled video clock rate is fed into video parallel to serial converter <b>1182</b> through buffer <b>1183</b> and is sent to serial to parallel converter <b>1080</b> through buffer <b>1184</b>. Additionally, reset control unit <b>1135</b> in PIC <b>1100</b> receives a reset signal from the CPU CNTL &#x26; GPIO latch/driver unit <b>1190</b> and transmits the reset signal on the RESET# line to the HIC <b>1000</b> whereas reset control unit <b>1045</b> of HIC <b>1000</b> receives the reset signal and forwards it to its CPU CNTL &#x26; GPIO latch/driver unit <b>1090</b> because, in the above embodiment, the reset signal RESET# is unidirectionally sent from the PIC <b>1100</b> to the HIC <b>1000</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Like HIC <b>1000</b>, PIC <b>1100</b> handles the PCI bus control signals and control bits from the XPBus representing PCI control signals in the following ways:</p>

<p id="p-0148" num="0147"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a table showing the information transmitted on the XPBus during two clock cycles of the XPBus in one embodiment of the present invention where 10 data bits are transmitted in each clock cycle of the XPBus. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, A<b>00</b> to A<b>31</b> represent 32 bits of PCI address A[31::0], D<b>00</b> to D<b>31</b> represent 32 bits of PCI data D[31::0], BS<b>0</b> to BS<b>3</b> represent 4 bits of bus status data indicating the status of the XPBus, CM<b>0</b># to CM<b>3</b># represent 4 bits of PCI command information, BE<b>0</b># to BE<b>3</b># represent 4 bits of PCI byte enable information, and CN<b>0</b> to CN<b>9</b> represent 10 bits of control information sent in each clock cycle. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, for each of lines PD<b>0</b> to PD<b>3</b>, the 10 bit data packets contain one BS bit, one CM/BE bit, and eight AID bits. For the PCN line, the 10 bit data packet contains 10 CN bits. The first clock cycle shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> comprises an address cycle in which 4 BS bits, 4 CM bits, 32 A bits and 10 CN bits are sent. The second clock cycle comprises a data cycle in which 4 BS bits, 4 BE bits, 32 D bits and 10 CN bits are sent. The bits transmitted on lines PD<b>0</b> to PD<b>3</b> represent 32 PCI AD[31::0] signals, 4 PCI C/BE# [3::0] signals, and part of the function of PCI control signals, such as FRAME#, IRDY#, and TRDY#.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, BS<b>0</b> to BS<b>3</b> are sent at the beginning of each clock cycle. The bus status bits indicate the following bus cycle transactions: idle, address transfer, write data transfer, read data transfer, switch XPBus direction, last data transfer, wait, and other cycles.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Bits representing signals transmitted between the CPU and South Bridge may also be sent on the lines interconnecting the HIC and PIC, such as lines PCN and PCNR. For example, CPU interface signals such as CPU interrupt (INTR), Address 20 Mask (A20M#), Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI), System Management Interrupt (SMI#), and Stop Clock (STPCLK#), may be translated into bit information and transmitted on the XPBus between the HIC and the PIC.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a table showing the information transmitted on the XPBus during four clock cycles of the XPBus in another embodiment of the present invention where 10 data bits are transmitted in each clock cycle of the XPBus. In this embodiment, the XPBus clock rate is twice as large as the PCI clock rate. This allows sending data and address bits every other XPBus cycle. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, there are no address or data bits transmitted during the second or fourth XPBus clock cycle. The fact that the XPBus clock rate is higher than the PCI clock rate allows for compatibility of the XPBus with possible future expansions in the performance of PCI bus to higher data transfer and clock rates.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, there are 18 control bits, CN<b>0</b> to CN<b>17</b>, transmitted in every two XPBus clock cycles. The first bit transmitted on the control line in each XPBus clock cycle indicates whether control bits CN<b>0</b> to CN<b>8</b> or control bits CN<b>9</b> to CN<b>17</b> will be transmitted in that cycle. A zero sent at the beginning of a cycle on the control line indicates that CN<b>0</b> to CN<b>8</b> will be transmitted during that cycle, whereas a one sent at the beginning of a cycle on the control line indicates that CN<b>9</b> to CN<b>17</b> will be transmitted during that cycle. These bits also indicate the presence or absence of data and address bits during that cycle. A zero indicates that address or data bits will be transmitted during that cycle whereas a one indicates that no address or data bits will be transmitted during that cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">In one embodiment, BS<b>0</b> and BS<b>1</b> are used to encode the PCI signals FRAME# and IRDY#, respectively. Additionally, in one embodiment, BS<b>2</b> and BS<b>3</b> are used to indicate the clock speed of the computer bus interface and the type of computer bus interface, respectively. For example. BS<b>2</b> value of zero may indicate that a 33 MHz PCI bus of 32 bits is used whereas a BS<b>2</b> value of one may indicate that a 66 MHz PCI bus of 32 bits is used. Similarly, a BS<b>3</b> value of zero may indicated that a PCI bus is used whereas a BS<b>3</b> value of one may indicated that another computer interface bus, such as an Institute of Electronics &#x26; Electrical Engineers (IEEE) 1394 bus, is used.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a schematic diagram of lines PCK, PD<b>0</b> to PD<b>3</b>, and PCN. These lines are unidirectional LVDS lines for transmitting clock signals and bits such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> from the HIC to the PIC. The bits on the PD<b>0</b> to PD<b>3</b> and the PCN lines are sent synchronously within every clock cycle of the PCK. Another set of lines, namely PCKR, PDR<b>0</b> to PDR<b>3</b>, and PCNR, are used to transmit clock signals and bits from the PIC to HIC. The lines used for transmitting information from the PIC to the HIC have the same structure as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, except that they transmit data in a direction opposite to that in which the lines shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> transmit data. In other words they transmit information from the PIC to the HIC. The bits on the PDR<b>0</b> to PDR<b>3</b> and the PCNR lines are sent synchronously within every clock cycle of the PCKR. Some of the examples of control information that may be sent in the reverse direction, i.e., on PCNR line, include a request to switch data bus direction because of a pending operation (such as read data available), a control signal change in the target requiring communication in the reverse direction, target busy, and transmission error detected.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">The XPBus which includes lines PCK, PD<b>0</b> to PD<b>3</b>, PCN, PCKR, PDR<b>0</b> to PDR<b>3</b>, and PCNR, has two sets of unidirectional lines transmitting clock signals and bits in opposite directions. The first set of unidirectional lines includes PCK, PD<b>0</b> to PD<b>3</b>, and PCN. The second set of unidirectional lines includes PCKR, PDR<b>0</b> to PDR<b>3</b>, and PCNR. Each of these unidirectional set of lines is a point-to-point bus with a fixed transmitter and receiver, or in other words a fixed master and slave bus. For the first set of unidirectional lines, the HIC is a fixed transmitter/master whereas the PIC is a fixed receiver/slave. For the second set of unidirectional lines, the PIC is a fixed transmitter/master whereas the HIC is a fixed receiver/slave. The LVDS lines of XPBus, a cable friendly and remote system I/O bus, transmit fixed length data packets within a clock cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The XPBus lines, PD<b>0</b> to PD<b>3</b>, PCN, PDR<b>0</b> to PDR<b>3</b> and PCNR, and the video data and clock lines, VPD and VPCK, are not limited to being LVDS lines, as they may be other forms of bit based lines. For example, in another embodiment, the XPBus lines may be IEEE 1394 lines.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">It is to be noted that although each of the lines PCK, PD<b>0</b> to PD<b>3</b>, PCN, PCKR, PDR<b>0</b> to PDR<b>3</b>, PCNR, VPCK, and VPD is referred to as a line, in the singular rather than plural. each such line may contain more than one physical line. For example, in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, each of lines PCK, PD<b>0</b> to PD<b>3</b> and PCN includes two physical lines between each driver and its corresponding receiver. The term line, when not directly preceded by the terms physical or conductive, is herein used interchangeably with a signal or bit channel which may consist of one or more physical lines for transmitting a signal. In the case of non-differential signal lines, generally only one physical line is used to transmit one signal. However, in the case of differential signal lines, a pair of physical lines is used to transmit one signal. For example, a bit line or bit channel in an LVDS or IEEE 1394 interface consists of a pair of physical lines which together transmit a signal.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">A bit based line (i.e., a bit line) is a line for transmitting serial bits. Bit based lines typically transmit bit packets and use a serial data packet protocol. Examples of bit lines include an LVDS line, an IEEE 1394 line, and a Universal Serial Bus (USB) line.</p>

The preferred ACM-to-PCON interconnection <b>1900</b> includes circuitry to transmit and receive parallel bus information from multiple signal paths as a serial bit stream on a single signal path. This reduces the number of physical signal paths required to traverse the interconnection <b>1900</b>. Further, employing low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS) on the bit stream data paths provides very reliable, high-speed transmission across cables.

<p id="p-0170" num="0169">The CPU component <b>1710</b> of the ACM functional circuitry <b>1701</b> of the presently described embodiment comprises a microprocessor <b>1712</b>, which is the chief component of the personal computer system, power supply connection point <b>1713</b>, and cache memory <b>1714</b> tightly coupled to the microprocessor <b>1712</b> by the CPU-to-cache bus <b>1714</b> comprising signal paths for address, data. and control information. The microprocessor <b>1712</b> of this embodiment is one of the models from the Pentium II family of processors from Intel Corporation. Microprocessor <b>1712</b> receives electrical power from power bus <b>1768</b> via connection point <b>1713</b>. Microprocessor <b>1712</b> couples to the Host Interface Controller (HIC) <b>1920</b> via CPU-to-HIC bus <b>1763</b> comprising signal paths to exchange control information such as an interrupt request. Microprocessor <b>1712</b> also couples to CPU Bridge <b>1746</b> via CPU main bus <b>1764</b> comprising signal paths for address, data, and control information.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">The CPU Bridge component <b>1746</b> of the interface and support circuitry <b>1740</b> operates to couple the high speed CPU main bus <b>1764</b> to specialty buses of varying speeds and capability that connect other computer components. The CPU Bridge of the presently described embodiment incorporates memory controller circuitry, advanced graphics processor support circuitry, and a general, industry-standard PCI bus controller in a single package. A CPU Bridge <b>1746</b> such as the 82443LX PCI/AGP Controller from Intel Corporation may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">The system memory component <b>1720</b> of the ACM functional circuitry <b>1701</b> in the present embodiment comprises main system memory (RAM) <b>1722</b>, BIOS memory <b>1724</b>, and flash memory <b>1726</b>. The system memory <b>1720</b> is used to contain data and instructions that are directly addressable by the CPU. The RAM <b>1722</b> comprises volatile memory devices such as DRAM or SDRAM memory chips that do not retain their stored contents when power is removed. This form of memory represents the largest proportion of total system memory <b>1720</b> capacity. The BIOS memory <b>1724</b> comprises non-volatile memory devices such as ROM or EPROM memory chips that retain their stored contents regardless of the application of power and are read-only memory under normal operating conditions. The BIOS memory <b>1724</b> stores, for example, start-up instructions for the microprocessor <b>1712</b> and sets of instructions for rudimentary input/output tasks. The flash memory <b>1726</b> comprises non-volatile memory devices that retain their stored contents regardless of the application of power. Unlike the BIOS non-volatile memory, however, the stored contents of the flash memory <b>1726</b> are easily changed under normal operating conditions. The flash memory <b>1726</b> may be used to store status and configuration data, such as security identifiers or ACM specifications like the speed of the microprocessor <b>1712</b>. Some embodiments may combine the BIOS functions into the flash memory device, thus permitting BIOS contents to be rewritten, improving field upgradability.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">The main system memory (RAM) <b>1722</b> is coupled to memory controller circuitry resident within the CPU Bridge <b>1746</b> via direct memory bus <b>1765</b>. The BIOS <b>1724</b> and flash memory <b>1726</b> are coupled to HIC <b>1920</b> via switched memory bus <b>1766</b>.

<p id="p-0174" num="0173">The primary mass storage component <b>1730</b> of the ACM functional circuitry <b>1701</b> in the present embodiment comprises a compact hard disk drive with an industry-standard, IDE interface. The hard disk drive (HDD) <b>1732</b> has a formatted storage capacity sufficient to contain an operating system for the computer, application software desired by the user, and related user configuration and operating parameter data. The HDD <b>1732</b> in the present embodiment serves as the &#x201c;boot&#x201d; device for the personal computer from which the operating system is loaded into RAM <b>1722</b> by the start-up program stored in the BIOS <b>1724</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">The present HDD <b>1732</b> has a capacity of approximately 2,000 megabytes to provide adequate storage for common software configurations and reasonable space for user data. One example of a common software configuration includes the Windows 95 operating system from Microsoft Corporation, a word processing program, a spreadsheet program, a presentation graphics program, a database program, an email program, and a web browser such as Navigator from Netscape Corporation. The hard disk <b>1732</b> stores program and data files for each software component, including files distributed by the vendor as well as files created or updated by operation of the software after it is installed. For example, a word processor program may maintain information about a user's identity and latest preferences in an operating system registry file. Or, for example, the web browser may maintain a file of the user's favorite web sites or most recently viewed web pages. An HDD with 2000 megabyte capacity is readily available in the small size of hard disk (e.g., 2.5-inch or 3.5-inch) to minimize the space required within the ACM for the primary mass storage device <b>1730</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">The HDD <b>1732</b> is coupled to IDE controller circuitry <b>1748</b> via IDE bus <b>1772</b>. The IDE controller circuitry <b>1748</b> is coupled to the CPU Bridge <b>1746</b> via the Host PCI bus <b>1767</b>. IDE controllers and busses, and the PCI bus are well known and understood in the industry. The above components operate together to couple the hard disk drive <b>1732</b> to the microprocessor <b>1712</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">The high performance devices component <b>1750</b> of the ACM functional circuitry <b>1701</b> in the present embodiment comprises an Advanced Graphics Processor (AGP) <b>1752</b>. The Model 740 Graphics Device froth Intel Corporation may be used in the present embodiment as the AGP.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">Increases in computer screen size, graphics resolution, color depth, and visual motion frame rates, used by operating system and application software alike, have increased the computing power required to generate and maintain computer screen displays. An AGP removes a substantial portion of the graphics computing burden from the CPU to the specialized high-performance processor, but a high level of interaction between the CPU and the specialized processor is nonetheless required. To maximize the effective contribution of having a specialized processor in the presently described embodiment, the AGP <b>1752</b> is located in the ACM <b>1700</b>, where it is in close proximity to the microprocessor <b>1712</b>. The AGP <b>1752</b> is coupled to the microprocessor <b>1712</b> via the advanced graphics port bus <b>1773</b> of the CPU Bridge <b>1746</b>. The visual display signal generated by the AGP are conveyed toward actual display devices at the peripheral console (PCON) via video signal bus <b>1770</b>. Video information from a source external to the ACM and appearing as video port signals <b>1917</b> may be conveyed to the AGP <b>1752</b> via video port signal path <b>1771</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">Other types of high performance components may be included in different ACM configurations. For example, an interface to an extremely high speed data communication facility may be desirable in some future computer where CPU-to-network interaction is of comparable intensity to today's CPU-to-graphics interaction. Because such high performance components tend to be high in cost, their inclusion in the ACM is desirable. Inclusion of high cost, high performance components in the ACM concentrates a user's core computing power and environment in a portable package. This represents a further advantage of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">The interface and support component <b>1740</b> of the ACM functional circuitry <b>1701</b> in the present embodiment comprises circuitry for power regulation <b>1742</b>, clocking <b>1744</b>, CPU Bridge <b>1746</b>, IDE controller <b>1748</b>, and signal conveyance paths <b>1761</b>-<b>1774</b>. The CPU Bridge <b>1746</b> couples the CPU component <b>1710</b> of the ACM <b>1700</b> with the other components of the ACM <b>1720</b>-<b>1750</b> and the CPU-to-PCON Interconnection <b>1900</b>. The CPU Bridge <b>1746</b> and IDE controller <b>1748</b> have already been discussed. Power regulation circuitry <b>1742</b> receives electrical power via the electrical power conduction path <b>1914</b> of the CPU-to-PCON Interconnection <b>1900</b>, conditions and distributes it to the other circuitry in the ACM using power distribution bus <b>1768</b>. Such regulation and distribution is well known and understood in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Clocking circuitry <b>1744</b> generates clock signals for distribution to other components within the ACM <b>1700</b> that require a timing and synchronization clock source. The CPU <b>1710</b> is one such component. Often, the total power dissipated by a CPU is directly proportional to the frequency of its main clock signal. The presently described embodiment of the ACM <b>1700</b> includes circuitry that can vary the frequency of the main CPU clock signal conveyed to the CPU via signal path <b>1762</b>, in response to a signal received from the host interface controller (HIC) <b>1920</b> via signal path <b>1761</b>. The generation and variable frequency control of clocking signals is well understood in the art. By varying the frequency, the power consumption of the CPU (and thus the entire ACM) can be varied.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">The variable clock rate generation may be exploited to match the CPU power consumption to the available electrical power. Circuitry in the host interface controller (HIC) <b>1920</b> of the presently described embodiment adjusts the frequency control signal sent via signal path <b>1761</b> to the clocking circuitry <b>1744</b>, based on the &#x201c;console type&#x201d; information signal <b>1918</b> conveyed from the peripheral console (PCON) by the CPU-to-PCON interconnection <b>1900</b>. In this arrangement, the console type signal originating from a desktop PCON would result in the generation of a maximum speed CPU clock. The desktop PCON, presumably has unlimited power from an electrical wall outlet and does not need to sacrifice speed for power conservation. The console type signal originating from a notebook PCON would, however, result in the generation of a CPU clock speed reduced from the maximum in order to conserve battery power and extend the duration of computer operation obtained from the energy stored in the battery. The console type signal originating from a notepad PCON would result in the generation of a CPU clock speed reduced further yet, the notepad PCON presumably having smaller batteries than the notebook PCON. Inclusion of control signals and circuitry to affect a CPU clock signal varying in frequency according to characteristics of the PCON to which the ACM is connected facilitates the movement of the user's core computing power and environment to different work settings, which is a further advantage of the present invention.</p>
