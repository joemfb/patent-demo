<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to facilitating cross security-domain processing within a multi-system computing environment.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Over time, multi-system computing environments have developed comprising the same or different operating systems and software requirements. These systems may be within the same or different security domains, with each security domain maintaining its own set of user security credentials. Within a security domain, a user registry is provided which includes a list of users and information, such as a user ID and password, that is used, for example, to authenticate a user when the user requests access to the domain. Note that the user may be a human user, or may be a software process that is assigned a local user identity, such as a print server. Each domain typically has its own administrative tools that allows its system administrator to add, delete, or modify user identities in the user registry. With a multiple domain environment that has several different systems, this means that the system administrator must learn and become proficient in the several different tools that handle identity management in the respective domains.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One way to avoid having multiple user identities for the same user is to force all applications and systems to share a common user registry. This approach may be viable in a homogenous environment (e.g., in a network that only has computers of the same platform type sharing a common security manager and a common security database). However, implementing this approach on a computing environment that includes several different security domains would require that each system and each application be rewritten to access some common user registry for the computing environment. This is not a workable solution.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Generally stated, provided herein is a facility for enhancing processing within a computing environment comprising multiple security domains. The facility allows for the projection of security credentials of a user of a first system in a first security domain to a second system in a second security domain of a computing environment. The back projected security credentials of the user in the second system comprise, for example, a reference to a runtime security context for the user in the second system resolvable within the computing environment, or a portable representation of the runtime security context for the user in the second system. These credentials are subsequently associated with work transferred from the first system to the second system. The work has associated therewith the reference to the runtime security context for the user in the second system or the portable representation of the runtime security context for the user in the second system, depending upon, for example, the particular type of application or component within the first operating system requiring work at the second operating system. By way of example, embodiments of the invention are described herein with reference to a single IBM System z sysplex. As used herein, a &#x201c;sysplex&#x201d; comprises a system complex and includes, for example, a cluster of operating systems.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Multiple security domains can exist within a single IBM System z sysplex customer installation. A system installation might comprise one or more machines based on the z/Architecture&#xae;, offered by International Business Machines Corporation of Armonk, N.Y., U.S.A., and described in an IBM publication entitled &#x201c;z/Architecture Principles of Operation&#x201d;, IBM Publication No. SA22-7832-07, February 2009, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. (IBM&#xae;, System z&#xae; and z/Architecture&#xae; are registered trademarks of International Business Machines Corporation, Armonk, N.Y., U.S.A. Other names used herein may be registered trademarks, trademarks or product names of International Business Machines Corporation, or other companies). For example, a given customer may configure a sysplex that has one or more z/OS operating system images running within the computing environment which use different, and to various extent dissimilar, z/OS External Security Managers (ESMs).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Reference <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, wherein a sysplex <b>100</b> is shown to include a first system (system <b>1</b>) <b>110</b> and a second system (system <b>2</b>) <b>120</b> each of which, in this example, is a z/OS operating system image. The ESM on one z/OS image (i.e., system <b>2</b>) is an IBM Resource Access Control Facility (RACF) <b>121</b>, while the ESM on the other z/OS image (i.e., system <b>1</b>) within the same sysplex <b>100</b> is, for example, a Computer Associates' ACF<b>2</b> <b>111</b>. Use of two or more different External Security Managers results in two or more different security domains being defined within the sysplex. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a first security domain, security domain A encompasses system <b>1</b>, with ACF<b>2</b> <b>111</b>, and a second security domain, security domain B, encompasses system <b>2</b> with RACF <b>121</b>. In one aspect, presented herein is a protocol for projecting a user's security credentials (or local security context) in system <b>1</b> of security domain A into system <b>2</b> of security domain B.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The facilities described herein are based (in one embodiment) upon facilities known formally as z/OS (and/or RACF) Identity Propagation and Translation and generally referred to as ID Prop. These facilities are described in greater detail in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2006/0288228, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, and are further documented with IBM's RACF product publications: (1) z/OS-Security Server RACROUTE Macro Reference, IBM Publication No. SA22-7692-12, Section 3.60 &#x26; 3.61, Thirteenth Edition, September 2009, pp. 211-273; (2) z/OS-Security Server RACF Command Language Reference, IBM Publication No. SA22-7687-14, Section 5.45, Fifteenth Edition, October 2009, pp. 392-398; (3) z/OS-Security Server RACF Security Administrator's Guide, IBM Publication No. SA22-7683-13, Chapter 26, Fourteenth Edition, September 2009, pp. 703-715; and (4) z/OS-Security Server RACF Data Areas, IBM Publication No. GA22-7680-11, Twelfth Edition, September 2009, each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. These publications make it possible for a runtime security context established within a given z/OS image to be projected into another z/OS image when a work request requires (for one reason or another) the facilities of multiple z/OS images in order for the work to be completed. An example of this is the IBM Customer Information Control System (CICS) transaction processing software product where a Terminal Owning Region (TOR) does some initial processing of a given work request, then passes the request off to an Application Owning Region (AOR) for completion. This identity translation improves the accuracy, efficiency and audit-ability of the processing by providing the ability to &#x201c;propagate&#x201d; the entirety of the runtime security context, know technically in one example as the z/OS Accessor Environment Element (ACEE) <b>112</b>,<b>122</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) from one z/OS image (where the TOR runs) to another z/OS image (where the AOR may run).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The problem addressed by the present invention is that an ACEE <b>112</b> created within one z/OS security domain (such as but not limited by the ACF<b>2</b> processing <b>113</b> in security domain A), may not be an exact equivalent to an ACEE <b>122</b> that is created within another, differing security domain (such as that created by RACF processing <b>123</b> in security domain B). This is because, for example, an RACF ACEE <b>122</b> may include, or point to by a memory address, certain data areas that are proprietary to the IBM RACF program product, and therefore, are not published interfaces useable by the ACF<b>2</b> ESM program product on system <b>1</b> in security domain A. The opposite scenario is also possible.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Other examples of this problem can arise even when the same program product ESM is used in different systems, but the databases supporting the ESMs are different (e.g., not shared between them). Today, the only choice a customer has in addressing these problems is to limit the implementation to a homogeneous security domain sysplex configuration wherein all ESMs and associated databases within a given sysplex configuration are the same, e.g., all are ACF and all share the same database, or for customer applications to some how cause an entirely new runtime security context, lacking the completeness of the original context, to be instantiated whenever such a security domain traversal is desired. The former choice can interfere with customer information technology consolidation activity, and the later choice bars the advantages of identity propagation.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In view of the above, presented herein is processing that can, through a combination of discovery and customer configuration, be made aware of a multi-ESM topology within the sysplex when it occurs, and to return such information to a potential application or component caller when requested by the caller. This new service also provides the ability for an application, running within one security domain within the sysplex (i.e., a source domain), to request a runtime security context (ACEE) be created within another security domain within the sysplex that is expected to be the target domain to which the source domain will send a work request, and for either a &#x201c;reference&#x201d; ACEE that is resolvable within the sysplex or a &#x201c;portable representation&#x201d; of the ACEE to be returned to the calling application. This reference or portable representation then flows back with the work request from the first, source domain to the second, target domain, where the target domain resolves it into a local ACEE (i.e., assuming the user and the source domain have been assigned a user ID within the target domain) for use in running the work request in the target domain. The processing described herein overcomes the problem of dissimilar runtime security contexts by allowing an application running in one security domain (source domain) to acquire a runtime security context from the other dissimilar domain (target domain) for use in directing work to that domain. Since the runtime security context is acquired from the target security domain within which the work request is to process, it will be of a form and format that is correct and usable in that security domain. It may be considered &#x201c;opaque&#x201d; to the source security domain that acquires it, however, this is not a problem because it is not used as a runtime security context within the source security domain.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The logical facility described above can be implemented on z/OS as an MVS System Authorization Facility (SAF) call-able service. Thus, it could available for use with z/OS ESMs other than RACF; for example, Computer Associates' (CA) ACF<b>2</b>, assuming CA chooses to enhance ACF<b>2</b> appropriately. Today, RACF's ID propagation mapping filters support the concept of user &#x2018;A&#x2019; within source security domain A being mapped into user &#x2002;T at a target security domain B in accordance with a &#x2018;mapping filter&#x2019; administratively defined at the target RACF domain. This mapping filter concept can be represented by the following nomenclature: A @ SD maps to B @ TD. Also supported are the concepts of multiple users within a given target domain being mapped into a single RACF userID as in *-* @ SD map to C @ TD, where *-* represents z/OS ID Prop external name component filter mapping elements. Also supported by z/OS ID Prop is the concept of any user at any source domain mapping into a common &#x2018;default&#x2019; userID at the target domain. This concept can be represented as *@* maps into Y at TD, (Y being a default user ID within the target domain). As part of this invention, IBM SAF-RACF is enhanced (in one example) to support an additional identity mapping filter concept in that any user identity at a specified source domain could map into an existing user ID at the target domain (TD) when the user ID at the source domain (SD) matches an existing user ID in the target domain by character string compare. Extending the established nomenclature to illustrate this, the mapping filter would look as follows: * at SD maps to &#x2018;=&#x2019; at TD. In this case, if a given user ID, or more generally a given user security credential, on the source domain is not found within the target domain, then the mapping operation would fail with a &#x2018;user not found&#x2019; message.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Consider the following examples, wherein &#x2018;SD&#x2019; represents the source security domain and the &#x2018;TD&#x2019; represents the target security domain within the same sysplex (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Domain SD consists of one or more z/OS system images that share a common security database, and TD likewise consists of one or more z/OS system images that share a common security database, that is not the same database as systems within domain SD. The security domains and associated databases may or may not be of the same manufacturer and model.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">(1) With one aspect of the present invention, an application running within domain SD (source security domain), in preparation for sending a work request to domain TD (target security domain), invokes the new service (implementation of the invention) with a request for creation of a runtime security context within a system of domain TD. This initial request contains an ID Prop ICRX (a) (as defined in IBM Publication z/OS Security Server RACF Data Areas, IBM Publication No. GA22-7680-11, September 2009) that is partially complete in that it contains identity data for the user consisting of the user's user ID within domain SD as well as the identity of domain SD (realm or registry). This ICRX is considered to be &#x2018;partially complete&#x2019; because it contains only user identity data and not a reference to a cached identity within the ESM (i.e., a security context). This identity data also contains any other user identity differentiating factors that may be present such as the user's session security label (related to multi-level security processing) and/or the user's &#x2018;port-of-entry&#x2019; into the IT complex.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">(2) In another aspect of the invention, that is, the new service (a part of which is running within domain TD, and acting in response to the request from domain SD in accordance with the identity information passed within the ICRX (a), and with the authority predefined within domain TD or domain SD to issue such requests), uses a combination of existing and new functions, with the present invention z/OS Identity Propagation functions (e.g., the mapping support described previously) to create and locally cache an appropriate runtime security context (ACEE) within a system that is within domain TD. In this option, the ID Prop function returns to the new service a complete ICRX (b), with a sysplex scope that &#x201c;references&#x201d; the cached ACEE. This ICRX is referred to as &#x2018;complete&#x2019; because it now includes ESM identity cached reference information.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">(3) An application running in domain SD and using this option would be expected to soon send the ICRX (c) (i.e., the &#x201c;reference&#x201d;) back to domain TD with a work request.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">(4) The IP Prop function running in domain TD subsequently uses the ICRX (or reference) to locate the cached ACEE and use it to establish the security context within domain TD for executing the requested work function.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In another aspect of the present invention, certain applications could choose to have a complete user runtime security context, in the form of a SAF-RACF ENVR object, known as a RACO (b), returned instead of an ICRX. This option will be necessary in certain application scenarios where reliance on a remote cache entry or security database storage device input/output (I/O) processing at the target may not be tolerated (or possible) at some unpredictable future time, such as to recover from an I/O failure. In such cases, the RACO will be retained in main storage by the application within domain SD, then when needed passed back to domain TD along with the work request. New security manager support per the present invention will assign the RACO (c) to the execution thread (e.g., an MVS task) for execution of the work request within domain TD.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">To summarize, the present invention extends the identity translation art to facilite work among systems, such as z/OS system in a sysplex, and potentially across a network. Considering a parallel sysplex example, and considering the sysplex illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there are two interconnected z/OS systems, labeled system <b>1</b> and system <b>2</b>. System <b>1</b> is running ACF<b>2</b> as security manager, and system <b>2</b> is running RACF, that is, a different security product. Alternatively, system <b>1</b> might be running RACF with a set of security definitions in database <b>1</b>, and system <b>2</b> might be running RACF with a different set of security definitions in database <b>2</b>. Thus, a user on system <b>1</b> might have one user identity and on system <b>2</b> a different user identity. In either case, there is a problem if the user might run work on system <b>1</b>, say in an application server such as CICS or Websphere Application Server (WAS), which could spawn additional work to run on system <b>2</b>. In this case, there is an application spawning some work elsewhere in the sysplex of connected z/OS systems. If system <b>1</b> and system <b>2</b> have different security managers, then it is not possible to transfer a copy of the user's local security credentials or security context and use the credentials/context directly on system <b>2</b>, or vice versa. Similarly, even with a single security manager, if system <b>1</b> and system <b>2</b> have different security databases, it may not be possible to directly use the user's credentials or context from system <b>1</b> for work on system <b>2</b>. By way of example, system <b>1</b> is referred below as the source system, and system <b>2</b> the target system. Note that from the view point of system <b>1</b>, system <b>2</b> is a &#x201c;remote&#x201d; system, and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Aspects of the present invention are further described below with reference to the processing flow embodiment thereof illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A &#x26; 2B</figref>. Referring to STEP <b>200</b>, on system <b>1</b>, when an application or other component wishes to send work to system <b>2</b>, it can issue a new query operation providing (a) the user's local security credentials (comprising e.g., a user ID, group membership, port-of-entry, security label, and other security relevant information maintained by the system <b>1</b> security manager), and (b) the destination system's name within the sysplex, or an address in some form if outside of the sysplex. In STEP <b>210</b>, in response to the generated query, the local security manager of system <b>1</b> determines whether the user's security credentials, or alternatively, the user's local security context, is acceptable to the target system. As used herein, a determination of &#x201c;acceptable&#x201d; encompasses two inquiries namely: is the target system using the same security manager as the source system, and if so, is it also using the same security database (or one compatible for user identities, group memberships, etc.)? If the credentials are acceptable, then the local security manager returns an indication to the application or other component (i.e., the caller) that the local security credentials/context can be sent to the target system, and will optionally return an encapsulated copy of the local security credentials (or security context) that the application can send to the target system with its work request.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In STEP <b>220</b>, if the local credentials are deemed unacceptable to the target system, then the local security manager of the source system contacts (via network data flows or sysplex data flows) the local security manager of the target system (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, ACF<b>2</b> in system <b>1</b>) contacts RACF in system <b>2</b>) and provides the user's security credential information in a neutral format understandable by all security managers in the computing environment. By way of example, the distributed-identity-user-name and distributed-identity-registry name defined in z/OS Security Server RACF Command Language Reference, IBM Publication No. SA22-7687-14, Section 5.45, RACMAP Command (October 2009), may be used as a neutral format understandable by all security managers. To facilitate this capability, names may be more tailored in format to z/OS than to distributed systems. There may be additional information provided, as typically supplied on RACROUTE REQUEST=VERIFY (see, for example, z/OS Security Server RACROUTE Macro Reference, IBM Publication No. SA22-7692-12, Section 3.60, 3.61 (September 2009)), including, but not limited to such items as an application name, port-of-entry class and name (e.g., TERMINAL T25), a group name, and a security label. The exact format in which these elements are specified is not relevant for the purposes of the present invention. For example, the neutral format might be USER=name1, GROUP=name2, POECLASS=TERMINAL, POE=T25, or it could be a more structured set of data, such as:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0029">COUNT DC F&#x2032;4&#x2032; (which could be larger value if more fields are supplied, or a smaller value with fewer supplied)</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0030">FIELDNAME1 DC CL8&#x2032;USER&#x2032;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0031">FIELDVALUE1 DC CL8&#x2032;name1&#x2032;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0032">FIELDNAME2 DC CL8&#x2032;GROUP&#x2032;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0033">FIELDVALUE2 DC CL8&#x2032;name2&#x2032;</li>

        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0035">FIELDVALUE3 DC CL8&#x2032;TERMINAL&#x2032;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0036">FIELDNAME4 DC CL8&#x2032;POE&#x2032;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0009" num="0037">FIELDALUE4 DC CL8&#x2032;T25&#x2032;</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0038">Alternatively, the neutral format could be specified in an XML format, etc. The point of the neutral format is that it is a form of keyword/value pairs, providing (for example) information typically associated with RACROUTE REQUEST=VERIFY.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0039">In STEP <b>230</b>, the security manager on the target system (e.g., RACF in system <b>2</b>) receives the neutral format security credentials, and performs a &#x201c;mapping&#x201d; operation using rules established by the system <b>2</b> security administrator(s) to derive a set of security credentials acceptable to system <b>2</b>. This mapping operation may involve: (a) a lookup operation with inputs of the source system user ID and source system name (system <b>1</b>) and possibly additional identification for the system (e.g., sysplex name, network domain, or other). The output is a user ID acceptable to the target system (i.e., system <b>2</b>); (b) a similar lookup operation is performed for each group name(s) provided in the neutral format security credentials, to enable transformation into group names acceptable to the target system; (c) a similar lookup for any port-of-entry information associated with the user is performed, that is if desired by the security administrator of the second system; and (d) a similar lookup is performed for the security label associated with the user by the target system, that is if desired by the security administrator of the target system.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0040">The security manager on the target system in STEP <b>240</b> then constructs either (or both) of the following as requested by the application: (a) an identity context reference (ICRX), which can be subsequently presented to the target system to construct a set of security credentials (i.e., the runtime security context) for the user when needed; or (b) an encapsulated copy of the set of security credentials for the user, acceptable to the local security manager generating them on the target system (i.e., a portable representation of the runtime security context for the user in the target system).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0041">In STEP <b>250</b>, the security manager on the target system returns the results of STEP <b>240</b> to the security manager on the source system, which then forwards the results to the application or component that requested them in STEP <b>200</b>. The application/component subsequently sends work form system <b>1</b> to system <b>2</b> in STEP <b>260</b> using as security credentials (a) the local credentials (or encapsulated local credentials) as returned in STEP <b>210</b>; or (b) the returned ICRX or the returned encapsulated mapped credentials as provided in STEP <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0042">In STEP <b>270</b>, when the target system receives work via STEP <b>260</b>, the local security manager will either locate or reconstruct the appropriate runtime security context based on the supplied ICRX (created by that security manager in STEP <b>240</b>), or will directly use the encapsulated security credentials (i.e., the portable representation of the runtime security context), provided by the application (which, again, were created by this security manager in STEP <b>240</b> originally).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0043">Optionally, the security manager, when providing the encapsulated credentials in STEP <b>240</b>, can protect them from modification through the use of cryptographic caching and digital signature operations, so that in STEP <b>270</b>, the security manager can detect tampering and reject them if they have been modified. This is not needed for the ICRX, since the security manager will rebuild the credentials from an ICRX or will use a copy that it has maintained in its own protected cache, but can be valuable as a protection mechanism for the case where the encapsulated credentials leave the security manager's control and flow back to the application in the source system, and in a particular, one on a different system within the sysplex.</p>

<p id="p-0050" num="0058">Further, other types of computing environments can benefit from one or more aspects of the present invention. As an example, an environment may include an emulator (e.g., software or other emulation mechanisms), in which a particular architecture (including, for instance, instruction execution, architected functions, such as address translation, and architected registers) or a subset thereof is emulated (e.g., on a native computer system having a processor and memory).
