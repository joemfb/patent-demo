<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the following embodiments, silicon is taken as an example of the material of the semiconductor layer and substrate. However, semiconductors other than silicon (e.g., compound semiconductors such as SiC and GaN) can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The semiconductor device of the embodiment includes an integrated circuit (e.g., analog integrated circuit) in which a lateral PNP bipolar transistor (hereinafter also simply referred to as PNP transistor) and other components such as transistors and diodes are provided and integrated on the same substrate.</p>

<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The substrate <b>11</b> can be e.g. a p-type silicon substrate. On the substrate <b>11</b>, an n-type base layer <b>13</b> is provided. In the device region with the PNP transistor <b>10</b> formed therein, between the substrate <b>11</b> and the base layer <b>13</b>, an n-type buried layer <b>12</b> is provided in contact with the substrate <b>11</b> and the base layer <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The n-type impurity concentration of the buried layer <b>12</b> is higher than the n-type impurity concentration of the base layer <b>13</b>. The buried layer <b>12</b> functions as part of the base in the PNP transistor <b>10</b>. By the buried layer <b>12</b>, the PNP transistor <b>10</b> is electrically isolated from the substrate <b>11</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the surface of the base layer <b>13</b> outside the region where the collector layer <b>15</b> surrounds the emitter layer <b>14</b>, an n-type base contact layer <b>16</b> having a higher n-type impurity concentration than the base layer <b>13</b> is provided. Furthermore, on the surface of the base contact layer <b>16</b> is provided an n-type base contact layer <b>19</b> having a higher n-type impurity concentration than the base contact layer <b>16</b>. To the base contact layer <b>19</b>, a base electrode <b>43</b> is ohmically connected.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A device isolation layer <b>25</b> is provided on the surface of the base layer <b>13</b> between the emitter contact layer <b>17</b> and the collector contact layer <b>18</b>, and on the surface of the base layer <b>13</b> between the collector contact layer <b>18</b> and the base contact layer <b>19</b>.

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Furthermore, the device isolation layer <b>25</b> is provided also on the surface of the base layer <b>13</b> outside the region provided with the PNP transistor <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">On the surface side of the base layer <b>13</b> between the emitter layer <b>14</b> and the collector layer <b>15</b>, an n-type first guard ring layer <b>21</b> is provided. The first guard ring layer <b>21</b> is not in contact with the emitter layer <b>14</b> and the collector layer <b>15</b>, but spaced from the emitter layer <b>14</b> and the collector layer <b>15</b>. The upper portion of the first guard ring layer <b>21</b> reaches the device isolation layer <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Below the first guard ring layer <b>21</b>, an n-type second guard ring layer <b>22</b> is provided.

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The n-type impurity concentration of the first guard ring layer <b>21</b> and the n-type impurity concentration of the second guard ring layer <b>22</b> are higher than the n-type impurity concentration of the base layer <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an n-type impurity concentration profile in the depth direction of the first guard ring layer <b>21</b> and the second guard ring layer <b>22</b> by a solid line. The horizontal axis represents the depth direction of the first guard ring layer <b>21</b> and the second guard ring layer <b>22</b> (thickness direction of the base layer <b>13</b>). The vertical axis represents the n-type impurity concentration (cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The first guard ring layer <b>21</b> has an n-type impurity concentration profile decreasing toward the second guard ring layer <b>22</b> side. The second guard ring layer <b>22</b> has an n-type impurity concentration profile decreasing toward the first guard ring layer <b>21</b> side.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As described later, the first guard ring layer <b>21</b> is formed by implanting n-type impurity by the ion implantation process and thermally diffusing the implanted n-type impurity. The first guard ring layer <b>21</b> has a peak of impurity concentration in the vicinity of the implantation position of n-type impurity. From the peak position toward the second guard ring layer <b>22</b> side, the n-type impurity concentration decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Likewise, as described later, the second guard ring layer <b>22</b> is formed by implanting n-type impurity by the ion implantation process and thermally diffusing the implanted n-type impurity. The second guard ring layer <b>22</b> has a peak of impurity concentration in the vicinity of the implantation position of n-type impurity. From the peak position toward the first guard ring layer <b>21</b> side, the n-type impurity concentration decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">That is, the first guard ring layer <b>21</b> and the second guard ring layer <b>22</b> are connected as an n-type region having a higher impurity concentration than the base layer <b>13</b> by thermal diffusion of n-type impurity. In the vicinity of the connected portion (the boundary between the first guard ring layer <b>21</b> and the second guard ring layer <b>22</b>), the n-type impurity concentration has a local minimum.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The n-type impurity concentration of the base layer <b>13</b> is nearly constant in its thickness direction. For instance, as indicated by a dot-dashed line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the n-type impurity concentration of the base layer <b>13</b> is approximately 1.5&#xd7;10<sup>15 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>. The minimum of the n-type impurity concentration of the first guard ring layer <b>21</b> and the minimum of the n-type impurity concentration of the second guard ring layer <b>22</b> are higher than the n-type impurity concentration of the base layer <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The n-type impurity concentration of the buried layer <b>12</b> is e.g. approximately 10<sup>18 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>. The maximum of the n-type impurity concentration of the first guard ring layer <b>21</b> and the maximum of the n-type impurity concentration of the second guard ring layer <b>22</b> are lower than the maximum of the n-type impurity concentration of the buried layer <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the first guard ring layer <b>21</b> continuously surrounds the periphery of the emitter layer <b>14</b>. The second guard ring layer <b>22</b> has nearly the same width as the first guard ring layer <b>21</b> and is provided below the first guard ring layer <b>21</b>. The second guard ring layer <b>22</b> continuously surrounds the region of the base layer <b>13</b> below the emitter layer <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">That is, the periphery and lower side of the emitter layer <b>14</b> are surrounded with the first guard ring layer <b>21</b>, the second guard ring layer <b>22</b>, and the buried layer <b>12</b>, which have a higher n-type impurity concentration and a higher density of electrons to be recombined with holes than the base layer <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Outside the region provided with the PNP transistor <b>10</b>, a device isolation layer <b>26</b> is provided. The device isolation layer <b>26</b> has e.g. a deep trench isolation (DTI) structure. In this structure, an insulating film such as silicon oxide film is buried in a trench penetrating from the surface device isolation layer <b>25</b> through the base layer <b>13</b> and the buried layer <b>12</b> to the substrate <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Further outside the device isolation layer <b>26</b>, a diffusion type device isolation layer including a p-type buried layer <b>23</b> and a p-type device isolation layer <b>24</b> is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The p-type buried layer <b>23</b> is spaced from the n-type buried layer <b>12</b> and provided at nearly the same depth as the n-type buried layer <b>12</b>. The p-type device isolation layer <b>24</b> has a lower p-type impurity concentration than the p-type buried layer <b>23</b>. The p-type device isolation layer <b>24</b> is provided above the p-type buried layer <b>23</b> and extends to the surface device isolation layer <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The device isolation layer <b>26</b> of the DTI structure continuously surrounds the periphery of the region provided with the PNP transistor <b>10</b>. Outside the device isolation layer <b>26</b> of the DTI structure, the diffusion type device isolation layer continuously surrounds the periphery of the region provided with the PNP transistor <b>10</b>. The PNP transistor <b>10</b> is isolated from other components formed on the same substrate <b>11</b> by the device isolation layer <b>26</b> and the diffusion type device isolation layer.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the PNP transistor <b>10</b> described above, to the PN junction of the emitter layer <b>14</b> and the base layer <b>13</b> is applied a forward voltage. Thus, majority carriers (holes) in the emitter layer <b>14</b> are injected into the base layer <b>13</b>. To the PN junction of the collector layer <b>15</b> and the base layer <b>13</b> is applied a reverse voltage. Thus, the holes injected into the base layer <b>13</b> and not eliminated in the base layer <b>13</b> flow to the collector layer <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Downsizing of the lateral PNP transistor <b>10</b> results in decreasing the distance between the emitter layer <b>14</b> and the collector layer <b>15</b>. Thus, the amplification factor (h<sub>FE</sub>) tends to increase. The amplification factor higher than necessary may cause the problem of e.g. oscillation.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">However, according to the embodiment, in the base layer <b>13</b>, in the portion between the emitter layer <b>14</b> and the collector layer <b>15</b> and in the portion therebelow, a first guard ring layer <b>21</b> and a second guard ring layer <b>22</b> having a higher n-type impurity concentration than the base layer <b>13</b> are provided. The first guard ring layer <b>21</b> reaches the device isolation layer <b>25</b>. The second guard ring layer <b>22</b> reaches the buried layer <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Hence, migration of the holes, which have been injected from the emitter layer <b>14</b> into the base layer <b>13</b>, to the collector layer <b>15</b> side is limited by the first guard ring layer <b>21</b> and the second guard ring layer <b>22</b>. Thus, the device size (the distance between the emitter layer <b>14</b> and the collector layer <b>15</b>) can be reduced while suppressing the increase of the amplification factor. The PNP transistor according to the embodiment can reduce the device size, and is suitable for integration with other devices.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">By reduction of the device size, the distance between the emitter layer <b>14</b> and the collector layer <b>15</b> is shortened. This causes concern about punch-through and leakage. In punch-through, the depletion layer extended from the emitter layer <b>14</b> side and the depletion layer extended from the collector layer <b>15</b> side are connected. However, the first guard ring layer <b>21</b> and the second guard ring layer <b>22</b> of the embodiment can prevent the above punch-through.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Here, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows a first comparative example. In the structure of the first comparative example, for instance, a p-type emitter layer <b>14</b> is provided in an n-type well layer <b>61</b> having a higher n-type impurity concentration than the base layer <b>13</b> and limiting the hole current.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">However, in this first comparative example, the p-type emitter layer <b>14</b> and the n-type well layer <b>61</b> having a relatively high impurity concentration are in contact with each other. Thus, the emitter-base breakdown voltage is likely to decrease.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In contrast, according to the embodiment, the n-type first guard ring layer <b>21</b> and the n-type second guard ring layer <b>22</b> for limiting the hole current are spaced from the p-type emitter layer <b>14</b>, and not in contact therewith. This can suppress the decrease of the emitter-base breakdown voltage, and achieve an emitter-base breakdown voltage comparable to the emitter-collector breakdown voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in the vicinity of the connected portion of the first guard ring layer <b>21</b> and the second guard ring layer <b>22</b> (the boundary between the first guard ring layer <b>21</b> and the second guard ring layer <b>22</b>), the n-type impurity concentration is made relatively lower than the other portion.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Hence, the holes injected from the emitter layer <b>14</b> into the base layer <b>13</b> pass primarily through the vicinity of the boundary between the first guard ring layer <b>21</b> and the second guard ring layer <b>22</b> and flow to the collector layer <b>15</b>. Hence, the amplification factor can be controlled by controlling the n-type impurity concentration in the vicinity of the boundary between the first guard ring layer <b>21</b> and the second guard ring layer <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The integrated circuit including the PNP transistor <b>10</b> of the embodiment can be used as e.g. a battery monitoring IC. Then, the PNP transistor <b>10</b> is required to have a breakdown voltage of 50 V or more. For instance, the breakdown voltage of the PNP transistor <b>10</b> of the embodiment is approximately 80-100 V. Thus, the thickness of the base layer <b>13</b> is designed to be 5 &#x3bc;m or more (such as 6 &#x3bc;m).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the base layer <b>13</b> having a thickness of 5 &#x3bc;m or more, n-type impurity is injected and thermally diffused on the surface side of the base layer <b>13</b>. However, a high concentration n-type region having an n-type impurity concentration of approximately 10<sup>16 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, higher than that of the base layer <b>13</b>, is difficult to form throughout the thickness of the base layer <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows a second comparative example. In the second comparative example, the guard ring layer <b>21</b> does not reach the buried layer <b>12</b>. This allows holes to flow through the base layer <b>13</b> between the guard ring layer <b>21</b> and the buried layer <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In contrast, according to the embodiment, as described below, the first guard ring layer <b>21</b> and the second guard ring layer <b>22</b> are formed as an integrated n-type semiconductor layer connected in the thickness direction of the base layer <b>13</b> by thermal diffusion of n-type impurity implanted to different depths by the ion implantation process.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3C</figref> are schematic sectional views for describing a method for manufacturing the PNP transistor <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, on the surface side of the substrate <b>11</b>, a first n-type impurity <b>51</b> schematically indicated by open circles and a second n-type impurity <b>52</b> schematically indicated by cross marks are implanted by the ion implantation process. The first n-type impurity <b>51</b> is implanted into a region for forming the aforementioned n-type buried layer <b>12</b>. The second n-type impurity <b>52</b> is implanted into a region for forming the aforementioned second guard ring layer <b>22</b>. This region is smaller than the implantation region of the first n-type impurity <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The first n-type impurity <b>51</b> is e.g. antimony. The second n-type impurity <b>52</b> is e.g. phosphorus, having a faster diffusion rate than the first n-type impurity <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">After ion implantation of the first n-type impurity <b>51</b> and the second n-type impurity <b>52</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, an n-type base layer <b>13</b> is formed on the substrate <b>11</b> by e.g. the epitaxial growth process.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Then, in the base layer <b>13</b> above the implantation position of the second n-type impurity <b>52</b>, a third n-type impurity <b>53</b> schematically indicated by filled circles are ion implanted. The third n-type impurity <b>53</b> can be the same as the second n-type impurity <b>52</b>, such as phosphorus.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Then, by annealing, the first n-type impurity <b>51</b>, the second n-type impurity <b>52</b>, and the third n-type impurity <b>53</b> are simultaneously subjected to thermal diffusion.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">By the thermal diffusion of the first n-type impurity <b>51</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, an n-type buried layer <b>12</b> is formed in the vicinity of the boundary between the substrate <b>11</b> and the base layer <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The second n-type impurity <b>52</b> and the third n-type impurity <b>53</b> are each diffused in the thickness direction of the base layer <b>13</b>, and connected in the thickness direction of the base layer <b>13</b> as a first guard ring layer <b>21</b> and a second guard ring layer <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The second n-type impurity <b>52</b> and the first n-type impurity <b>51</b> are implanted to the same depth in the substrate <b>11</b>. However, the second n-type impurity <b>52</b> has a faster diffusion rate than the first n-type impurity <b>51</b>. Hence, the second n-type impurity <b>52</b> extends and diffuses further than the first n-type impurity <b>51</b> in the thickness direction of the base layer <b>13</b> (the thickness direction of the substrate <b>11</b>). Thus, the diffused region of the second n-type impurity <b>52</b> is connected to the region of the third n-type impurity <b>53</b> diffused downward.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Here, the second n-type impurity <b>52</b> diffuses below the buried layer <b>12</b>. Part of the second guard ring layer <b>22</b> is projected also below the buried layer <b>12</b>. Alternatively, depending on the implantation depth of the second n-type impurity <b>52</b> and the thickness of the buried layer <b>12</b>, the second guard ring layer <b>22</b> may not be projected below the buried layer <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The second n-type impurity <b>52</b> is implanted on the surface side of the substrate <b>11</b> before forming the base layer <b>13</b>. Thus, the second n-type impurity <b>52</b> does not need to be implanted into a deep position of the thick base layer <b>13</b>. This facilitates the process.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The second n-type impurity <b>52</b> and the third n-type impurity <b>53</b> are not limited to phosphorus, but may be arsenic.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As described above, the embodiment can easily form an n-type guard ring layer having a higher n-type impurity concentration than the base layer <b>13</b> throughout the thickness of the base layer <b>13</b> even if e.g. a breakdown voltage of 50 V or more is required and the thickness of the base layer <b>13</b> is 5 &#x3bc;m or more.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic sectional view of a semiconductor device of an alternative embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In this embodiment, the device isolation layer of the DTI structure is not provided. By the diffusion type device isolation layer (n-type device isolation layer <b>24</b> and n-type buried layer <b>23</b>), the PNP transistor <b>10</b> is isolated from other devices on the same substrate <b>11</b>.
