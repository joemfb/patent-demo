<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an image forming apparatus, a method of controlling this apparatus and an image forming system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An image forming apparatus to which a sheet feeding unit can be added on as an optional unit in order to increase the capacity for stacking a sheet material has been proposed. Such an optional unit executes the sheet feeding operation in response to a feeding instruction transmitted from the engine controller of the image forming apparatus. The engine controller terminates the sheet feeding operation when a sensor provided on the optional unit senses the leading edge of a sheet. If the leading edge of a sheet cannot be sensed by the sensor despite the fact that sheet feeding has been instructed, on the other hand, then the engine controller causes the optional unit to retry the sheet feeding operation (see the specification of Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2005-272083).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Assume here that the optional unit transmits status data to the image forming apparatus by serial communication. Assume also that the result of sensing by the sensor provided on the optional unit to sense a sheet also is transmitted as status data.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When optional units are provided in multiple stages, however, the status data sent by serial communication is delayed and there is the danger that this will hamper an increase in the sheet conveying speed. That is, if the optional unit is provided in multiple stages and with higher functionality, there is an increase in optional-unit status data to be checked by the engine controller. As a result, there is a widening of the update interval of the status data that includes the result of sensing by the sensor and, hence, the real-time nature of the status data is lost.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">On the other hand, the higher the sheet conveying speed is made, the shorter the time between sheets becomes during continuous printing and, hence, the more difficult it becomes for the sensor to sense the sheet-to-sheet interval. Here the &#x201c;time between sheets&#x201d; refers to the difference between the times at which at the trailing edge of a preceding sheet and the leading edge of the succeeding sheet pass by a prescribed position. Further, the &#x201c;sheet-to-sheet&#x201d; interval refers to the interval between the trailing edge of a preceding sheet and the leading edge of the succeeding sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to solve this problem, it will suffice to enlarge the sheet-to-sheet interval in such a manner that the sensor can sense the sheet-to-sheet interval reliably. However, this will lower the maximum throughput of the image forming apparatus. On the other hand, if a dedicated signal line separate from a serial signal line is provided and the sensor information is sent to the image forming apparatus via this line, throughput can be maintained. However, this can lead to higher cost.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, the present invention seeks to solve one of these problems or other problems. For example, the present invention seeks to provide an image forming apparatus in which throughput can be maintained without increasing the number of signal lines. Other problems will be understood from the entirety of the specification.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention can be implemented as an image forming apparatus connected to one or more detachable sheet feeding units. A transmitting unit transmits a feeding instruction via a signal line to a sheet feeding unit that is to perform sheet feeding. A first sheet detector, which is placed in the sheet feeding unit, detects a sheet that has been fed from the sheet feeding unit. A second sheet detector is provided downstream of the first sheet detector in terms of the sheet conveyance direction. A receiving unit receives status data, which includes results of detection performed by the first and second sheet detectors, via the signal line. If the feeding instruction is transmitted and a plurality of sheets are fed from the sheet feeding unit, an image formation controller determines whether to cause the image forming operation to continue or stop based upon whether a sheet-to-sheet interval of a plurality of sheets has been detected by the second sheet detector in a state in which the result of detection by the first sheet detector indicates presence of a sheet. It should be noted that the present invention may be implemented as an image forming system and method of controlling an image forming apparatus.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the drawings. It should be noted that the relative arrangement of the components, the numerical expressions and numerical values set forth in these embodiments do not limit the scope of the present invention unless it is specifically stated otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">[First Embodiment]</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic view illustrating the configuration of an image forming apparatus according to a first embodiment of the present invention. The image forming apparatus can be implemented as a printer, copier, multifunction peripheral or facsimile machine, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">[Main Body of Image Forming Apparatus]</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">An image forming apparatus has a main body <b>100</b> also referred to as a printer engine. A toner cartridge <b>101</b>, which is capable of being removably loaded in the main body <b>100</b>, contains toner. A photosensitive drum <b>102</b> is an image carrier for carrying an electrostatic latent image and a toner image, etc. A semiconductor laser <b>103</b> is a light source that irradiates the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>102</b>, which has been uniformly charged, with a laser beam <b>106</b>. A rotating polygon mirror <b>105</b> is driven and rotated by a scanner motor <b>104</b>, thereby deflecting the laser beam back and forth.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A charging roller <b>107</b> charges the photosensitive drum <b>102</b> uniformly. A developing unit <b>108</b> uses toner to develop an electrostatic latent image that has been formed on the photosensitive drum <b>102</b>. A transfer roller <b>109</b> transfers the toner image, which has been formed by the developing unit <b>108</b>, to a sheet. A fixing unit, which comprises a fixing heater <b>110</b> and a fixing film <b>111</b>, thermally fuses the toner image that as been transferred to the sheet. It should be noted that the term &#x201c;sheet&#x201d; may also be referred to as printing paper, printing material, print medium, transfer material or transfer paper.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A cassette tray <b>112</b> accommodates sheets within the main body. A size sensor <b>113</b> senses the size of the sheets accommodated in the cassette tray <b>112</b>. A cassette-loaded sensor <b>114</b> is a sensor for determining whether the cassette tray <b>112</b> has been loaded in the main body <b>100</b>. A cassette-sheet sensor <b>115</b> is a sensor for detecting whether sheets have been stacked in the cassette tray <b>112</b>. A pick-up roller <b>116</b> is one example of a sheet feeder which, by being rotated through one revolution, feeds a sheet from the cassette tray <b>112</b> to a conveyance path. A roller pair <b>117</b> is a pair of rollers for feeding a sheet, which has been picked up by the pick-up roller <b>116</b>, to the conveyance path. When a plurality of sheets have been picked up, the roller pair <b>117</b> functions to separate the sheets into individual sheets. That is, the roller pair <b>117</b> comprises feed retard rollers, by way of example.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">An intermediate roller <b>118</b> is one example of a conveyance unit for conveying a sheet, which has been fed from the cassette tray <b>112</b>, to an image forming unit. Here the image forming unit signifies mainly the photosensitive drum <b>102</b>, etc. A pre-feed sensor <b>119</b> is a sensor for sensing the leading and trailing edges of a sheet that has been transported by the intermediate roller <b>118</b>. Pre-transfer rollers <b>120</b> form a conveyance unit for feeding a conveyed sheet to the photosensitive drum <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A top sensor <b>121</b> is an example of a measuring unit for measuring the length of a fed sheet in the direction of conveyance. The top sensor <b>121</b> is also one example of a second sheet detector provided in the conveyance path downstream of a first sheet detector (e.g., conveyance sensors <b>133</b>, <b>141</b>) along the direction of conveyance. The result of detection performed by the top sensor <b>121</b> is utilized in order to synchronize the writing (recording/printing) of an image to the photosensitive drum <b>102</b> and the conveyance of the sheet. For this reason, the top sensor <b>121</b> may also be referred to as a &#x201c;registration sensor&#x201d;. A fixing sensor <b>122</b> is a sensor for sensing whether or not a sheet is present after fixing of an image. Conveyance rollers <b>123</b> form a conveyance unit for discharging a sheet, onto which an image has been fixed, to a sheet ejection path. Sheet ejection rollers <b>124</b> are rollers in a forward direction in order to eject a sheet, which has been transported by the conveyance rollers <b>123</b>, onto a drop tray <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">[Optional Unit (Sheet Feeding Unit)]</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A first-stage optional cassette <b>126</b> is one example of a sheet feeding unit detachable with respect to the main body <b>100</b>. A first-stage optional cassette tray <b>127</b> is one example of a sheet accommodating unit for accommodating sheets. A first-stage cassette-loaded sensor <b>128</b> is a sensor for determining whether the first-stage optional cassette tray <b>127</b> has been loaded. A first-stage size sensor <b>129</b> senses the size of the sheets stacked in the first-stage optional cassette tray <b>127</b>. A first-stage sheet sensor <b>130</b> is a sensor for detecting whether sheets are present in the cassette tray <b>127</b>. A first-stage pick-up roller <b>131</b> is one example of a sheet feeder which, by being rotated through one revolution, feeds a sheet from the first-stage optional cassette tray <b>127</b> to the conveyance path. A first-stage roller pair <b>132</b> is an example of a conveyance unit a pair of rollers for feeding a sheet, which has been picked up by the first-stage pick-up roller <b>131</b>, to the conveyance path.

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">An engine control CPU <b>301</b> is the core control circuit of the engine controller <b>202</b>. The engine control CPU <b>301</b> functions as feeding-failure determination unit and image formation controller. The feeding-failure determination unit decides that feeding failure has occurred if the status data indicates absence of a sheet continuously from transmission of feeding instruction until elapse of a first threshold time. The first threshold time is decided from the standpoint of detecting feeding failure in the sheet feeding unit, by way of example. The image formation controller stops image formation if feeding failure has been detected. On the other hand, the image formation controller allows image formation to continue if, after transmission of a feeding instruction, the status data indicates a change from absence of a sheet to presence of a sheet before the first threshold time elapses.

In this case, the engine control CPU <b>301</b> allows image formation to continue when a sheet-to-sheet interval within the second threshold time has been detected. The second threshold time is decided in order to detect sheet-retention jam that occurs in the conveyance path, by way of example. On the other hand, the engine control CPU <b>301</b> causes image formation to stop when a sheet-to-sheet interval cannot be detected even upon elapse of the second threshold time. It should be noted that the second sheet-to-sheet interval detector may also function in a case where the sheet-to-sheet interval cannot be detected by the first sheet-to-sheet interval detector.

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Serial communication between the engine control CPU <b>301</b> and control CPUs <b>302</b>, <b>303</b> is executed in sync with a clock signal (referred to as a &#x201c;CLK signal&#x201d; below) that a clock generator <b>311</b> of the engine control CPU <b>301</b> outputs to a CLK signal line <b>304</b>. &#x201c;CLK&#x201d; is the abbreviation of &#x201c;clock&#x201d;.

If the CMD signal switch <b>307</b> is not connected, then the command which the engine control CPU <b>301</b> transmits via the CMD signal line <b>305</b> is not sent to the control CPU <b>303</b>. The same hold true for a CMD signal switch <b>308</b>. In accordance with a changeover instruction that is output from a changeover unit <b>334</b> of the control CPU <b>302</b>, the CMD signal switch <b>308</b> electrically changes over the CMD signal line <b>305</b> to connect it to or disconnect it from the optional cassette downstream.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The engine control CPU <b>301</b> assigns device IDs to the control CPUs of each of the optical cassettes in order to perform communication with all of the connected optional cassettes. The assignment of an ID is executed by transmitting a device-ID designating command that specifies the device ID (e.g., device ID=1).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">When assignment starts (e.g., at the introduction of power, etc.), the control CPU <b>302</b> of the first-stage optional cassette is placed in the disconnected state. Consequently, the device-ID designating command is not transmitted to the control CPUs of the optional cassettes from those of the second stage onward. Thus, the control CPU of each optional cassette holds its own CMD signal switch in the disconnected state until the device ID is assigned.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Upon receiving the device-ID designating command in a state in which a device ID has not been assigned, the control CPU <b>302</b> stores the specified device ID (device ID=1) in a storage unit within the CPU as its own ID. The storage unit is implemented by a memory or the like. The status transmission unit <b>322</b> transmits the fact that device ID=1 has been decided to the engine control CPU <b>301</b> via the STS signal line <b>306</b> as status sent back in response to the device-ID designating command. The changeover unit <b>324</b> thenceforth changes over the CMD signal switch <b>307</b> to the connected state.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The engine control CPU <b>301</b> determines whether the status data indicates that the device ID (device ID=1) has been decided for the first-stage optional cassette <b>126</b>. If the device ID of the optional cassette <b>126</b> is decided, then the engine control CPU <b>301</b> transmits a device-ID designating command that specifies another ID (e.g., device ID=2). Since the CMD signal switch <b>307</b> is in the connected state at this time, this device-ID designating command is transmitted to the control CPUs <b>302</b> and <b>303</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Since the device ID has already been decided, the control CPU <b>302</b> ignores the device-ID (device ID=2) designating command. On the other hand, if a device ID has not been assigned, then the control CPU <b>303</b> of the second-stage optional cassette stores device ID=2 in the storage unit as its own ID. The status transmission unit <b>322</b> transmits the fact that device ID=2 has been decided to the engine control CPU <b>301</b> via the STS signal line <b>306</b> as status sent back. The changeover unit <b>334</b> thenceforth changes over the CMD signal switch <b>308</b> to the connected state.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">From this point onward, the engine control CPU <b>301</b> sets different device IDs and transmits the device-ID designating command until status sent back in response to the ID-designating command can no longer be received from optional cassettes. As a result, device IDs specific to all optional cassettes connected to the image forming apparatus directly or indirectly can be assigned.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">After the device IDs of all connected optional cassettes have been decided, the engine controller <b>202</b> transmits a command designating a device ID to the optional cassette that is desired to be operated. As a result, each of the optional cassettes can be controlled individually.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">With serial communication, generally an interval in which a command is transmitted and an interval in which status data is transmitted repeat alternatingly along the time axis. If the status-data transmission interval is divided into a plurality of data intervals and each data interval is assigned to a device ID, then status data of each optional cassette with respect to one command can be acquired by the engine controller <b>202</b> by a single communication operation. It should be noted that if a data interval is divided, the amount of data that can be transmitted by one optional cassette decreases. Further, if the type of sensor data, etc., increases, then the sensor information must be transmitted a plurality of times and the period of time over which specific sensor information is updated is prolonged. The real-time nature of specific sensor information thus tends to be lost.</p>

The control CPUs of the optional cassettes receive the data one bit at a time in sync with the rising edge of the clock on the CLK signal line <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a command comprises ID designating codes of C<b>0</b>, C<b>1</b> and data codes of D<b>0</b> to D<b>13</b>.

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">When status data is output over the STS signal line <b>306</b>, the control CPU <b>302</b> outputs &#x201c;0&#x201d; as the first bit of data in sync with the falling edge of the signal on the CLK signal line <b>304</b>. Next, the control CPU <b>302</b> outputs status data SO to S<b>13</b> and parity data P of S<b>0</b> to S<b>13</b> serving as an error detection code.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">It should be noted that the control CPU <b>303</b> of the second-stage optional cassette does not output status data if the ID of a command is not the device ID assigned to itself.

<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> are flowcharts illustrating a control method according to the first embodiment. Here it is assumed that a sheet is fed from the first-stage optional cassette <b>126</b> connected to the main body <b>100</b>. Further, assume that the engine control CPU <b>301</b> checks the state of sheet conveyance using the first-stage conveyance sensor <b>133</b> and top sensor <b>121</b>. States of sheet conveyance include, e.g., presence of a sheet, absence of a sheet, sheet-to-sheet interval, retention jamming and delay jamming, etc. It should be noted that the second-stage optional cassette <b>134</b> may just as well be the cassette that is to feed a sheet. In such case the structural elements of the second-stage optional cassette should be read in place of the structural elements of the first-stage optional cassette. Further, a sheet sensor other than the top sensor <b>121</b> may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">It is assumed that if the printer controller <b>201</b> specifies continuous printing, the engine control CPU <b>301</b> adjusts the feed timing in such a manner that the sheet-to-sheet interval between a preceding sheet and the succeeding sheet will be rendered constant. Here &#x201c;preceding sheet&#x201d; means the sheet ahead of the sheet that follows, and &#x201c;succeeding sheet&#x201d; means the sheet that follows the sheet ahead.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">At step S<b>501</b>, the engine control CPU <b>301</b> determines whether the timing for the feeding of a sheet has arrived. Whether or not this timing has arrived is judged based upon whether the top sensor <b>121</b> has sensed the trailing edge of a sheet, by way of example. Naturally a timing at which another sheet sensor has sensed the trailing or leading edge of a sheet may be employed as the criterion. When the timing for feeding a sheet arrives, control proceeds to step S<b>502</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">At step S<b>502</b>, the command transmission unit <b>312</b> of the engine control CPU <b>301</b> transmits, via the CMD signal line <b>305</b>, a feed designating command that specifies the first-stage optional cassette as the destination. Upon receiving this feed designating command, the control CPU <b>302</b> starts the sheet feeding operation. For example, the control CPU <b>302</b> drives the first-stage pick-up roller <b>131</b> by driving a solenoid, which is not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">At step S<b>503</b>, the engine control CPU <b>301</b> causes a first timer to start timekeeping (counting) from an initial value in order to detect feeding failure. It is assumed that the first timer is incorporated within the engine control CPU <b>301</b>. At step S<b>504</b>, the engine control CPU <b>301</b> causes a second timer to start timekeeping (counting) from an initial value in order to detect the state of sheet conveyance in accordance with the result of sensing by the top sensor <b>121</b>. It is assumed that the second timer also is incorporated within the engine control CPU <b>301</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">At step S<b>505</b>, the engine control CPU <b>301</b> clears a feed sheet-to-sheet interval flag. &#x201c;Clear&#x201d; is synonymous with the resetting of the feed sheet-to-sheet interval flag. The feed sheet-to-sheet interval flag is a flag that is set when the first-stage conveyance sensor <b>133</b> has sensed the sheet-to-sheet interval between a preceding sheet and the succeeding sheet. If a sheet-to-sheet interval has not been sensed, the feed sheet-to-sheet interval flag is maintained in the initial (reset) state.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">At step S<b>506</b>, the engine control CPU <b>301</b> determines whether &#x201c;sheet present&#x201d; is indicated by the result of sensing by the conveyance sensor <b>133</b> included in the status data received by the status receiving unit <b>313</b>. It should be noted that it is permissible to presume that the command transmission unit <b>312</b> transmits a command, which requests the result of sensing by the first-stage conveyance sensor <b>133</b>, to the first-stage optional cassette <b>126</b> in advance. If presence of a sheet cannot be sensed (i.e., if absence of a sheet is sensed), control proceeds to step S<b>507</b>. If presence of a sheet is sensed, control proceeds to step S<b>515</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">At step S<b>507</b>, the engine control CPU <b>301</b> sets the feed sheet-to-sheet interval flag. Then, at step S<b>508</b>, the engine control CPU <b>301</b> monitors the value of the count in the first timer and determines whether counting has ended. For example, the engine control CPU <b>301</b> checks to determine whether the value of the count has exceeded the first threshold time decided in order to detect feeding failure such as sheet-feed delay jamming. &#x201c;Sheet-feed delay jamming&#x201d; refers to jamming in which a sheet does not reach a prescribed position within a prescribed period of time following transmission of a feeding instruction. Sheet-feed delay jamming can result from failure to pick up a sheet in an optional cassette or can be caused by jamming of a sheet that occurs in the conveyance path ahead of the conveyance sensor. Control returns to step S<b>506</b> if counting by the first timer has not ended. If counting by the first time has ended, on the other hand, then the engine control CPU <b>301</b> recognizes that this means failure of the pick-up roller <b>131</b> to feed a sheet. Accordingly, the engine control CPU <b>301</b> executes a retry operation (steps S<b>509</b> to S<b>513</b>) as a recovery measure.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">At step S<b>509</b>, the engine control CPU <b>301</b> again transmits a feed designating command to the control CPU <b>302</b> of the first-stage optional cassette via the CMD signal line <b>305</b>. Upon receiving this feed designating command, the control CPU <b>302</b> executes the sheet feeding operation again.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">At step S<b>510</b>, the engine control CPU <b>301</b> restarts the counting by the first timer for detecting feed delay. That is, the first timer starts counting again from the initial value. Next, at step S<b>512</b>, the engine control CPU <b>301</b> restarts the counting by the second timer for detecting retention jamming. That is, the second timer start counting again from the initial value.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">At step S<b>513</b>, the engine control CPU <b>301</b> determines whether sheet-feed delay jamming has occurred based upon whether or not counting by the first timer has ended. If counting by the first timer has ended, then the engine control CPU <b>301</b> recognizes that sheet-feed delay jamming has occurred and executes jam troubleshoot processing. This is processing for stopping image formation or displaying an error message, by way of example.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">If counting by the first timer has ended, on the other hand, then control proceeds to step S<b>514</b>. Here the engine control CPU <b>301</b> determines whether the conveyance sensor <b>133</b> has detected presence of a sheet. The details of step S<b>513</b> are as described above at step S<b>506</b>. If presence of a sheet cannot be detected, then control returns to step S<b>513</b>. If presence of paper can be detected, on the other hand, then this means that sheet feeding has succeeded and, hence, control proceeds to step S<b>517</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">If the conveyance sensor <b>133</b> senses presence of a sheet at step S<b>506</b>, control proceeds to step S<b>515</b>, as described above. At step S<b>515</b>, the engine control CPU <b>301</b> determines whether the feed sheet-to-sheet interval flag has been set. It should be noted that if the feed sheet-to-sheet interval flag has been set, this indicates that absence of a sheet and presence of a sheet have been detected one time (i.e., that the sheet-to-sheet interval has been detected). This also means that feeding has succeeded. In this case, control proceeds to step S<b>517</b>. On the other hand, if the feed sheet-to-sheet interval flag is found to still be in the reset state, this indicates that the state of paper presence is continuing. This means that retention jamming has occurred in the vicinity of the conveyance sensor <b>133</b> or that the sheet-to-sheet interval is too short and could not be detected. Alternatively, there is the possibility that the engine control CPU <b>301</b> could detect the sheet-to-sheet interval because, although the conveyance sensor <b>133</b> could detect the sheet-to-sheet interval, a communication delay or communication error occurred in the status data representing the absence or presence of a sheet. At this time, therefore, a conclusion cannot be drawn as to what event has occurred. Accordingly, control proceeds to step S<b>516</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">At step S<b>516</b>, the engine control CPU <b>301</b> determines whether counting by the first timer has ended. If counting has not ended, control returns to step S<b>506</b>. If counting has ended, on the other hand, then control proceeds to step S<b>517</b> in order to detect the sheet-to-sheet interval based upon the top sensor <b>121</b> and second timer. One reason for the end of counting by the first timer is that the sheet-to-sheet interval could not be detected because a communication delay or communication error occurred in the status data.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">At step S<b>517</b>, the engine control CPU <b>301</b> resets a conveyance sheet-to-sheet interval flag. The conveyance sheet-to-sheet interval flag is a flag that is set when the top sensor <b>121</b> senses the sheet-to-sheet interval. At step S<b>518</b>, the engine control CPU <b>301</b> determines whether the top sensor <b>121</b> has sensed presence (absence) of a sheet. The fact that the top sensor <b>121</b> has sensed absence of a sheet means that the sheet-to-sheet interval could be detected. Control therefore proceeds to step S<b>519</b>, where the engine control CPU <b>301</b> sets the conveyance sheet-to-sheet interval flag. Then, at step S<b>520</b>, the engine control CPU <b>301</b> determines whether counting by the second timer has ended. If counting by the second timer has not ended, control returns to step S<b>518</b>. Whether or not counting has ended is determined based upon whether or not the value of the count in the second timer has exceeded the second threshold time.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The fact that the second time has finished counting means that although a sheet could be detected in the optional cassette <b>126</b>, this sheet could not be detected in the main body <b>100</b> of the image forming apparatus. If the second timer has finished counting, the fact that sheet-feed delay jamming has occurred is recognized and the engine control CPU <b>301</b> execute jam troubleshoot processing.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">If presence of a sheet has been detected at step S<b>518</b>, then control proceeds to step S<b>521</b>, where the engine control CPU <b>301</b> determines whether the second timer has finished counting. It should be noted that step S<b>521</b> is processing similar to that at step S<b>520</b>. If counting has ended, retention jamming has occurred. Accordingly, the engine control CPU <b>301</b> executes jam troubleshoot processing. If counting has not ended, control proceeds to step S<b>522</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">At step S<b>522</b>, the engine control CPU <b>301</b> determines whether the conveyance sheet-to-sheet interval flag has been set. In other words, if what is to be detected is the first sheet of a print job, the top sensor <b>121</b> senses the presence of a sheet at step S<b>518</b> after the absence of a sheet is detected, and a transition is then made to step S<b>512</b>. However, with regard to sheets from the second sheet onward of a print job, there is the possibility that a preceding sheet will still be present at the top sensor <b>121</b> immediately after the conveyance sensor <b>133</b> has sensed the leading edge of the succeeding sheet. Accordingly, control transitions to step S<b>522</b> without the conveyance sheet-to-sheet interval flag being set (i.e., with the flag being left in the reset state). If the decision processing of step S<b>522</b> is not provided, there is the danger that feeding of the succeeding sheet will be recognized erroneously has having succeeded despite the fact that the preceding sheet was detected. Accordingly, step S<b>522</b> is added on in order to suppress such misrecognition. The above-described step S<b>515</b> is provided for the same reason. If the conveyance sheet-to-sheet interval flag has not been set, control returns to step S<b>518</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">If the conveyance sheet-to-sheet interval has been set, on the other hand, then this means that the sheet-to-sheet interval between a preceding sheet and the succeeding sheet (namely the leading edge of the succeeding sheet) has been detected. Accordingly, control proceeds to step S<b>523</b> and the engine control CPU <b>301</b> starts or continues image formation.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Timing out of the timer at step S<b>516</b> can be construed to mean that the sheet-to-sheet interval is too short (i.e., the sheet-to-sheet interval could not be detected) or that the cause is communication delay of the status data. Which of these events has occurred cannot be specified. On the other hand, timing out of the timer at step S<b>521</b> is the result solely of non-detection of the sheet-to-sheet interval by the top sensor <b>121</b>. The reason is that since the top sensor <b>121</b> and engine control CPU <b>301</b> have not been connected by a serial signal line, communication delay ascribable to multistage connection of optional cassettes basically does not occur.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In accordance with this embodiment, the engine control CPU <b>301</b> allows image formation to continue even in a case where the status data continuously indicates presence of a sheet from transmission of a feeding instruction until elapse of the first threshold time. That is, when the sheet-to-sheet interval cannot be detected based upon the status data, the engine control CPU <b>301</b> presumes that the sheet-to-sheet interval is too short and cannot be detected, as a result of which erroneous detection of jamming is suppressed. By extension, an image forming apparatus that is capable of maintaining throughput without adding on signal lines to the three serial signal lines is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In accordance with this embodiment, the engine control CPU <b>301</b> causes image formation to continue if the sheet-to-sheet interval is detected by the top sensor <b>121</b> before the second timer for detecting retention jamming times out. Further, if the sheet-to-sheet interval cannot be detected even if the second timer times out, the engine control CPU <b>301</b> presumes that retention jamming has occurred and causes image formation to stop. Accordingly, by virtue of the two-stage arrangement composed of the conveyance sensor <b>133</b> of the optional cassette and the top sensor <b>121</b> of the main body <b>100</b>, it can be determined whether the event that has occurred is retention jamming or a sheet-to-sheet interval that is too short. Naturally, in a case where the sheet-to-sheet interval cannot be detected owing to communication delay, etc., sheet transport itself will be normal and therefore it will be unnecessary to cause image formation to stop needlessly as in the prior art. In comparison with the prior art, therefore, the probability that throughput will decline is diminished.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In this embodiment, the engine control CPU <b>301</b> causes timekeeping by the second timer to start using the transmission of a feeding instruction as a trigger (S<b>504</b>, S<b>512</b>). This is desirable if one takes into account the fact that retention jamming occurs as a result of the feeding instruction. It is particularly desirable that the engine control CPU <b>301</b> restarts the timekeeping by the second timer using as a trigger the feed retry operation (S<b>509</b>, etc.) executed in response to a determination of feeding failure. That is, elapsed time is longer when the retry operation is performed than when it is not performed. Accordingly, that timing of the start of timekeeping by the second timer is changed dynamically is desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the first embodiment, the order of execution of the processing steps can be changed freely as long as similar actions and effects are obtained. For example, steps S<b>502</b> to S<b>505</b> may be executed in any order. The same holds true for steps S<b>509</b> to S<b>512</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">[Second Embodiment]</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the first embodiment, the timing for starting the second timer for sensing sheet-feed delay jamming or retention jamming is in principle the timing at which the feeding operation starts (S<b>514</b>). Further, when the retry operation is executed, restarting of the second timer is necessary (S<b>512</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In a second embodiment, the second timer is started using as a trigger the timing at which the conveyance sensors <b>133</b>, <b>144</b> sense the leading edge of a sheet or the timing at which a determination that feeding has succeeded is made based upon status data regarding the conveyance sensors <b>133</b>, <b>144</b>. As a result, the influence of a difference in processing time between the processing route through steps S<b>506</b> to S<b>514</b> and the processing route from step S<b>506</b> to step S<b>515</b> or S<b>516</b> on the second timer can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> are flowcharts illustrating a control method according to the second embodiment. Steps similar to those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> are designated by like step numbers and need not be described again.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">If the flowcharts shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> are compared with the flowcharts shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, it will be understood that steps S<b>504</b> and S<b>512</b> have been deleted and that a new step S<b>600</b> has been inserted between steps S<b>514</b> and S<b>517</b>. Step S<b>600</b> is processing where the engine control CPU <b>301</b> starts the second timer in a manner similar to that at step S<b>504</b>. It should be noted that one timing for transitioning to step S<b>600</b> is the timing at which status data changes from absence of a sheet to presence of a sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Thus, in accordance with the second embodiment, timekeeping by the second timer is started using as a trigger a change in the status data from absence of a sheet to presence of a sheet. As a result, the timing at which timekeeping by the second timer starts can be measured in isolation from the timing at which the feeding instruction is transmitted. In comparison with the first embodiment, the time necessary for detection of the sheet-to-sheet interval based upon status data is negligible. As a result, retention jamming and sheet-to-sheet interval can be detected with relatively good accuracy based upon the top sensor <b>121</b>.</p>

The scope of the following claims is to be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and equivalent structures and functions.</p>
