<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A wireless communication system as described here employs control signaling for contention-based uplink access from user equipment devices to a base station. Contention-based access configuration is performed via physical downlink control channel signaling. Configuration data sent to the user equipment devices identifies multiple contention-based access zones, along with minimum power headroom values for each contention-based access zone. A probability factor may also be used to lower collision possibility by influencing whether the user equipment devices perform contention-based uplink access. An uplink grant message can be used to acknowledge contention-based transmission; contention resolution is achieved implicitly via the uplink grant.</p>

<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Embodiments of the subject matter described herein relate generally to wireless communication systems. More particularly, embodiments of the subject matter relate to techniques, procedures, and technologies that support contention-based uplink access in a wireless communication system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Wireless communication systems are well known, and the operation of wireless communication systems are usually governed by published specifications, standards, and operating protocols. For example, Long Term Evolution (LTE) refers to a recent standard for mobile network technology, and the current LTE specification is published by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). LTE Advanced (LTE-A) is a proposed extension of LTE that is expected to be finalized in the year 2011.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A wireless device in an LTE system (i.e., a user equipment or UE device) may experience undesirable amounts of latency associated with power-up, initialization, and/or connection to the wireless network. Contention-based uplink access has been proposed as a way to reduce such latency. Contention-based uplink access would allow multiple UE devices to compete for uplink resources on a shared channel supported by the base station, in addition to or in lieu of the traditional uplink access scheme that utilizes dedicated and scheduled resources.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A successful deployment of contention-based uplink access will leverage certain access mechanisms, communication protocols, and procedures performed by the UE devices and the base station. Accordingly, it is desirable to have effective and reliable techniques and technologies that enable a wireless communication system to employ contention-based uplink access from UE devices to base stations.</p>

The wireless communication module <b>202</b> can send uplink messages and uplink control signaling information to the eNB <b>102</b>, while receiving downlink messages and downlink control signaling information from the eNB <b>102</b>. For this embodiment, the wireless communication module <b>202</b> can transmit data packets using the LTE frame structure. In LTE, each radio frame consists of ten subframes, and each subframe is one millisecond long. Each subframe is comprised of control and data portions. In the downlink, the control part consists of information regarding the size of the control part in number of OFDM symbols, acknowledgements pertaining to past uplink data transmissions, uplink/downlink grants, and power control fields.

In the uplink, the control part consists of information regarding channel state information, scheduling request indication, and acknowledgements pertaining to past downlink data transmissions.

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">For this particular embodiment, the wireless communication module <b>202</b> supports the following wireless channels: a physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) <b>214</b>; a physical uplink control channel (PUCCH) <b>216</b>; a physical broadcast channel (PBCH) <b>218</b>; a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) <b>220</b>; and a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) <b>222</b>. The PUSCH <b>214</b> can be shared by a plurality of UE devices in the system <b>100</b> for purposes of data transmission. Moreover, uplink access via the PUSCH <b>214</b> may be contention-based and/or scheduled (as described in more detail below). The PUCCH <b>216</b> carries uplink control information (e.g., uplink scheduling requests, ACK/NACK information, and channel quality information). In this regard, the PUCCH <b>216</b> is considered to be a signaling channel between the UE device <b>104</b> and the eNB <b>102</b>. The PBCH <b>218</b> carries cell-specific control information from the eNB <b>102</b> to the UE devices within range of the transmitting eNB <b>102</b>.

In this regard, the PDCCH <b>222</b> is considered to be a signaling channel between the eNB <b>102</b> and the UE device <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The processor module <b>204</b> is operatively associated with the wireless communication module <b>202</b>, and it can process and analyze information and data received by the wireless communication module <b>202</b>, and process and prepare information for transmission by the wireless communication module <b>202</b>.

In practice, the processor module <b>204</b> may include one processor device or a plurality of cooperating processor devices.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The memory <b>206</b> may be realized as RAM memory, flash memory, EPROM memory, EEPROM memory, registers, a hard disk, a removable disk, or any other form of storage medium known in the art. In this regard, the memory <b>206</b> can be coupled to the processor module <b>204</b> such that the processor module <b>204</b> can read information from, and write information to, the memory <b>206</b>. In the alternative, the memory <b>206</b> may be integral to the processor module <b>204</b>. As an example, the processor module <b>204</b> and the memory <b>206</b> may reside in an ASIC. In practice, a functional or logical component of the UE device <b>104</b> and/or one or more applications executed by the UE device <b>104</b> might be realized using program code that is maintained in the memory <b>206</b>. Moreover, the memory <b>206</b> can be used to store data utilized to support the operation of the UE device <b>104</b>, including, without limitation, contention-based configuration data, an identifier of the UE device <b>104</b>, buffered data to be transmitted by the wireless communication module <b>202</b>, and the like (as will become apparent from the following description).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">For the eNB <b>102</b>, the wireless communication module <b>208</b> may be implemented as a transceiver and one or more antennas. In certain embodiments, the wireless communication module <b>208</b> utilizes a plurality of cooperating antennas that support MIMO communication. The wireless communication module <b>208</b> can send downlink messages and downlink control signaling information to the UE device <b>104</b>, while receiving uplink messages and uplink control signaling information from the UE device <b>104</b>. For this embodiment, the wireless communication module <b>208</b> can transmit data packets using the LTE frame structure. Notably, the wireless communication module <b>208</b> also supports the various channels described above with reference to the wireless communication module <b>202</b>, namely, the PUSCH <b>214</b>, the PUCCH <b>216</b>, the PBCH <b>218</b>, the PDSCH <b>220</b>, and the PDCCH <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The controller <b>210</b> is operatively associated with the wireless communication module <b>208</b>, and it can process and analyze information and data received by the wireless communication module <b>208</b>, and process and prepare information for transmission by the wireless communication module <b>208</b>.

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The memory <b>212</b> may be realized in the manner described above for the memory <b>206</b> of the UE device <b>104</b>. Moreover, a functional or logical component of the eNB <b>102</b> and/or one or more applications executed by the eNB <b>102</b> might be realized using program code that is maintained in the memory <b>212</b>. Moreover, the memory <b>212</b> can be used to store data utilized to support the operation of the eNB <b>102</b>, including, without limitation, contention-based configuration data, resource allocation information, and the like (as will become apparent from the following description).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Power-up latency and network connection latency experienced by UE devices in a wireless network can be annoying and frustrating to users. In an LTE based system, some of this latency can be attributed to the manner in which physical resources are dedicated to UE devices in a time scheduled manner. In contrast, the system <b>100</b> described here utilizes contention-based uplink access as a way to reduce latency experienced by the UE devices <b>104</b>. Such latency reduction is achieved because a UE device <b>104</b> need not transmit a scheduling request indicator (SRI) and wait for an uplink grant issued by the eNB <b>102</b> before sending its data. Rather, when using contention-based uplink access, the UE devices <b>104</b> are allowed to transmit data on a designated and reserved PUSCH region, and an identifier (such as the cell radio network temporary identifier or C-RNTI) is added to the uplink message to identify the transmitting UE device. This methodology is most beneficial under low system load conditions where most resource blocks are not being used. The contention-based uplink access methodology can also be used for machine-type communication (i.e., machine to machine communication) to possibly lower overhead associated with uplink data transmission. To support such contention-based access, standardized mechanisms and procedures should be defined and implemented. In this regard, the following description addresses certain control signaling for contention-based access and presents a preliminary UE procedure for contention-based access.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram that schematically depicts an exemplary allocation of physical resource blocks for the system <b>100</b>. In this example, three contention-based resource zones <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>306</b> are defined. In practice, however, any number of contention-based resource zones could be utilized. Notably, any UE device serviced by an eNB is able to use the contention-based resource zones <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>306</b> because, by definition, those zones are associated with shared (not dedicated) resources. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> also depicts an area <b>308</b> corresponding to assigned or dedicated resources that are utilized for traditional schedule based uplink access. As described in more detail below, certain situations might call for scheduled uplink access using dedicated physical resources rather than contention-based access. Moreover, contention-based uplink access can be used for an initial amount of data to be transmitted by a UE device, and additional data can follow using scheduled uplink transmission. Accordingly, the area <b>308</b> of assigned or dedicated resources may be utilized in a conventional manner for purposes of scheduled uplink access.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> also schematically depicts the available demodulation reference signal (DMRS) <b>320</b> that are available for use by the UE devices during contention-based uplink transmissions. In this context, a DMRS and associated cyclic shift represents a pilot signal used by the transmitting UE device, as is well understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. In certain embodiments, a UE device randomly selects a DMRS cyclic shift when transmitting on a contention-based access zone. This feature provides support for spatial separation and increases the likelihood that the eNB will successfully decode uplink access transmissions from more than one UE device when collisions do occur. This also allows the eNB to detect collisions even if the PUSCH cannot be decoded because the eNB can detect that different DMRS cyclic shifts are being transmitted on the contention-based zone using energy detection. Thus, although the eNB cannot decode the data packets due to collision, it can detect the collision itself.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The contention-based resource zones <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>306</b> are used for the PUSCH <b>214</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), i.e., they are used for uplink access to the eNB <b>102</b>. Each of the contention-based resource zones <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>306</b> includes a respective number of physical resource blocks (PRBs). For purposes of this description, a PRB in a contention-based resource zone is defined as a group of subcarriers by a number of OFDM symbols. (For example, for a normal cyclic prefix subframe in LTE, a PRB is 12 subcarriers in frequency and 14 OFDM symbols in time.)</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Notably, each of the contention-based resource zones <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>306</b> has a respective modulation and coding scheme (MCS) assigned thereto; in certain implementations, each contention-based resource zone has a different MCS assigned thereto. For example, and without limitation, the zone <b>302</b> may be assigned an MCS corresponding to QPSK and R=1/3 (where R represents coding rate), the zone <b>304</b> may be assigned an MCS corresponding to QPSK and R=3/4, and the zone <b>306</b> may be assigned an MCS corresponding to 16-QAM and R=3/4. It should be appreciated that different modulation and/or coding techniques could be utilized in an embodiment of the system <b>100</b>, and that these examples are not exhaustive or required.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">For this particular embodiment, UE devices are allowed to transmit in one of the contention-based resource zones <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>306</b> using the predefined MCS and Transport Block Size (TBS) assignment given in the grant (in this context, TBS refers to the amount of data in bits that the UE can transmit in a particular zone). This particular grant provides information about the contention-based resource zones i.e., the PDCCH-based configuration described below). A minimum power headroom restriction may be implemented so that a UE device is not allowed to transmit in a particular zone if the assigned MCS cannot be supported by that UE device (e.g., UE devices at the cell edge are not allowed to transmit in 16-QAM zones). In this case, the grant is common to all UEs and it provides information about MCS, TBS, power headroom, and possibly other parameters that UEs using contention-based access can read.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Contention-based access parameters of the UE devices can be configured semi-statically via radio resource control (RRC) signaling, dynamically or in a semi-persistent manner via PDCCH assignment. RRC signaling incurs the least amount of overhead, however the process is slow and, because RRC signaling is common, all UE devices will be required to read and update the RRC signaling information in their internal databases. Although the timing of RRC signaling may vary from one network to another, RRC information is typically sent once every forty subframes (i.e., much less frequently than PDCCH signaling information). Dynamic configuration of contention-based access parameters can be performed via PDCCH signaling. This allows the configuration data to be changed every subframe, which may incur high PDCCH overhead. If contention-based access is only used when system load is low, then PDCCH overhead may not be an issue. However, the provision of contention-based configuration data can also be performed in a semi-persistent manner to save PDCCH overhead if needed. (Semi-persistent is defined herein to mean that the configuration is provided once and remains valid for a certain amount of time or until canceled.) Such a methodology allows contention-based access to be supported for other purposes, for example machine-type communication.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">To accommodate PDCCH configuration of contention-based access, a new downlink control information (DCI) format is defined. This new DCI format may be considered to be a contention-based access uplink grant, and it may be based on the existing uplink grant structure defined in the LTE specification. In this regard, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagram that illustrates exemplary data fields associated with contention-based configuration data <b>400</b>. The configuration data <b>400</b> can be sent from the eNB <b>102</b> to the UE devices <b>104</b> in an appropriate signaling channel, e.g., the PDCCH, and in an appropriate format. Thus, the configuration data <b>400</b> could be updated in a dynamic manner, once every subframe. In certain embodiments, the configuration data <b>400</b> is sent using RRC.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Although the content of the contention-based configuration data <b>400</b> may vary from one embodiment to another, the configuration data <b>400</b> for this example includes: a hopping flag <b>402</b>; physical resource block assignment data <b>404</b>; MCS data <b>406</b>; zone data <b>408</b> associated with the contention-based resource zones; and minimum power headroom data <b>410</b>. The hopping flag <b>402</b> is used to provide frequency diversity, as called for in the LTE specification, 3GPP TS 36.213 V9.2.0 (2010-06), Section 8.4. The physical resource block assignment data <b>404</b> identifies the PRBs assigned to each contention-based resource block. In practice, therefore, a given PRB can be assigned to only one contention-based resource block at any given time. As explained above, multiple contention-based resource zones may be configured. This allows different zones to be defined to lower collision probability. Moreover, different zones can be used to support different MCSs, data packet sizes, or data rates. Accordingly, the MCS data <b>406</b> is utilized to identify the particular MCSs that are assigned to each contention-based resource zone. The zone data <b>408</b> identifies the plurality of different contention-based resource zones in an appropriate manner. For example, the zone data <b>408</b> may indicate the number of contention-based resource zones available to the UE devices, the size of each contention-based resource zone, etc. In practice, the zone data <b>408</b> and the physical resource block assignment data <b>404</b> could be merged together into a single field.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The minimum power headroom data <b>410</b> identifies a respective minimum power headroom value for each of the contention-based resource zones. The minimum power headroom value that is obtained or defined for each contention-based access zone can be considered by the UE devices when determining which contention-based access zone (if any) to use for uplink access. This ensures that a transmitting UE device meets the stated minimum power requirement before it can transmit in a contention-based access zone. Thus, the UE device will not waste power on an uplink transmission that cannot be decoded at the eNB due to inadequate transmission power. The manner in which the UE devices process the minimum power headroom values is described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As mentioned previously, the eNB sends the contention-based configuration data <b>400</b> to the UE devices. In this regard, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flow chart that illustrates an exemplary operating process <b>500</b> performed by a base station (e.g., an eNB). The process <b>500</b> relates to the provision of the contention-based configuration data to the UE devices supported by that particular eNB. The various tasks performed in connection with a process described herein (such as the process <b>500</b>) may be performed by software, hardware, firmware, or any combination thereof. For illustrative purposes, a described process may refer to elements mentioned above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>. In practice, portions of a described process may be performed by different elements of the described system, e.g., a base station, a UE device, a network infrastructure device, or the like. It should be appreciated that a described process may include any number of additional or alternative tasks, the tasks shown in a figure need not be performed in the illustrated order, and a described process may be incorporated into a more comprehensive procedure or process having additional functionality not described in detail herein. Moreover, one or more of the tasks shown in a figure could be omitted from an embodiment of the depicted process as long as the intended overall functionality remains intact.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">For this particular implementation, the process <b>500</b> is performed by an eNB. The process <b>500</b> may begin with the eNB determining a plurality of contention-based resource zones to be used for the PUSCH of that eNB (task <b>502</b>). In practice, the number of contention-based resource zones and the PRBs assigned to each contention-based resource zone may be determined in response to system load, expected data packet sizes (e.g., TCP/IP acknowledgement, voice-over-IP packet), number of machine-type users, past collisions, etc.). The process <b>500</b> also assigns a modulation and coding scheme (MCS) to each of the contention-based resource zones (task <b>504</b>). In certain embodiments, task <b>504</b> assigns different MCSs to the contention-based resource zones. In practice, the MCSs can be assigned to support different data rates, quality of service, and the like. MCS selection for each zone can be performed based on, for example, expected channel quality of UEs that are near or far from the eNB, or in the middle of the cell (near, mid, far). In this regard, LTE specification 36.213 V9.2.0 (2010-06), Section 7.1.7 includes a table of available MCS levels.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The eNB will also obtain minimum power headroom values for the contention-based resource zones (task <b>506</b>), expressed in appropriate units such as dBm. In this regard, each contention-based resource zone will have a respective minimum power headroom value assigned thereto. The minimum power headroom values will be considered by the UE devices prior to using contention-based uplink access to the eNB. The minimum power headroom value for a given contention-based resources zone will be influenced at least in part by the particular MCS assigned to that zone, because the power requirements for each MCS might vary. Thus, the minimum power headroom values are correlated to the assigned MCSs. Depending upon the system implementation, the current operating conditions, and/or other factors, the minimum power headroom values may be different for each of the contention-based resource zones, or at least two of the minimum power headroom values might be the same.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">When system load is low, collision may not be an issue with contention-based uplink access. However, the load may change from time to time and the eNB should have the ability to manage collision. Accordingly, a probability factor can be sent to a UE device for use when deciding whether it can transmit using a contention-based resource. The probability factor influences whether UE devices in the system actually perform contention-based uplink transmission. For example, under very light load conditions (where collisions are unlikely), the UE devices should have a relatively high probability of utilizing contention-based uplink resources. On the other hand, under high load conditions (where collisions are more likely), the UE devices should have a lower probability of utilizing contention-based uplink resources. The eNB can manage contention-based uplink access by the UE devices by updating the probability factor as needed to reflect dynamically changing system conditions. The illustrated embodiment of the process <b>500</b> assumes that the eNB is responsible for calculating (task <b>508</b>) a probability factor that influences contention-based uplink access by the UE devices in the manner described above. In practice, the probability factor may be calculated based upon current operating conditions such as system loading, available resources, the number of UE devices actively supported by the eNB, and the like. It should be understood however, that calculating a probability factor is optional and not essential to the method.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The process <b>500</b> may continue by preparing and formatting the contention-based configuration data in an appropriate manner that is suitable for transmission to the UE devices (task <b>510</b>). In practice, the controller of the eNB can perform task <b>510</b> to package, format, or otherwise arrange the contention-based configuration data for transport via one or more signaling channels (e.g., the PDCCH). For example, the contention-based configuration data can be prepared in a predefined message format with designated fields for the various types of configuration information described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. This enables the eNB to send the contention-based configuration data to the UE devices (task <b>512</b>) in a format that is recognized and understood by the UE devices. The eNB could also broadcast or otherwise send the calculated probability factor to the UE devices (task <b>514</b>). For example, the probability factor could be transmitted on the physical broadcast channel (PBCH). Alternatively (or additionally), the probability factor can be sent dynamically in the PDCCH. In this regard, the probability factor could be included in a field of the contention-based configuration data, along with the fields for the other configuration information depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Some or all of the process <b>500</b> can be repeated as often as necessary or desired. Indeed, the contention-based configuration data and/or the probability factor could be updated once every subframe, once every frame, or at any designated interval. Accordingly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts the process <b>500</b> repeating after task <b>514</b>. The illustrated embodiment assumes that tasks <b>502</b>, <b>504</b>, and <b>506</b> are repeated for each iteration. In practice, however, the number, size, and arrangement of the contention-based resource zones, the MCSs assigned to each zone, and/or the minimum power headroom value assigned to each zone could be fixed after their initial determination or calculation. In other embodiments, the number, size, and arrangement of the contention-based resource zones, the MCSs assigned to each zone, and/or the minimum power headroom value assigned to each zone could be updated less frequently than the probability factor. These and other variations of the process <b>500</b> are contemplated by this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The UE devices can use contention-based uplink access to minimize latency and to transmit occasional packets without incurring high overload. In this regard, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, is a flow chart that illustrates an exemplary operating process <b>600</b> performed by a UE device. The process <b>600</b> begins with the UE device receiving and processing contention-based configuration data, which is sent by the eNB (task <b>602</b>). In preferred embodiments, the received contention-based configuration data includes at least the information mentioned above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">If the UE device determines that contention-based uplink access should not be used at this time, then the UE device can perform uplink access using a dedicated and scheduled transmission scheme. If, however, the UE device decides to use contention-based uplink access, then the process <b>600</b> continues by obtaining, calculating, or otherwise determining its currently available power headroom (task <b>604</b>). In practice, the UE device can perform certain self-monitoring or self-diagnostic procedures to obtain its currently available power headroom in a real-time or virtually real-time manner. The currently available power headroom value can then be compared to the minimum power headroom values associated with the available contention-based resource zones (task <b>606</b>). As mentioned above, these minimum power headroom values are received as part of the contention-based configuration data, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Ideally, the currently available power headroom of the UE device will exceed all of the received minimum power headroom values, thus enabling the UE device to use any of the contention-based resource zones. In practice, however, the currently available power headroom may not satisfy one or more of the received minimum power headroom values. Accordingly, task <b>606</b> may identify a subset (which may be a proper subset or the entire set) of the contention-based resource zones for which the currently available power headroom of the UE device satisfies the respective minimum power headroom values. In other words, task <b>606</b> identifies certain candidate zones that can be reliably used by the UE device.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The UE device may then select one of the zones from the identified subset of contention-based resource zones (task <b>608</b>). This selection may be performed randomly, in an ordered fashion, or according to any specified rule or algorithm.

The selected zone may be considered to be the transmit resource zone for this iteration of the process <b>600</b>. In addition, the process <b>600</b> may proceed with one or more optional steps (shown in dashed lines) if so desired. For example, the process <b>600</b> identifies or obtains the MCS assigned to the selected transmit resource zone (task <b>610</b>) and configures the UE device in an appropriate manner to support that MCS. Thereafter, the UE device transmits a data packet using the selected contention-based resource zone and using the MCS associated with the selected zone (task <b>612</b>). For this embodiment, the data is transmitted with the identifier of the UE device (e.g., its C-RNTI) and a buffer status report if there is additional data in the buffer of the UE device. This information allows the eNB to determine the identify of each transmitting UE device and to determine how best to handle and process the received data.</p>

<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flow chart that illustrates another exemplary operating process <b>800</b> performed by a UE device. The process <b>800</b> assumes that the UE device has some data that needs to be sent to the eNB. Accordingly, the process <b>800</b> may identify the amount of data to be transmitted from the UE device to the eNB (task <b>802</b>). The identified amount of data can then be used as a factor in determining whether the UE device will utilize contention-based uplink access or dedicated and scheduled uplink access. For example, the UE device may compare the identified amount of data to a data capacity or threshold amount corresponding to a single physical resource allocation. If all of the identified amount of data can be transmitted using only one physical resource allocation (query task <b>804</b>), then the process <b>800</b> allows contention-based uplink access (task <b>812</b>) to be considered. In other words, if only one physical resource allocation is required to accommodate all of the identified amount of data, then contention-based access to the eNB might be a viable candidate (whether or not contention-based access is actually used might be subject to other factors, as described below). As used here, &#x201c;one&#x201d; physical resource allocation means the resource allocation configured for contention-based access. Thus, if a relatively small amount of data needs to be transmitted by the UE device, it may be possible to use contention-based access. For example, if contention-based access is configured to support 100 bits, but the packet size is 400 bits, then four different transmissions would be required. In such a situation, contention-based access should be avoided because the likelihood that all four transmissions will be successful without collision would be relatively low and it might take an undesirably long amount of time to successfully send and receive all the data. Instead, one dedicated transmission will accommodate all 400 bits at once.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">If, however, the identified amount of data cannot be transmitted using only one physical resource allocation (query task <b>804</b>), then the process <b>800</b> determines or identifies the next scheduled transmit time (if any) for dedicated access to the eNB (task <b>806</b>). It should be realized that task <b>806</b> assumes that the UE device is suitably configured to support both contention-based uplink access and traditional dedicated and scheduled uplink access methodologies. In practice, the next scheduled transmit time may be associated with an SRI. In particular, the next scheduled transmit time may be dictated by the current SRI period of the UE device. For this particular embodiment, the UE device compares the time until the next scheduled transmit time (T) to a threshold amount of time (T<sub>TH</sub>). If the time until the next scheduled transmit time is not greater than the designated threshold amount of time (query task <b>808</b>), then contention-based uplink access is not allowed and the UE device performs uplink access using the dedicated and scheduled transmission scheme (task <b>810</b>). In this situation, the UE device may transmit a data packet containing at least some of the identified amount of data, using scheduled dedicated access to the eNB. In other words, the UE device uses scheduled dedicated uplink access when both: (a) the time until the next scheduled transmit time is shorter than the threshold amount of time; and (b) the identified amount of data cannot be transmitted using only one resource allocation.</p>

Whether or not contention-based access is actually used might be subject to other factors, as described below. In practice, the threshold amount of time may be equal to the time associated with a fixed number of subframes or frames, if so desired.

For example, the selection may favor zones that support higher data rates, or it may favor zones having lower minimum power headroom requirements. The selected zone may be considered to be the transmit resource zone for this iteration of the process <b>900</b>. In addition, the process <b>900</b> randomly selects one DMRS cyclic shift (task <b>932</b>) to be used for the uplink transmission. The process <b>900</b> also identifies or obtains the MCS assigned to the selected transmit resource zone (task <b>934</b>) and configures the UE device in an appropriate manner to support that MCS. Thereafter, the UE device transmits a data packet using the selected contention-based resource zone, using the MCS associated with the selected zone, and using the randomly selected DMRS cyclic shift (task <b>936</b>). For this embodiment, the data is transmitted with the identifier of the UE device (e.g., its C-RNTI) and a buffer status report if there is additional data in the buffer of the UE device. This information allows the eNB to determine the identity of each transmitting UE device and to determine how best to handle and process the received data.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">With the procedure described above, a UE device uses a contention-based zone if the expected latency of waiting for contention-free access is comparatively higher, or if the efficiency of using contention-based access is greater. If the amount of data to be transmitted is relatively low, (e.g. in machine-type communication), the UE devices need not be allocated uplink control signaling such as Channel Quality Information (CQI) and SRI, and may instead be instructed to use contention-based access. In this regard, CQI/SRI set-up is part of dedicated uplink control signaling, which consumes uplink resources. Accordingly, this approach can reduce uplink overhead.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In addition, additional restrictions can be placed on contention-based access if so desired. For example, restrictions based on traffic types can be defined. Thus, guaranteed bit rate (GBR) flows with packet delay budget less than a defined amount (T<sub>d</sub>) could have sub-priority among certain classes (e.g., gaming has higher priority than conversational-video). On the other hand, non-GBR flows would be allowed access but no further buffer status reports will be served (e.g., TCP ACK/NACK only). Restrictions can also be placed based on traffic activities. For instance, contention-based access is not allowed if the UE device has sent SRI and is still waiting for an uplink grant, or if the UE device has received an uplink grant, or if the UE device has already sent data to the eNB with a buffer status report. In this case, the UE device already has been or will soon be assigned dedicated resources, so contention-based access is not likely to reduce latency.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The system <b>100</b> described here also considers how the eNB will process data received via contention-based resources. In this regard, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a flow chart that illustrates another exemplary operating process <b>1000</b> performed by a base station, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a diagram that illustrates timing associated with the uplink transmission of a data packet and the downlink transmission of a corresponding acknowledgement message. The numbered squares in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> represent data packets, time slots, time blocks, or any predefined period associated with the operation of the eNB and the UE, with time increasing to the right.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the process <b>1000</b> begins with the eNB receiving a data packet from a UE device (task <b>1002</b>) via contention-based uplink access. For this particular embodiment, the received data packet includes an identifier that uniquely identifies the transmitting UE device within the domain of the system. The identifier may be, for example, a C-RNTI. The eNB decodes (or attempts to decode) the received data packet (task <b>1002</b>). The eNB may also perform one or more tests or checks to determine whether or not the data was decoded correctly. For example, the eNB could perform a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) on the decoded data. If the received data packet was not correctly decoded (query task <b>1006</b>), then the eNB does not transmit an acknowledgment message to the UE device within the designated response window (task <b>1008</b>). Consequently, if the UE device does not receive an acknowledgement message within the designated response window, then it will assume that the eNB either did not receive the data packet or did not correctly decode the data packet. Accordingly, the UE device can then either transmit the data packet again using contention-based access or it can wait for the next SRI slot to send a scheduling request to the eNB.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Certain exemplary embodiments of the system <b>100</b> use uplink grant messages as acknowledgement messages. Therefore, if the UE device does not receive an uplink grant within the designated response window, then it assumes that the eNB did not correctly decode the data packet. The use of uplink grant messages in this manner is desirable because the format and use of uplink grants are already defined in the LTE specification. Accordingly, if the received data packet is not correctly decoded, then the eNB will not send an uplink grant back to the UE device (task <b>1008</b>). It should be appreciated that an uplink grant represents control information sent on the PDCCH that provides information about how the UE device will access the system in the uplink. For dedicated access, an uplink grant is addressed to a UE device (using, for example, the C-RNTI). For contention-based access, an uplink grant will address a special RNTI that is common to all UE devices (i.e., all UE devices will try to read this grant). Information fields/contents for an uplink grant are defined in 3GPP specification 36.212 V9.2.0 (2010-06), Section 5.3.3.1.1. They include, for instance, MCS, hopping field, DMRS, and power control information. The UE device knows whether the grant is successfully received if it successfully decodes the information (CRC check of message is good).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">If the received data packet is correctly decoded, then the eNB may also receive a buffer status report from the UE device; the buffer status report could be received with the data packet (task <b>1010</b>). The buffer status report indicates an amount of data remaining to be transmitted by the UE device. Note that the buffer status report could indicate that no additional data remains to be transmitted. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the arrow <b>1102</b> represents the contention-based uplink transmission of the data packet, the C-RNTI, and the buffer status report from the UE device to the eNB. Upon receipt of this information, the eNB can perform the necessary processing, decoding, analysis, and handling during a processing time period. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the arrow <b>1104</b> represents this processing time period. It should be appreciated that the actual processing time period <b>1104</b> could span any number of time &#x201c;blocks,&#x201d; and that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is merely exemplary.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the eNB analyzes the received buffer status report to determine the amount of data remaining to be transmitted by the UE device (task <b>1012</b>) and the process <b>1000</b> checks whether more data remains to be transmitted by the UE device (query task <b>1014</b>). As described above, the eNB can consult the buffer status report to determine whether more data remains to be transmitted. When more data remains to be transmitted by the UE device, the eNB prepares an uplink grant that includes or otherwise indicates the C-RNTI of the transmitting UE device (task <b>1016</b>). Notably, this uplink grant is prepared in accordance with the LTE specification because it actually serves as a true uplink grant that enables the UE device to transmit its remaining data using the traditional dedicated and scheduled resource approach. This uplink grant is transmitted to the originating UE device within the designated response window, via a signaling channel such as the PDCCH (task <b>1018</b>). It should be appreciated that this uplink grant serves at least two purposes: (1) as an acknowledgement message; and (2) as a grant that enables the UE device to transmit its remaining data using dedicated and scheduled resources. The inclusion of the C-RNTI in this uplink grant enables the UE device to confirm that the uplink grant represents an acknowledgement message for its recently transmitted data packet.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the response window <b>1106</b> for this example is two time blocks (from the perspective of the eNB). Of course, the response window <b>1106</b> could be defined to be any number of time blocks corresponding to any number of packets, time slots, etc. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the acknowledgement message <b>1108</b> (e.g., the uplink grant) is sent before the response window <b>1106</b> lapses.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">If query task <b>1014</b> determines that no additional data remains to be transmitted by the UE device, then the process <b>1000</b> prepares a dummy uplink grant that includes or otherwise indicates the C-RNTI of the transmitting UE device (task <b>1020</b>). As used here, a &#x201c;dummy&#x201d; uplink grant is one that serves only as an acknowledgement message. In other words, a dummy uplink grant does not function as a true grant as defined by the LTE specification. Consequently, a dummy uplink grant will convey less contextual information than an actual uplink grant, although it will have the same size, format, and fields as defined in a &#x201c;normal&#x201d; uplink grant, however, some of the fields will be set to an invalid or reserved state so that the UE device will detect the message as a dummy uplink grant rather than a normal uplink grant. Therefore, the content of the acknowledgement message (i.e., the uplink grant) is influenced by the amount of data remaining to be transmitted by the UE device. The dummy uplink grant is transmitted to the originating UE device within the designated response window, via a signaling channel such as the PDCCH (task <b>1022</b>). Again, the inclusion of the C-RNTI in this dummy uplink grant enables the UE device to confirm that the dummy uplink grant represents an acknowledgement message for its recently transmitted data packet.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Notably, an uplink grant (whether an actual grant or a dummy grant) serves as an implicit ACK to let the UE device know that the eNB has successfully received and decoded the data packet. If the UE device has more data to transmit, the grant will be an actual uplink grant, and an additional uplink resource will be allocated to the UE device in a conventional manner. If the UE device does not receive an uplink grant (actual or dummy) within the predefined response window, then the UE device will proceed as if it had received a NACK. Using this approach, contention resolution is managed using uplink grants (actual grants and dummy grants). Alternately, an ACK format can be created for transmission using the PDCCH, where the eNB echoes back all C-RNTIs conveyed with data packets that were correctly decoded.</p>

It should also be appreciated that the exemplary embodiment or embodiments described herein are not intended to limit the scope, applicability, or configuration of the claimed subject matter in any way.
