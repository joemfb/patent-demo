<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">According to one embodiment, an image conversion apparatus includes a 3D conversion instruction module, a determination module, and a converter. The 3D conversion instruction module is configured to instruct execution of a 3D conversion required to convert an input image into a 3D image. The determination module is configured to determine validity or invalidity of the 3D conversion instruction based on whether the input image corresponds to a 3D image format or a 2D image format. The converter is configured to convert, based on validity determination of the 3D conversion instruction, the input image into the 3D image in response to the 3D conversion instruction.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-125133, filed May 31, 2010; the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments described herein relate generally to an image conversion apparatus and image conversion method.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Nowadays, a full-fledged television which can display three-dimensional (3D) images (to be referred to as a 3D television hereinafter) is about to come into the market. Various techniques required to display 3D images have been disclosed and put into practical use so far. However, since the brightness and resolution of a 3D image are inferior to those of a two-dimensional (2D) image, 3D televisions are unfamiliar.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, in recent years, due to the advent of large-capacity optical discs such as a Blu-ray (BD&#xae;) and the prevalence of full-HD televisions, 3D images having high image quality can be played back by, for example, a frame sequential method.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, the 3D televisions will become widespread exponentially in the future. However, the amount of available 3D image content is still small. Against such a background, a technique for converting 2D image content into 3D image content, and generating pseudo-3D images based on the converted 3D image content (2D-3D conversion technique) has been disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As described above, the 2D-3D conversion technique has been disclosed, and televisions incorporating the 2D-3D conversion technique have been proposed. However, various playback apparatuses may be connected to a television, and miscellaneous image content may be input to the television.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A technique which controls 2D-3D conversion according to input image content has not been disclosed yet. The user does not always want to view a converted image (for example, a 3D image), and often wants to view an original image (for example, a 2D image). A technique which controls 2D-3D conversion as the situation demands has not been disclosed yet.</p>

The 3D conversion instruction module is configured to instruct execution of a 3D conversion required to convert an input image into a 3D image. The determination module is configured to determine validity or invalidity of the 3D conversion instruction based on whether the input image corresponds to a 3D image format or a 2D image format. The converter is configured to convert, based on validity determination of the 3D conversion instruction, the input image into the 3D image in response to the 3D conversion instruction.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The first to third embodiments will be described hereinafter with reference to the drawings.</p>

In other words, the image playback apparatus <b>2</b> is configured to be connectable to the image display apparatus <b>1</b> (that is, the interface <b>12</b>) via the interface <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The interfaces <b>12</b> and <b>22</b> are two-way communication units, and are interfaces which are compliant with, for example, the High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI&#xae;) standard.

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Note that, for example, a single 2D/3D conversion key may be arranged in place of the 3D conversion key <b>141</b> and 2D conversion key <b>142</b>. For example, when the user presses this 2D/3D conversion key once, the 2D/3D conversion key issues a 3D conversion instruction for converting an input image into a 3D image. When the user presses this 2D/3D conversion key twice successively, the 2D/3D conversion key issues a 2D conversion instruction for converting an input image into a 2D image.</p>

The 3D conversion processing module <b>231</b> converts an original image signal (2D image signal) from the storage device <b>27</b> or tuner <b>28</b> into a 3D image signal, and outputs the 3D image signal. That is, the 3D conversion processing module <b>231</b> converts an original image signal (2D image signal) input via the interface <b>26</b> into a 3D image signal, and outputs the 3D image signal.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The 2D conversion processing module <b>232</b> converts an original image signal (3D image signal) from the storage device <b>27</b> or tuner <b>28</b> into a 2D image signal, and outputs the 2D image signal.

Then, the 3D conversion processing module <b>131</b> of the image processing module <b>13</b> converts the input image signal into a 3D image signal, and outputs the 3D image signal (BLOCK <b>114</b>). The liquid crystal panel <b>19</b> displays a 3D image based on the converted 3D image signal (BLOCK <b>115</b>).
