<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">An example of a specialized decoupling capacitor is the Metal-Insulator-Metal (MIM) capacitor. MIM capacitors may be formed on an integrated circuit chip and typically provide a greater unit capacitance density (e.g., femtofarads per square micrometer (fF/&#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>)) than gate-oxide based capacitors. MIM capacitors offer significant advantages in enhancing high-performance circuits by filtering switching noise, especially for power supply lines. To improve their filtering capability, a group of MIM capacitors is often ganged together to form a bank of capacitors. Although these capacitor banks generally perform adequately, failure of one or more of the MIM capacitors typically becomes problematic. Therefore, improvements in this area would prove beneficial in the art.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a diagram of an embodiment of an integrated circuit (IC) assembly, generally designated <b>100</b>, constructed according to the principles of the present disclosure. The IC assembly <b>100</b> includes a collection of IC units <b>105</b>-<b>1</b>,<b>105</b>-N, an IC capacitor bank <b>110</b> and a pair of supply lines <b>115</b>, <b>120</b> that are connected to each of the collection of IC units <b>105</b>-<b>1</b>,<b>105</b>-N and the IC capacitor bank <b>110</b>, as shown. The supply line <b>115</b> provides a current sourcing voltage Vdd, and the supply line <b>120</b> provides a current sinking voltage Vss. In alternate embodiments, the pair of supply lines <b>115</b>, <b>120</b> may provide a current sourcing voltage and a common reference point (such as a ground reference) or a current sinking voltage and a common reference point.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The collection of IC units <b>105</b>-<b>1</b>,<b>105</b>-N represent various digital or analog circuits that share the pair of supply lines <b>115</b>,<b>120</b>. Each of the collection of IC units <b>105</b>-<b>1</b>,<b>105</b>-N produces high frequency noise signals on the pair of supply lines <b>115</b>, <b>120</b> that may interfere with its own operation or the operation of another unit. The IC capacitor bank <b>110</b> provides a significant number of IC capacitors that are connected in parallel across the pair of supply lines <b>115</b>, <b>120</b> to provide filtering of these high frequency noise signals thereby reducing their overall detrimental effect.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">High dielectric constant (high-k) metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors may be formed on an IC chip and typically provide a greater unit capacitance density than gate-oxide based capacitors thereby providing a greater interference filtering capability. Therefore, the IC capacitor bank <b>110</b> typically employs multiple capacitor columns having a plurality of high-k MIM capacitors. However, high-k MIM capacitors suffer from low time dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) lifetimes, resulting in the inability to use them reliably in many important applications (e.g., using them for a one volt supply voltage at 125 C for 10 years).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In each capacitor column of the IC capacitor bank <b>110</b>, the plurality of high-k MIM capacitors is parallel connected together to a pair of conductive traces. A fusible trace is located on an end of one of the pair of conductive traces to form a capacitor column that is connected between the pair of supply lines <b>115</b>, <b>120</b>, such that failure of a dielectric in one of the high-k MIM capacitors causes the fusible trace to at least partially open thereby limiting a fault current in the capacitor column.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The term &#x201c;failure of a dielectric&#x201d;, as employed in this disclosure, means that the dielectric in one of the MIM capacitors has undergone a breakdown in its insulating properties to an extent that it no longer functions as a sufficient electrical insulator between its two metal conductors. This dielectric breakdown failure results in a fault current flowing through the two metal conductors that is provided by connected supply lines (e.g., the pair of supply lines <b>115</b>, <b>120</b>), and is much larger than an initial leakage current in the MIM capacitor. This fault current, if left unchecked, typically impairs or inhibits proper operation of one or more of the supply lines connected to the capacitor bank. Additionally, this fault current may cause failure of other integrated circuit units connected to the supply lines. The fusible trace provides protection against this failure condition by reducing the fault current to a value that allows proper operation of the supply lines.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The term &#x201c;at least partially open&#x201d;, as employed in this disclosure, means that the fusible trace has significantly increased its electrical resistance value from its initial or operating electrical resistance value. In some embodiments, the fusible trace is designed to totally open becoming, for all practical purposes, an electrical open circuit thereby isolating its capacitor column from the capacitor bank and rendering its capacitor column non-operational. In other embodiments, the fusible trace is designed to increase its electrical resistance to a value high enough to render its capacitor column non-operational in the capacitor bank, although the fusible trace is not totally an open circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> illustrate diagrams of an embodiment of an IC capacitor bank, generally designated <b>200</b>, <b>250</b>, constructed according to the principles of the present disclosure. The IC capacitor bank <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> includes multiple capacitor columns CC<b>1</b>-CCm wherein a capacitor column <b>205</b> (CCj) may be considered to be typical. The capacitor column <b>205</b> includes a plurality of high-k MIM capacitors <b>210</b> that are parallel connected to a fusible trace <b>215</b> (FTj). In some embodiments, subsets of the multiple capacitor columns CC<b>1</b>-CCm may employ differing high-k MIM capacitors or differing types of fusible traces as deemed appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Each of the capacitor columns CC<b>1</b>-CCm has a fusible trace <b>215</b> that provides a narrow path connection to the plurality of high-k MIM capacitors <b>210</b> within each capacitor column CC<b>1</b>-CCm. It should be understood, however, that though <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows that the fusible trace <b>215</b> of each capacitor column CC<b>1</b>-CCm is connected to Vss (a supply line <b>220</b><i>a</i>), other embodiments provide that the fusible trace <b>215</b> of each capacitor column CC<b>1</b>-CCm may be connected to Vdd (a supply line <b>220</b><i>b</i>), and in yet other embodiments some of the fusible traces <b>215</b> may be connected to Vdd while others are connected to Vss.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates that the fusible trace <b>215</b> has a fusible trace length L<sub>j</sub>, as shown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> also shows the fusible trace length L<sub>j </sub>and additionally illustrates the conductive trace <b>212</b><i>b </i>having a conductive trace width W<sub>CT </sub>and the fusible trace <b>215</b> having a fusible trace width Wj. The fusible trace width W<sub>j </sub>is designed to provide a fusible trace width that is less than the narrower width of the conductive traces <b>212</b><i>a</i>, <b>212</b><i>b </i>connected to the plurality of high-k MIM capacitors <b>210</b>, such that a ratio of conductive trace width W<sub>CT </sub>to fusible trace width W<sub>j </sub>ranges from about 9:1 to 12:1 (widths not drawn to scale in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>). In an alternative embodiment where the width of the conductive traces <b>212</b><i>a</i>, <b>212</b><i>b </i>are the same, the width is less than the width of either of the conductive traces <b>212</b><i>a</i>, <b>212</b><i>b</i>. This narrow path allows a high percentage of the heating energy afforded by a fault current to be directed to the fusible trace <b>215</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the illustrated embodiment, the fault current corresponds to a capacitor column current ranging from about one to five milliamperes, as compared to a background leakage current level of about 10 femtoamperes. Of course, the fusible trace <b>215</b> may be designed to provide protection for other fault current ranges, as deemed appropriate. The fusible trace <b>215</b> may include a fusing material that is selected from the group consisting of polycrystalline silicon, silicided poly-silicon, tantalum nitride and a fusible metal, for example. The fusible metal may be copper or another fusible metal compatible for inclusion in an IC containing the fusible trace <b>215</b>. Accordingly, the fusible trace <b>215</b> being at least partially open corresponds to the fusing material selected providing an electrical resistance increase that is at least 50 times greater than an initial electrical resistance of the fusible trace <b>215</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Assume that the capacitor column <b>205</b> provides a worst case capacitance of about 0.2 picofarads. A maximum initial electrical resistance corresponding to a frequency response requirement for the capacitor column <b>205</b>, for example, may be determined as shown below.</p>

therefore R&#x2245;796 ohms.
<br/>
The initial electrical resistance of the fusible trace <b>215</b> may be as high as about 796 ohms for the capacitor column <b>205</b> to function efficiently. This condition may be met employing silicided poly-silicon or copper, for example.
</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Generally, selecting an initial electrical resistance of a fusible trace to be a value proximate the high end of an acceptable resistance range provides an additional benefit in fault current management for a capacitor bank or a system-on-chip (SOC) that employs the capacitor bank. For a case where the fusible trace fails to at least partially open during a fault condition, the initial electrical resistance of the fusible trace provides a measure of fault current limiting by itself. This feature may further allow the capacitor bank to degrade gracefully in operation instead of failing outright.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, TDDB lifetimes are typically problematic for high-k MIM capacitors. Additionally, capacitor banks are often subject to a failure criterion (e.g., as part of an SOC) that may not be exceeded. For example, the failure criterion may require a failure rate of no more than 1,000 parts per million (ppm) in 10 years at 125 C. Assume that 90 percent of the fusible traces at least partially open and 10 percent of the fusible traces fail to at least partially open (i.e., remain intact) after a dielectric breakdown event. The failure rate of the fusible traces may be increased to 10,000 ppm thereby ensuring that only 1,000 ppm will have their function impaired. A lifetime for 1,000 ppm at 1.0V and 125 C is 3.5 years, while a lifetime for 10,000 ppm at 1.0V and 125 C is 18.6 years, thereby exceeding the required 10 years at 125 C by a comfortable margin.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> illustrate sectional views of embodiments of a fusible trace <b>300</b>, <b>350</b>, respectively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows the fusible trace <b>300</b> in a closed configuration, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows the fusible trace <b>350</b> in an opened configuration. The fusible trace <b>300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> includes a composite structure, which in one embodiment comprises a runner portion <b>305</b> and a liner/barrier layer <b>310</b>, which are located in an IC substrate <b>315</b>, as may be employed in an embodiment of a capacitor column described herein. In the illustrated embodiment, the liner/barrier layer <b>310</b> determines an increase in electrical resistance for limiting a fault current in the capacitor column. The liner/barrier layer <b>310</b> may be a metal liner, for example such as tantalum nitride or titanium nitride and the like. The runner portion <b>305</b> may be any one of or a combination of the group of fusing materials discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The fusible trace <b>300</b> may be seen to have a fusible trace length L, corresponding to the fusible trace length Lj in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, and a fusible trace width W, corresponding to the fusible trace width W<sub>j </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. Generally, the fusible trace <b>300</b> provides a narrow path length to width ratio (L/W) ranging from about 100:1 to 150:1. For 40 nanometer technology, an embodiment of the fusible trace <b>300</b> employs a fusible trace length L of about 5 microns and a fusible trace width W of about 0.04 microns. These quantities provide a fusible trace length to width ratio (L/W) of about 125.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A change in resistance of the fusible trace <b>300</b>, when it becomes at least partially open, is proportional to cross-sectional areas of the runner portion <b>305</b> and liner/barrier layer <b>310</b> and their respective resistivities. For example, assume that the cross-sectional areas are equal, the runner portion <b>305</b> is copper and the liner/barrier layer <b>310</b> is tantalum, nitride. The resistivity of tantalum nitride is approximately 200 uohm-cm as compared to approximately three uohm-cm for copper interconnect. This provides at least a partially open resistance increase that is 200/3 or about 66 times greater than an initial electrical resistance for the assumed equal cross-sectional areas. Of course this ratio may be modified for the same fusing materials by appropriately changing the cross-sectional areas of the runner portion <b>305</b> and liner/barrier layer <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows a sectional view of the fusible trace <b>350</b> that has, at least, partially opened in response to a dielectric failure. Subsequent to being opened, the fusible trace <b>350</b> includes remaining remnants <b>305</b><i>a</i>-<b>305</b><i>d </i>of the runner portion <b>305</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) and the liner/barrier layer <b>310</b> in the substrate <b>315</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the remaining remnants <b>305</b><i>a</i>-<b>305</b><i>d </i>indicate that the previous runner portion <b>305</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, has totally opened electrically leaving only the liner/barrier layer <b>310</b> mostly intact. This condition provides a partially open resistance increase to render its associated capacitor column non-operational, although the fusible trace <b>350</b> is not totally open electrically. However, it should be understood that the liner/barrier layer <b>310</b> may also be substantially removed due to the dielectric failure.</p>

The IC capacitor bank <b>400</b> includes multiple capacitor columns (a capacitor column <b>405</b> is typical) wherein each is protected by one of multiple fusible traces (a fusible trace <b>410</b> is typical) that are constructed of silicided poly-silicon and located at a same supply line end of the capacitor bank <b>400</b>. As discussed previously, other embodiments may employ some of the multiple fusible traces located at one supply line end of the capacitor bank <b>400</b> and remaining ones located at the other supply line end of the capacitor bank <b>400</b>.</p>

The method <b>600</b> starts in a step <b>605</b>, and a plurality of high-k metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors is provided in a step <b>610</b>. Then, in a step <b>615</b>, the plurality of MIM capacitors is parallel connected together to a pair of conductive traces. A fusible trace is located on an end of one of the pair of conductive traces to form a capacitor column that is connected between a pair of supply lines in a step <b>620</b>, such that failure of a dielectric in one of the MIM capacitors causes the fusible trace to at least partially open thereby limiting a fault current in the capacitor column.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one embodiment, the pair of supply lines provides a current sourcing voltage and a current sinking voltage, a current sourcing voltage and a common reference point or a current sinking voltage and a common reference point. Accordingly, the common reference point may provide a local, chip or system ground reference. In one application, the fault current in the capacitor column may be limited to a range of about one to five milliamperes. The fusible trace, designed for this fault current value, is caused to at least partially open and reduce the fault current to an acceptable lower value commensurate with allowing the pair of supply lines to continue to operate as intended.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In another embodiment, the fusible trace includes a fusing material that is selected from the group consisting of polycrystalline silicon, silicided poly-silicon, tantalum nitride and a fusible metal. In one application, the fusible trace provides a width that is less than the narrower width of the pair of conductive traces connected to it such that a ratio of conductive trace width to fusible trace width ranges from about 9:1 to 12:1. In another application, a length to width ratio of the fusible trace may range from about 100:1 to 150:1. In still another application, the fusible trace increases its electrical resistance by at least 50 times when it is at least partially open, over its initial electrical resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In still another embodiment, the fusible trace includes a composite structure having a runner portion and a liner/barrier layer. In one application, the fusible trace includes a path liner that determines an increase in electrical resistance for limiting the fault current in the capacitor column.
