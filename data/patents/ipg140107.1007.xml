<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Patent Document 1 discloses a roller for in-furnace conveyance which is provided in a heating furnace that serves to conduct long-term heating at high temperature of metallic work pieces for purposes of heat treatment or hot rolling. With respect to this roller for in-furnace conveyance, the overall roller is configured by reciprocal fitting and welding of roller materials, wherein a central body section and other sections are separately fabricated. According to this configuration, the manufacturing cost of the roller for in-furnace conveyance is reduced by welding together a body section and a shaft section, where the body section which is exposed to high temperature by being disposed in a central region of the furnace is fabricated from costly material with a small linear expansion coefficient, and the shaft section which is disposed in region of lower temperature than the furnace center by being positioned at furnace wall area is fabricated from inexpensive material with a larger linear expansion coefficient than the body section.</p>

<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, as the fitting section of the aforementioned roller for in-furnace conveyance is made for one-step straight fitting, when different types of deformation arise in the reciprocal members due to the occurrence of load deformation and heat deformation, deformation of the weld portion is restrained by the immediately close fitting. Consequently, significant strain and stress arise in the weld portion, the weld portion is easy to break.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, when the shaft section and the body section are formed with materials of different composition, and the shaft section and the body section are fitted and welded together at normal temperature, and when the heating furnace enters a high-temperature condition, the shaft section which has a large linear expansion coefficient undergoes a larger thermal expansion than the body section which has a small linear expansion coefficient. Then, significant circumferential tensile strain and stress arise in the body section. As a result, deformation of the weld portion is restrained by the immediately close fitting, significant strain and stress arise in the weld portion, the weld portion is easy to break.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention was made in light of the foregoing problem, and its objective is to offer a roller for in-furnace conveyance which alleviates the strain and stress that arise in weld portion when load deformation and heat deformation occur.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to solve the foregoing problem, the present invention is provided with a fitting section in which a fitting hole of a first constituent member and a fitting shaft of a second constituent member are fitted. The present invention is a roller for in-furnace conveyance wherein a single roller is constituted by welding of the fitting section. The fitting section has a first fitting section in which fitting occurs with a prescribed interstice at a position separated from the weld position, and a second fitting section in which fitting occurs with an interstice larger than that of the first fitting section at a position adjacent to the weld position.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">By means of this configuration, in the present invention, a large clearance is formed by the second fitting section in the immediate vicinity of the weld position. Consequently, in the present invention, even if different types of deformation occur in the reciprocal members due to load deformation and heat deformation, restriction at the weld is reduced, reducing strain and stress at the weld position. Moreover, in the present invention, clearance at the position separated from the weld position is small due to the first fitting section. Consequently, the fitting accuracy of the first constituent member and the second constituent member is ensured, enabling easy welding.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the present invention, it is desirable that the first constituent member and the second constituent member are composed of different materials of mutually different compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">By adopting this configuration, in the present invention, strain and stress at the weld position are alleviated even when the first constituent member and the second constituent member are made of different materials of different compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the present invention, it is desirable that the first constituent member and the second constituent member are composed of different materials with mutually different linear expansion coefficients.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">By means of this configuration, in the present invention, strain and stress are alleviated at the weld position when heat deformation occurs even when the first constituent member and the second constituent member are made of different materials with different linear expansion coefficients.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the present invention, it is desirable that the fitting shaft is a two-step structure which has a large-diameter shaft section having a diameter corresponding to the first fitting section, and a small-diameter shaft section having a diameter smaller than the large-diameter shaft section corresponding to the second fitting section.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">By means of this configuration, in the present invention, a two-step fitting of the fitting shaft in which fitting clearance at the position adjacent to the weld position is large, and fitting clearance at the position separated from the weld position is small is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the present invention, it is desirable that a heat insulating member which covers the end portion of the fitting shaft is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">By means of this configuration, in the present invention, it is possible to prevent the outflow of heat from the end portion of the fitting shaft. By providing a heat insulating member, the temperature difference between the first constituent member and the second constituent member is increased, thereby increasing the difference in heat deformation. However, as there is a large clearance in the immediate vicinity of the weld position due to the second fitting section, restriction at the weld position is reduced, alleviating strain and stress at the weld position.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the present invention, it is desirable that fitting in the fitting section is a loose fit.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">By means of this configuration, in the present invention, restriction at the weld position is reduced, alleviating strain and stress at the weld position.</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Rollers for in-furnace conveyance of embodiments of the present invention are described below with reference to drawings.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">(First Embodiment)</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view which shows a roller for in-furnace conveyance <b>1</b> of a first embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an exploded view which shows constituent members of the roller for in-furnace conveyance <b>1</b> of the first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The roller for in-furnace conveyance <b>1</b> is composed of two or more constituent members, and constitutes a single roller by welding. The roller for in-furnace conveyance <b>1</b> is provided in a heating furnace which serves to conduct long-term heating at high temperature of metallic work pieces for purposes of heat treatment or hot rolling. The roller for in-furnace conveyance <b>1</b> has a body section (first constituent member) <b>10</b> which conveys a metallic work piece at the furnace center, and shaft sections (second constituent members) <b>20</b> which are welded to the both end portions of the body section <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The body section <b>10</b> is composed of material with a smaller linear expansion coefficient than the shaft sections <b>20</b>, because it is disposed in the central region of the furnace where it is exposed to high temperature. The body section <b>10</b> is molded into a cylindrical shape, and a hollow section S<b>1</b> is formed in its interior. Fitting holes <b>11</b> which fit the shaft sections <b>20</b> are provided at the both end portions of the body section <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The shaft sections <b>20</b> are disposed in regions of lower temperature than the center of the furnace by being positioned at furnace wall (not illustrated in the drawings). Consequently, the shaft sections <b>20</b> are composed of material with a larger linear expansion coefficient than the body section <b>10</b>. Each shaft section <b>20</b> has a hollow section S<b>2</b> formed in its interior, and includes a large-diameter section <b>21</b> of the same diameter as the external form of the body section <b>10</b>, a small-diameter section <b>23</b> with a smaller diameter than the large-diameter section <b>21</b>, and a tapered section <b>22</b> provided between the large-diameter section <b>21</b> and the small-diameter section <b>23</b>. At the end portion of the large-diameter section <b>21</b>, a fitting shaft <b>24</b> is provided which fits the fitting hole <b>11</b> of the body section <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, fitting section <b>30</b>, where the fitting hole <b>11</b> of the body section <b>10</b> and the fitting shaft <b>24</b> of the shaft section <b>20</b> are fitted, is connected by a weld portion <b>2</b>. The weld portion <b>2</b> is a site where a bead is formed by arc welding such as TIG welding or MIG welding across the entire circumference along a groove form that is formed between the end portion of the body section <b>10</b> and the large-diameter section <b>21</b> of the shaft section <b>20</b>. Moreover, the weld portion <b>2</b> is formed using a welding rod made of an intermediate material (a material that is intermediate in terms of composition and linear expansion coefficient) relative to the material constituting the body section <b>10</b> and the material constituting the shaft section <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The fitting section <b>30</b> has a first fitting section <b>31</b> in which fitting occurs with a prescribed interstice at a position separated from the position where the weld portion <b>2</b> is formed (welding position), and a second fitting section <b>32</b> in which fitting occurs with an interstice larger than that of the first fitting section <b>31</b> at a position adjacent to the welding position. The first fitting section <b>31</b> and second fitting section <b>32</b> fit with a loose fit. More specifically, the fitting hole <b>11</b> and the fitting shaft <b>24</b> have a fitting diameter on the order of &#x3a6;135 (mm). Moreover, the small clearance formed by the first fitting section <b>31</b> is of the H7h7 tolerance zone class set forth in Japanese Industrial Standard CI IS), while the large clearance formed by the second fitting section <b>32</b> is of the H7e7 tolerance zone class.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The fitting shaft <b>24</b> has a two-step structure which has a large-diameter shaft section <b>24</b><i>a </i>provided with a diameter corresponding to the first fitting section <b>31</b>, and a small-diameter shaft section <b>24</b><i>b </i>provided with a diameter, which is smaller than the large-diameter shaft section <b>24</b><i>a</i>, corresponding to the second fitting section <b>32</b>. By means of this configuration, in the present embodiment, a two-step fitting is obtained whereby fitting clearance at the position adjacent to the weld portion <b>2</b> is large, and fitting clearance at the position separated from the weld portion <b>2</b> is small.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Next, operations of the roller for in-furnace conveyance <b>1</b> of the aforementioned configuration are described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Differences between the roller for in-furnace conveyance of the present embodiment and a conventional roller for in-furnace conveyance are described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the same reference numerals are assigned to components whose configuration is identical or equivalent to the roller for in-furnace conveyance <b>1</b> of the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the circumstances of deformation when a load F is applied to the roller for in-furnace conveyance <b>1</b> of the first embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a cross-sectional view which shows the configuration of a conventional roller for in-furnace conveyance <b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the circumstances of deformation when a load F is applied to a conventional roller for in-furnace conveyance <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As the fitting section <b>30</b> of a conventional roller for in-furnace conveyance <b>1</b> is one-step straight fitting as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, when the roller for in-furnace conveyance <b>1</b> undergoes load deformation due to a load F, deformation of the weld <b>2</b> is restrained by the fitting in the immediate vicinity of the weld portion <b>2</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Consequently, significant strain and stress arise at the weld portion <b>2</b>, the weld portion <b>2</b> is easy to breakage.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">On the other hand, with the roller for in-furnace conveyance <b>1</b> of the present embodiment, a clearance in the immediate vicinity of the weld portion <b>2</b> is large due to the second fitting section <b>32</b>. Consequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when the roller for in-furnace conveyance <b>1</b> undergoes load deformation due to a load F, restriction at the weld portion <b>2</b> is reduced, alleviating strain and stress at the weld portion <b>2</b>. Moreover, as fitting in the fitting section <b>30</b> is of the loose fit type, restriction at the weld portion <b>2</b> is further reduced, alleviating strain and stress at the weld portion <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the fitting section <b>30</b> of the roller for in-furnace conveyance <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the body section <b>10</b> and the shaft section <b>20</b> are formed from different materials of differing composition. Consequently, when the body section <b>10</b> and the shaft section <b>20</b> are fitted and welded at room temperature, and when the heating furnace enters a high-temperature condition, the shaft section <b>20</b> with the large linear expansion coefficient undergoes a larger thermal expansion than the body section <b>10</b> with the small linear expansion coefficient. Significant tensile strain and stress then arise in the circumferential direction of the body section <b>10</b>. On the other hand, deformation of the weld portion <b>2</b> is restrained by the fitting in the immediate vicinity of the weld portion <b>2</b>. As a result, significant strain and stress arise in the weld portion <b>2</b>, the weld <b>2</b> is easy to breakage.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">By contrast, by means of the fitting section <b>30</b> of the roller for in-furnace conveyance <b>1</b> of the present embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, even if different types of deformation arise in the reciprocal members due to heat deformation, restriction at the weld portion <b>2</b> is reduced as a result of the large clearance in the immediate vicinity of the weld portion <b>2</b> due to the second fitting section <b>32</b>, alleviating strain and stress at the weld portion <b>2</b>. Moreover, as clearance at the position separated from the weld portion <b>2</b> is small due to the first fitting section <b>31</b>, the fitting accuracy of the body section <b>10</b> and the shaft section <b>20</b> is ensured. Furthermore, even if a difference in thermal expansion arises at the position separated from the weld portion <b>2</b>, propagation of strain and stress to the weld portion <b>2</b> is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As stated above, according to the first embodiment of the present invention, the roller for in-furnace conveyance <b>1</b> is provided with a fitting section <b>30</b> where the fitting hole <b>11</b> of the body section <b>10</b> and the fitting shaft <b>24</b> of the shaft section <b>20</b> are fitted, and a single roller is formed by welding of the fitting section <b>30</b>. The fitting section <b>30</b> has a first fitting section <b>31</b> where fitting occurs with a prescribed interstice at a position separated from the welding position, and a second fitting section <b>32</b> where fitting occurs with an interstice larger than that of the first fitting section <b>31</b> at a position adjacent to the welding position. Consequently, even if different types of deformation arise in the reciprocal members due to load deformation and heat deformation, restriction at the weld portion <b>2</b> is reduced due to the large clearance in the immediate vicinity of the weld portion <b>2</b> resulting from the second fitting section <b>32</b>. Consequently, strain and stress in the weld portion <b>2</b> are alleviated. Moreover, as clearance at the position separated from the weld portion <b>2</b> is small due to the first fitting section <b>31</b>, the fitting accuracy of the body section <b>10</b> and the shaft section <b>20</b> is ensured, enabling easy welding.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Accordingly, in the first embodiment described above, the strain and stress arisen in the weld portion <b>2</b> are alleviated when load deformation and heat deformation occur in the roller for in-furnace conveyance <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">(Second Embodiment)</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Next, a second embodiment of the present invention is described.

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The roller for in-furnace conveyance <b>1</b> has a shaft spindle (second constituent member) <b>40</b> welded to the shaft section (first constituent member) <b>20</b>. At the end portion of the small-diameter section <b>23</b> of the shaft section <b>20</b> is provided a fitting hole <b>23</b><i>a </i>of two-step structure into which the shaft spindle <b>40</b> fits.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The shaft spindle <b>40</b> is axially supported by a bearing (not illustrated in the drawings) on the outer side of the furnace wall, and is disposed in a region of lower temperature than the furnace wall. Consequently, the shaft spindle <b>40</b> is composed of material with a larger linear expansion coefficient than the shaft section <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The shaft spindle <b>40</b> is provided with a fitting shaft <b>41</b> which fits the fitting hole <b>23</b><i>a</i>. The fitting shaft <b>41</b> is configured with a two-step structure corresponding to the fitting hole <b>23</b><i>a </i>of two-step structure.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A fitting section <b>50</b>, where the fitting hole <b>23</b><i>a </i>of the shaft section <b>20</b> and the fitting shaft <b>41</b> of the shaft spindle <b>40</b> fit, is connected by a weld portion <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the fitting section <b>50</b> has a first fitting section <b>51</b> where fitting occurs with a prescribed interstice at a position separated from the position where the weld portion <b>3</b> is formed (the welding position), and a second fitting section <b>52</b> where fitting occurs with an interstice larger than that of the first fitting section <b>51</b> at a position adjacent to the welding position. The first fitting section <b>51</b> and the second fitting section <b>52</b> together constitute a loose fit.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Therefore, according to the roller for in-furnace conveyance <b>1</b> of the aforementioned configuration, restriction at the weld portion <b>3</b> is reduced as a result of the large clearance in the immediate vicinity of the weld portion <b>3</b> due to the second fitting section <b>52</b>. Consequently, strain and stress are alleviated at the weld portion <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In order to prevent the outflow of heat from the shaft spindle <b>40</b>, the roller for in-furnace conveyance <b>1</b> is provided with a heat insulating member <b>60</b> so as to cover the distal portion of the fitting shaft <b>41</b>. The heat insulating member <b>60</b> is provided so as to fill the hollow section S<b>2</b> of the region corresponding to the tapered section <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">By providing the heat insulating member <b>60</b>, the outflow of heat from the shaft spindle <b>40</b> can be prevented. On the other hand, the temperature difference between the shaft section <b>20</b> and the shaft spindle <b>40</b> increases, with the result that the difference in heat deformation between the shaft section <b>20</b> and the shaft spindle <b>40</b> increases. However, restriction at the weld portion <b>3</b> is reduced, because of the large clearance in the immediate vicinity of the weld portion <b>3</b> due to the second fitting section <b>52</b>. Consequently, strain and stress at the weld portion <b>3</b> are alleviated.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Consequently, according to the roller for in-furnace conveyance <b>1</b> of the second embodiment, heat outflow is prevented, and strain and stress at the weld <b>3</b> are alleviated.</p>
