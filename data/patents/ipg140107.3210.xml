<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The subject matter disclosed herein relates generally to light emitting devices and methods. More particularly, the subject matter disclosed herein relates to light emitting devices and methods comprising at least one pattern and/or array of light emitting diodes (LEDs).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Light emitting devices, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), may be utilized in packages for providing white light (e.g., perceived as being white or near-white), and are developing as replacements for incandescent, fluorescent, and metal halide high-intensity discharge (HID) light products. A representative example of an LED device comprises a device having at least one LED chip, a portion of which can be coated with a phosphor such as, for example, yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG). The phosphor coating can convert light emitted from one or more LED chips into white light. For example, LED chips can emit light having desired wavelengths, and phosphor can in turn emit yellow fluorescence with a peak wavelength of about 550 nm, for example. A viewer perceives the mixture of light emissions as white light. As an alternative to phosphor converted white light, light emitting devices of red, green, and blue (RGB) wavelengths can be combined in one device or package or device to produce light that is perceived as white.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Despite availability of various LED devices and methods in the marketplace, a need remains for improved devices and improved manufacturability of devices suitable for industrial and commercial lighting products and replacement of conventional light sources, such as for example, 50 to 100 watt HID and high wattage compact fluorescent (CFL) lamps, outdoor lighting products, home luminaires, and retrofit light bulbs. A need remains for improved devices suitable for a range of low to high voltage applications. LED devices and methods described herein can advantageously enhance light output performance and accommodate various low to high voltage applications while promoting ease of manufacture.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In accordance with this disclosure, novel light emitting devices and methods are provided that are well suited for a variety of applications, including industrial and commercial lighting products. It is, therefore, an object of the present disclosure herein to provide light emitting devices and methods comprising at least one pattern, arrangement, and/or array of light emitting devices optimized to enhance light output performance and accommodate various low to high voltage applications while providing energy savings.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">These and other objects of the present disclosure as can become apparent from the disclosure herein are achieved, at least in whole or in part, by the subject matter disclosed herein.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Reference will now be made in detail to possible aspects or embodiments of the subject matter herein, one or more examples of which are shown in the figures. Each example is provided to explain the subject matter and not as a limitation. In fact, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used in another embodiment to yield still a further embodiment. It is intended that the subject matter disclosed and envisioned herein covers such modifications and variations.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As illustrated in the various figures, some sizes of structures or portions are exaggerated relative to other structures or portions for illustrative purposes and, thus, are provided to illustrate the general structures of the present subject matter. Furthermore, various aspects of the present subject matter are described with reference to a structure or a portion being formed on other structures, portions, or both. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, references to a structure being formed &#x201c;on&#x201d; or &#x201c;above&#x201d; another structure or portion contemplates that additional structure, portion, or both may intervene. References to a structure or a portion being formed &#x201c;on&#x201d; another structure or portion without an intervening structure or portion are described herein as being formed &#x201c;directly on&#x201d; the structure or portion. Similarly, it will be understood that when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;connected&#x201d;, &#x201c;attached&#x201d;, or &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; to another element, it can be directly connected, attached, or coupled to the other element, or intervening elements may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly connected&#x201d;, &#x201c;directly attached&#x201d;, or &#x201c;directly coupled&#x201d; to another element, no intervening elements are present.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Furthermore, relative terms such as &#x201c;on&#x201d;, &#x201c;above&#x201d;, &#x201c;upper&#x201d;, &#x201c;top&#x201d;, &#x201c;lower&#x201d;, or &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; are used herein to describe one structure's or portion's relationship to another structure or portion as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that relative terms such as &#x201c;on&#x201d;, &#x201c;above&#x201d;, &#x201c;upper&#x201d;, &#x201c;top&#x201d;, &#x201c;lower&#x201d; or &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, structure or portion described as &#x201c;above&#x201d; other structures or portions would now be oriented &#x201c;below&#x201d; the other structures or portions. Likewise, if devices in the figures are rotated along an axis, structure or portion described as &#x201c;above&#x201d;, other structures or portions would now be oriented &#x201c;next to&#x201d; or &#x201c;left of&#x201d; the other structures or portions. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Light emitting devices according to embodiments described herein may comprise group III-V nitride (e.g., gallium nitride) based light emitting diodes (LEDs) or lasers fabricated on a growth substrate, for example, silicon carbide substrate, such as those devices manufactured and sold by Cree, Inc. of Durham, N.C. For example, Silicon carbide (SiC) substrates/layers discussed herein may be 4H polytype silicon carbide substrates/layers. Other silicon carbide candidate polytypes, such as 3C, 6H, and 15R polytypes, however, may be used. Appropriate SiC substrates are available from Cree, Inc., of Durham, N.C., the assignee of the present subject matter, and the methods for producing such substrates are set forth in the scientific literature as well as in a number of commonly assigned U.S. patents, including but not limited to U.S. Pat. No. Re. 34,861; U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,547; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,200,022, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As used herein, the term &#x201c;Group III nitride&#x201d; refers to those semiconducting compounds formed between nitrogen and one or more elements in Group III of the periodic table, usually aluminum (Al), gallium (Ga), and indium (In). The term also refers to binary, ternary, and quaternary compounds such as GaN, AlGaN and AlInGaN. The Group III elements can combine with nitrogen to form binary (e.g., GaN), ternary (e.g., AlGaN), and quaternary (e.g., AlInGaN) compounds. These compounds may have empirical formulas in which one mole of nitrogen is combined with a total of one mole of the Group III elements. Accordingly, formulas such as AlxGa1-xN where 1&#x3e;x&#x3e;0 are often used to describe these compounds. Techniques for epitaxial growth of Group III nitrides have become reasonably well developed and reported in the appropriate scientific literature.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Although various embodiments of LEDs disclosed herein comprise a growth substrate, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the crystalline epitaxial growth substrate on which the epitaxial layers comprising an LED are grown may be removed, and the freestanding epitaxial layers may be mounted on a substitute carrier substrate or submount which may have better thermal, electrical, structural and/or optical characteristics than the original substrate. The subject matter described herein is not limited to structures having crystalline epitaxial growth substrates and may be used in connection with structures in which the epitaxial layers have been removed from their original growth substrates and bonded to substitute carrier substrates.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Group III nitride based LEDs according to some embodiments of the present subject matter, for example, may be fabricated on growth substrates (such as a silicon carbide substrates) to provide horizontal devices (with both electrical contacts on a same side of the LED) or vertical devices (with electrical contacts on opposite sides of the LED). Moreover, the growth substrate may be maintained on the LED after fabrication or removed (e.g., by etching, grinding, polishing, etc.). The growth substrate may be removed, for example, to reduce a thickness of the resulting LED and/or to reduce a forward voltage through a vertical LED. A horizontal device (with or without the growth substrate), for example, may be flip chip bonded (e.g., using solder) to a carrier substrate or printed circuit board (PCB), or wire bonded. A vertical device (without or without the growth substrate) may have a first terminal solder bonded to a carrier substrate, mounting pad, or PCB and a second terminal wire bonded to the carrier substrate, electrical element, or PCB. Examples of vertical and horizontal LED chip structures are discussed by way of example in U.S. Publication No. 2008/0258130 to Bergmann et al. and in U.S. Publication No. 2006/0186418 to Edmond et al., the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">An LED can be coated, at least partially, with one or more phosphors with the phosphors absorbing at least a portion of the LED light and emitting a different wavelength of light such that the LED emits a combination of light from the LED and the phosphor. In one embodiment, the LED emits a white light combination of LED and phosphor light. An LED can be coated and fabricated using many different methods, with one suitable method being described in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 11/656,759 and 11/899,790, both entitled &#x201c;Wafer Level Phosphor Coating Method and Devices Fabricated Utilizing Method&#x201d;, and both of which are incorporated herein by reference. In the alternative, LEDs can be coated using other methods such an electrophoretic deposition (EPD), with a suitable EPD method described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/473,089 entitled &#x201c;Close Loop Electrophoretic Deposition of Semiconductor Devices&#x201d;, which is also incorporated herein by reference. It is understood that LED devices and methods according to the present subject matter can also have multiple LEDs of different colors, one or more of which may be white emitting.</p>

In one aspect, first pattern P<b>1</b> comprises what is referred to herein as a grid arrangement, pattern or design, where at least two LEDs are at least substantially aligned in at least two directions and can include single, unaligned LEDs at opposing ends of a set or string of LEDs. Each of the LEDs <b>25</b> comprising first pattern P<b>1</b> can be electrically connected in series. In one aspect, second arrangement or second pattern P<b>2</b> can be disposed adjacent first pattern P<b>1</b>, for example, located at the second and ninth strings of LEDs <b>25</b>.

Any suitable number of LEDs <b>25</b> can be connected in any suitable configuration or arrangement such as in series to form a string having a suitable pattern. Care must be taken when connecting LEDs <b>25</b> in series such that the positive or negative electrode of a preceding LED electrically connects to an electrode of opposite electrical polarity for a subsequent LED for allowing electrical current to flow properly through the string of LEDs <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Third pattern P<b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> can comprise a checkerboard pattern having a checkerboard design, or arrangement of LEDs <b>25</b> electrically connected in series.

For illustration purposes, only three patterns are shown although any suitable number of patterns could be utilized. The alternating LEDs <b>25</b> of third pattern P<b>3</b> can optimize light output by ensuring uniform coverage and spatial alignment over conducting pad <b>30</b> such that light emission is uniform and improved.

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The LEDs even in a single set or string in emission area <b>16</b> can comprise LEDs in more than one pattern or configuration. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrates one aspect of a possible arrangement of LEDs in emission area <b>16</b> where there are at least two sets, shown here as strings without limitation, of LEDs <b>25</b> and where LEDs <b>25</b> for some sets or strings are arranged in different patterns or configurations with respect to another set or string of LEDs and even within one single set or string of LEDs. Any two given separate sets or strings of LEDs <b>25</b> can be electrically connected in a pattern such that some or all of the LEDs within each of the two sets or strings of LEDs can be arranged in different patterns, in identical patterns, or in any combination of patterns. In other words, the LEDs in any given set or string can be disposed in different or identical patterns with respect not only to the LEDs in that set or string but can also be disposed in any pattern with respect to another set or string of LEDs and the two sets or strings can in one aspect be parallel to one another. For example, LEDs <b>25</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> can be disposed in one aspect such that emission area <b>16</b> comprises a combination of different arrangements or patterns, for example, a first pattern P<b>1</b>A, a second pattern P<b>2</b>A and/or a third pattern P<b>3</b>A for optimizing light emission and device brightness.

That is, a given set of LEDs <b>25</b> can comprise LEDs <b>25</b> in different orientations. In other aspects, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> for example, pattern P<b>2</b> and pattern P<b>3</b> can comprise sets of rectangular LEDs <b>25</b> where the major axis is the same is the same for the given set but different from the orientation of other sets.</p>

The present subject matter envisions retention material <b>14</b> disposed in areas, positions, or locations R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>, and/or any location therebetween. When retention material <b>14</b> is disposed in locations R<b>1</b> or R<b>2</b>, it can be disposed over and cover at least a portion of one or more wirebonds <b>26</b> connecting outermost LEDs <b>25</b>A to electrical elements, such as conductive trace <b>34</b>.

<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a string of one or more LEDs <b>25</b>, for illustration purposes four LEDs <b>25</b> are shown but strings of LEDs <b>25</b> can comprise any suitable number of LEDs, for example, 14 LEDs <b>25</b> arranged in series. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a cross-section of substrate <b>12</b> over which LEDs <b>25</b> can be mounted or otherwise arranged. Substrate <b>12</b> can comprise, for example, conducting pad <b>30</b>, first and second conductive traces <b>33</b> and <b>34</b>, and solder mask <b>32</b> at least partially disposed between conducting pad <b>30</b> and each of conductive traces <b>33</b> and/or <b>34</b>. As noted earlier, if retention material is positioned adjacent outermost LEDs <b>25</b>A, for example in location R<b>1</b>, solder mask <b>32</b> between conducting pad <b>30</b> and first and second conductive traces <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> can be eliminated as it would no longer be necessary.

For illustration purposes, substrate <b>12</b> can comprise a MCPCB, for example, those available and manufactured by The Bergquist Company of Chanhassan, Minn. Any suitable substrate <b>12</b> can be used, however. Core layer <b>38</b> can comprise a conductive metal layer, for example copper or aluminum. Dielectric layer <b>36</b> can comprise an electrically insulating but thermally conductive material to assist with heat dissipation through substrate <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates retention material <b>14</b> arranged, for example, in position R<b>2</b> at least partially over each of solder mask <b>32</b> and the wirebond <b>26</b> connecting to conductive traces <b>33</b> and <b>34</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates filling material <b>40</b> disposed over the one or more LEDs <b>25</b>.

<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> further illustrates examples of first and second heights H<b>1</b> and H<b>2</b> of filling material <b>40</b> which can be selectively filled within LED device <b>10</b>. First height H<b>1</b> can comprise a height at which filling material <b>40</b> is disposed over the LEDs <b>25</b>. The height may vary due to process variability, so an average height above the string of LEDs <b>25</b> can be used and controlled for optimal brightness. Second height H<b>2</b> can comprise a height at which filling material <b>40</b> is selectively disposed over a top surface of conducting pad <b>30</b>. Second height H<b>2</b> can be controlled, for example, by controlling the location of retention material <b>14</b> and whether it assumes location R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b> or any position therebetween. Second height H<b>2</b> can also be controlled by controlling the amount of filling material <b>40</b> dispensed into the cavity defined by retention material <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Controlling the volume of filling material <b>40</b> within the cavity, or dam defined by retention material <b>14</b> can affect first and second heights H<b>1</b> and/or H<b>2</b> and can notably allow for fine-tuning, or micro-tuning the color, or wavelength, of light emitted from LED device <b>10</b>. Micro-tuning the color of LED devices <b>10</b> can therefore ideally increase product yields to 100%. For example, the amount of color affecting components, including but not limited to phosphors, contained in filling material <b>40</b> can be selectively added and the first and/or second heights H<b>1</b>, H<b>2</b> can be selectively controlled by under or over filling the filling material <b>40</b> within emission area <b>16</b> depending on the wavelength of LEDs <b>25</b> used within device <b>10</b>. Location of retention material <b>14</b>, for example, locating retention material at R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>, or any position or distance therebetween can also affect first and/or second heights H<b>1</b> and H<b>2</b>. Micro-tuning color can be achieved over multiple devices or on a per device, or package, basis by changing, for example the ratio of volume of phosphor to overall dispense capability volume of filling material <b>40</b>. The ratio of volume of phosphor to overall dispense capability volume of filling material <b>40</b> can be adjusted based on the wavelength bin of LEDs <b>25</b> selected for use in a given device to attain the desired overall wavelength output of LED device <b>10</b>. By manipulating, for example, the diameter of the dam provided by retention material <b>14</b> and/or the height of retention material <b>14</b>, each of which can affect heights H<b>1</b> and/or H<b>2</b> and therefore the volume of fill material, the color of individual devices <b>10</b> can be micro-tuned thereby attaining higher process yields. Notably, selectively controlling a volume of the fill material such that color-affecting components of the fill material can be fine-tuned allows for light produced by the one or more LEDs to fall within a predetermined and precise color range.</p>

In this embodiment, one or more ESD protection device or Zener diode <b>44</b> can be disposed in gap <b>42</b> and can be electrically connected, or mounted to conductive area <b>54</b>. In this embodiment, conductive area <b>54</b> can comprise an area larger than a footprint of Zener diode <b>44</b>. Zener diode <b>44</b> can be positioned over conductive area <b>54</b> between ends of first and second conductive traces <b>33</b> and <b>34</b>. Zener diode <b>44</b> can be reversed biased with respect to the one or more strings of LEDs <b>25</b>. For example, when one Zener diode <b>44</b> is used, one or more wirebonds <b>46</b> can connect conductive area <b>54</b> to one of first and second conductive traces <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> such that Zener diode <b>44</b> can be reverse biased with respect to the strings of LEDs <b>25</b>. As Zener diodes <b>44</b> are typically black and absorb light, placing the at least one Zener diode <b>44</b> in gap <b>42</b> between conductive traces <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> and also beneath retention material <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) can further improve light output intensity.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> also illustrates one possible location for test point <b>15</b>. Test point <b>15</b> can be disposed within the area marked by broken lines <b>52</b> which correspond to conducting material disposed under solder mask. Broken lines <b>52</b> illustrate one possible aspect of the size and/or shape of the conducting material which can be deposited on or in substrate <b>12</b> for electrically coupling conductive traces <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> and attachment surfaces <b>18</b>. The electrical coupling allows electrical current to be communicated from attachment surfaces <b>18</b> to the one or more strings of LEDs <b>25</b> electrically connected to traces <b>33</b> and <b>34</b>. The lines are broken to illustrate how the material can be disposed under solder mask <b>32</b>. Thus, test point <b>15</b> and attachment surfaces <b>18</b> electrically and/or thermally communicate with respective conductive traces, and can comprise the same layer of material. Solder mask <b>32</b> can be deposited or disposed at least partially between respective conductive traces and conducting pad <b>30</b>, such that the solder mask <b>32</b> comprises a substantially circular arrangement about conducting pad <b>30</b>. Conductive pad <b>30</b> can comprise one or more marks or notches <b>62</b> for orientation purposes and for proper alignment of retention material <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Solder mask <b>32</b> can also be deposited in areas outside of the conductive traces, for example, between the respective conductive traces and one or more attachment surfaces <b>18</b> and/or test point <b>15</b>.

The electrical current can flow into and/or out of the conductive traces and therefore into and out of respective strings of LEDs <b>25</b> mounted over conducting pad <b>30</b>. In one aspect, test point <b>15</b> can allow electrical properties of the device to be tested when probed with an electrically conductive test wire or device (not shown). The arrangement illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, i.e., the location of conductive traces <b>33</b> and <b>34</b>, conductive area <b>54</b>, Zener diode <b>44</b>, and test point <b>15</b> prior to placing retention material <b>14</b> can correspond to any one of the previously described LED devices e.g., <b>10</b> and <b>50</b> or any of the devices described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-14</figref>. For example, LED devices described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11-14</figref> can comprise at least one opening or hole, generally designated <b>20</b>, that can be disposed through or at least partially through substrate <b>12</b> for facilitating attachment of the LED devices to an external substrate or surface.

<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 to 14</figref> illustrate top views of different embodiments of LED devices. Such devices may be similar in many aspects to previously described LED devices <b>10</b> and <b>50</b>, but can also be useful for a range of low and/or high voltage applications in addition to attaining different light output by pattern variation. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates one embodiment of an LED device, generally designated <b>60</b> which can be used in lower voltage applications. In one aspect and for example only without limitation, LED device <b>60</b> can be operable at approximately 16 V. In one aspect, LED device <b>60</b> can be operable at less than approximately 16 V, for example, 14 to 16 V. In one aspect, LED device <b>60</b> can be operable at more than approximately 16 V, for example, 16 to 18 V. In one aspect, using more than 140 LEDs <b>25</b>, e.g., more than LED device <b>10</b> and changing the pattern of LEDs <b>25</b> can allow LED device <b>60</b> to be operable at lower voltage applications. In one aspect, the pattern can be changed by electrically connecting less than 14 LEDs <b>25</b> together in a series or string.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates at least two sets of LEDs arranged in two patterns forming a reticulated array of LEDs <b>25</b> within emission area <b>16</b>. For example, a first set of LEDs can comprise second pattern P<b>2</b>, previously described. A second set of LEDs can comprise a fourth pattern P<b>4</b>. Each pattern can comprise, for example, 30 strings of five LEDs <b>25</b> electrically connected in series. That is, fewer than 14 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B) LEDs <b>25</b> can be electrically connected in series in a given string. The first and last strings of LEDs <b>25</b> can comprise five LEDs <b>25</b> electrically connected in series according to previously described second pattern P<b>2</b>. The second to twenty-ninth strings can comprise another pattern different from the first and thirtieth strings. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates five LEDs <b>25</b> electrically connected in series according to pattern P<b>2</b>, the strings can be disposed on conducting pad <b>30</b> proximate one or more rounded outer edges of emission area <b>16</b>. LEDs <b>25</b> arranged in the first and thirtieth strings can, for example and without limitation, be spaced equidistant from each other and uniformly across emission area <b>16</b> according to pattern P<b>2</b>. LEDs <b>25</b> arranged in pattern P<b>2</b> can comprise a straight line arrangement in which longer axes of LEDs <b>25</b> are substantially parallel. The shorter axes of LEDs <b>25</b> in pattern P<b>2</b> can also be at least substantially parallel. Longer axes of LEDs <b>25</b> arranged in pattern P<b>2</b> can be aligned perpendicular to wirebonds <b>26</b>. In addition, longer axes of LEDs <b>25</b> arranged in pattern P<b>2</b> can be perpendicular to longer axes of LEDs <b>25</b> arranged in adjacent patterns, e.g., pattern P<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In one aspect, pattern P<b>4</b> can comprise five LEDS <b>25</b> electrically connected in series across conducting pad <b>30</b>. Pattern P<b>4</b> can comprise a straight line of LEDs, and each of the five LEDs <b>25</b> can be positioned such that longer axes of LEDs <b>25</b> are substantially aligned along a straight line. In one aspect, longer axes of each LED <b>25</b> can be aligned in a same direction as the direction of wirebonds <b>26</b> connecting the LEDs <b>25</b> to conductive traces <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> disposed below retention material <b>14</b>. Adjacent strings, e.g., adjacent strings in the second through twenty-ninth strings of LEDs <b>25</b> connected in pattern P<b>4</b> can alternate above and below a straight line such that the LEDs <b>25</b> form a substantially checkerboard type arrangement. That is, a first string of LEDs <b>25</b> arranged in pattern P<b>4</b> (i.e., the second overall string of LEDs <b>25</b> disposed below the first string comprising pattern P<b>2</b>) can comprise five LEDs <b>25</b> spaced equidistant apart, leaving a space in between adjacent LEDs <b>25</b>. In the alternative, LEDs <b>25</b> in pattern P<b>4</b> could be wirebonded in a checkerboard arrangement, but that could increase the voltage at which device <b>60</b> is operable. Below the first string of LEDs <b>25</b> arranged in pattern P<b>4</b>, a subsequent string of LEDs <b>25</b> arranged in pattern P<b>4</b> can be positioned or placed such that the LEDs <b>25</b> are substantially within and/or slightly below the space between adjacent LEDs <b>25</b> of the preceding string. That is, LEDs <b>25</b> arranged in pattern P<b>4</b> can comprise a first string aligned such that a bottom edge of each LED <b>25</b> in the string is aligned along a same first straight line. LEDs <b>25</b> in a neighboring subsequent string of pattern P<b>4</b> can be aligned such that a top edge of each LED <b>25</b> is also aligned along the same first straight line as the bottom edge of LEDs <b>25</b> in the preceding string. Thus, LEDs <b>25</b> of preceding and subsequent strings alternate above and/or below spaces between adjacent LEDs <b>25</b> in a given string, and the top and bottom edges of LEDs <b>25</b> in adjacent strings can be aligned along a same line. This arrangement comprises a substantially checkerboard shaped orientation which can advantageously allow LEDs <b>25</b> to uniformly emit light from LED device <b>60</b> without one or more adjacent LEDs blocking light.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Additional strings of LEDs <b>25</b> arranged in pattern P<b>4</b> can alternate according to the first two strings just described. Strings of LEDs <b>25</b> comprising pattern P<b>4</b> can comprise a same or similar width over emission area <b>16</b>. That is, each adjacent LED <b>25</b> of a given string can be spaced apart at equidistant lengths, but the overall string length may not be uniformly across emission area <b>16</b>. Rather, LEDs <b>25</b> can be spaced such that the second to twenty-ninth rows form a substantially reticulated array over emission area <b>16</b>. In one aspect, LEDs <b>25</b> form a rectangular array over emission area <b>16</b> which utilizes a substantially uniform portion of horizontal segments, or chords of conducting pad <b>30</b>. In one aspect, LED device <b>60</b> can comprise at least one group of LEDs <b>25</b> arranged in more than one string of LEDs, where the overall configuration can be in a predetermined geometrical shape, such as for example and without limitation, a rectangle. Any suitable number of LEDs <b>25</b> may be connected in series. Fewer number of LEDs <b>25</b>, for example five LEDs <b>25</b> connected in series as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> can allow LED device <b>60</b> to be suitable for lower voltage applications, for example 16 V applications. For illustration purposes, 30 strings of five LEDs <b>25</b> arranged in one or more patterns are illustrated for operation at lower voltages, however, any suitable number of strings and/or LEDs <b>25</b> electrically connected in series is contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">LED device <b>60</b> can comprise outermost LEDs <b>25</b>A electrically connected via electrical connectors such as wirebonds <b>26</b> to conductive traces <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). Retention material <b>14</b> can then be dispensed at least partially about conducting pad <b>30</b> and at least partially over wirebonds <b>26</b>. Retention material <b>14</b> can be dispensed about emission area <b>16</b> which can comprise a plurality of LED chips, or LEDs <b>25</b> disposed within and/or below filling material <b>40</b> such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Filling material <b>40</b> can be at least partially contained by retention material <b>14</b>, and retention material can be used to control or adjust various heights of filling material as may be desirable. Notably, LED device <b>60</b> can comprise a uniform optical source in the form of single, cohesive, and undivided emission area which can simplify the manufacturing process for manufacturers of light products requiring a single component. LEDs <b>25</b> can be spaced a suitable distance apart such that device <b>60</b> can advantageously emit uniform light without having any light blocked by one or more adjacent LEDs <b>25</b>. The patterns and pattern spacing (i.e., spacing between adjacent LEDs <b>25</b> and spacing between adjacent strings of LEDs <b>25</b>) disclosed for example in LED devices <b>10</b> and <b>60</b> allow for optimization of light extraction by reducing the amount of light blocked by adjacent LEDs <b>25</b> and adjacent strings of LEDs <b>25</b>. The pattern spacing disclosed for example in LED devices <b>10</b> and <b>60</b> can further be configured and expanded, for example, by increasing the spacing between adjacent LEDs <b>25</b> (e.g., to pattern spacing illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-14B</figref>) to maximum spacing within a given string and between one or more strings to further maximize and attain a higher efficiency and light extraction within a given LED device.</p>

For example, the first and last strings proximate rounded edges of conducting pad <b>30</b> can comprise 14 LEDs <b>25</b> arranged in previously described pattern P<b>2</b>. The longitudinal axes of adjacent LEDs <b>25</b> in pattern P<b>2</b> can be aligned such that they are at least substantially parallel.

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, strings of LEDs <b>25</b> disposed between outermost strings of second pattern P<b>2</b> can comprise a different pattern, for example, third pattern P<b>3</b> previously described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>. Third pattern P<b>3</b> can comprise a substantially checkerboard pattern or arrangement of LEDs <b>25</b> electrically connected in series.

LED device <b>70</b> can be disposed uniformly across emission area <b>16</b> and/or conducting pad <b>30</b>, for example. In general, adjacent LEDs <b>25</b> in each of the strings of LED device <b>70</b> can be spaced at equidistant intervals to utilize a substantial portion of horizontal segments of conducting pad <b>30</b>.

The one or more strings of device <b>80</b> can have the same and/or different patterns. For illustration purposes, previously described pattern P<b>3</b> is illustrated. LEDs <b>25</b> can be arranged in a checkerboard pattern alternating above and below a horizontal line. Adjacent LEDs <b>25</b> can be spaced a substantially uniform distance from each other across a large portion of the surface area of conducting pad <b>30</b>.

Spacing between adjacent LEDs <b>25</b> within the same string and adjacent LEDs <b>25</b> within different strings has been maximized to minimize the amount of light absorbed by adjacent LEDs.

The second through fifth strings of LEDs <b>25</b> within LED device <b>85</b> comprise pattern P<b>3</b>. When comparing the six string arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> to the six string arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>, it is apparent that the strings of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref> are more spread out, i.e., vertically and horizontally spaced further apart on conducting pad <b>30</b> to utilize more of the mounting area.

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In one aspect, inter-string spacing, that is, spacing between adjacent LEDs <b>25</b> of the same string has been increased by at least approximately 31%, or by 125 &#x3bc;m, or greater in the vertical direction for pattern P<b>3</b> from LED device <b>80</b> to LED device <b>85</b>.

<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Using a large quantity of LEDs <b>25</b> comprising a smaller footprint over a single emission area can advantageously allow for more uniform light output in addition to desirable optical properties such as high brightness as the LEDs <b>25</b> can be arranged into one or more uniform patterns over a portion of emission area <b>16</b>. The concentrated patterns of LEDs <b>25</b> can allow for concentrated light emission. In one aspect, the density or spacing of LEDs <b>25</b> in the one or more patterns described herein can be adjusted such that light will not be absorbed or blocked by adjacent LEDs <b>25</b>. That is, patterns and arrangements of LEDs <b>25</b> disclosed herein may improve light extraction by minimizing the amount of light absorbed by adjacent, or neighboring LEDs <b>25</b>. The number of LEDs <b>25</b> per string can allow LED devices to be operable at low to high voltages. For illustration purposes, four patterns have been illustrated. However, any suitable pattern of LEDs <b>25</b> is contemplated. Each string of LEDs <b>25</b> can comprise a single pattern or a combination of more than one pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref> illustrate methods of die attach that can, for example and without limitation, be used for LED devices according to the disclosure herein. LED <b>25</b> can comprise a backside metal pad or bonding layer <b>100</b> for mounting over conducting pad <b>30</b>. Bonding layer <b>100</b> can comprise a length of the entire bottom surface LED <b>25</b> or a portion thereof. For illustration purposes, bonding layer <b>100</b> is illustrated as having a same length as the entire bottom surface of LED <b>25</b>, however, any configuration is contemplated. LED <b>25</b> can comprise lateral sides <b>104</b> which can extend between an upper surface and the bottom surface of LED <b>25</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref> illustrate inclined lateral sides <b>104</b>, however, lateral sides <b>104</b> can be substantially vertical or straight where a straight-cut LED is selected. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref> illustrate LEDs <b>25</b> having an upper surface of a greater surface area than an area of bottom surface comprising bonding layer <b>100</b>. However, upper surface can be of a smaller surface area than the surface area of bonding surface. LEDs <b>25</b> can comprise a square, rectangle, or any suitable shape in addition to having any suitable lateral side configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Any suitable die attach method can be used to mount LED <b>25</b> over conducting pad <b>30</b> in any of the LED devices previously described. In one aspect, any suitable optimized die attach method and/or materials can be used. For example, optimized die attach methods can comprise metal-to-metal die attach methods for facilitating attachment of one or more metals on and/or between LED <b>25</b> and conducting pad <b>30</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> illustrates an example of a metal-to-metal die attach method which can be eutectic or non-eutectic. This metal-to-metal die attach method can comprise using an assist material <b>106</b> to facilitate the metal-to-metal die attach. In one aspect, a flux-assisted eutectic metal-to-metal die attach method can be used and in other aspects a metal-assisted non-eutectic metal-to-metal die attach method can be used. In a flux-assisted eutectic, or flux eutectic, die attach method, bonding layer <b>100</b> can comprise a metal alloy having a eutectic temperature, for example, but not limited to, an alloy of gold (Au) and tin (Sn). For example, bonding layer <b>100</b> can comprise an 80/20 Au/Sn alloy having a eutectic temperature of approximately 280&#xb0; C. In the flux eutectic technique, assist material <b>106</b> can comprise a flux material. In the non-eutectic technique, assist material <b>106</b> can comprise a metallic material. The assist material <b>106</b> can comprise a conduit for facilitating the metal-to-metal die attach between the bonding layer <b>100</b> and conducting pad <b>30</b> when the bonding layer <b>100</b> is heated above the eutectic temperature. The metal of bonding layer <b>100</b> can flow into and attach to the metal of conducting pad <b>30</b>. The metal of bonding layer <b>100</b> or can atomically diffuse and bond with atoms of the underlying mounting conducting pad <b>30</b>. In one aspect, flux used in a flux-assisted eutectic method can comprise a composition, for example, 55-65% rosin and 25-35% polyglycol ether in addition to small amounts of other components. Any suitable flux material can be used however.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Flux-assisted eutectic die attach methods can be tedious, and it is unexpected to use such methods when attaching a large quantity of LEDs <b>25</b> in predetermined arrangements and/or an array. Flux eutectic die attach according to the present subject matter can comprise dispensing flux assist material <b>106</b>, that can be liquid at room temperature, in an amount to be precisely the right volume to avoid either swimming of the LEDs <b>25</b> or poor die attach if too much or too little flux is used. Flux-assisted eutectic die attach according to the present subject matter can also require the right composition for each of the flux assist material <b>106</b> and bonding metal <b>100</b> of the emitter chips. Flux-assisted eutectic die attach according to the present subject matter can optimally utilize a very clean and flat surface and substrates that do not move or bend during heating and cooling such to stress the solder joint. Flux-assisted eutectic according to the present subject matter can utilize a fine surface roughness that is small enough not to encumber the Au/Sn bonding surface of the emitter chips while being rough enough to allow flux to escape during heating. The heating profile can be matched perfectly to the bonding metal <b>100</b>, such as Au or AuSn, to ensure a good weld between the bonding metal <b>100</b> and underlying conducting pad <b>30</b>. Using flux-assisted eutectic for die attach according to the present subject matter also can utilize an inert atmosphere, such as a nitrogen atmosphere, to reduce oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>) levels and also allow gravity to apply a downward force on LEDs <b>25</b>. This can reduce the amount of oxidation at the metal-to-metal bond between bonding layer <b>100</b> and underlying conducting pad <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, a non-eutectic metal-to-metal die attach method can be used which can also comprise an assist material <b>106</b>, wherein the assist material <b>106</b> can comprise a metallic material. In this aspect, bonding layer <b>100</b> can comprise a single metal or a metal alloy. For example, bonding layer <b>100</b> can comprise Au, Sn, or AuSn. In non-eutectic methods, the bonding layer does not need to reach or exceed a temperature, for example, a eutectic temperature. In this aspect, assist material <b>106</b> can comprise a metallic material to facilitate the metal-to-metal bonding. For example, assist material <b>106</b> can comprise AuSn paste or Ag epoxy. Any suitable metallic assist material <b>106</b> can be used. The metal of bonding layer <b>100</b> can attach to the metal of the assist material <b>106</b>. The metal of the assist material <b>106</b> can also attach to the metal of conducting pad <b>30</b>. In one aspect, a metal &#x201c;sandwich&#x201d; forms between bonding layer <b>100</b>, assist material <b>106</b>, and conducting pad <b>30</b> in non-eutectic metal-to-metal attach techniques where a metallic assist material <b>106</b> is used. Metal-assisted, non-eutectic die attach can be tedious, just as flux-assisted methods, and it is also unexpected to use such methods when attaching LEDs <b>25</b> within one or more patterns for LED devices described herein. Metal-to-metal attachment using an assist material <b>106</b> can be hard to control and tedious when attaching multiple small footprint LEDs within a device.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> illustrates a metal-to-metal die attach technique which does not require an assist material <b>106</b>. One such method can comprise a thermal compression die attach method wherein the metal of bonding layer <b>100</b> will directly attach to the metal of conducting pad <b>30</b>. The thermal compression method can be eutectic or non-eutectic. In one aspect, thermal compression can be used when bonding layer <b>100</b> comprises an alloy having a eutectic temperature. In other aspects, bonding layer <b>100</b> can comprise a metal not having a eutectic temperature. Conducting pad <b>30</b> can comprise any suitable metal, not limited to a Cu, Al, Ag, or Pt layer within a metal core printed circuit board (MCPCB). Bonding layer <b>100</b> comprises any suitable metal. In one aspect, bonding layer <b>100</b> can comprise a layer of Sn having any suitable thickness. In one aspect, bonding layer <b>100</b> can comprise a thickness greater than approximately 0 &#x3bc;m. In one aspect, bonding layer <b>100</b> can comprise a bonding layer equal to or greater than at least approximately 0.5 &#x3bc;m. In one aspect, bonding layer <b>100</b> can comprise a layer of Sn having a thickness of at least equal to or greater than approximately 2.0 &#x3bc;m. Unlike the flux-assisted eutectic or metal-assisted non-eutectic methods just described, thermal compression metal-to-metal die attach techniques can utilize an external downward force F as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Force F can comprise a compression delivered in a heated environment, thus deemed a thermal compression, as opposed to dispensing a flux or metallic assist material <b>106</b>. The thermal compression technique is an alternative die attach method developed to reduce metal squeeze out along the conducting pad <b>30</b> which can form Shottky or Shunt defects and allow subsequent leakage of current and other various and related problems. In one aspect, the bonding temperature in thermal compression techniques can be approximately 255-265&#xb0; C. after optionally subjecting conducting pad <b>30</b> to a pre-heat treatment or process. Conducting pad <b>30</b> can be heated to a mounting temperature of at least 20&#xb0; C. above the melting temperature of the bonding layer <b>100</b>. The bonding time can be approximately 300 msec and the bonding force can be approximately 50+/&#x2212;10 grams (g). Predetermined settings can be important for this method, including adequate preheat, bonding temperature, bonding time, and bonding force. The equipment and predetermined settings for use with thermal compression methods can be difficult to use and/or maintain, and it is unexpected to use such methods when attaching a large quantity of LEDs <b>25</b> in an array and/or one or more patterns. Metal-to-metal methods for attaching an array of LEDs in LED devices is not known and is unexpected to use flux-assisted eutectic, metal-assisted non-eutectic, or thermal compression die attach techniques for attaching one or more strings of LEDs <b>25</b> in an array or pattern arrangement.</p>
