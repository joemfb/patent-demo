<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosed invention relates generally to fabrication of integrated circuits, and more particularly, but not by way of limitation, to wiring levels on an integrated circuit in a back-end-of-line (BEOL) processing that include active and/or nonlinear devices embedded therein.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">From the beginning of semiconductor manufacture, there has been a progressive trend to miniaturizing electrical components through dimension scaling, thereby resulting in increased circuit density over time. In the general manufacturing scheme of an integrated circuit (IC), there are two major parts, the front end of line (FEOL) processing and the back end of line (BEOL) processing.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, the FEOL layer contains active and nonlinear devices requiring a semiconductor, such as transistors, diodes, varactors, photodetectors, photo-emitters, polysilicon resistors, MOS (metal-oxide-silicon or metal-oxide-semiconductor) capacitors, waveguides, waveguide modulators, etc. The BEOL contains passive, linear devices made from metals and insulators, such as signal and power wires, transmission lines, metal resistors, metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors, inductors, fuses, etc. The FEOL processing may include a transistor and other active or nonlinear devices being formed on a semiconducting wafer surface, for example a Si wafer, and the back end of line (BEOL) may include the devices being wired together with a patterned multilevel metallization processes.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To support the increased component density, a hierarchical wiring method was developed for the BEOL, in which multiple levels of interconnect wires are fabricated in a level-by-level scheme. The BEOL then generally includes a plurality of wiring levels to provide interconnections for the FEOL devices to carry the signals therebetween. A set of far BEOL (FBEOL) connections is formed, and the integrated circuit (IC) is then finally protected by a sealing layer. Completed IC's are tested, including a plurality of electrical tests to determine a proportion of the devices on the wafer that perform within certain preset parameters to provide a yield.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To fabricate the BEOL interconnect layers, a damascene or dual damascene process is commonly used and is known in the art. The dual damascene process allows for hierarchical wiring management and reduced cost.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As dimension scaling reaches fundamental limits, one general approach to increase the IC density and functionality has been to combine two prefabricated IC's in a stacked or three dimensional (3-D or 3D) IC. This is a high cost solution. For example, wafer bumping is one 3D packaging technology, in which two or more layers of active electronic components are integrated into a single 3D circuit or package. Currently, a 3D integrated (IC) chip requires that more than one IC layer be fabricated independently (be it partial or full fabrication), stacked, and then packaged together. The yield in the latter steps is low, again leading to increased cost. Therefore, a new method is needed to help in the wiring of the devices in order to help increase the circuit density and still provide a high yield and reduced cost.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The prefabrication of more than one integrated circuit (IC) also requires that more than one silicon wafer be used. A separate substrate is necessary for each prefabricated device layer that is bonded together. Moreover, there are many extra steps and inherent problems of the subsequent stacking and bonding of the ICs, and these steps lead to increased cost of the stacked 3-D IC. In one example, two IC chips can be bonded together with the aid of insulating and adhesive layers in order to stack two IC chips together. The bonding can be made by thermo-compression, fusion bonding, oxide bonding, or by use of an intermediate bonding layer, for example, an adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Generally, a bonded structure can include a semiconductor device layer stack and a first set of functional elements, such as BEOL interconnect elements. The BEOL interconnect elements can at least partially connect the circuits present in the semiconductor device layer. The stacked components are separately formed, and then bonded after being stacked. However, in order to implement a 3D stacked IC solution, reliability and high yields of individual elements along with very high bonding yields and precise alignment methods need to be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">There have been a plurality of other problems in the bonding process including having to deal with the forces that are required to form a strong wafer bond. For example, higher forces acting on a mechanically weak BEOL structure may damage that structure. Then, the prefabricated device layers must be modeled and modified in design in order to take account of the inherent forces due to deformation during bonding and subsequent cool down.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Additionally, there are problems with the bonded contacts. These include reliability over use, defects, and degradation of circuit performance. There are also problems in that extra steps are necessary for the fabrication process at the back-end in order to have more than one active layer. This can increase costs and increase the possible defects of the final product.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Therefore, there is also a need to improve the overall mechanical strength of the BEOL hierarchical wiring structures.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Moreover, there is a problem in reduced yield as the circuit density has increased. Additionally, the performance of signals traveling through interconnects has degraded with the increased wiring density. The BEOL interconnects have become mechanically weaker with the use of low-k and porous dielectrics to regain signal performance.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">There is a need for increased density and high performance in the integrated circuits such that circuit function can be distributed amongst a plurality of circuit layers without adversely impacting circuit performance and increasing manufacturing costs.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Therefore, it is also desirable to provide improved BEOL structures incorporating individual devices interconnected with wiring on the wafer that allows for increased circuit density as compared to present day chips while still increasing performance and yield.</p>

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In view of the foregoing and other problems, disadvantages, and drawbacks of the aforementioned background art, an exemplary aspect of the disclosed invention provides wiring levels on an integrated circuit, such as damascene Cu wiring levels on an integrated circuit. Commonly, the damascene Cu wiring levels are fabricated in a low-K dielectric having a tensile stress, although oxide dielectrics having compressive stress are also used. Herein, the term &#x201c;silicon nitride&#x201d; (SiN) is used to include an alloy of silicon and nitrogen, and also an alloy of silicon, carbon, and nitrogen (SiCN), and both these alloys may include hydrogen (H).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Another exemplary aspect of the disclosed invention is to provide a termination of at least one damascene Cu wiring level (fabricated in a low-K dielectric, either porous or non-porous, or in a dense oxide dielectric), with a semiconductor active or nonlinear device layer, including sublayers, for example, of a semiconductor, a metal, and an insulator. In contrast to the related art, this layer of semiconductor active and/or nonlinear devices is integrated within the wiring levels, as opposed to bonded from a separate substrate. No bonding interface exists within the active/nonlinear device layer of this invention. In contrast to the related art, this layer of semiconductor active and/or nonlinear devices is located under the sealing layer and FBEOL connections.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Another exemplary aspect of this invention is to provide the internal stress of a semiconductor layer having active nonlinear devices in order to provide a substrate with a near-zero curvature after completion of the active semiconductor layer.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Yet another exemplary aspect of this invention provides a termination of at least one damascene Cu wiring level with a semiconductor layer in which nonlinear devices and active circuits are located in the semiconductor layer and are connected as a single integrated circuit based on one Si wafer base layer.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">It is still another exemplary aspect of this invention to provide additional circuit functions, the circuit functions being located within an active semiconductor layer including sub-layers.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In accordance with one exemplary aspect of the disclosed invention, a monolithic integrated circuit is provided, including a substrate, a plurality of nonlinear semiconductor device layers formed above the substrate, and at least one metal wiring layer with vias interconnecting the plurality of semiconductor device layers. Generally, the monolithic integrated circuit also includes a single sealing layer and a set of FBEOL connections above the plurality of semiconductor device layers.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The nonlinear semiconductor device layers are interconnected by the at least one metal wiring layer constructed within a dielectric layer. The dielectric layer is deposited on the substrate. The plurality of nonlinear or active semiconductor devices are fabricated in the plurality of semiconductor device layers. More specifically, the plurality of devices are embedded within the BEOL wiring layers, with no bonding or joining interface such as would be required for such layers fabricated on a separate substrate. A first dielectric layer is deposited on the one metal wiring layer. Having these aspects, the integrated circuit of this exemplary aspect of the invention is called &#x201c;monolithic&#x201d;. Further aspects of the monolithic IC are now described.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The at least one metal wiring layer is terminated by depositing a first silicon nitride (SiN) or SiCN layer. Above a first silicon nitride layer located atop the one metal wiring level having at least one lower damascene Cu wiring level, a nonlinear semiconductor device layer is formed by deposition on the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A nonlinear device is formed on at least one of the plurality of semiconductor device layers.

The device of this example embodiment includes the first, second and control conductors connected to at least one of the metal wiring levels.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a specific embodiment, the plurality of nonlinear semiconductor devices includes a plurality of transistors. Gate, source, and drain conductor contacts of the transistors are connected to the metal wiring level located above said transistors. The gate, source, and drain conductor contacts of the transistors are fabricated through a second dielectric layer deposited on the semiconductor device layer. The second dielectric layer acts to encapsulate the contacts and the nonlinear device. The contacts may be optionally made using the shallow vias described below.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In another example embodiment, the nonlinear device includes a first conductor of a principal electrically conducting region, a second conductor of the principal electrically conducting region and a change in dopant concentration within the conducting region. The device of this example embodiment includes the first and second conductors connected to at least one of the metal wiring levels. This device performs a rectification or diode function.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The intrinsic stress in the first and second dielectric layers can be adjusted to minimize a net curvature of the substrate after completion of said second dielectric layer. This feature provides a BEOL wiring structure with an enhanced resistance to cracking, delamination, etc., when the inventive monolithic IC is diced and packaged.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In accordance with another exemplary aspect of the disclosed invention, a monolithic integrated circuit includes a substrate, a first wiring layer formed on the substrate, a first dielectric layer connected with the first wiring layer in the substrate, a first semiconductor layer comprising an active device formed in the substrate, a second dielectric layer formed on the first semiconductor layer in the substrate, and a second wiring layer formed on the second dielectric layer, and a second semiconductor layer, the second semiconductor layer is located in a BEOL (back-end-of-line) structure. The second semiconductor device layers are not continuous all across the substrate, but can be patterned into regions.</p>

The PD preferably has an internal compressive stress greater than 20 GPa. There are further steps of forming of two kinds of interconnects including the first and second wiring layers within the first dielectric. There are through-vias that do not pass through the plurality of semiconductor layers. Additionally, there are shallow vias that make electrical contact to one of the first semiconductor layers. The first or second dielectric layer preferably is planarized by CMP to remove topography.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The invention will now be described with reference to the drawing figures, in which like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout. It is emphasized that, according to common practice, the various features of the drawing are not necessary to scale. On the contrary, the dimensions of the various features can be arbitrarily expanded or reduced for clarity. Exemplary embodiments are provided below for illustration purposes and do not limit the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The exemplary disclosure describes, at least in part but not limited to, creating an integrated circuit with two or more levels of active device, whereas the related art has one level. In the related art, two independent layers are bonded together, whereas in the present exemplary disclosure there is a building in a stepwise fashion and using a single substrate. In the related art, two layers can be fabricated independently and then bonded together. Therefore, in the exemplary embodiments, there is a building of the multiple semiconductor layers with nonlinear devices as the process proceeds in a stepwise fashion and using only a single substrate. Therefore, a monolithic integrated circuit is formed, and the semiconductor layers are described as monolithically integrated.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The exemplary embodiments also relate to a structure that is a nonlinear device layer with interconnects both above and below. The interconnects are attached to both surfaces of the device layer. The method and structure of the exemplary disclosure does not prefabricate devices or integrated circuits on separate wafers.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The exemplary embodiments also provide a monolithic IC with more than one semiconductor nonlinear device layer under a single sealing layer.</p>

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The exemplary embodiments provide an increase in density and add new functions to integrated circuits, by providing a monolithic IC structure. A plurality of exemplary problems are solved, including a high mechanical strength layer being placed in the BEOL of an integrated circuit to enable chip packaging using lower strength ILDs (interlayer dielectrics) in the BEOL, and also active circuits being fabricated in the semiconductor device layer (e.g., Si layer) in the BEOL to increase circuit density compared to present day IC chips.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A semiconductor layer is fabricated in the BEOL. The semiconductor layer includes devices, circuits, and a plurality of features or functions including, but not limited to the following list.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">One feature or function (1) includes mechanical strength. The dielectric is preferably an oxide or nitride with high modulus and compressive stress. A preferred example is a very highly compressive stress nitride, SiN. This feature of mechanical strength provides the monolithic IC of the exemplary disclosed invention with a strong BEOL structure that enables success in dicing and packaging the IC.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Another feature or function (2) includes an active semiconductor layer, e.g. laser-recrystallized Si and associated doping, gate dielectric, and silicide layers so as to allow nonlinear devices listed below to be formed at low temperatures compatible with the underlying metal wiring levels.</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, an example of a semiconductor (or multifunction) active layer in a BEOL is shown. The high mechanical strength layer is indicated in the bands <b>32</b> and <b>42</b> within a Cu BEOL on an integrated circuit <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, general features of the active semiconductor layer <b>107</b> with high mechanical strength are illustrated. The exemplary embodiment described here provides the active semiconductor layer (or multifunction layer) <b>107</b> within the BEOL wiring levels of an integrated circuit where the active semiconductor layer <b>107</b> includes Si transistors connected to perform circuit functions or features such as listed above in functions (1) to (5). The active semiconductor layer <b>107</b> can include the active elements or devices, such as but not limited to, the ones listed above for features or functions (1) to (5).

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Further, this exemplary disclosure provides a very high mechanical strength termination of at least one Damascene Cu interconnect layers, by locating the Si circuit functions within a dielectric that has a modulus greater than 20 GPa (gigapascals) and an intrinsic stress that is adjusted according to the stress characteristics of the BEOL wiring levels of the integrated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The high modulus of the multifunction layer serves to raise the average (effective) modulus of the collective BEOL interconnect structure, resulting in an integrated circuit chip with high mechanical strength that is designed to undergo chip to package bonding with no mechanical failure. The circuit functions or features, as exemplified above, of the active semiconductor layer <b>107</b> serve to enhance the function of the integrated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In further detail, referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a substrate <b>101</b> contains integrated circuit devices <b>103</b> and the integrated circuit devices <b>103</b> are connected through a damascene Cu wiring level (or a BEOL metal wiring level) <b>105</b>. The Cu wiring can include other metals within the wiring.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Optionally, there are a plurality of damascene Cu wiring levels, but only one such level is shown here as an example (i.e., an interconnect or damascene Cu wiring level <b>105</b>). A wiring level is terminated with a dielectric. Therefore, in order to complete the damascene Cu wiring level <b>105</b>, a layer of SiN or SiCN alloy, as examples of a first dielectric layer <b>109</b> known as the Cu cap, is provided with the damascene Cu wiring level. Other types of dielectrics can be used. The first dielectric layer <b>109</b> can help prevent the reaction between above and below the first dielectric layer <b>109</b>. The first dielectric layer <b>109</b> can be a SiN layer, which is in strong adhesive contact with the damascene Cu wiring level <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Atop or stacked above the first dielectric (e.g., SiN or SiCN) layer <b>109</b> is a first semiconductor layer (e.g. Si device) layer <b>111</b>.

The crystal structure of the first semiconductor layer (or Si device layer) <b>111</b> is different in other exemplary embodiments. The layer can be crystalline, polycrystalline, or amorphous. The layer can be an alloy of Si (SiC, SiGe, SiGeC), or a compound III-V or II-VI semiconductor. A second wiring level <b>123</b> can be included above the active semiconductor <b>107</b>. Therefore, there are interconnects both above and below the active semiconductor layer <b>107</b> and all the mentioned layers are formed on a single substrate <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The first semiconductor layer <b>111</b> can be made of low thermal budget process for recrystallization so that the semiconductor, such as Si, can have a crystal structure with desirable semiconductor properties that may be superior to an amorphous Si structure. This crystal structure, through the low thermal budget process for recrystallization, provides the support for the devices fabricated in this layer. The process used for creating the crystal structure is not limited to low thermal budget process for recrystallization, but can be other similar or equivalent processes, so long as they are compatible with any thermal limitations of the existing, underlying wiring levels. For example, methods with a low thermal budget include, but are not limited to, rapid thermal annealing, pulsed continuous-wave laser annealing, nanosecond-pulsed laser annealing, and ultraviolet light assisted annealing.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In this exemplary embodiment, the Si device layer or first semiconductor layer <b>111</b> has characteristics of a crystalline layer evidenced by narrow X-ray diffraction peaks for the Si lattice and detected by other diffraction methods such as electron diffraction in a transmission electron microscopy (TEM).</p>

In some embodiments, the stress in dielectric <b>104</b> (of wiring layer <b>105</b>) is tensile stress, and then the first dielectric layer <b>109</b> and the second dielectric layer <b>113</b> are deposited to have a compressive stress. The magnitude of the compressive stress is adjusted using, for example, deposition methods known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The second dielectric layer <b>113</b> can be a dielectric with passivation and diffusion barrier properties as well.

Therefore, not every type of dielectric may be appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Regarding the first dielectric layer <b>109</b>, the first semiconductor layer <b>111</b> and the second dielectric layer <b>113</b> that form the active semiconductor layer <b>107</b>, there can also be sub-layers within or among any of those layers.
