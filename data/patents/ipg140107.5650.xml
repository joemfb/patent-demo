<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This patent document generally relates to contact data queries, and in particular relates to the storing and resolution of contact data received in response to contact data queries.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When a user of a communication device desires to communicate with a contact, the communication device requires the communication contact data associated with the contact, such as electronic addresses or telephone numbers. When the communication contact data for a particular contact are not stored in the communication device, the user of the communication device typically must search an external database for the communication contact data. The search may take an appreciable amount of time. Furthermore, during the search, the user of the communication device may not be able to perform communication functions until the search is completed. For example, if the communication functions include initiating a phone call, the phone program cannot allow a phone call to begin until the phone number is available. Similarly, if the communication functions include composing, addressing, and sending an e-mail, the e-mail program may not allow any functions to be performed while the search for a particular e-mail address is conducted.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Additionally, the user of the communication device may not desire to store the communication contact data received in response to the search. For example, if the user desires to keep address book entries to a minimum, or if the user knows that he or she will only communicate with the particular contact infrequently, the user may elect not to store the communication contact data in the address book on the communication device. If the user, however, needs to communicate with the contact several times over the course of the day, then the user must either execute the search each time the user invokes a communication application, or review previous message data sent to the contact in order to manually retrieve the communication contact data associated with the contact.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Finally, communication contact data received in response to a search may not be made available for multiple communication applications, or at a later time after a communication is completed. For example, if a search for contacts is conducted in an e-mail application environment, the corresponding communication contact data received may include both e-mail addresses and phone numbers. However, once the e-mail communication is sent, the communication contact data received in response to the search may be deleted, and thus is not available for later use by the e-mail program or any other communication application.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A processor-implemented method of operating a mobile communication device operable to execute one or more communication applications includes issuing a query for contact data over a communication network, creating a contact resolution object, receiving contact data responsive to the query over the communication network, the contact data comprising communication contact data for the one or more communication applications, associating the contact data received with the contact resolution object, and resolving the contact resolution object to select communication contact data.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A mobile device operable to initiate and receive communications over one or more wireless communication networks comprises a processing subsystem, a memory subsystem, a display subsystem, a communication subsystem, and an input/output subsystem. Mobile device program code is stored in the memory subsystem and comprises program instructions executable by the processing subsystem. Upon execution, the program code causes the mobile device to issue a query for contact data over a communication network, create a contact resolution object, receive contact data responsive to the query over the communication network, the contact data comprising communication contact data for one or more communication applications, associate the contact data received with the contact resolution object, and resolve the contact resolution object to select communication contact data.</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of a mobile device <b>100</b>. The mobile device <b>100</b> may comprise a display subsystem <b>102</b>, a processing subsystem <b>104</b>, a memory subsystem <b>106</b>, a keyboard subsystem <b>108</b>, and a communication subsystem <b>110</b>. The mobile device <b>100</b> may be any mobile communication device adapted to operate within a wireless communication network and is preferably a two-way communication device. An audio subsystem comprising a speaker <b>112</b> and a microphone <b>114</b> may also be included if the mobile device <b>100</b> supports voice communication functions. A more detailed description of the mobile device <b>100</b> and an exemplary operating environment for the mobile device <b>100</b> is described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref> below.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Depending on the functionality provided by the mobile device <b>100</b>, the mobile device <b>100</b> may be referred to as a data messaging device, a two-way pager, a cellular telephone with data messaging capabilities, a wireless Internet appliance or a data communication device (with or without telephony capabilities). Data communication functions, such as e-mail, instant messaging, paging, and the like, are primarily facilitated by the display subsystem <b>102</b>, the keyboard subsystem <b>108</b>, and the communication subsystem <b>110</b>, which provide the primary user interface and communication capability for composing, reading and replying to data communications. Voice communication functions are further facilitated by the audio subsystem comprising the speaker <b>112</b> and the microphone <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The memory subsystem <b>106</b> stores mobile device program code comprising program instructions that are executable by the processing subsystem <b>104</b>. The mobile device <b>100</b> is thus a programmable device that may be programmed to carry out multiple functions upon execution of the mobile device program code by the processing subsystem <b>104</b>. The memory subsystem <b>106</b> may also store contact data comprising contact names and associated communication contact data, such as telephone numbers and e-mail addresses. The contact data may be accessible by an application program for browsing and management. An address book program is an example of one such application that may store and manage contact data in the memory subsystem <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a structure block diagram of a contact query data system that may be implemented in the mobile device <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The mobile device <b>100</b> is operable to communicate over a network <b>202</b> and provides queries to and receives data from a contact database <b>204</b>. The mobile device <b>100</b> may have stored in the memory subsystem <b>106</b> a contact query module <b>210</b>, communication applications <b>220</b> and <b>230</b>, and a contact application <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The contact database <b>204</b> stores a list of contacts and their associated communication contact data. The communication contact data may comprise electronic addresses, such as e-mail addresses, instant messaging addresses, and pager numbers, for example, and may further comprise other communication contact data, such as telephone numbers, cell phone numbers, and the like. Exemplary contact databases <b>204</b> may be realized by implementing one of several commercially available systems, such as a Microsoft Exchange Server or a Lotus Domino Server.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The contact query module <b>210</b> determines an appropriate query structure depending on the service that it provides and the particular type of contact database <b>204</b>. For example, the contact query module <b>210</b> may conduct a search of an Outlook mail server directory using the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). Other mail protocols, such as Lotus Notes, may also be supported.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The communication applications <b>220</b> and <b>230</b> may be associated with different communication functions. For example, the communication application <b>220</b> may comprise an e-mail communication program, and the communication application <b>230</b> may comprise a telephone communication program. Additional communication applications may also be included in the mobile device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The contact application <b>240</b> may be associated with one or more communication applications and further provides a capability for the user to store, review, and organize contact data in the mobile device <b>100</b>. An address book application is an example of one such contact application <b>240</b>. The contact application <b>240</b> manages contact data for one or more contacts. The contact data comprises a contact's name, address, and associated communication contact data, such as telephone numbers, fax numbers, e-mail addresses, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A contact query may be initiated from within a communication application environment, as indicated by the arrow from the communication application <b>220</b> to the contact query module <b>210</b>. Alternatively, the contact query may be initiated from within a contact application environment, as indicated by the arrow from the contact application <b>240</b> to the contact query module <b>210</b>. A contact query may also be initiated from any other appropriate operating environment of the mobile device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A contact query is typically initiated when the user of the mobile device <b>100</b> desires to communicate with a particular contact but does not have the contact's corresponding communication contact data. For example, if the user desires to send a co-worker contact an e-mail message, and the user does not remember the co-worker contact's e-mail address and the co-worker contact's e-mail address is not stored in the user's mobile device <b>100</b>, then the user may initiate a search on a company global contact database <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Upon receiving contact query data, the contact query module <b>210</b> creates a contact resolution object <b>212</b>, and causes the mobile device <b>100</b> to transmit the query to the contact database <b>204</b> via the communication network <b>202</b>. Upon receiving contact data <b>214</b> responsive to the query, the contact query module <b>210</b> associates the contact data <b>214</b> received with the contact resolution object <b>212</b>. The contact resolution object <b>212</b> and the received contact data <b>214</b> are stored in the memory subsystem <b>106</b> of the mobile device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The contact resolution object <b>212</b> is an object that may be resolved to one or more contacts related to the received contact data <b>214</b>. When a contact resolution object <b>212</b> is resolved to a particular contact, then a communication application receives the corresponding communication contact data for that contact. For example, if a contact query comprises a search for contacts with the last name &#x201c;Smith&#x201d; and the received contact data <b>214</b> comprises contact data for three separate contacts with the last name &#x201c;Smith&#x201d;&#x2014;Andy Smith, Betty Smith, and Charlie Smith&#x2014;then the contact resolution object <b>212</b> may be resolved to any one of these three separate contacts. If the contact resolution object <b>212</b> is resolved to the first contact, e.g., Andy Smith, then a communication application will receive the corresponding communication contact data for Andy Smith. Thus, if the communication application is an e-mail program, the communication application will receive the e-mail address for the resolved contact Andy Smith. Similarly, if the communication application is a telephone communication program, then the communication application will receive the telephone number for Andy Smith.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The contact resolution object <b>212</b> may also function to allow communication applications to perform resolution independent functions prior to resolution of the contact resolution object <b>212</b>, and perform resolution dependent functions after resolution of the contact resolution object <b>212</b>. For example, when addressing an e-mail, a user of an e-mail client program may conduct a search of a global contact database <b>204</b>. However, when the search is being conducted, many e-mail client programs are either unable to perform other functions or will not allow the performance of other functions until the search is completed. Thus, a user may have to wait until the search of the contact database <b>204</b> is completed before addressing the e-mail to another contact, or composing the body of the e-mail. The contact resolution object <b>212</b>, however, represents an address object in the e-mail client program. Thus, the contact resolution object <b>212</b> allows a communication application <b>220</b> to perform resolution independent functions <b>222</b> prior to resolution, and allows the communication application <b>220</b> to perform resolution dependent functions after resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Upon creation of the contact resolution object <b>212</b>, the communication application <b>220</b> may perform resolution independent functions <b>222</b>. Resolution independent functions are functions that can be performed without resolving the contact resolution object <b>212</b> to a particular contact, such as composing the body of an e-mail message, addressing the e-mail message to other recipients, and the like. After received contact data <b>214</b> has been associated with the contact resolution object <b>212</b> and the contact resolution object <b>212</b> is resolved to a particular contact so that the communication application <b>220</b> receives communication contact data <b>216</b> for the particular contact, then the communication <b>220</b> application may perform resolution dependent functions. Resolution dependent functions are functions that can be performed only after resolving the contact resolution object <b>212</b> to a particular contact, such as addressing the e-mail message to the actual e-mail address of the resolved contact, sending the e-mail message to the recipients, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Because the contact resolution object <b>212</b> and the associated contact data are stored in the mobile device <b>100</b> memory, the contact resolution object <b>212</b> may be later referenced and resolved to another contact. For example, upon creation of the contact resolution object <b>212</b>, a corresponding entry in an address book associated with a contact application <b>240</b> is created. After received contact data <b>214</b> has been associated with the contact resolution object <b>212</b>, the contact resolution object <b>212</b> may be repeatedly referenced and resolved to particular contacts. For example, after sending the e-mail message to Andy Smith, the user of the mobile device <b>100</b> may later reference the contact resolution object <b>212</b> and resolve the contact resolution object to Betty Smith or Charlie Smith to obtain their corresponding communication contact data <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Resolution of the contact resolution object <b>212</b> may be context-sensitive. The resolution is context-sensitive when the selection of particular communication contact data causes the mobile device to launch a corresponding communication application, or when the communication contact data are automatically selected depending on the corresponding communication application environment.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">For example, if the user of the mobile device <b>100</b> resolves a contact resolution object <b>212</b> from within an environment of a telephone communication application, the corresponding phone number in the communication contact data <b>216</b> is provided to the telephone communication application. Similarly, if the user of the mobile device <b>100</b> resolves a contact resolution object <b>212</b> from within the environment of a e-mail communication application, the corresponding e-mail address in the communication contact data <b>216</b> will be provided to the e-mail communication application. Alternatively, if the user of the mobile device <b>100</b> resolves a contact resolution object <b>212</b> from within the environment of a contact application <b>240</b> and selects a particular address in the communication contact data <b>218</b>, such as a telephone number, a corresponding communication application <b>230</b> will launch, such as a telephone communication application. Finally, if contact data for only one contact is received, then the contact resolution object <b>212</b> may be auto-resolved to the contact data for the one contact. Alternatively, the user may be prompted to confirm auto-resolution to the contact data received for the one contact.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow diagram <b>300</b> of a contact query process. In step <b>302</b>, a query for contact data is issued over a communication network from the mobile device <b>100</b>. The query is responsive to a user input query, such as a search conducted from an address book application or from within a communication application environment.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In step <b>304</b>, a contact resolution object is created. In the embodiment shown, the contact resolution object is created upon the query being issued over the communication network. In another embodiment, however, the contact resolution object may be created upon receiving contact data responsive to the query.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In step <b>306</b>, contact data responsive to the query is received at the mobile device <b>100</b>. The contact data typically comprises contact names and associated communication contact data, such as telephone numbers and e-mail addresses.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In step <b>308</b>, the contact data received is associated with a contact resolution object. Associating the contact data received with the contact resolution object allows the contact resolution object to be resolved to one or more contacts.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In step <b>310</b>, the contact resolution object is resolved to select communication contact data. The resolution may be automatic, such as the case in which contact data for only one contact is received, or may be subject to user selection, such as the case in which contact data for a plurality of contacts is received.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is flow diagram <b>320</b> for enabling resolution-independent and resolution-dependent functions. Steps <b>322</b>, <b>324</b>, and <b>326</b> occur after the creation of a contact resolution object. In step <b>322</b>, performance of resolution independent functions is enabled. Resolution independent functions are functions that do not require resolution of the contact resolution object, e.g., addressing a communication to another contact, composing a body of the message of a communication, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Step <b>324</b> monitors whether the contact resolution object has been resolved. If the contact resolution object has not been resolved, then step <b>324</b> continues to monitor whether the contact resolution object has been resolved. If the contact resolution object has been resolved, then performance of resolution dependent functions is enabled in step <b>326</b>. Resolution dependent functions are functions that require resolution of the contact resolution object, e.g., addressing a communication to a contact listed in the contact data associated with the contact resolution object, sending an e-mail communication to the contact, initiating a telephone communication to the contact, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flow diagram <b>330</b> for a first context-sensitive selection of communication contact data. In step <b>332</b>, the contact resolution object is resolved to a contact. In step <b>334</b>, selection of communication contact data associated with the resolved contact resolution object is enabled. Step <b>334</b> may be implemented, for example, by displaying the communication contact data associated with the contact, such as the contact's telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, and other communication contact data.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In step <b>336</b>, communication contact data are selected. The communication contact data may be selected by the user, such as the manual selection of an e-mail address, or may be automatically selected depending on selection rules defined by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In step <b>338</b>, a communication application corresponding to the selected communication contact data is launched. For example, if the selected communication contact data is a telephone number, then a telephone communication application is launched. Similarly, if the selection communication contact data selected is an e-mail address, then an e-mail communication application is launched.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flow diagram <b>340</b> for a second context-sensitive selection of communication contact data. The second context-sensitive selection of communication contact data is dependent upon the communication application environment from which the contact resolution object is resolved.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In step <b>342</b>, the contact resolution object is resolved in a communication application environment. A contact resolution object may be resolved in a communication application environment by selecting the contact resolution object and resolving it to a particular contact. For example, if the communication application is an e-mail communication application, then the contact resolution object may be listed in the address line of the e-mail message. Selecting the contact resolution object may invoke the displaying of a list of associated contacts, and selection of one or more of the contacts will resolve the contact resolution object. Thus, if a contact resolution object is associated with five contacts and their corresponding communication contact data, then selection of one or more of the contacts will resolve the contact resolution object to the one or more selected contacts.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In step <b>344</b>, communication contact data corresponding to the communication application environment is selected. For example, if the communication application is an e-mail communication application, then the e-mail address of the contact to which the contact resolution object has been resolved is selected. If the contact resolution object has been resolved to more than one contact, then the e-mail addresses of the contacts to which the contact resolution object has been resolved are selected. In step <b>346</b>, the resolved contact resolution object is replaced by the communication contact data selected in step <b>344</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flow diagram <b>350</b> for storing and executing contact queries. Often a user of the mobile device <b>100</b> may not desire to store the communication contact data received in response to each search. For example, if the user desires to keep address book entries to a minimum, or if the user knows that he or she will only communicate with the particular contacts that are responsive to the search infrequently, the user may elect not to store the communication contact data in the address book on the mobile device <b>100</b>. Thus, the search query and associated contact data are temporarily stored on the mobile device <b>100</b>. If the user needs to communicate with the contacts several times over the course of the day, then the user need only reference the contact resolution object to obtain the communication contact data.
<br/>
Communication contact data received in response to each search may also be deleted to minimize memory requirements. For example, in one embodiment, the number of contact resolution objects comprising query data and communication contact data received is limited to a fixed number, e.g., five, and prioritized on a first-in, first-out basis. Thus, if five contact resolution objects are stored, and a sixth contact resolution object is created, then the first-in of the five stored contact resolution objects is deleted so that the sixth contact resolution object may be stored. To further minimize memory requirements, the contact data may be deleted after the occurrence of an event, e.g., a timeout period, and the query data retained and associated with the contact resolution object. Accordingly, if the user needs to communicate with a contact whose contact data has been deleted, the user need only access the contact resolution object rather than reenter the query data to again execute the query.
</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In step <b>352</b>, the query data and contact data associated with a contact resolution object are stored in the mobile device <b>100</b> memory subsystem <b>106</b>. The query data may comprise a simple search string, such as &#x201c;Smith&#x201d; for a search for contacts with the name &#x201c;Smith.&#x201d; The query data may also comprise wildcards and Boolean expressions, such as root expanders, AND operators, OR operators, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Step <b>354</b> monitors whether a contact data deletion event has occurred. A contact data deletion event is an event that will cause the contact data associated with a contact resolution object to be deleted from the mobile device <b>100</b> memory subsystem <b>106</b>. The event may be a timeout period from the last access of the contact resolution object, a set time period, a low memory condition, or some other event that may be monitored for occurrence.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">If the contact data deletion event has not occurred, then step <b>354</b> continues to monitor whether the contact data deletion event has occurred. If the contact data deletion event has occurred, then in step <b>356</b> the contact data associated with the contact resolution object are deleted.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Step <b>358</b> then monitors whether the contact resolution object is selected. If the contact resolution object has not been selected, then step <b>358</b> continues to monitor whether the contact resolution object is selected. The monitoring step <b>358</b> may continue until the contact resolution object is selected, or until a deletion event occurs which causes the contact resolution object to be deleted from the mobile device <b>100</b> memory subsystem <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">If the contact resolution object has been selected, then step <b>360</b> issues the stored query for contact data over the communication network. Thus, the user need not recreate or manually reenter the query. Upon receiving contact data responsive to the query, the contact data are again associated with the contact resolution object and steps <b>352</b>-<b>360</b> are repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Query data may be deleted in much the same manner as the contact data is deleted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. For example, after the contact data associated with the query data is deleted, then the mobile device may monitor for the occurrence of a deletion event associated with the query data, such as the expiration of a time-out period or the occurrence of a low memory condition. This prevents the accumulation of unused query data. In another embodiment, both the query data and the contact data are deleted after the occurrence of a deletion event, such as the expiration of a time-out period or the occurrence of a low memory condition. In another embodiment, the contact resolution object is deleted upon the occurrence of storage of the communication contact data in a contact management store, such as an address book application.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Conditions may also occur that prevent deletion of a contact resolution object. For example, if a contact resolution object is resolved to a telephone number, and the user of the mobile device then engages in telephone call to the telephone number of a duration longer than a time-out period that would require deletion of the contact resolution object, the selection of the contact resolution object by the telephone application may prevent such deletion. Likewise, if a contact resolution object is selected by an e-mail application, and the user of the mobile device composes and then saves the e-mail for sending at a later time, the contact resolution object selected by the e-mail program will be stored at least until the e-mail application sends the e-mail communication. Thus, selection or referencing of a contact resolution object (whether resolved or not resolved) by a communication application can preclude deletion of the contact resolution object until a communication is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-19</figref> describe exemplary display environments for embodiments of the apparatus and methods described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref> above. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is an illustration of a first address book display environment <b>400</b> on the mobile device <b>100</b>. As shown, the user of the mobile device <b>100</b> has searched the address book on the mobile device <b>100</b> for a contact named &#x201c;Karen,&#x201d; as indicated by search string <b>402</b>. A search result <b>404</b> indicates that no results were found in response to the search of the locally stored contacts.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is an illustration of a second address book display environment <b>410</b> and a search dialog box <b>412</b>. The search dialog box <b>412</b> corresponds to searches that are conducted on external contact databases, such as the contact database <b>204</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The user enters a search string <b>414</b> for the contact named &#x201c;Karen.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> are illustrations of the second address book display environment <b>410</b> and the contact resolution object <b>420</b>. Upon issuing the search query to the external contact database, the contact resolution object <b>420</b> is created and displayed as an entry in the address book. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the contact resolution object <b>420</b> comprises a bracketed string &#x201c;[Searching: Karen].&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The text of the string indicates that the complete results of the search have not yet been received from the external contact database. Thus, in this embodiment, the contact resolution object includes status indicia indicating the status of the search. In one embodiment, the contact resolution object cannot be resolved until the entire search is completed. In another embodiment, the contact resolution object may be resolved as soon as contact data are received for one or more contacts responsive to the query for contact data.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the contact resolution object <b>420</b> comprises a bracketed string &#x201c;[6 matches: Karen],&#x201d; thus indicating that the search on the external contact database is complete and contact data for six contacts responsive to the query have been received. The user may now select and resolve the contact resolution object in the manner described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref> above.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is an illustration of a first communication application environment <b>430</b> and a contact resolution object <b>432</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the user has addressed an e-mail message to a contact named Karen. However, because there is no contact information corresponding to a contact named Karen stored on the mobile device <b>100</b>, the user has initiated a query for contact data from within the e-mail communication application environment <b>430</b>. The contact resolution object <b>432</b> includes the text string <b>434</b> &#x201c;Searching: Karen&#x201d; indicating that the complete results of the search have not yet been received from the external contact database. The user, however, may still perform resolution independent functions within the communication application environment, such as typing an e-mail message in an e-mail editor window <b>436</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> are illustrations of the first communication application environment <b>430</b> and a plurality of contact resolution objects <b>432</b>, <b>438</b>, and <b>440</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates that more than one query for contact data may be conducted simultaneously. For example, contact resolution objects <b>438</b> and <b>440</b> are associated with queries for contact data related to contacts named Amy and Scott, respectively. Furthermore, a query for contact data may be issued to an external contact database even if there are contact data stored on the mobile device that are responsive to the query. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the external contact database has been queried for contact data responsive to contacts having the name Amy and for contact data responsive to contacts having the name Scott, even though such responsive contact data are stored in the locally stored contacts <b>406</b>. The external contact database may be queried for such responsive contact data when the user of the mobile device is aware the locally stored contact information is dated, or if searching for another contact having the same name as one of the locally stored contacts.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">A contact resolution object may be resolved by selecting the contact resolution object and viewing its associated contact data. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the contact resolution object <b>432</b> has been selected. A drop down menu <b>442</b> has been activated to select a &#x201c;View Search&#x201d; menu option <b>444</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is an illustration of a first contact query results display environment <b>450</b>. The first contact query results display environment <b>450</b> is displayed in response to the selection of the &#x201c;View Search&#x201d; menu option <b>444</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. The six matches for responsive contact data include contact data for contacts Karen Jones <b>454</b>, Karen Peterson <b>456</b>, Karen Sangster <b>458</b>, Karen Smith <b>460</b>, Karen William <b>462</b>, and Karen Williamson <b>464</b>. The contact Karen Sangster <b>458</b> has been selected, indicating that the user desires to address the e-mail communication to this contact. While only one contact has been selected, several contacts could also be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is an illustration of the first communication application environment <b>430</b> and a resolved contact resolution object <b>466</b>. In this embodiment, the resolved contact resolution object <b>466</b> comprises the e-mail address of the contact selected in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, Karen Sangster. By resolving the contact resolution object <b>432</b> to Karen Sangster in a communication application environment, the e-mail communication contact data for this contact is automatically selected and provided to the e-mail communication application. While the contact resolution object <b>432</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> was resolved to only one contact, had several contacts been selected, the contact resolution object would have been resolved to several e-mail addresses.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In another embodiment, the contact resolution object <b>432</b> may be retained in the address field after resolution so that the user may again refer to the contact resolution object <b>432</b> and resolve it to another contact. For example, should the user resolve the contact resolution object <b>432</b> to an incorrect contact, the user may delete the resolved contact resolution object <b>466</b>, and again resolve the contact resolution object <b>432</b> to the correct contact. Likewise, should the user decide to address the message to an additional contact associated with the contact resolution object <b>432</b>, the user may resolve the contact resolution object <b>432</b> to the additional contact.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In another embodiment, the contact resolution object <b>432</b> is retained and displays resolution indicia indicating that the contact resolution object <b>432</b> has been resolved to a particular contact. For example, should the user resolve the contact resolution object <b>432</b> to the contact Karen Sangster, the contact resolution object <b>432</b> text will change from &#x201c;[6 matches: Karen]&#x201d; to &#x201c;[Karen Sangster]&#x201d;, indicating that the object <b>432</b> has been resolved to the contact Karen Sangster. The contact resolution object <b>432</b> may be resolved to a different associated contact, however, should the user decide to address the message to the different contact.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In another embodiment, communication contact data associated with a contact to which a contact resolution object is resolved is stored. For example, if several queries are conducted by the user, and the resulting several contact resolution objects are resolved to a plurality of contacts, the plurality of contacts and associated communication contact data may be stored separately from the contact resolution objects. The plurality of contacts and associated communication contact data may be stored in a memory store separate from the memory store storing contact resolution objects, such as a separate directory for resolved contacts, for convenient access, or even retention after deletion of the contact resolution objects.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is an illustration of the first communication application environment <b>430</b> and an unresolved dialog box <b>456</b>. The unresolved dialog box <b>456</b> is displayed when the user of the mobile device <b>100</b> attempts to initiate or send a communication with an unresolved contact resolution object. As illustrated, the contact resolution objects <b>438</b> and <b>440</b> are unresolved. In the embodiment shown, if the user elects to send the e-mail communication without resolving the contact resolution objects <b>438</b> and <b>440</b>, then the contact resolution objects <b>438</b> and <b>440</b> are discarded. If the user elects to not send the e-mail, the user may then select the contact resolution objects <b>438</b> and <b>440</b> for resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is an illustration of a second contact query results display environment <b>470</b>. The second contact query results display environment <b>470</b> may be invoked from an address book application environment, such as by selecting the contact resolution object <b>420</b> listed as an address book entry in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. In the embodiment shown, the string <b>472</b> &#x201c;Lookup: Karen&#x201d; indicates that the contact resolution object <b>420</b> has associated contact data for the contacts <b>454</b>, <b>456</b>, <b>458</b>, <b>460</b>, and <b>462</b>. A drop-down menu <b>474</b> includes a select menu option <b>476</b>, an e-mail menu option <b>478</b>, a PIN menu option <b>480</b>, a telephone menu option <b>482</b> and a view menu option <b>484</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Selection of the select menu option <b>476</b> will resolve the contact resolution object to the selected contact <b>458</b>, Karen Sangster. Selection of either the e-mail menu option <b>478</b>, PIN menu option <b>480</b>, or the telephone menu option <b>482</b> will invoke a corresponding communication application associated with the e-mail, PIN or telephone communication contact data for the selected contact <b>458</b>. Additional menu options for additional communication contact data may also be displayed. For example, if the contact <b>460</b>, Karen Smith, has a pager number included in her corresponding communication contact data, then a &#x201c;Page&#x201d; menu option may be displayed upon selection of the contact <b>460</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In another embodiment, the communication contact data associated with each contact may be viewed and edited before using and/or saving in a memory store. Selection of the view menu option <b>484</b> will display the contact data for the selected contact <b>458</b>, Karen Sangster. Thus, upon selecting a particular menu option, the corresponding communication contact data may be displayed for editing and saving. The edited communication contact data may be stored in an address book, or may be stored in the temporary storage area used to store the communication contact data associated with the contact resolution object.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is an illustration of device display environment <b>490</b> and a query notification dialog box <b>492</b>. If a query for contact data takes an appreciable amount of time, the user of the mobile device <b>100</b> may exit the communication application environment until the contact data responsive to the query is received, at which time the user may then resolve the contact resolution object. For example, if the user has composed an e-mail but contact data responsive to the contact query has not been received, the user may save the message with the referenced contact resolution object and exit the e-mail application. Upon contact data being received and associated with the contact resolution object, the mobile device <b>100</b> may notify the user that the contact resolution object may be resolved. Accordingly, the user may then provide an affirmative answer to the query notification <b>492</b> to open the e-mail message, resolve the contact resolution object, and send the e-mail message.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In addition to receiving contact data responsive to contact query, the mobile device may receive other data responsive to the contact query. For example, if the remote contact database <b>204</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> does not include any entries responsive to the contact query, a &#x201c;No Results Found&#x201d; message may be generated. Additionally, if the mobile device is out of coverage, or if the contact data received is corrupted, appropriate error messages may also be generated. Appropriate error processing or decision options may be implemented to handle such events.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a block diagram of an example redirector system <b>2000</b> for redirecting electronic messages to and from a mobile communication device <b>2020</b>. The mobile device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be used in the example system <b>2000</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. The example redirection system <b>2000</b> includes an enterprise server <b>2004</b>, a mail server <b>2002</b>, a storage medium <b>2006</b> for electronic messaging (e.g., e-mail) account data, and a wireless gateway <b>2016</b>. Also illustrated are the mobile communication device <b>2020</b>, a wireless network <b>2018</b>, a wide area network (WAN) <b>2012</b>, a firewall <b>2010</b>, a desktop client <b>2008</b>, and one or more other electronic messaging systems <b>2014</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The mail server <b>2002</b> may include electronic messaging software executing on a computer within a local area computer network (LAN). The mail server <b>2002</b> is coupled to local network devices <b>2004</b>, <b>2006</b>, <b>2008</b> via the LAN, and is coupled to remote network devices <b>2014</b>, <b>2016</b> via the WAN <b>2012</b>. The LAN and WAN <b>2012</b> may be separated by a firewall <b>2010</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The mail server <b>2002</b> maintains an electronic message account within the electronic message account database <b>2006</b> for each desktop client <b>2008</b> in the LAN. The electronic message account database <b>2006</b> may be one or more storage devices coupled to the mail server <b>2002</b>, and may be included within the same network device as the mail server <b>2002</b> or in one or more separate devices within the LAN. The desktop client <b>2008</b> may be one of a plurality of computers (e.g., personal computers, terminals, laptop computers, or other processing devices) coupled to the mail server <b>2002</b> via the LAN that execute electronic messaging software to send and receive electronic messages via the mail server.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Electronic messages sent from the desktop client <b>2008</b> are stored by the mail server <b>2002</b> in an outgoing message storage location (an &#x201c;outbox&#x201d;) within a corresponding electronic message account <b>2006</b>. If the outgoing message is addressed to an electronic message account within the LAN, then the mail server <b>2002</b> delivers the message to an incoming message storage location (an &#x201c;inbox&#x201d;) in the appropriate electronic message account <b>2006</b>. If the outgoing message is addressed to an electronic message account in another electronic messaging system <b>2014</b>, however, then the message is delivered via the WAN <b>2012</b>. Similarly, incoming electronic messages addressed to the electronic message account <b>2006</b> is received by the mail server <b>2002</b> and stored to the electronic message account database <b>2006</b> within the appropriate incoming message storage location (&#x201c;inbox&#x201d;). The incoming electronic message may then be retrieved from the electronic message account <b>2006</b> by the desktop client <b>2008</b>, or may be automatically pushed to the desktop client <b>2008</b> by the mail server <b>2002</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The enterprise server <b>2004</b> may include electronic message redirection software executing on a computer within the LAN. The enterprise server <b>2004</b> is operational to redirect electronic messages from the electronic message account <b>2006</b> to the mobile communication device <b>2020</b> and to place messages sent from the mobile communication device <b>2020</b> into the electronic message account <b>2006</b> for delivery by the mail server <b>2002</b>. The enterprise server <b>2004</b> stores mobile device information, such as a wireless identification (e.g., a PIN), used to communicate with the mobile communication device <b>2020</b>. The enterprise server <b>2004</b> may, for example, communicate with the mobile communication device <b>2020</b> using a direct TCP/IP level connection with the wireless gateway <b>2016</b>, which provides an interface between the WAN <b>2012</b> and the wireless network <b>2018</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">When an electronic message is received in the inbox of the electronic message account <b>2006</b>, the electronic message is detected by the enterprise server <b>2004</b>, and a copy of the message and any necessary mobile device information are sent over the WAN <b>2012</b> to the wireless gateway <b>2016</b>. For example, the enterprise server <b>2004</b> may encapsulate a copy of the message into one or more data packets along with a wireless identification (e.g., a PIN) for the mobile communication device <b>2020</b>, and transmit the data packet(s) to the wireless gateway <b>2016</b> over a direct TCP/IP level connection. The wireless gateway <b>2016</b> may then use the wireless identification and/or other mobile device information to transmit the data packet(s) containing the electronic message over the wireless network <b>2018</b> to the mobile communication device <b>2020</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Electronic messages sent from the mobile communication device <b>2020</b> may be encapsulated into one or more data packets along with a network identification for the enterprise server <b>2004</b> and then transmitted over the wireless network <b>2018</b> to the wireless gateway <b>2016</b>. The wireless gateway <b>2016</b> may use the network identification for the enterprise server <b>2004</b> to forward the data packet(s) over the WAN <b>2012</b> to the enterprise server <b>2004</b>, preferably via a direct TCP/IP level connection. Upon receiving the data packet(s) from the wireless gateway <b>2016</b>, the enterprise server <b>2004</b> places the enclosed electronic message into the outbox of the associated electronic message account <b>2006</b>. The mail server <b>2002</b> then detects the electronic message in the outbox and delivers the message, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Security may be maintained outside of the firewall <b>2010</b> by encrypting all electronic messages sent between the enterprise server <b>2004</b> and the mobile communication device <b>2020</b>. For instance, an electronic message to be redirected to the mobile communication device <b>2020</b> may be encrypted and compressed by the enterprise server <b>2004</b>, and the encrypted message may then be encapsulated into one or more data packets for delivery to the mobile communication device <b>2020</b>. To maintain security, the electronic message may remain encrypted over the entire communication path <b>2016</b>, <b>2018</b>, <b>2012</b> from the enterprise server <b>2004</b> to the mobile communication device <b>2020</b>. Similarly, electronic messages sent from the mobile communication device <b>2020</b> may be encrypted and compressed by the mobile communication device <b>2020</b> before being packetized and transmitted to the enterprise server <b>2004</b>, and may remain encrypted over the entire communication path <b>2016</b>, <b>2018</b>, <b>2012</b> from the mobile communication device <b>2020</b> to the enterprise server <b>2004</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In addition, the enterprise server <b>2004</b> may include a communication subsystem, a memory subsystem and a processing subsystem. The communication subsystem may be operable to communicate with the wireless gateway <b>2016</b> over the WAN <b>2012</b>. The memory subsystem may be operable to store data and program information. The processing subsystem may be operable to store and retrieve data in the memory subsystem and execute programs stored in the memory subsystem, and to cause the communication subsystem to transmit and receive information over the WAN <b>2012</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example mobile communication device <b>2100</b>. The block diagram for the example mobile communication device <b>2100</b> can be considered a more detailed block diagram of the mobile device <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The mobile device <b>2100</b> includes a processing subsystem <b>2138</b>, a communications subsystem <b>2111</b>, a short-range communications subsystem <b>2140</b>, a memory subsystem <b>2124</b>, <b>2126</b>, and various other device subsystems and/or software modules <b>2142</b>. The mobile device <b>2100</b> also includes a user interface, which may include a display <b>2122</b>, a serial port <b>2130</b>, keyboard <b>2132</b>, a speaker <b>2134</b>, a microphone <b>2136</b>, one or more auxiliary input/output devices <b>2128</b>, and/or other user interface devices.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The processing subsystem <b>2138</b> controls the overall operation of the mobile device <b>2100</b>. Operating system software executed by the processing subsystem <b>2138</b> may be stored in a persistent store, such as a flash memory <b>2124</b>, but may also be stored in other types of memory devices in the memory subsystem, such as a read only memory (ROM) or similar storage element. In addition, system software, specific device applications, or parts thereof, may be temporarily loaded into a volatile store, such as a random access memory (RAM) <b>2126</b>. Communication signals received by the mobile device <b>2100</b> may also be stored to RAM <b>2126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The processing subsystem <b>2138</b>, in addition to its operating system functions, enables execution of software applications <b>2124</b> on the device <b>2100</b>. A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations, such as data and voice communications, may be installed on the device <b>2100</b> during manufacture. In addition, a personal information manager (PIM) application, including an electronic messaging application, may be installed on the device. The PIM may, for example, be operable to organize and manage data items, such as e-mail, calendar events, voice mails, appointments, and task items. The PIM application may also be operable to send and receive data items via the wireless network <b>2119</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Communication functions, including data and voice communications, are performed through the communication subsystem <b>2111</b>, and possibly through the short-range communications subsystem <b>2140</b>. The communication subsystem <b>2111</b> includes a receiver <b>2112</b>, a transmitter <b>2114</b> and one or more antennas <b>2116</b>, <b>2118</b>. In addition, the communication subsystem <b>2111</b> also includes a processing module, such as a digital signal processor (DSP) <b>2120</b> or other processing device(s), and local oscillators (LOs) <b>2113</b>. The specific design and implementation of the communication subsystem <b>2111</b> is dependent upon the communication network in which the mobile device <b>2100</b> is intended to operate. For example, a mobile device <b>2100</b> may include a communication subsystem <b>2111</b> designed to operate within the Mobitex&#x2122; mobile communication system, the DataTAC&#x2122; mobile communication system, a GSM network, a GPRS network, a UMTS network, and/or an EDGE network.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Network access requirements vary depending upon the type of communication system. For example, in the Mobitex and DataTAC networks, mobile devices are registered on the network using a unique personal identification number or PIN associated with each device. In UMTS and GSM/GPRS networks, however, network access is associated with a subscriber or user of a device. A GPRS device therefore requires a subscriber identity module, commonly referred to as a SIM card, in order to operate on a GSM/GPRS network.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">When required network registration or activation procedures have been completed, the mobile device <b>2100</b> may send and receive communication signals over the communication network <b>2119</b>. Signals received by the antenna <b>2116</b> from the communication network <b>2119</b> are routed to the receiver <b>2112</b>, which provides signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, etc., and may also provide analog to digital conversion. Analog-to-digital conversion of the received signal allows the DSP to perform more complex communication functions, such as demodulation and decoding. In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted to the network <b>2119</b> are processed (e.g., modulated and encoded) by the DSP <b>2120</b> and are then provided to the transmitter <b>2114</b> for digital to analog conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification and transmission to the communication network <b>2119</b> (or networks) via the antenna <b>2118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In addition to processing communication signals, the DSP <b>2120</b> provides for receiver <b>2112</b> and transmitter <b>2114</b> control. For example, gains applied to communication signals in the receiver <b>2112</b> and transmitter <b>2114</b> may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP <b>2120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In a data communication mode, a received signal, such as a text message or web page download, is processed by the communication subsystem <b>2111</b> and input to the processing device <b>2138</b>. The received signal is then further processed by the processing device <b>2138</b> for output to a display <b>2122</b>, or alternatively to some other auxiliary I/O device <b>2128</b>. A device user may also compose data items, such as e-mail messages, using a keyboard <b>2138</b> and/or some other auxiliary I/O device <b>2128</b>, such as a touchpad, a rocker switch, a thumb-wheel, or some other type of input device. The composed data items may then be transmitted over the communication network <b>2119</b> via the communication subsystem <b>2111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In a voice communication mode, overall operation of the device is substantially similar to the data communication mode, except that received signals are output to a speaker <b>2134</b>, and signals for transmission are generated by a microphone <b>2136</b>. Alternative voice or audio I/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may also be implemented on the device <b>2100</b>. In addition, the display <b>2122</b> may also be utilized in voice communication mode, for example, to display the identity of a calling party, the duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The short-range communications subsystem <b>2140</b> enables communication between the mobile device <b>2100</b> and other proximate systems or devices, which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example, the short-range communications subsystem <b>2140</b> may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a Bluetooth&#x2122; communication module to provide for communication with similarly-enabled systems and devices.</p>
