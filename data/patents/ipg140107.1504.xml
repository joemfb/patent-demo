<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method of operating a compressor in an adaptive core engine is disclosed. The method comprises the steps of operating a front block compressor to increase pressure of a fluid to a first pressure ratio in a high-power mode operation; operating a rear block compressor coupled to the front block compressor such that the front block compressor and the rear block compressor operate at the same physical speed; closing a rear block stator vane located axially forward from the rear block compressor such that the flow of the fluid into the rear block compressor is substantially cut off; and keeping a blocker door opened such that substantially all of the fluid pressurized by the front block compressor flows through a bypass passage during the high-power mode operation. The operation may be transitioned from the high-power mode to a low-power mode by opening a rear block stator such that the rear block compressor receives at least a portion of the fluid flowing from the front block compressor and maintains an overall engine pressure ratio.</p>

<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to jet propulsion engines, and more specifically to adaptive core engines and methods of operating them under variable flow conditions while maintaining near constant overall pressure ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Future mixed mission morphing aircraft as well as more conventional mixed mission capable military systems that have a high value of thrust/weight ratio present many challenges to the propulsion system. They need efficient propulsion operation at diverse flight speeds, altitudes, and particularly at low power settings where conventional engine designs may have reduced part-power efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When defining a conventional engine cycle and configuration for a mixed mission application, compromises have to be made in the selection of fan pressure ratio, bypass ratio, and overall pressure ratio to allow an engine to operate effectively at both subsonic and supersonic flight conditions. In particular, the fan pressure ratio and related bypass ratio selection needed to obtain an engine capable of developing the thrusts needed for combat maneuvers and supersonic operation are non-optimum for efficient low power subsonic flight where conventional design engines cannot retain the high overall pressure ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the art, the core concepts studied in multi-core engines are quite complex, having multiple cores with multiple compressors. The transition of operation between these multiple compressors would require the use of complex diverter ducts and valves. Further, the engines may be required to operate at any operating point during transitions from the high-power mode to the low-power mode or vice-versa. Further, operation of the engine near or at minimum SFC (Specific Fuel Consumption) levels is desirable at any intermediate point. It is desirable that the engine should not be operated at an overall pressure ratio higher than that of the high-power mode because of cooling air restrictions on compressor exit temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, it would be desirable to have an adaptive core engine having a simple core design having the variable flow-near constant pressure ratio operating capability while retaining more traditional framing, sealing, and bearing designs. It would be desirable to have a method of operating multiple compressor blocks in an adaptive core engine whereby the adaptive core engine transitions between high power mode and a low power mode and substantially maintains an overall high pressure ratio in both modes without creating reverse flows in bypass ducts.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The above-mentioned need or needs may be met by exemplary embodiments disclosed herein which provide a method of operating a compressor in an adaptive core engine comprising the steps of operating a front block compressor to increase pressure of a fluid to a first pressure ratio in a high-power mode operation; operating a rear block compressor coupled to the front block compressor such that the front block compressor and the rear block compressor operate at the same physical speed; closing a rear block stator vane such that the flow of the fluid into the rear block compressor is substantially cut off; and keeping a blocker door opened such that substantially all of the fluid pressurized by the front block compressor flows thorough a bypass passage during the high-power mode operation. The adaptive core engine operation may be transitioned from the high-power mode to a low-power mode such that the rear block compressor receives at least a portion of the fluid flowing from the front block compressor and maintains an overall engine pressure ratio.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to the drawings wherein identical reference numerals denote the same elements throughout the various views, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of a portion of an adaptive core gas turbine engine constructed according to an aspect of the present invention. The exemplary adaptive core gas turbine engine <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> comprises an adaptive core <b>20</b> having a front block compressor <b>30</b> and a rear block compressor <b>40</b>. The front block compressor <b>30</b> comprises one or more compressor stages, each stage having a row of blades <b>36</b> arranged circumferentially around an engine centerline axis <b>11</b>. The row of blades <b>36</b> is suitably supported by a disk <b>34</b> or spool. A row of vanes <b>38</b> is located axially forward from the row of rotor blades <b>36</b>. A row of vanes <b>134</b>, often referred to as Inlet Guide vanes (IGV) <b>132</b> is located axially forward from the first rotor stage <b>130</b> of the front block compressor <b>30</b>. The IGV <b>132</b> of the front block compressor <b>30</b> is a variable type, as shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Other stator vanes <b>38</b> of the front block compressor <b>30</b> may also be variable stators, as shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Variable stators allow variations in the basic flow of air and its direction through the compressor stages, such as, for example, for stage matching during off-design operation. The inlet guide vanes (IGV) <b>132</b> may have their stagger (setting angle) selectively changed by using an actuator <b>133</b>. Suitable, known actuators can be used for this purpose. Optionally, some of the inter-stage vanes <b>38</b> may have their stagger (setting angle) changed by using an actuator <b>39</b>. Here again, suitable, known actuators can be used for this purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The adaptive core <b>20</b> shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> comprises a rear block compressor <b>40</b>. In the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the rear block compressor <b>40</b> is an axial compressor comprising of one or more stages, each stage having a row of blades <b>46</b> arranged circumferentially around the engine center line axis <b>11</b>. The row of blades is suitably supported by a disk or spool <b>44</b>. A row of vanes <b>48</b> is located axially forward from the row of rotor blades <b>46</b>. A row of vanes, often referred to as rear block Inlet Guide vanes (IGV) <b>142</b> is located axially forward from the first rotor stage <b>140</b> of the rear block compressor <b>40</b>. The rear block IGV <b>142</b> of the rear block compressor <b>40</b> is a variable type, as shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Other stator vanes of the rear block compressor <b>40</b> may also be variable stators (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Variable stators allow stagger angle variations (to effect variations in the basic flow of air and its direction) in the compressor stages. In the rear block compressor <b>40</b>, the inlet guide vanes (IGV) may have their angle of attack with respect to the airflow and their open flow area selectively changed by using a known actuator <b>143</b>. Optionally, the interstage vanes may have their stagger angle selectively changed by using an actuator of a known type (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). During operation, it is possible to move at least a portion of the rear block IGV <b>142</b> using the actuator <b>143</b> such that the flow of air into the rear block compressor <b>40</b> may be substantially blocked, except for some purge air flow (item <b>122</b> for example). The rear block <b>40</b> is &#x201c;stowable&#x201d; in that it is capable of being substantially fully closed using the IGV system <b>142</b> and actuator <b>143</b> to prevent airflow through it, except for a purge flow <b>122</b>. In the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the front block compressor <b>30</b> and the rear block compressor <b>40</b> are driven by a high pressure turbine <b>60</b> that is coupled to a turbine shaft <b>42</b> that in turn is coupled to a compressor shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an axial flow compressor for the rear block compressor <b>40</b>, in alternative embodiments of the present invention, the rear block compressor may be a centrifugal compressor or an axi-centrifugal compressor. The principles and methods of operation of the adaptive core described herein (and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) are applicable for these alternative embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The adaptive core engine described herein has a core compressor <b>24</b> that comprises an axially forward block (front block) compressor <b>30</b> and a rear block compressor <b>40</b>. A high-power mode is characterized by the forward block <b>30</b> of the core compressor <b>24</b> pressurizing the flow with the rear block <b>40</b> operating in a substantially closed manner. A low-power mode is characterized by the front block <b>30</b> operating well below its maximum potential but with the rear block <b>40</b> operating at its maximum potential. In the mode where the rear block <b>40</b> is phased out of operation the engine performance is substantially similar to that of a conventional turbofan engine. The operational mode switch occurs when the rear block <b>40</b> is brought on line to make up for the deficiency in overall pressure ratio that has been experienced by the drop in front block <b>30</b> pressure ratio due to its operation at part power. Once mode change has been accomplished by bringing the rear block <b>40</b> on line, further reductions in engine thrust may be accomplished by further migration along the operating line of the front block <b>30</b> with a suitable scheduled operating line migration on the rear block <b>40</b>. During certain modes of operation, such as, for example, a low-power mode, the pressure behind the rear block compressor <b>40</b> is substantially higher than the pressure in front of the rear block compressor, creating a mechanism for a potential reverse flow. A bypass door <b>150</b> is used to prevent such a reverse flow in the bypass passage <b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As to the amount of flow into the rear block compressor <b>40</b>, the mechanisms for controlling that flow include the rear block compressor corrected speed and the setting (stagger) of the variable stators <b>142</b>, <b>48</b> in the rear block <b>40</b>. At constant physical HP (high pressure) compressor shaft (see item <b>32</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) speed, the corrected speed of the rear block <b>40</b> increases as the flow into the front block <b>30</b> and the front block pressure ratio decrease. This is because the temperature rise across the front block compressor <b>30</b> reduces with reduced front block pressure ratio. The lower temperature into the rear block, with a constant physical speed, raises the rear block <b>40</b> corrected speed. Transition between high-power mode and low-power mode is facilitated by the variable vanes (see items <b>132</b>, <b>38</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) for the front block <b>30</b> and variable vanes (see items <b>142</b>, <b>48</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) for rear block <b>40</b> compressors. In some cases, the front block stators track a schedule in preparation for the transition, and once this preparation has been completed, transition of the core compressor modes may be accomplished without further change to the front block stators.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">An exemplary transitional operation of the engine <b>10</b> may be described as follows, assuming the transition of the fan from a single bypass to a double bypass has already been accomplished. Beginning with the high-power mode of the core compressor <b>24</b> as the starting point, the core compressor <b>24</b> is presumed to be operating at a reduced core exit temperature and reduced speed (because the transition to double bypass of fan has already been accomplished). The core is, however, still in the high-power mode. This means that the rear block compressor <b>40</b> remains &#x201c;phased&#x201d; out of the operating loop by virtue of having its inlet guide vanes <b>142</b> fully closed during the high-power mode. The bypass door <b>150</b> is fully open and stays that way initially, as in the high-power mode. The rear block stators <b>142</b>, <b>48</b> are then opened and flow into the rear block <b>40</b> initiates. The flow into the rear block <b>40</b> satisfies continuity by a combination of &#x201c;stealing&#x201d; flow from the bypass duct and dropping or raising the operating line of the front block compressor <b>30</b> if necessary. The flow function downstream of the core compressor <b>24</b> is held to remain substantially constant during this portion of the transition, and that approximately preserves the overall pressure ratio of the engine. It may be noted that, at this point, the bypass door <b>150</b> is still wide open and adjustments to the front block <b>30</b> operating line can be accomplished to approximately preserve the overall pressure ratio of the engine. At this point during the transition, the operating pressure ratio of the rear block <b>40</b> is approximately 1.0 because it has not been throttled up from its starting point in the high-power mode but in low-power operating condition. At this point during the transition the discharge pressure from the rear block <b>40</b> approximately equals that of the front block <b>30</b> and the stators <b>142</b>, <b>48</b> of the rear block <b>40</b> have been opened to absorb all the flow coming from the front block <b>30</b>. Accordingly, there is no net flow in the bypass duct <b>154</b> and the bypass door <b>150</b> can safely be closed without impacting the engine operation. The downstream flow function is then reduced to raise the operating line of the rear block <b>40</b> to regain the overall pressure ratio of the engine <b>10</b>. The downstream flow function variation may be accomplished by operation of the variable high-pressure turbine nozzle <b>64</b>, variable low-pressure turbine nozzle <b>65</b>, and/or the exhaust nozzle <b>80</b>. The engine is now in the low-power mode of operation at its full design overall pressure ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">During operation of the adaptive core engines, such as for example shown in the figures herein, at the maximum flow operation condition, the front block compressor <b>30</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is operated at design speed and pressure ratio. This is schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (see item <b>200</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows exemplary compressor maps <b>200</b>, <b>210</b> of front block compressor <b>30</b> and rear block compressor <b>40</b> respectively during operation of the exemplary adaptive core gas turbine engine, such as, for example, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, for this example the front block pressure ratio (&#x201c;PR&#x201d;) is set at a value of P<b>2</b> (8.5 for example), and the reference compressor flow rate (&#x201c;W<b>2</b>&#x201d;) is at about 100% (see item <b>204</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The rear block IGV <b>142</b> is substantially closed (see item <b>212</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) with only a controlled purge flow <b>122</b> passing through this section of the rear block compressor <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In this mode of operation (i.e., maximum flow condition) the majority of the front block compressor flow <b>110</b> goes around the rear block compressor <b>40</b> through a bypass passage <b>154</b> before entering the combustor <b>58</b>. In some applications, a controlled area (variable area) diffuser may be optionally used, such as, for example, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The optional variable area diffuser shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> comprises a baffle <b>120</b> that is operable around a hinge <b>121</b> to control the diffusion of the flow from the compressors <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>. The adaptive core engine comprises a high-pressure turbine (HPT) <b>60</b>. The HPT comprises HPT vanes <b>62</b> that are located axially forward from the HP turbine blades <b>61</b>. The HPT vanes <b>62</b> (alternatively referred to herein as nozzles) may be a variable area type (VATN), such as, for example, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Using the variable HPT vane <b>62</b>, the flow geometry and flow function may be varied using known actuators <b>63</b> during operation of the engine <b>10</b>. Alternatively, other known means of changing flow functions may also be used. In the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and the operation described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the HP turbine vanes are in their full open position during the maximum compressor flow operation. For reduced thrust, the front block flow is reduced by partially closing IGV <b>132</b> and other front block compressor variable stators <b>38</b> with a minimum amount of rotor speed (rpm) reduction. This combination keeps the rear block compressor <b>40</b> speed high for maximizing its pressure ratio potential during reduced flow operation of the front block compressor <b>30</b>. Also, to help produce a high pressure ratio in the rear block compressor <b>40</b>, the rear block compressor <b>40</b> design corrected speed is based on the super-charging temperature of the front block compressor discharge when the front block compressor is operated at a reduced pressure ratio level. In the exemplary method of operating shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the front block compressor <b>30</b> is at pressure ratio of &#x201c;P<b>1</b>&#x201d; (4.7 for example) at an operating corrected flow of &#x201c;W<b>1</b>&#x201d;% (60% for example). With a rear block compressor <b>40</b> design pressure ratio of &#x201c;P<b>4</b>&#x201d; (1.8 for example), and it's IGV <b>142</b> substantially fully open (see item <b>214</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), the front block compressor flow now goes through the rear block compressor (see item <b>124</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) producing an overall core pressure ratio of close to &#x201c;P<b>2</b>&#x201d; (4.7&#xd7;1.7=8.5 in the example) at a corrected flow of &#x201c;W<b>1</b>&#x201d; (60% in the example). The variable HPT vanes <b>62</b> may partially close for this operating mode of having substantially constant pressure ratio while having variable flow.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an example of the operating characteristics of the exemplary adaptive core <b>20</b> compressor in the exemplary adaptive core gas turbine engine <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the operating map with the overall compressor flow along the X-axis and the overall pressure ratio along the Y-axis. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the unique type of compressor map/operation that results from a two-block core compression system shown in the exemplary embodiments shown herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the compressor characteristics in two modes, one mode with the Rear Block compressor <b>40</b> &#x201c;open&#x201d; (having the Front Block compressor <b>30</b> partially closed and the other mode with the Rear Block compressor <b>40</b> &#x201c;closed&#x201d; (with the Front Block <b>30</b> nominal). The operating lines <b>302</b>, <b>312</b> and stall lines <b>300</b>, <b>310</b> shift as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, having transition lines <b>304</b> shown for example. The constant speed lines (see item <b>311</b> for example) are substantially the same speed, but having differing stator schedules.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As described previously herein, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> show the general operating characteristics of an adaptive core engine according to the present invention. A high-power mode is characterized by the front block (FB) <b>30</b> of the core compressor <b>24</b> pressurizing the flow with the rear block (RB) <b>40</b> operating in a substantially closed manner. A low-power mode is characterized by the front block <b>30</b> operating well below its potential but with the rear block <b>40</b> operating at its maximum potential. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;front-block&#x201d; and &#x201c;forward block&#x201d; are used interchangeably to refer to the front block compressor (shown as item <b>30</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) located axially forward from the rear block compressor <b>40</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a notional schematic cross-section layout of a portion of the core compressor <b>24</b> region for an adaptive core engine, such as, for example, shown as item <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows in superposition fashion the high and low power modes of operation. Transitions between the high-power and low-power modes of operation are made by operating a blocker door <b>150</b> to bypass some of the flow from the front block compressor <b>30</b> around the rear block compressor <b>40</b> through a bypass passage <b>154</b>. It may be noted that variable stators are used to control the flow in the rear block compressor <b>40</b> and the bypass door (blocker door) <b>150</b> prevents backflow in the bypass passage <b>154</b> in certain operating conditions. In one exemplary design, the blocker door <b>150</b> has a hinge <b>151</b> and the blocker door <b>150</b> is capable of swinging about the hinge <b>151</b> to open or close the door <b>150</b>. The blocker door <b>150</b> can be operated using known actuators. The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the same schematic cross-section layout of the core compressor <b>24</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, but only the high-power mode of operation is depicted, wherein the blocker door <b>150</b> is open and flow enters the bypass passage <b>154</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the low-power mode of operation where the blocker door <b>150</b> is closed to prevent reverse flow in the bypass passage <b>154</b> and the flow from the front block compressor <b>30</b> enters the rear block compressor <b>40</b>. In both figures, only the rear stage of the front block (FB) <b>30</b> of the compressor is shown. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;stator&#x201d; and &#x201c;vane&#x201d; are used interchangeably to refer to the stator components such as compressor vanes and inlet guide vanes, such as, for example shown as items <b>38</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>134</b>, <b>142</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and similar items in other figures herein.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In operational mode shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the front block stators <b>132</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) are nominal while the rear block stators <b>142</b>, <b>48</b> are substantially closed. Only a small amount of airflow (see item <b>122</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), enough to purge the flow cavities, is allowed through the rear block <b>40</b>. Furthermore, the bypass doors <b>150</b> are fully opened. In high power mode the front block <b>30</b> is operating at its maximum potential in both airflow and pressure ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the front block vanes <b>38</b>, <b>134</b> are in a more closed position to reduce the front block inlet corrected flow while maintaining the corrected speed at or near its (front block compressor) design level. The high spool speed is maintained to facilitate design of the rear block <b>40</b> that occurs when the core engine is in the low-power mode. In the low-power mode (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) the rear block stators <b>142</b> are set to their substantially opened position and the bypass doors <b>150</b> are substantially fully closed. The rear block <b>40</b> swallows substantially all the low power mode front compression block flow. Because the front block stators <b>38</b>, <b>134</b> are more closed in this mode of operation, the physical flow swallowed by the rear block <b>40</b> is reduced from the flow level that bypasses the rear block <b>40</b> in the high power mode. However, because the pressure ratio of the front block <b>30</b> is reduced by the more closure of the front bloc, the discharge corrected flow from the front block <b>30</b> remains approximately constant as determined by a downstream throttle area. The rear block <b>40</b> has a design pressure ratio sufficient to return the core compressor <b>24</b> exit pressure to the selected level of high power mode cycle-overall-pressure ratio in the low power mode. The front or forward side <b>152</b> of the bypass doors <b>150</b> is at a pressure dictated by the pressure level and the Mach number from the exit of the front block <b>30</b>. Also, the pressure level on the backside <b>153</b> of the bypass doors <b>150</b> is set by the static pressure at the mixing plane <b>155</b> since there is no flow to sustain a pressure difference in the bypass duct <b>154</b>. In some operating conditions, significant pressure difference may exist across the doors <b>150</b> in a direction that forces the doors closed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> for example).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">An exemplary method of operating an adaptive core engine (such as shown in the figures herein and described herein) is described below, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an exemplary operating characteristics of the rear block compressor <b>40</b>, having rear block corrected flow (RB Wc %) along the horizontal axis and the rear block pressure ratio (RB PR) along the vertical axis. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows an exemplary operating characteristics of the front block compressor <b>30</b>, having front block corrected flow (FB Wc %) along the horizontal axis and the front block pressure ratio (FB PR) along the vertical axis. Assuming initial operation in the high-power mode, (see operating points shown by item <b>172</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and item <b>181</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) the front block <b>30</b> operates at the high-power mode (item <b>181</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) and the front block stators <b>132</b>, <b>134</b>, <b>38</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) are substantially open. Operating point shown as item <b>181</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> represents maximum power operation in the high thrust mode. This is when the engine is in the single bypass mode. The transition from the single bypass mode to the double bypass mode on the front fan is accompanied by moving the front block compressor <b>30</b> from operating point <b>181</b> to operating point <b>182</b>. The stators (vanes <b>38</b>, <b>132</b>) on the front block <b>30</b> have been closed somewhat but the blocker door (bypass door) <b>150</b> remains in the open position. During this portion of the throttle hook the rear block <b>40</b> operates at point <b>172</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) and, as noted, the bypass door <b>150</b> remains open. The stators <b>142</b>, <b>48</b> on the rear block compressor <b>40</b> remain fully closed. Now, as the transition initiates, the rear block stators <b>142</b>, <b>48</b> open until all of the flow coming from the front block <b>30</b> is passing through the rear block <b>40</b> and therefore the bypass flow in bypass passage <b>154</b> has been reduced to almost zero. Now the bypass door <b>150</b> can be closed. The rear block <b>40</b> is now operating at a point <b>173</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) that is at nearly the same pressure ratio as point <b>172</b> but has the flow nearly the same as point <b>171</b>. Then, the downstream flow function is reduced (such as, for example, by closing a downstream turbine nozzle <b>63</b>, <b>65</b> area or exhaust nozzle <b>80</b> area) which causes the operating line on the rear block to raise to point <b>171</b>. The bypass passage flow decreases as the rear block stators <b>142</b>, <b>48</b> are opened from point <b>172</b> to <b>173</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). Point <b>172</b> and point <b>173</b> collapse into one operating point <b>272</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) on the overall compressor map illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As described before, in the high-power mode, the rear block stators <b>142</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) are substantially closed, except to allow purge flow <b>122</b>. To transition the operation of the engine from this high-power mode to a low-power mode, the rear block stators <b>142</b> are slowly opened to increase flow in the rear block <b>40</b>. When the amount of flow bypassing the rear block <b>40</b> reaches substantially zero, the bypass doors <b>150</b> are closed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). During this process, the downstream variable area turbine nozzle <b>64</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is kept substantially fixed to maintain the rear block pressure ratio near unity.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Once the bypass doors <b>150</b> are closed, rear block recirculation is prevented and the downstream nozzle <b>62</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) area can be reduced to increase rear block <b>40</b> pressure ratio. A combination of HP (high pressure turbine system) flow function, LP (low pressure turbine system) flow function and exhaust nozzle <b>80</b> area &#x201c;A<b>8</b>&#x201d; may be used to reduce the flow function and increase the rear block <b>40</b> pressure ratio. Overall core compressor <b>24</b> pressure ratio can be maintained at the high-power design level by partially closing the front block <b>30</b> stators to reduce front block pressure ratio in proportion to the increase in rear block <b>40</b> pressure ratio. It should be noted that partial closure of the front block stator <b>134</b>, <b>38</b> has been achieved before transition of the rear block <b>40</b> is initiated and no further adjustment may be needed to front block stators <b>134</b>, <b>38</b> until the aircraft requires a further reduction in thrust. When the front block stators <b>134</b>, <b>38</b> and rear block stators <b>142</b>, <b>48</b> reach their final low-power mode position, the rear block exit flow function is reduced to produce the elevated pressure ratio required of the rear block, and then transition from the high-power mode to the lower-power mode is complete. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> which show the operating maps for the Rear Block <b>40</b> and the Front Block <b>30</b> respectively. It should be noted that in the operations of the variable vanes/stators for the front and rear block compressors described herein, more than just the IGV (Inlet Guide Vane) operation may be involved. In addition to the IGV, one or more vane row in each compressor block may be variable wherein all of them move in unison. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 &#x26; 8</figref> the speed lines are constant and the setting (stagger) on the vanes is varied.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A safety valve <b>160</b> is shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>. The safety valve <b>160</b> would be employed, if for some reason, difficulty were encountered in proper control of the compressor operating line and hence the combustor <b>58</b> inlet pressure. To control the inlet pressure of the combustor <b>58</b>, the safety valve <b>160</b> is opened to enable some of the flow to be extracted from the bypass passage <b>154</b>. In the event that the valve <b>160</b> is opened, the flow through it would be discharged into a fan bypass duct and the operating line on the compressor(s) would drop. Opening valve <b>160</b> in effect increases the compressor downstream flow function.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the maximum thrust mode, the adaptive core engine <b>10</b> typically operates in the single and/or double bypass fan mode. As reduced thrust is demanded, the combustor exit gas temperature (&#x201c;T<b>4</b>&#x201d;) drops as engine exhaust nozzle <b>80</b> area (&#x201c;A<b>8</b>&#x201d;) is opened. The core compressor corrected flow is dropping while this is happening and the front block stators <b>38</b>, <b>132</b> are being adjusted according to their schedule. The core compressor <b>24</b> operation is still in the high-power mode but at a reduced thrust level. Further reduction in thrust causes a fan transition into the double bypass mode of operation. Further reduction in temperature &#x201c;T<b>4</b>&#x201d; accompanies the transition. During this time, the core compressor corrected flow is dropping with stator change while retaining high core compressor speed. The engine <b>10</b> is still in the high-thrust core mode but temperature T<b>4</b> has been reduced and the stators <b>38</b>, <b>132</b> on the core compressor front block <b>30</b> have been partially closed as prescribed by the stator schedule. At this point it is possible to start the transition of the core compressor <b>24</b> from its high power mode (in which the rear block compressor <b>40</b> is bypassed) to the low-power mode wherein the rear block <b>40</b> is operated at its full potential and the inner bypass flow in bypass passage <b>154</b> is reduced to zero.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In summary, an exemplary method of operating a gas turbine engine according to the present invention is described as follows: The method comprises the steps of (1) operating a front block compressor <b>30</b> to increase pressure of a fluid to a first pressure ratio in a high-power mode operation (see item <b>204</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>); (2) operating a rear block compressor <b>40</b> coupled to the front block compressor <b>30</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) such that the front block compressor <b>30</b> and the rear block compressor <b>40</b> operate at the same physical speed; (3) closing a rear block stator vane <b>142</b>, <b>48</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>4</b>-<b>6</b>) such that the flow of the fluid into the rear block compressor <b>40</b> is substantially cut off except for a purge flow (see item <b>122</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) during the high-power mode operation; and (4) keeping the blocker door <b>150</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>) opened such that substantially all of the fluid pressurized by the front block compressor <b>30</b> flows thorough a bypass passage <b>154</b> during the high-power mode operation. During this operation, the stator vanes <b>132</b>, <b>134</b>, <b>38</b> may be kept scheduled to hold corrected speed nearly constant. When the gas turbine engine is operating in a high-power mode, certain steps may be taken to transition the engine operation from the high-power mode to a low-power mode. The step of partially closing a front block stator vane <b>132</b>, <b>134</b>, <b>38</b> may be taken in preparation for the transition. Then the step of opening the rear block vanes <b>142</b>, <b>48</b> is taken such that the rear block compressor <b>40</b> receives at least a portion of the fluid flowing from the front block compressor <b>30</b>. During this step, the rear block stator vane <b>142</b>, <b>48</b> will be opened. The above steps are carefully performed and the blocker door is operated to a closed position such that there is no reversal of flow in the bypass passage <b>154</b> or there is no recirculation of flow in the rear block compressor <b>40</b>. Further, the flow functions downstream from the core compressor is adjusted using, for example, variable turbine nozzle vanes <b>62</b>, <b>65</b> and/or exhaust nozzle <b>80</b>, such that the rear block compressor <b>40</b> operating line is raised and increases the pressure to a second pressure in the low-power mode.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the exemplary method of transitioning the engine operation from high-power mode to a low-power mode, the blocker door <b>150</b> and the rear block stator vanes <b>142</b>, <b>48</b> are operated such that an overall pressure ratio in the low-power mode after transition is substantially the same as the overall pressure ratio in the high-power mode before the transition. It may be noted that in preparation for transition to low-power mode of the rear block <b>40</b>, the core has pulled away from its maximum potential pressure ratio operation (P<b>2</b>, for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). During this initial phase, the core flow is reduced (such as for example, partially closing the front block stator vanes <b>132</b>, <b>38</b>), as well as its pressure ratio is reduced (see point identified by item number <b>182</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). The operating point where transition to the &#x201c;low-power&#x201d; mode for the rear block <b>40</b> is initiated is point <b>182</b> on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. During the transition operation from high-power mode to a low-power mode for the rear block compressor, the variable area turbine nozzle <b>64</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is maintained in a substantially fixed position. Once the transition to low-power mode is complete and the blocker door <b>150</b> is substantially closed, the rear block pressure ratio may be increased by taking the step of reducing the flow function down stream from the compressor, such as, for example, reducing an area of an variable turbine nozzle <b>64</b>, <b>65</b> located downstream from the rear block compressor. When the transition of the core compressor <b>24</b> from the high-power mode to the low-power mode is complete, the front block <b>30</b> will be operating at a point that is less than it maximum design capability whereas the rear block <b>40</b> will be operating at its maximum design capability. The adaptable core feature and the method of operation as described herein overcome the loss in overall pressure ratio accompanying part power operation in conventional engines. As explained before, if needed in order to control the pressure of fluid entering the combustor, the method may involve the additional step of opening a safety valve <b>160</b> to release a portion of the flow in the bypass passage <b>154</b> into another location.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The description of the exemplary transition process as employed herein initiates with the engine in the high-power mode and terminates with the engine in the low-power mode. The reverse transition process wherein the engine initiates transition from the low-power mode and terminates with the engine in the high-pressure mode can also be accomplished similarly. The steps in this reverse transition process simply mirror the steps described herein.</p>

The patentable scope of the invention is defined by the claims, and may include other examples that occur to those skilled in the art.
