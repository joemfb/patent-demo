<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2011-0034967, filed on Apr. 15, 2011, and all the benefits accruing therefrom under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119, the contents of which in its entirety are herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to an apparatus and method for recovery of sulfur hexafluoride.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>) is a typical electrical dielectric substance used for electric power devices. SF<sub>6 </sub>is also used for washing process in the manufacture of semiconductor wafers, LCD panels, etc. SF<sub>6</sub>, however, is known to have an impact on global warming about 23,900 times that of carbon dioxide. Further, in the Convention on Climate Change held in Kyoto in 1997, SF<sub>6 </sub>was listed as one of six substances with the largest global warming potentials.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There are several methods for treating SF<sub>6</sub>. The first method is to decompose SF<sub>6</sub>. Since SF<sub>6 </sub>is very stable, high energy such as plasma is required to decompose SF<sub>6</sub>. Further, during the decomposition, highly toxic and corrosive byproducts such as S<sub>2</sub>F<sub>10</sub>, SF<sub>4 </sub>and HF are produced. Considering the problems associated with the decomposition as well as the consistently increasing price of SF<sub>6</sub>, it would be desirable to recover and recycle SF<sub>6 </sub>in terms of cost saving.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to recover SF<sub>6 </sub>from SF<sub>6</sub>-containing mixture gas, general gas separation techniques such as chilling, pressure swing adsorption (PSA), membrane separation, etc. may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The chilling method is suitable for large-scale, high-concentration applications, but the investment cost is high while the energy consumption efficiency is low. In PSA method, an adsorbent such as zeolite is used to separate SF<sub>6 </sub>by adsorbing small-sized molecules like nitrogen, and pressurization and decompression are repeated so that the adsorbed substance, e.g. nitrogen, is desorbed during decompression and then fresh nitrogen is adsorbed during the next pressurization, thereby separating SF<sub>6 </sub>from a nitrogen/SF<sub>6 </sub>mixture gas. In PSA method, however, SF<sub>6 </sub>leaks out during desorption. Although the maximum recovery efficiency may be 90% or above, if the ratio of SF<sub>6 </sub>in the mixture gas is low, liquefaction is necessary after separation, since only about 60 vol % of SF<sub>6 </sub>is recovered from the mixture gas.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In exemplary embodiments of this disclosure, sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>) may be separated with high-concentration and improved recovery ratio through a multi-stage separation and recovery processes using a plurality of separation membrane modules.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Also, in exemplary embodiments of this disclosure, SF<sub>6 </sub>gas may be concentrated to maximize the SF<sub>6 </sub>recovery ratio before the separation and recovery processes through the separation membrane modules. As well, sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and moisture included in the SF<sub>6 </sub>waste gas may be removed effectively so as to extend the service life of the separation membrane modules.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an exemplary embodiment, an apparatus for separating and recovering SF<sub>6 </sub>may comprise: a gas pretreatment device removing sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and moisture included in an SF<sub>6</sub>-containing waste gas; a first SF<sub>6 </sub>concentrating device adsorbing SF<sub>6 </sub>included in the waste gas with an adsorbent and desorbing SF<sub>6 </sub>gas from the adsorbent; a first separation membrane module separating the waste gas exhausted from the first SF<sub>6 </sub>concentrating device into a first recovered gas and a first remnant gas; a second separation membrane module separating the first recovered gas into a second recovered gas and a second remnant gas; a remnant gas storage tank storing the first remnant gas separated by the first separation membrane module; and a third separation membrane module receiving the first remnant gas from the remnant gas storage tank and separating the first remnant gas into SF<sub>6 </sub>and the remaining gas. Herein, the first recovered gas and the second recovered gas respectively contain higher concentration of SF<sub>6 </sub>than the first remnant gas and the second remnant gas.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The first SF<sub>6 </sub>concentrating device may include a concentration chamber, an adsorbent provided in the concentration chamber and selectively adsorbing SF<sub>6 </sub>included in the waste gas, and a heating devices selectively heating the concentration chamber so as to desorb the SF<sub>6 </sub>adsorbed to the adsorbent.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The adsorbent may be an activated carbon, and the temperature of the concentration chamber may be controlled to about 50&#xb0; C. to about 200&#xb0; C. so as to desorb the SF<sub>6 </sub>from the adsorbent.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The gas pretreatment device may include a first chamber and a second chamber placed adjacently and sequentially, a moisture removing material may be filled in the first chamber, an SO<sub>2 </sub>removing material may be filled in the second chamber, and a heating device may be provided around the second chamber to control the temperature of the SO<sub>2 </sub>removing material. The moisture removing material may be one of microparticulate zeolite, silica and molecular sieve, and the SO<sub>2 </sub>removing material may be one of metal oxide (MO) and zeolite or a mixture thereof, wherein M may be a group II metal.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The first separation membrane module may be made of a material with a relatively higher permeability as compared to the second separation membrane module, and the second separation membrane module may be made of a material with a relatively higher SF<sub>6 </sub>selectivity as compared to the first separation membrane module. The first separation membrane module may be made of polycarbonate.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Each of the first separation membrane module, the second separation membrane module, and the third separation membrane module may be provided in a thermostat. The thermostat may provide space for mounting the first, second and third separation membrane modules and maintain the temperature of the first, second and third separation membrane modules constant. The temperature of the thermostat may be controlled to about 20&#xb0; C. to about 150&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A waste gas stabilizing tank may be further provided before the gas pretreatment device or between the gas pretreatment device and the first separation membrane module. The waste gas stabilizing tank may maintain the concentration of SF<sub>6 </sub>in the waste gas constant. The concentration of SF<sub>6 </sub>in the waste gas may be controlled through the temperature control of the waste gas stabilizing tank.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an exemplary embodiment, a method for separating and recovering SF<sub>6 </sub>may comprise: removing sulfur dioxide and moisture included in a SF<sub>6</sub>-containing waste gas; adsorbing SF<sub>6 </sub>gas included in the waste gas with an adsorbent; desorbing SF<sub>6 </sub>gas from the adsorbent by heating, thereby obtaining concentrated SF<sub>6 </sub>gas; separating the concentrated SF<sub>6 </sub>gas into a SF<sub>6</sub>-containing first recovered gas and a first remnant gas; storing the first remnant gas; separating the first recovered gas into a SF<sub>6</sub>-containing second recovered gas and a second remnant gas, and separating the stored first remnant gas into SF<sub>6 </sub>and a remaining gas.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an exemplary embodiment, the adsorbent is an activated carbon, and the heating is performed at a temperature of about 50&#xb0; C. to about 200&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an exemplary embodiment, the moisture is first removed from the waste gas by using a moisture removing material and then sulfur dioxide is removed from the waste gas by using a sulfur dioxide removing material, and heat is provided to the sulfur dioxide removing material.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an exemplary embodiment, the concentrated SF<sub>6 </sub>gas or the SF<sub>6</sub>-containing waste gas is stored in a tank, and the concentration of the concentrated SF<sub>6 </sub>gas or the SF<sub>6</sub>-containing waste gas is adjusted by changing the temperature of the tank before being subject to separation.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>)-containing waste gases are emitted from various emission sources. When the ratio of SF<sub>6 </sub>in the waste gas is low, a high SF<sub>6 </sub>recovery efficiency is not achieved with a commonly used apparatus for separating and recovering SF<sub>6</sub>. The exemplary embodiments of this disclosure are applicable even when the waste gas contains SF<sub>6 </sub>at low ratio. Improved SF<sub>6 </sub>recovery efficiency may be provided by concentrating the SF<sub>6 </sub>existing in the waste gas before separating and recovering the SF<sub>6</sub>. In addition, in an exemplary embodiment, sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and moisture included in the waste gas may be removed before the concentrating of the SF<sub>6 </sub>existing in the waste gas.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an apparatus for separating and recovering SF<sub>6 </sub>according to an exemplary embodiment may comprise a gas pretreatment device <b>120</b>, a first SF<sub>6 </sub>concentrating device <b>210</b>, a first separation membrane module <b>130</b>, a second separation membrane module <b>140</b>, a second SF<sub>6 </sub>concentrating device <b>210</b>, a remnant gas storage tank <b>150</b> and a third separation membrane module <b>160</b>. The gas pretreatment device <b>120</b> removes SO<sub>2 </sub>and moisture included in the waste gas, the first SF<sub>6 </sub>concentrating device <b>210</b> and the second SF<sub>6 </sub>concentrating device <b>210</b> concentrates the SF<sub>6 </sub>gas in the waste gas, and the first, second, and third separation membrane modules <b>130</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>160</b> recover the SF<sub>6 </sub>included in the waste gas.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Explaining in detail, the gas pretreatment device <b>120</b> removes SO<sub>2 </sub>and moisture included in the waste gas. The gas pretreatment device may comprise a first chamber <b>121</b>, a second chamber <b>123</b> and a heating devices <b>125</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As used herein, the waste gas refers to a mixture gas of SF<sub>6 </sub>with the other remaining gases. The other remaining gases may include O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The first chamber <b>121</b> and the second chamber <b>123</b> are placed adjacently and sequentially. A moisture removing material <b>122</b> is provided in the first chamber <b>121</b>, and an SO<sub>2 </sub>removing material <b>124</b> is provided in the second chamber <b>123</b>. The moisture removing material <b>122</b> may be zeolite, silica, molecular sieve, etc. having good hygroscopicity, which may be microparticulate. And, the SO<sub>2 </sub>removing material <b>124</b> may be one of metal oxide (MO) and zeolite or a mixture thereof, having good SO<sub>2 </sub>adsorption efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Herein, M may be a group II metal such as copper (Cu) (In this case, the metal oxide is CuO). For sequential removal, the moisture removing material <b>122</b> and the SO<sub>2 </sub>removing material <b>124</b> may be respectively filled in the first chamber <b>121</b> and the second chamber <b>123</b>, for example, in the form of microparticles. Meanwhile, the heating devices <b>125</b> may be provided around the second chamber <b>123</b> in order to improve SO<sub>2 </sub>adsorption efficiency by the SO<sub>2 </sub>removing material <b>124</b> in the second chamber <b>123</b>. After passing the second chamber <b>123</b>, the waste gas may be supplied to the first SF<sub>6 </sub>concentrating device <b>210</b>. Specifically, the temperature of the heating devices <b>125</b> may be controlled to about 100&#xb0; C. to about 250&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The first SF<sub>6 </sub>concentrating device <b>210</b> is provided between the gas pretreatment device <b>120</b> and the first separation membrane module <b>130</b>, selectively adsorbs and desorbs the SF<sub>6 </sub>gas included in the waste gas and, thus, selectively concentrates SF<sub>6 </sub>only.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In more detail, the first SF<sub>6 </sub>concentrating device <b>210</b> has a concentration chamber <b>211</b>. An adsorbent <b>212</b> is provided in the concentration chamber <b>211</b>. The adsorbent <b>212</b> selectively adsorbs the SF<sub>6 </sub>gas included in the waste gas. The adsorbent <b>212</b> may be an activated carbon. Specifically, A1216 activated carbon, A836 activated carbon or A1261 activated carbon may be used. The concentration chamber <b>211</b> may be heated selectively by an external heating devices <b>213</b>. When the concentration chamber <b>211</b> is heated, the SF<sub>6 </sub>gas adsorbed to the adsorbent <b>212</b> may be desorbed and highly concentrated SF<sub>6 </sub>gas with high purity may be supplied to the first separation membrane module <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The operation of the first SF<sub>6 </sub>concentrating device <b>210</b> may be as follows. When the waste gas is supplied from the gas pretreatment device <b>120</b> to the first SF<sub>6 </sub>concentrating device <b>210</b>, the SF<sub>6 </sub>in the waste gas may be adsorbed to the adsorbent <b>212</b> in the concentration chamber <b>211</b> and the remnant gas (e.g., N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, etc.) excluding the SF<sub>6 </sub>gas may be exhausted through an exhaust port (not shown) provided on one side of the concentration chamber <b>211</b>. When the concentration chamber <b>211</b> is heated after the SF<sub>6 </sub>is adsorbed to the adsorbent <b>212</b>, the SF<sub>6 </sub>adsorbed to the adsorbent <b>212</b> may be desorbed, and the desorbed SF<sub>6 </sub>may be supplied to the first separation membrane module <b>130</b>. The gas supplied to the first separation membrane module <b>130</b> may be a highly concentrated SF<sub>6 </sub>gas with high purity. Specifically, when heating the concentration chamber <b>211</b> to desorb the SF<sub>6</sub>, the heating temperature may be controlled to about 50&#xb0; C. to about 200&#xb0; C. When the heating temperature is below about 50&#xb0; C., vapor may be condensed again in the concentration chamber <b>211</b>, resulting in decreased amount of the desorbed SF<sub>6</sub>. When the heating temperature is above about 200&#xb0; C., the adsorbent <b>212</b> may be oxidized.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As such, the SF<sub>6 </sub>separation and recovery efficiency may be maximized even when the waste gas contains a small amount of SF<sub>6</sub>, since the SF<sub>6 </sub>is concentrated by the first SF<sub>6 </sub>concentrating device <b>210</b> and then supplied to the first separation membrane module <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The first separation membrane module <b>130</b> and the second separation membrane module <b>140</b> may be sequentially provided after the first SF<sub>6 </sub>concentrating device <b>210</b> to recover the SF<sub>6 </sub>included in the waste gas. A first preliminary recovery may be performed by the first separation membrane module <b>130</b> and a second recovery, which may be the final recovery, may be performed by the second separation membrane module <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Specifically, the first separation membrane module <b>130</b> separates the waste gas that has passed the first SF<sub>6 </sub>concentrating device <b>210</b> into a first recovered gas and a first remnant gas. The first recovered gas refers to a gas containing SF<sub>6 </sub>with higher concentration than the first remnant gas. The first remnant gas may contain a trace amount of SF<sub>6</sub>. The second separation membrane module <b>140</b> separates the first recovered gas into a second recovered gas and a second remnant gas. The second recovered gas may be substantially SF<sub>6 </sub>gas with high-concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The first recovered gas containing SF<sub>6 </sub>gas with low-concentration may be recovered primarily by the first separation membrane module <b>130</b>, and the second recovered gas containing SF<sub>6 </sub>with high-concentration may be recovered secondarily by the second separation membrane module <b>140</b>. Accordingly, in order to improve SF<sub>6 </sub>recovery efficiency, the first separation membrane module <b>130</b> may be made of a material with a relatively higher permeability as compared to the second separation membrane module <b>140</b>, and the second separation membrane module <b>140</b> may be made of a material with a relatively higher SF<sub>6 </sub>selectivity as compared to the first separation membrane module <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As used herein, &#x201c;low-concentration&#x201d; and &#x201c;high-concentration&#x201d; refer to the relative SF<sub>6 </sub>concentration of the first recovered gas and the second recovered gas, the permeability refers to a permeability in the length direction of the separation membrane module, and &#x201c;higher&#x201d; SF<sub>6 </sub>selectivity means that the recovered gas separated by each separation membrane module has higher SF<sub>6 </sub>concentration. The first separation membrane module <b>130</b> may be made of polycarbonate (PC) having relatively superior permeability, and the second separation membrane module <b>140</b> may be made of polysulfone, polyimide, etc. having relatively superior SF<sub>6 </sub>selectivity.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Each of the first separation membrane module <b>130</b>, the second separation membrane module <b>140</b>, and the third separation membrane module <b>160</b> may be provided in a thermostat <b>170</b>. The thermostat <b>170</b> provides space for mounting the first, second and third separation membrane modules <b>130</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>160</b> and maintains the temperature of the first, second and third separation membrane modules <b>130</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>160</b> constant.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The gas constant (R) is variable depending on temperature. Since the change in the gas constant leads to change in the gas permeability of the first, second and third separation membrane modules <b>130</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>160</b>, the temperature of the separation membrane modules should be maintained constant. Specifically, considering the efficiency of the separation membrane modules, the temperature of the thermostat <b>170</b> may be controlled to about 20&#xb0; C. to &#xb0; about 150&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The remnant gas storage tank <b>150</b> stores the first remnant gas separated by the first separation membrane module <b>130</b> and supplies the first remnant gas to the third separation membrane module <b>160</b>. The first remnant gas may be a remnant gas such as O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, etc. containing a trace amount of SF<sub>6</sub>. Thus, separating the first remnant gas again into SF<sub>6 </sub>and the remnant gas immediately may not allow good SF<sub>6 </sub>separation efficiency. Accordingly, the first remnant gas separated by the first separation membrane module <b>130</b> may be stored until a certain amount of the first remnant gas is collected before the first remnant gas is separated into SF<sub>6 </sub>and the remaining gas. The remnant gas storage tank <b>150</b> may serve the purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The third separation membrane module <b>160</b> separates the first remnant gas stored in the remnant gas storage tank <b>150</b> into SF<sub>6 </sub>and the remaining gas. The third separation membrane module <b>160</b> may be a final-stage separation membrane module like the second separation membrane module <b>140</b>. Accordingly, the third separation membrane module may be made of a material with superior SF<sub>6 </sub>selectivity. For example, it may be made of the same material as the second separation membrane module <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">An apparatus for separating and recovering SF<sub>6 </sub>according to an exemplary embodiment may further comprise a waste gas stabilizing tank <b>110</b>. Since the concentration of SF<sub>6 </sub>included in the waste gas is not constant, it may be necessary to maintain the SF<sub>6 </sub>concentration of the waste gas constant. For this purpose, the waste gas stabilizing tank <b>110</b> may be provided to stabilize the waste gas. The waste gas stabilizing tank <b>110</b> may be provided before the gas pretreatment device <b>120</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or between the gas pretreatment device <b>120</b> and the first separation membrane module <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The reason why the SF<sub>6 </sub>concentration in the waste gas needs to be maintained constant is for accurately determining the treatment efficiency of the first, second, third separation membrane module <b>160</b> and the SF<sub>6 </sub>recovery ratio. The SF<sub>6 </sub>concentration may be maintained constant by keeping the waste gas in the waste gas stabilizing tank <b>110</b> at constant temperature for a certain period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Also, the SF<sub>6 </sub>concentration in the waste gas may be controlled selectively by controlling the temperature of the waste gas stabilizing tank <b>110</b>. For example, a temperature controller may be used to raise the temperature of the waste gas stabilizing tank <b>110</b> so as to decrease the SF<sub>6 </sub>concentration, or conversely to lower the temperature so as to increase the SF<sub>6 </sub>concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Also, in an exemplary embodiment, a second SF<sub>6 </sub>concentrating device <b>210</b> may be further provided after the second separation membrane module <b>140</b>. The second SF<sub>6 </sub>concentrating device <b>210</b> may be configured the same as the first SF<sub>6 </sub>concentrating device <b>210</b>. That is, The second SF<sub>6 </sub>concentrating device <b>210</b> may comprise a concentration chamber <b>211</b>, an adsorbent <b>212</b>, and a heating devices <b>213</b>. It may perform the same function as the first SF<sub>6 </sub>concentrating device <b>210</b>. That is, it may finally concentrate and separate the SF<sub>6 </sub>discharged from the second separation membrane module <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In an exemplary embodiment, a method for separating and recovering SF<sub>6 </sub>may include removing sulfur dioxide and moisture included in a SF<sub>6</sub>-containing waste gas, adsorbing SF<sub>6 </sub>gas included in the waste gas with an adsorbent, desorbing SF<sub>6 </sub>gas from the adsorbent by heating, thereby obtaining concentrated SF<sub>6 </sub>gas, separating the concentrated SF<sub>6 </sub>gas into a SF<sub>6</sub>-containing first recovered gas and a first remnant gas, storing the first remnant gas, separating the first recovered gas into a SF<sub>6</sub>-containing second recovered gas and a second remnant gas, and separating the stored remnant gas into SF<sub>6 </sub>and a remaining gas.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Further, in an exemplary embodiment, the adsorbent may be an activated carbon, and the heating may be performed at a temperature of about 50&#xb0; C. to about 200&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In an exemplary embodiment, the moisture may be first removed from the waste gas by using a moisture removing material and then sulfur dioxide may be removed from the waste gas by using a sulfur dioxide removing material, and heat may be provided to the sulfur dioxide removing material.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In an exemplary embodiment, the concentrated SF<sub>6 </sub>gas or the SF<sub>6</sub>-containing waste gas may be stored in a tank (refer to the stabilization tank explained above), and the concentration of the concentrated SF<sub>6 </sub>gas or the SF<sub>6</sub>-containing waste gas may be adjusted by changing the temperature of the tank before being subject to separation.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">While the exemplary embodiments have been shown and described, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure as defined by the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In addition, many modifications can be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the present disclosure without departing from the essential scope thereof. Therefore, it is intended that the present disclosure not be limited to the particular exemplary embodiments disclosed as the best mode contemplated for carrying out the present disclosure, but that the present disclosure will include all embodiments falling within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
