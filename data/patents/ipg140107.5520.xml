<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to communication, in particular to charging a user for access to a service accessible via a communication network.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Services can be accessed by users via a communication network operated by a network operator. A service that is accessible via a network operator's communication network may be provided by a service provider different from the network operator. Alternatively, the service provider and the operator can be identical. A user may operate a user device like a mobile phone or a computer for service access via the communication network.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Examples for services are typical telecommunication services like e.g. making a phone call, sending messages via Short Message Service (SMS) or Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) or downloading a ring tone or a video clip or mobile television.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A common feature is that commercial operators charge a user for service access, i.e. for the activation and/or the usage of a service.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Rating is the practice of determining the cost for access to a particular service. The rating process involves converting data that is related to the access of a service into monetary-equivalent value. The rating process further considers tariffs for calculating the price to be charged to the user for service access. Data that is related to the access of a service, in the following denoted &#x201c;service access related data&#x201d;, is typically quantifiable and certain types exist like time property (e.g. day of week, date, time of day) or amount of usage (e.g. duration of call, amount of data, number of messages. number of songs), destination of the call (e.g. land line, overseas), or origin of call or location of the caller, or type of network used (e.g. mobile network, fixed network). Another example for service access related data is the type of subscription of a user, e.g. regular or premium service subscription, minute-based or second-based, flat-rate or not.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A tariff typically consists of a rate and/or a fee. A rate is the price set for an event, e.g. price per unit per minute or price per unit of transferred data. A fee is a&#x2014;typically fixed&#x2014;amount that can be added on when charging for certain events, e.g. a fee may be raised when a roaming call is connected. An event may be identical to service access related data or derived therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A rating entity, sometimes also known as rating engine, can be employed to determine the cost to be charged for access to a service. The rating entity may collect service access related data and calculate the costs for the service access under consideration of an applicable tariff. The determination of the applicable tariff may depend on at least some of the service access related data. A typical example for a service access by a user is a mobile phone call made by the user to another user, wherein the location and subscription information of both users, the time of service activation (e.g. working hours or weekend etc.) typically have an impact on the applicable tariff which can be determined by the operator taking into account the aforementioned service access related data. The rating engine may then calculate the costs for the call, e.g. based the duration of the call under consideration of the tariff comprising a rate on a per minute base and a fee for roaming users.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Common to all known charging systems is that tariffs are set by the communication network operators. If a service is provided by a service provider different from the network operator, the service provider may impact the tariff in addition.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Cost-aware users can only minimize their bill by influencing service access related data as far as possible, e.g. by reducing the number and duration of service access or avoiding roaming. However, this behavior is inconvenient for the user and also detrimental for the operators that have an interest in increased service access especially in case of low communication network load. On the other hand, operators need some means to control service access in situations of high communication network load, e.g. by prioritizing premium users over regular users. However, such a control mechanism based on fixed subscription is highly inflexible and does not fit to users that urgently need to access a service and would be willing to pay more.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is therefore an object of the invention to provide methods, devices, and computer programs that provide for more convenience and flexibility for a cost-optimized charging adapted especially for situations of high and/or low communication network load.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention discloses a method for charging a user for access to a service. The service is accessible via a communication network wherein at least two charging-related states are defined, e.g. a first charging-related state associated with low communication network load conditions and a second charging-related state associated with high communication network load conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A tariff proposal entity may be triggered by reception of a request to determine one or more tariff proposals for charging the user for accessing the service. The tariff proposal entity determines the one or more tariff proposals in accordance with preferences of the user and sends to a rating entity the determined one or more tariff proposals for charging the user for accessing the service.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">At the rating entity, the one or more tariff proposals for charging the user for accessing the service are received from the tariff proposal entity which is associated with the user. The rating entity analyzes the one or more received tariff proposals in relation to a current charging-related state of the at least two charging-related states. In the analysis it is determined if at least one of the one or more tariff proposals complies with at least one tariff setting associated with the current charging-related state. A tariff setting associated with a charging-related state may be any kind of information based on that the compliance of the one or more tariff proposals can be determined. A tariff setting can be for example a tariff defined e.g. by a communication network operator and optionally a service provider providing service. A tariff setting may be stored at the rating entity or obtained for the analysis from a source external to the rating entity.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The rating entity selects a tariff of the at least one complying tariff proposals. Preferably the selected tariff is identical to one of the tariff proposals. However, a selected tariff and a tariff proposal may differ slightly in order to accomplish and ascertain the compliance between the at least one tariff proposal and the at least one tariff setting. Furthermore, the rating entity initiates a charging of the user for access to the service according to the selected tariff.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the present invention, users are provided with the opportunity to influence the tariffs used in the charging process. Tariff proposals can be provided ad-hoc, e.g. when a service access request is made or during service access, and can be adapted to a current of various charging-related states being associated e.g. with different communication network load conditions. In addition, tariff proposals are analyzed for compliance with tariffs settings set by the operator and optionally, as explained previously, by the service provider for the current charging-related state and are selected accordingly. Hence, charging can be performed in a very flexible and convenient way and suits both the preferences of the users and the interests of the operators.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts an illustration of a communication network <b>100</b> operated by an operator. The communication network <b>100</b> comprises an access network <b>103</b>, a core network <b>104</b>, and a charging system <b>105</b> that are connected via respective links L<b>101</b> and L<b>104</b>. It may also be possible to incorporate the charging system into the core network (not depicted).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Examples for a communication network are a Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) network, a General Packet Radio System (GPRS) network, a Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) network, or fourth generation (4G) network, a wired telephone or data network or combinations of such communication networks. In those aforementioned mobile communication network examples, the charging system would be preferably a part of the core network.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The communication network <b>100</b> may comprise further entities like e.g. a service network or an operational support system or further connections which are not shown for simplicity reasons. The communication network <b>100</b> further offers a service <b>102</b> that is accessible for a user operating a user device <b>101</b>, here exemplary shown as mobile phone. The offered service <b>102</b> is depicted for illustrative reasons within the communication network <b>100</b> because the access to the service is accomplished via the communication network <b>100</b>. A device like a server at which the accessible service <b>102</b> is located, can be located within the communication network <b>100</b> (e.g. within the core network <b>104</b>) or external to the communication network <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The service <b>102</b> can be accessed via the communication network <b>100</b>, e.g. from the user device <b>101</b> via the access network <b>103</b> and the core network <b>104</b> and the respective links L<b>100</b>,L<b>101</b>,L<b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The communication network <b>100</b> further comprises a rating entity <b>107</b> and at least one tariff proposal entity <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>b</i>. A tariff proposal entity can be located at a user device <b>101</b> as illustrated for tariff proposal entity <b>106</b><i>a</i>. For this type of arrangement, the term &#x201c;terminal-centric&#x201d; may be used further on. A terminal-centric tariff proposal entity may be comprised in a user device <b>101</b> or connectable thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Alternatively or in addition, a tariff proposal entity may be located at other parts of the communication network remote from the user device <b>101</b>, e.g. like tariff proposal entity <b>106</b><i>b </i>located in the core network <b>104</b>. For such an arrangement where the tariff proposal entity is located remote from the user device <b>101</b> in the communication network, the term &#x201c;network-centric&#x201d; is also used in the following. Primarily, this term refers to arrangements wherein the user device <b>101</b> and the tariff proposal entity <b>106</b><i>b </i>are separated via a wireless link of a wireless access network.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A user may be associated with at least one of a network-centric and terminal-centric tariff proposal entity. For example, at a first charging-related state associated with e.g. high communication network load conditions, a network-centric tariff proposal entity e.g. like tariff proposal entity <b>106</b><i>b </i>may be used whereas at a second charging-related state associated with e.g. at low communication network load conditions, a terminal-centric tariff proposal entity like e.g. tariff proposal entity <b>106</b><i>a </i>may be used. A switch from a network-centric tariff proposal entity to a terminal-centric tariff proposal entity (and/or vice versa) may be initiated when the current charging-related state changes from a first charging-related state to a second charging-related state (and/or vice versa).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an example for charging-related states denoted as &#x201c;Discount&#x201d;, &#x201c;Default&#x201d;, and &#x201c;Auction&#x201d; being defined in a communication network. The charging-related states are associated with tariff settings, here indicated by line <b>200</b>. For charging-related state &#x201c;Discount&#x201d; the associated tariff settings <b>200</b> are low and may apply for high service availability, e.g. in case of low communication network load. Correspondingly, charging-related states &#x201c;Default&#x201d; and &#x201c;Auction&#x201d; have increasingly higher tariff settings as indicated by line <b>200</b>, e.g. in order to reflect for higher costs to be charged for medium and high communication network load conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The line <b>200</b> associated with tariff settings indicates that tariff proposals of higher value have to be submitted for charging-related state &#x201c;Auction&#x201d; compared to further charging-related states &#x201c;Default&#x201d; and &#x201c;Discount&#x201d; in order to comply with the tariff setting associated with charging-related state &#x201c;Auction&#x201d;. Minimum and/or maximum threshold parameter may limit tariff settings as indicated by &#x201c;min&#x201d; and &#x201c;max&#x201d; for limiting a tariff to be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The communication network may be configured that for each of the defined charging-related states tariffs for charging the users for service access are selected from submitted tariff proposals that comply with at least one tariff setting associated with a current charging state. Alternatively, this may be possible only for a sub-set of the at least two defined charging-related states. For example, a selection of a complying tariff proposal may be only allowed for charging-related states &#x201c;Discount&#x201d; and &#x201c;Auction&#x201d; while for charging-related state &#x201c;Default&#x201d; a tariff proposal received at the rating entity may be discarded right away, because the default tariff settings of the operator shall apply. Accordingly, the operator can define for the at least two charging states if a received tariff proposal is considered for an analysis and selection or not, thus providing an efficient initial filtering for those charging-related state(s) where a tariff proposal consideration is wanted by the operator or not.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">For charging a user for access to a service accessible via a communication network wherein at least two charging-related states are defined, a tariff proposal entity may be triggered by reception of a request to determine one or more tariff proposals for charging the user for accessing the service. The tariff proposal entity determines the one or more tariff proposals in accordance with preferences of the user and sends to a rating entity the determined one or more tariff proposals for charging the user for accessing the service. The determination of the one or more tariff proposals may be influenced by various parameters known by the tariff proposal entity, including but not limited to a previously failed attempt to obtain service access. Sending of the determined at least one tariff proposal to the rating entity may be accomplished in a push- or pull-like manner. The tariff proposal entity may send the determined one or more tariff proposals to the rating entity or to another entity from which the determined one or more tariff proposals are further sent to the rating entity or from which they can be downloaded by the rating entity. The one or more tariff proposal entities may be sent via a single message or a sequence of messages, e.g. in form of a dialog with the rating entity.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">At the rating entity, the one or more tariff proposals for charging the user for accessing the service are received from the tariff proposal entity which is associated with the user. The rating entity analyzes the one or more received tariff proposals in relation to a current charging-related state of the at least two charging-related states. In the analysis it is determined if at least one of the one or more tariff proposals complies with at least one tariff setting associated with the current charging-related state.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The rating entity selects a tariff of the at least one complying tariff proposals and initiates a charging of the user for access to the service according to the selected tariff.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A selected tariff and a tariff proposal may differ slightly in order to accomplish and ascertain the compliance between the at least one tariff proposal and the at least one tariff setting, e.g. for adapting the tariff proposal such that it can be processed by the rating entity which may be configured to process tariffs up to maximum two decimal places while the tariff proposal may have more than two decimal places such that rounding of the tariff proposal has to be carried out so that it can be determined that the tariff proposal and the tariff setting comply.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Preferably, in the analyzing step the one or more tariff proposals are analyzed according to an order specified by the tariff proposal entity. The order may reflect user preferences and is especially useful if the tariff proposal entity submits multiple tariff proposals for a service access such that the tariff proposals are analyzed according to the user preferences. For example, the associated tariff proposal entity may submit tariff proposals of increasing value. If the user preference is lowest price, the rating entity may be thus ordered to start the analysis for the tariff proposal of lowest value at the risk that the tariff proposal of lowest value and further lower value tariff proposals do not comply with the tariff settings of the current charging-related state and that it takes a while until a complying tariff proposal can be determined. According to another example, the order may be to start the analysis at a higher value tariff proposal if quicker access is required.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The rating entity may determine the tariff settings associated with the current charging-related state based on service access related data. This service access related data may be received at the rating entity in conjunction with the one or more tariff proposals and may be used by the rating entity to refine the tariff settings to be used in the compliance analysis to particularities of the service, service access, and the user.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A communication network load condition may determinable for any part of a communication network, e.g. on cell-, node-, sub-network-, network-, area- (e.g. location area or service area), and/or on link-level. A communication network load condition may be allocated to a leveling scheme, e.g. for indicating if a communication network load condition is on a high, a medium, or a low level. Correspondingly, charging-related states corresponding to the communication network load levels may be determined, e.g. charging-related state &#x201c;Discount&#x201d; for communication network load level &#x201c;LOW&#x201d; and charging-related state &#x201c;Auction&#x201d; for communication network load level &#x201c;HIGH&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The at least two charging-related states may be associated with at least two communication network load conditions. Furthermore, the rating entity may be adapted to select an address for communication with the tariff proposal entity in dependence of the current charging-related state being e.g. determined according to a current communication network load condition. The rating entity may be adapted to switch from a first tariff proposal entity being associated with a first charging-related state to a second tariff proposal entity being associated with the second charging-related state by switching from an address associated with the first tariff proposal entity associated with the user to an address of the second tariff proposal entity associated with the user. For example, for a high communication network load condition with current charging-related state &#x201c;Auction&#x201d;, the rating entity may turn to a network-centric tariff proposal entity <b>106</b><i>b</i>. For low communication network load conditions being associated with current charging-related state &#x201c;Discount&#x201d; with free capacity on a wireless link L<b>100</b>, the rating entity may communicate with a terminal-centric tariff proposal entity <b>106</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Users may feel more confident if they can verify the selected tariff. An approval of the selected tariff by the user may be even mandatory to fulfill legal charging requirements for certain jurisdictions wherein the communication network is operated, even for the case if the selected tariff proposal is lower than the default one. Preferably, an indication of the selected tariff is sent to the user device operated by the user for requesting approval of the selected tariff and the charging according to the selected tariff is initiated when a response to the approval request from the user is in the affirmative.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Alternatively, when the approval access is not in the affirmative, service access may be denied and a (small) fee set by the operator may be charged to the user who rejected the proposal. Alternatively, the communication network may be configured to provide requested service access and charge according to a default tariff defined by the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Preferably, the rating entity performs the step of initiating access to the service after the selection of the tariff and/or after the reception of the affirmative response to the approval request. Hence, access to the service can be granted under the condition that the applicable tariff (i.e. the selected tariff) for the service access is in consent with the user.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The rating entity may receive from at least one further entity associated with at least one further user one or more further tariff proposals for charging the at least one further user for accessing the service. The rating entity may analyze the received one or more tariff proposals of the user and the at least one further user in relation to the current charging-related state. In the analysis it is determined if said received one or more tariff proposals of the user and the at least one further user comply with the at least one tariff setting. Furthermore, one or more most valuable tariffs of the one or more complying tariff proposals are selected. The selection may be performed on a per user base up to a maximum number of users allowed for access to the service. The rating entity initiates a charging for access to the service for at least one user of the user and the at least one further user for which a most valuable tariff has been selected, the charging being in accordance with the selected most valuable tariff corresponding to said at least one user of the user and the at least one further user.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In other words, in the analysis it is checked if the tariff proposals comply with the at least one tariff setting. It can happen that a user submits more than one tariff proposal from which more than one is compliant. In this case, only the most valuable tariff proposal for this particular user is considered further on. However, this does not mean that for each user the corresponding complying most valuable tariff proposal is necessarily processed further, because service access is limited to a maximum number of users. Thus, in case the number of users with complying most valuable tariff proposal exceeds the maximum number of allowed users, the number of users is reduced to the maximum number. For example, the number of user submitting tariff proposals is X, the number of complying most valuable tariff proposals Y, and the number of allowed users is Z with X&#x3e;Y&#x3e;Z, then the number of users that will be charged is Z. Selection criteria is preferably the value of the complying most valuable tariff proposals, i.e. only the Z complying most valuable tariff proposals of highest value of the overall Y complying most valuable tariff proposals are selected for the charging process and only those Z associated users may get access to the service. More selection criteria may be applied, e.g. in case too many equal complying most valuable tariff proposals exist. In the end, a number of X-Z users are not considered for service access, among those number Y-Z of users with complying most valuable tariff proposals of too low value or otherwise filtered out.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">It may happen that the rating entity receives during service access one or more subsequent tariff proposals, e.g. from the user and/or the at least one or more further users. In this case, the rating entity may analyze the one or more subsequent tariff proposals for compliance with at least one tariff setting associated to a current charging-related state of the at least two charging-related states. The current charging-related state considered in the subsequent analysis (i.e. during service access) does not necessarily have to be the same current charging-related state as in the previous analysis (e.g. before service access). Hence, tariff settings considered in the previous and the subsequent analysis may differ. Consequently, compliance may be achieved differently and a complying subsequent tariff proposal may be different from a previous one (of course they can be also the same, especially if the charging-related state and the associated tariff settings have not changed). The rating entity can select a subsequent tariff of the one or more subsequent tariff proposals and initiates an adaptation of the charging for access to the service according to the selected subsequent tariff.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The tariff proposal entity may be configured to send out one or more tariff proposals on its own initiative, e.g. in a periodical fashion. Alternatively, the tariff proposal entity may be requested by the user and/or the rating entity for a subsequent tariff proposal submission.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The tariff proposal entity may be informed about a change in communication network load condition and may be triggered to send to the rating entity one or more new tariff proposals. Alternatively or in addition, the such informed tariff proposal entity may turn to the user device for informing the user about the changed communication network load condition and for requesting the user to determine and/or approve one or more tariff proposals adapted to the changed communication network load condition. Alternatively or in addition to the changed communication network load condition, a changed charging-related state and/or one or more associated tariff settings may be communicated to the aforementioned one or more entities and processed in a similar manner for sending one or more new tariff proposals to the rating entity with or without involvement of the user device.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Alternatively or in addition, the rating engine may store previously received one or more tariff proposals and re-analyze them if a charging-related state and thus its at least one associated tariff setting changes.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The rating entity can thus select a currently applicable tariff output by the analysis which may be replaced by a subsequently applicable tariff output by a subsequent analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The adaptation is especially useful for changing communication network load conditions effecting a change of the current charging-related state and thus changing the associated at least one tariff settings. Consequently, a previously compliant tariff proposal may no longer be compliant and a previously non-compliant tariff proposal may become compliant later on.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A change of the charging-related state may not have an effect on the charging for a service that is already accessed and charged according to a previously selected tariff. However, there might be communication networks and/or services that are operated and may demand for an adaptation of the tariff to the current charging-related state, because e.g. a previously selected tariff may be no longer compliant with the one or more tariff settings of a changed current charging related state. Hence, adaptation of the selected tariff (e.g. by submission and analysis of subsequent one or more tariff proposals and/or analysis of stored previously submitted tariff proposals) may increase the probability that a user does not get disconnected from service access.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Furthermore, the submission and analysis of the one or more subsequent tariff proposals and/or the re-analysis of previously received and stored tariff proposals can lead to a tariff improvement for the user, because when the tariff setting associated with a changed charging-related state drops e.g. to a certain extent, the previously selected applicable tariff may be too high and it is beneficial for the user to have it replaced by a lower tariff in consent with the user and still compliant with the network operator's and optionally service provider's tariff settings.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Preferably, the tariff proposal entity receives information about a current charging-related state of the at least two charging-related states and considers the current charging-related state when determining the one or more tariff proposals. The current charging-related state can be indicated to the tariff proposal entity from any communication network entity, e.g. a core network entity or an access network entity. Furthermore, for indicating a current charging-related state to a user, the current charging-related state may be output on a user device, e.g. on a display or via a loudspeaker or via other user output means. Different tariff settings may be associated with different charging-related states as described e.g. in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and the knowledge of the current charging-related state&#x2014;and preferably in addition the applicable current tariff settings&#x2014;increase the probability that the at least one tariff proposal received at the rating entity complies with the tariff settings of the current charging-related state.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The communication network may comprise a wireless access network and the user device may be operated at a first side of the wireless access network and the tariff proposal entity and the rating entity may be operated at a second side of the wireless access network, e.g. as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> for tariff proposal entity <b>106</b><i>b</i>. According to a network-centric solution, the tariff proposal entity associated with the user is located &#x201c;within the network&#x201d; and may be adapted to propose tariffs on behalf of the user. User preferences may be configured by the user in a previous configuration that may apply for multiple service accesses. User preferences may be set by the user for a particular service or for a particular service type.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Preferably, the tariff proposal entity is connectable to the rating entity via a link with such a capacity that it can communicate without (significant) delays with the rating entity. A network-centric arrangement has therefore especially advantages in wireless communication networks wherein almost always a wireless link capacity provides for the bottleneck, whereas connections between entities &#x201c;within the network&#x201d; are typically much less affected by overload. Alternatively or in addition, the tariff proposal entity may be operated at the user device, which may provide for more instantaneous interaction between the user and the tariff proposal entity, e.g. to increase user-experience if service access is to be auctioned. An example can be found in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> with the tariff proposal entity <b>106</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Preferably, the tariff proposal entity comprises a software agent. A software agent comprises software that acts on behalf of a user. Such &#x201c;action on behalf of&#x201d; implies the authority to decide when (and if) action is appropriate. Related and derived concepts include intelligent agents (in particular exhibiting some aspect of Artificial Intelligence, such as learning and reasoning), autonomous agents (capable of modifying the way in which they achieve their objectives), distributed agents (being executed on physically distinct machines), multi-agent systems (distributed agents that do not have the capabilities to achieve an objective alone and thus must communicate), mobile agents (agents that can relocate their execution onto different processors) and more.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The usage of a software agent has therefore the advantage that user interaction can be minimized, even to zero interaction depending on the user preferences, legal requirements, etc, and is especially advantageous for network-centric embodiments wherein the tariff proposal entity is preferably adapted to act autonomously with minimized user interaction.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A software agent may be capable to learn from previous submissions of tariff proposals in order to adapt tariff proposals that are to be determined in a current determination process to probable tariff settings of a (probable) current charging-related state to increase the probability that at least one of the one or more determined and sent tariff proposals comply.</p>

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A user wishing to access a service may turn to his user device <b>301</b> and may activate a request for service access that may be sent S<b>300</b> from the user device <b>301</b> to the network <b>304</b> (e.g. a core network) via message M<b>300</b>.

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The following description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> uses the terms &#x201c;operator&#x201d;, &#x201c;user&#x201d;, &#x201c;agent&#x201d;, and &#x201c;application&#x201d;. In order to ease the understanding of the following embodiments, it is abstained from a further fragmentation of the communication network into sub-parts like an access network <b>103</b> or a core network <b>104</b> or a charging system <b>105</b> with rating entity <b>107</b>. The following description also does not explicitly mention any links for the same reason. The communication network is assumed to be operated by an &#x201c;operator&#x201d; to provide one or more services <b>102</b> for access to one or more users and to perform charging therefore. Reception and analysis of tariff proposals, selection of a tariff and initiation of charging are assumed to be performed by a rating entity of the &#x201c;operator&#x201d;. It is differentiated between charging-related states &#x201c;Auction&#x201d; and &#x201c;Discount&#x201d; and between &#x201c;terminal-centric&#x201d; and &#x201c;network-centric&#x201d; arrangements. The &#x201c;user&#x201d; is assumed to operate a user device and to be associated to a tariff proposal entity comprising an &#x201c;agent&#x201d; or an &#x201c;application&#x201d;. In the following description an &#x201c;agent&#x201d; is used for a network-centric arrangement, because an agent may be installed on a computing entity in the network and is capable of autonomous operation without or with minimized user interaction. On the other hand, for a terminal-centric arrangement, an application operating on the user device is used that might be configured to provide more user interaction in order to involve the user more into the process of tariff proposing and interaction.</p>

<p id="p-0079" num="0078">According to step S<b>501</b>, the operator informs the user on her user device about the current charging-related state &#x201c;Discount&#x201d; for a certain service. The charging-related state may be kept in the user device until it changes to &#x201c;Auction&#x201d; or &#x201c;Default&#x201d; and can optionally be indicated permanently e.g. in the display of the user device.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In step S<b>502</b>, the user tries to access the &#x201c;discounted&#x201d; service.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The operator contacts in step S<b>503</b> the user's agent with a request to propose a &#x201c;discount&#x201d; tariff. This request can optionally include a default service tariff of the rating entity in order to have an upper limit for the proposal.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">According to step S<b>504</b>, the agent calculates a tariff proposal according to the preferences configured by the user and sends the tariff proposal back to the operator. The agent can optionally log the respective activity.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The operator compares in step S<b>505</b> the proposed tariff to its discount tariff policy describing the tariff settings for the current charging-related state. The discount tariff policy could for instance describe that proposed tariffs are accepted if they fall into a tariff range defined by a minimum tariff and the default tariff for the service. The probability of acceptance could also be related to how close the proposed tariff is to the default tariff.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">According to decision point S<b>506</b>, the operator determines whether the tariff proposal of the user is acceptable (Y) or not acceptable (N) for the operator, i.e. the tariff proposal complies with at least one tariff setting of the current charging-related state (Y) or not (N).</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">If the operator determines at decision point S<b>506</b> that the tariff proposal is not acceptable (N), the method proceeds to step S<b>507</b>. The agent and/or the user device will be preferably informed about the rejection and the user might be offered to access the service using the &#x201c;Default&#x201d; tariff or might be invited to submit a further tariff proposal for access to the service.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In case the operator determines at decision point S<b>506</b> that the tariff proposal is acceptable (Y), the tariff proposal is selected for charging the user for service access according to step S<b>508</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The user will be offered access to the service and the selected tariff is indicated to the user for approval according to step S<b>509</b>. The selected tariff can be indicated to the user at the user device in any appropriate way, e.g. in the form of an in-call announcement or by indication on the display of the user device.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">At decision point S<b>510</b> it is checked whether the user accepts (Y) the selected tariff or not (N). For this reason, communication between the operator and the user may be established.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In case the user does not accept (N) the offered access at decision point S<b>510</b>, the operator does not provide service access but might charge a fee instead according to step <b>511</b>.

<p id="p-0090" num="0089">According to step S<b>512</b>, service access is granted and charging is performed based on the selected tariff if the user accepts (Y) at decision point S<b>510</b> the offered access at the selected tariff.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">A &#x201c;terminal-centric&#x201d; solution for charging-related state &#x201c;Discount&#x201d; may be implemented rather similar. For example, steps S<b>501</b>-S<b>503</b> and S<b>505</b>-S<b>512</b> could be described in the same manner for a &#x201c;terminal-centric&#x201d; solution. Step S<b>504</b> may be modified to allow for more user interaction, e.g. an application in the user device (instead of an agent in the network as for the network-centric arrangement) processes the request and asks the user to enter a tariff proposal. This can e.g. be done by typing in the tariff via a keyboard, by selecting a tariff from a list or by pressing &#x201c;stop&#x201d; when an increasing (decreasing) tariff is shown on the user device. Alternatively, the application could calculate the proposal based on user defined preference settings. In any case, the&#x2014;howsoever&#x2014;determined tariff is then transmitted from the user device to the operator as tariff proposal. The user device can optionally log the activity.</p>

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">According to step S<b>601</b>, the operator may inform the user on her user device about the current charging-related state &#x201c;Auction&#x201d; for a certain service. In GSM, the charging-related state could for instance be efficiently transmitted using the BCCH (Broadcast Control Channel). The charging-related state is kept in the user device until it changes to &#x201c;Discount&#x201d; or &#x201c;Default&#x201d; and can optionally be indicated permanently (e.g. in the display).</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The user tries to access the &#x201c;auctioned&#x201d; service according to step S<b>602</b>. Information about this intention is transmitted to the operator, for instance via RACH (Random Access Channel). Such a communication also is possible in congestion situations of the access network.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The operator assigns the user to one or more service auctions in step S<b>603</b>. There might be n&#x3e;=1 services of the same type available, e.g. two voice channels.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">According to step S<b>604</b>, the operator contacts the user's agent with a request for an auction bid. The term &#x201c;bid&#x201d; is common in auctions and is used in the conjunction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> for a tariff proposal for access to the auctioned service. This request may include the minimum of the highest bids for the n auctions. If no bids are available, the default tariff calculated by the rating entity may be taken alternatively.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">According to step S<b>605</b>, the agent calculates a new bid according to the preference rules configured by the user and sends it back to the operator. The agent can optionally log the respective activity.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">According to step S<b>606</b>, the operator selects the n highest bids from all given bids received from multiple users and checks further if they comply with the current charging-related state settings, e.g. it may be checked if any of the n bids fall below a predefined threshold. Those bids may be excluded from further processing.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">According to decision point S<b>607</b>, it is questioned if the auction is over (Y) or not (N). If the auction is over (Y), e.g. the time limit or the maximum number of bidding rounds is reached, then the operator proceeds to step S<b>608</b>. Otherwise it may step back to step S<b>604</b>, e.g. to collect more bids from these users and/or from other users.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In case the user is among those users with the n highest complying bids, the user's complying bid is selected as tariff for access to the service according to step S<b>608</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The user's selected bid (i.e. selected tariff) may then be offered to the user for acceptance according to optional step S<b>609</b>. The selected tariff for the service may be indicated to the user in an appropriate way, e.g. in the form of an in-call announcement. If the user does not accept the offered access, the operator might charge a fee to the user. If the user accepts the selected bid, the method may proceed further to step S<b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">According to step S<b>610</b>, charging based on the selected bid for service access for this user will be initiated.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Alternatively, if the operator does not accept the proposal, the agent and/or the user will be preferably informed about the rejection and access to the service will be denied.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Both operator and agent could store information about the unsuccessful attempt.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">A &#x201c;terminal-centric&#x201d; solution for charging-related state &#x201c;Auction&#x201d; may be implemented rather similar. For example, steps S<b>601</b>-S<b>603</b> and S<b>606</b>-S<b>610</b> could be described in the same manner for a &#x201c;terminal-centric&#x201d; solution. Step S<b>604</b> may be modified such that the request for auction bid is sent via a BCCH to the application in the user device acting as tariff proposal entity. Step S<b>605</b> may be changed to allow for more user interaction, e.g. an application in the user device (instead of an agent in the network as for the network-centric arrangement) processes the request and asks the user to enter a tariff proposal.
