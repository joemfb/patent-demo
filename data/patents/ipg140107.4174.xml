<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The subject matter disclosed herein relates to electric power generation and distribution, and more particularly to a multi-functional solid state power controller for electric power generation and distribution systems.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Electrical power systems in hybrid vehicles, such as military hybrid vehicles, can include high voltage direct current (DC) power generation and distribution. Solid State Power Controllers (SSPC) can be used in a power distribution system to replace traditional electromechanical circuit breakers. The main functions of the SSPC can include power distribution and protection of power to different loads. In comparison to electromechanical devices, SSPC provides fast response time, and eliminates arcing during turn-off transient and bouncing during turn-on transient. SSPC does not suffer severe degradation during repeated fault isolation in comparison with electromechanical devices. SSPC facilitates advanced protection and diagnostics, and provides more efficient power distribution architectures and packaging techniques, due to the smaller size and weight of SSPC. However, current SSPC typically lack system oriented function and have system integration issues.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Exemplary embodiments include a solid state power controller apparatus, including an on/off-current limit controller, a pre-charge controller coupled to the on/off-current limit controller, an active damper controller coupled to the on/off-current limit controller and a main switch coupled to and responsive to on/off and protective commands from the on/off-current limit controller.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Additional exemplary embodiments include a solid state power controller system, including solid state power controller apparatus, having an on/off-current limit controller, a pre-charge controller coupled to the on/off-current limit controller, an active damper controller coupled to the on/off-current limit controller and a main switch coupled to and responsive to on/off and protective commands from the on/off-current limit controller. The solid state power controller system can further include a direct current power source coupled to the solid state power controller apparatus, a constant power load and an input filter disposed between the constant power load and the SSPC apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further exemplary embodiments include solid state power controller protective function method, including in response to an over current condition, turning off a main switch and turning on a first auxiliary switch to prevent pulse width modulation of the main switch and to direct current to a current limiting resistor and in response to a condition including at least one of over/under voltage, excessive ripple current, repetitive low over-current and harmful temperatures turning off a main switch and generating an alert.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a multi-functional SSPC system <b>100</b> according to one embodiment. In one or more embodiments and as further discussed below, the system <b>100</b> may improve system stability in the presence of constant power (i.e., negative impedance) loads, eliminate pre-charge circuits from the switching mode power converter due to synergism with the main SSPC switch, and/or avoid over sizing current rating of the main switch to meet short circuit conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, the system <b>100</b> can include a DC power source <b>125</b> electrically coupled to an SSPC <b>101</b>. In one embodiment, the DC source <b>125</b> can be an AC generator whose output is rectified to a DC voltage that includes voltage ripples, or any other DC input that can include ripples. The DC power source includes a positive rail <b>127</b> and a negative rail <b>126</b>. The system <b>100</b> can further include an input filter <b>150</b> electrically coupled to the SSPC <b>101</b>, and further electrically coupled to a constant power load <b>160</b>. In one embodiment, the input filter <b>150</b> can be an LC filter having an inductor <b>145</b> and a capacitor <b>155</b> having values selected to filter out certain frequencies between the SSPC <b>101</b> and the constant power load <b>160</b>. As known in the art, the LC filter is tuned to include minimal damping with as low a resistance as possible. The capacitor <b>155</b> is electrically coupled to a filter current sensor <b>165</b> described further herein.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The SSPC <b>101</b> includes a main switch <b>105</b> sized to meet low conduction losses in the SSPC <b>101</b>. The SSPC <b>101</b> further includes first, second and third auxiliary switches <b>110</b>, <b>115</b>, <b>120</b> electrically coupled to the main switch <b>105</b>. The first, second and third auxiliary switches <b>110</b>, <b>115</b>, <b>120</b> and the main switch <b>105</b> are further electrically coupled to the DC power source <b>125</b>. The SSPC <b>101</b> further includes an on/off-current limit controller coupled to the main switch <b>105</b> and the first auxiliary switch <b>110</b>. The SSPC <b>101</b> also includes a temperature sensor <b>130</b> that is electrically coupled to the on/off-current limit controller <b>135</b>. The SSPC <b>101</b> further includes an SSPC current sensor <b>140</b> that is electrically coupled to the on/off-current limit controller <b>135</b> and the main switch <b>105</b>. The SSPC current sensor <b>140</b> is also electrically coupled to the inductor <b>145</b> in the input filter <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The SSPC <b>101</b> furthers include a pre-charge controller <b>170</b> that is electrically coupled to the on/off-current limit controller <b>135</b> and to the second auxiliary switch <b>115</b>. As further described herein, the pre-charge controller <b>170</b> limits in-rush current of capacitive loads (part of constant power load). The SSPC <b>101</b> further includes a voltage sensor <b>175</b> that is electrically coupled to the pre-charge controller <b>170</b> and to the negative rail <b>126</b>. The SSPC <b>101</b> further includes an active damper controller <b>180</b> that is electrically coupled to the on/off-current limit controller <b>135</b>, the filter current sensor <b>165</b> and the third auxiliary switch <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The SSPC <b>101</b> further includes a current limiting resistor <b>185</b>, a pre-charge resistor <b>190</b> and a damping resistor <b>195</b>. The current limiting resistor <b>185</b> is electrically coupled to the first auxiliary switch <b>110</b> and an overvoltage protection diode <b>128</b> that bridges the negative rail <b>126</b> and a positive rail <b>127</b> of the DC power source <b>125</b>. The overvoltage protection diode <b>128</b> prevents overvoltage during the switching operations described herein. The pre-charge resistor <b>190</b> coupled to the second auxiliary switch <b>115</b> and the voltage sensor <b>175</b>. The damping resistor <b>195</b> coupled to the third auxiliary switch and to the input filter <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one embodiment, the main switch <b>105</b> is responsive to on/off commands and protective functions from the on/off-current limit controller <b>135</b>. The protective functions are generated by the on/off-current limit controller <b>135</b> in response to conditions including, but not limited to: module over-temperature; over-current; repetitive low over current; over/under voltage conditions; and excessive ripple.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment, the first auxiliary switch <b>110</b> is sized to sustain over-current conditions for a limited time. The first auxiliary switch <b>110</b> avoids pulse width modulation of the main switch <b>105</b> during overload conditions. The current limiting resistor <b>185</b> limits the current at the main switch <b>105</b> during the overload conditions. During over current conditions, the SSPC current sensor <b>140</b> detects the over current conditions and signals the on/off-current limit controller <b>135</b> of the over current conditions. In response to the over current conditions, the on/off-current limit controller <b>135</b> turns off the main switch <b>105</b> and keeps the first auxiliary switch <b>110</b> on thereby limiting the over current in the limiting resistor <b>185</b>. If the SSPC current sensor <b>140</b> falsely detects the over current condition, the on/off-current limit controller <b>135</b> turns on the main switch <b>105</b>. If the SSPC current sensor <b>140</b> properly detected the over current condition, the on/off-current limit controller <b>135</b> turns off the first auxiliary switch <b>110</b> as well and generates an indication of an over current fault as part of the over current protective function.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment, the pre-charge controller <b>170</b> enables a soft start of capacitive loads (e.g., from the constant power load <b>160</b>) and controls the low current second auxiliary switch <b>115</b>. As such, the pre-charge controller <b>170</b> turns on the second auxiliary switch during power up of the system <b>100</b>. When the voltage sensor <b>175</b> detects the low voltage of the system <b>100</b> during power-up, the voltage sensor <b>175</b> can signal the pre-charge controller <b>170</b>. In response to the low voltage of the system power up, the pre-charge controller <b>170</b> can turn the second auxiliary switch <b>115</b> on. When the voltage sensor <b>175</b> senses that the system <b>100</b> has reached a predetermined voltage level, the voltage sensor <b>175</b> can signal the pre-charge controller <b>170</b> that the predetermined voltage level has been met. In response to the predetermined voltage level being met, the pre-charge controller <b>170</b> can open the second auxiliary switch <b>115</b>. The pre-charge controller <b>170</b> also detects over/under voltage conditions measured by the voltage sensor <b>175</b> and commands the main switch <b>105</b> to turn-off if the operating voltage is outside of specified limits. In addition, when the second auxiliary switch <b>115</b> is switched on, pre-charge resistor <b>190</b> limits the current through it for a controlled rise time of the system voltage during power up.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment, the active damper controller <b>180</b> improves system stability by connecting, for a short time, the damping resistor <b>195</b> to the negative rail <b>126</b> of the DC power source <b>125</b>. The active damping is responsive to the capacitor <b>155</b> current of the input filter <b>150</b> as sensed by the filter current sensor <b>165</b>. If the filter current sensor <b>165</b> detects that the capacitor current exceeds a predetermined level, the filter current sensor <b>165</b> signals the active damper controller <b>180</b>. In response to the excess current, the active damper controller <b>180</b> turns on the third auxiliary switch <b>120</b> thereby connecting the damping resistor <b>195</b> to the negative rail <b>126</b>. When the filter current sensor <b>165</b> detects that the capacitor <b>155</b> current has crossed zero, the filter current sensor <b>165</b> signals the active damper controller <b>180</b>. In response to the capacitor <b>155</b> current crossing zero, the active damper controller turns off the third auxiliary switch <b>120</b>. The operation of active damping improves system stability in the presence of constant power loads.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As described herein, the on/off-current limit controller <b>135</b> provides protective functions to the main switch <b>105</b>. The current limiting protective function is described above. In addition, the on/off-current limit controller <b>135</b> can provide a protective function and/or turn off the main switch <b>105</b> if the temperature sensor <b>130</b> detects conditions that could damage the main switch <b>105</b>. In addition, the on/off-current limit controller <b>135</b> can provide a protective function and/or turn off the main switch to the main switch <b>105</b> responsive to repetitive low over current conditions detected by the SSPC current sensor <b>140</b>, or over/under voltage conditions detected by the voltage sensor <b>175</b> or excessive current ripple conditions detected by the SSPC current sensor <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a flowchart for a protective function method <b>200</b>. As described herein, the SSPC <b>101</b> can detect and address several conditions and the on/off-current limit controller <b>135</b> can provide several protective functions to the main switch <b>105</b>. The method <b>200</b> can cycle continuously to detect the various conditions and to take the necessary action as described herein. At block <b>210</b>, the on/off-current limit controller <b>135</b> determines if there are any conditions that require turning off the main switch <b>105</b>. If there are no conditions to turn off the main switch <b>105</b> at block <b>210</b>, then the main switch <b>105</b> remains on as indicated at block <b>220</b>. If there are conditions to turn the main switch <b>105</b> off, then at block <b>230</b> the on/off-current limit controller <b>135</b> determines if the condition is an over current condition. If the condition is an over current condition, at block <b>230</b> the on/off-current limit controller <b>135</b> switches the main switch <b>105</b> off and turns on the first auxiliary switch <b>110</b> as indicated at block <b>240</b>. If the overcurrent condition exists for more than predetermined period of time at block <b>281</b>, then the on/off-current limit controller <b>135</b> turns the first auxiliary switch off at block <b>280</b> and issues an overcurrent alert at block <b>245</b>, then exits. If the overcurrent condition does not exceed predetermined period of time at block <b>281</b>, then the on/off-current limit controller <b>135</b> turns the main switch on and turns the first auxiliary switch off at block <b>282</b>, then exits. If the condition is not an over current condition at block <b>230</b>, then the on/off-current limit controller <b>135</b> and the pre-charge controller <b>170</b> determine if the condition is an over/under voltage condition at block <b>250</b>. The pre-charge controller <b>135</b> mainly controls the second auxiliary switch <b>115</b> during power up as described herein. However, the pre-charge controller <b>135</b> can also sense under/over voltage conditions during operation of the system <b>100</b> and can report those conditions to the on/off-current limit controller <b>135</b>. If there is an over/under voltage condition at block <b>250</b>, the on/off-current limit controller <b>135</b>, generates an over/under voltage alert at block <b>283</b>, turns off the main switch <b>105</b> at block <b>287</b>, and exits. If there is not an over/under voltage condition at block <b>250</b>, the on/off-current limit controller <b>135</b> determines if there is an excessive ripple current at block <b>260</b>. If there is an excessive ripple current at block <b>260</b>, the on/off-current limit controller <b>135</b>, issues an excessive ripple alert at block <b>284</b>, turns the main switch <b>105</b> off at block <b>287</b> and exits. If there was not an excessive ripple current at block <b>260</b>, the on/off-current limit controller <b>135</b> determines if there is repetitive low over current at block <b>270</b>. If there is repetitive low over current at block <b>270</b>, the on/off-current limit controller <b>135</b>, issues a repetitive low overcurrent alert at block <b>285</b>, switches the main switch <b>105</b> off at block <b>287</b> and exits. If there was not repetitive low over current at block <b>270</b>, the on/off-current limit controller <b>135</b> determines if there are harmful temperatures at block <b>290</b>. If there are harmful temperatures at block <b>290</b>, the on/off-current limit controller <b>135</b>, issues an over temperature alert at block <b>286</b>, switches the main switch <b>105</b> off at block <b>287</b> and exits. If there are no harmful temperatures at block <b>290</b>, the on/off-current limit controller <b>135</b> issues a false alert at block <b>288</b>, and then exits. As described herein, the process can repeat itself so that the SSPC <b>101</b> can constantly monitor itself.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The switches described herein can be any suitable switch that meets the operating criteria. For example, the main switch <b>105</b> can be a Silicon Carbide Metal On Oxide Field Effect Transistor (SiC MOSFET), and the first, second and third auxiliary switches <b>110</b>, <b>115</b>, <b>120</b> can be a Silicon insulated gate bipolar transistor (Si IGBT).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The on/off-current-limit controller <b>135</b>, pre-charge controller <b>170</b> and active damper controller <b>180</b> can be any suitable microcontroller or microprocessor for executing the instructions (e.g., on/off commands) described herein. As such, the suitable microcontroller or microprocessor can be any custom made or commercially available processor, a central processing unit (CPU), an auxiliary processor among several processors, a semiconductor based microprocessor (in the form of a microchip or chip set), a macroprocessor, or generally any device for executing software instructions.</p>
