<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A screening media for use in vibrating screen devices that fractionize crushed stones or gravel. The screening media is made by extruding a fiber-reinforced rubber or polymeric material to form a strip in a length longer than that needed to make individual screening mats for use in the vibrating screen devices. Screening apertures are then punched in the strip, and the apertured strip is cut into individual mats. The extruded strip includes side portions configured to connect to support structures of the vibrating device. Prior to the cutting step, the apertured strip can be maintained in the form of a coil or a long-length element.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 and/or &#xa7;365 to Swedish patent application No. 1050199-7, filed Mar. 3, 2010, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure concerns screening media to be used in a vibrating screen device that fractionizes crushed stones or gravel.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the discussion of the background that follows, reference is made to certain structures and/or methods. However, the following references should not be construed as an admission that these structures and/or methods constitute prior art. Applicant expressly reserves the right to demonstrate that such structures and/or methods do not qualify as prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Vibrating screen devices are used to fractionize for example crushed stones and gravel into fractions of stones with different sizes. For the fractionizing, screening media is used having screening holes, whereby stones smaller than the screening apertures will pass through the screening apertures. Stones bigger than the screening apertures will be transported on top of the screening media and feed out at the end of the vibrating screen device.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The screening media has traditionally been made in a press or formed in a mold.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Disclosed herein is screening media for use in a vibrating screen device for fractionizing crushed stones or gravel, wherein the screening media comprises an extruded element.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The screening media is made by extruding a strip which is longer than that needed for individual mats, forming apertures in the strip, preferably by punching, and then cutting the apertured strip into screening mats of appropriate widths or lengths.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The screening media is preferably made of a rubber or polymeric material. In extrusion, the screening strips are produced either longitudinally or transversally. The extruded screening media has side parts adapted to be fixed in a carrier or support of the vibrating screen.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">By making the screening media through extrusion, the manufacturing process may be faster, endless screening mats may be produced, the manufacturing costs are lowered, and the manufacturing is more flexible.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">To reinforce the screening media, fibers are integrated in the rubber or polymeric material used for the extrusion. By incorporating the integrated fibers, the strength of the screening media will increase. The fibers may be made of a polymer, such as polyester or polyamide, or any other suitable material giving a reinforcement of the screening media. In one embodiment, carbon fibers are used. The screening media is normally made of rubber or polyurethane. The material of the screening media is reusable.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">By means of the reinforcement, the screening media will be able to take a bigger load without yielding. Thereby, it is possible to decrease the thickness of the screening media. It is also possible to decrease the amount of material between the openings of the screening media, thus increasing the total open area of the screening media. These measures will increase the screening efficiency of the screening media.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">By means of the reinforcing fibers, the stability of the screening media is increased. The increased dimensional stability makes it possible to have a closer fit in the aperture-punching step.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The extrusion of the rubber or polymeric material, including reinforcing fibers, gives the same properties throughout the entire screening media. By controlling the ratio of the reinforcing fibers in the screening media, it is possible to control the properties of the extruded screening media without amending the rubber material. Thus, the same rubber or polymeric material may be used independently of the desired characteristics of the screening media.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">For maintaining the extruded screening media during storage and transportation, the extruded screening media may be rolled into coils. In time of use, screening media is rolled off from the coil and cut into suitable lengths.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Alternatively, the extruded screening media could be maintained in relatively long lengths and then cut into appropriate lengths when needed.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The screening mats, whether cut from coils or long lengths, are then installed in the vibrating screen device. Conventionally, the screening mats have been stored and transported in the form of modules which include a support structure for the screening mat. However, the only part that is worn during normal use is the screening mat. By only replacing the screening mats, rather than using the conventional modules that include a support structure, fewer parts need to be transported and discarded, which is beneficial both financially and environmentally. Furthermore, the parts replaced are of the one and same material, making recycling easier.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further objects and advantages of the present invention will be obvious to a person skilled in the art when reading the detailed description below of different embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.</p>

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>c</i>-<b>2</b><i>i </i>one general example of a screening media strip <b>4</b> is shown with different dimensions, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The shown screening media strips <b>4</b> have side parts <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, which are configured to be received in a carrier or the like of the support structure <b>2</b>, to fix the screening mats <b>3</b> to the support structure <b>2</b>.

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The exact form of the side parts <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> of the screening media strip <b>4</b> is of no importance to the present invention and may vary depending on the design of the vibrating screen device <b>1</b> and the parts receiving the side parts <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> of respective screening mat <b>3</b>. The side parts <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> are integrated parts of the screening media strip <b>4</b>, and are thus formed in the extrusion step. By using extrusion as the manufacturing method, it is relatively easy to vary the forms and dimensions of the extruded screening media.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The screening media strip can be extruded in the longitudinal direction, or in the transverse direction. After the extrusion step, the screening apertures <b>7</b> are formed in the screening media strip <b>4</b>, preferably by a punching step.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The extruded screen media strip <b>4</b> is then normally rolled into a coil <b>10</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of appropriate size, or immediately cut into relatively long lengths and maintained in that condition prior to the cutting step. If rolled into a coil, the screening media strip <b>4</b> is rolled off from the formed coil in time of use, and screening mats <b>3</b> are cut in lengths or widths appropriate for the particular vibrating screen device <b>1</b> in which the screening mats <b>3</b> are to be installed. If the screening media is instead delivered in long lengths, it is also cut to appropriate lengths at time of use.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The material from which the screening media strip <b>4</b> is extruded is preferably formed by blending or otherwise integrating fibers into a polymeric or rubber material. The fibers may be made of a polymer, such as polyester or polyamide, or they may be carbon fibers. By means of the fibers, the extruded screening media <b>4</b> is reinforced. Thereby, the screening media <b>4</b> may take a bigger load without yielding. It is possible to control the properties of the screening media <b>4</b> by controlling the amount of reinforcing fibers in the screening media.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Although preferred embodiments have been disclosed, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that additions, deletions, modifications and substitutions not specifically described may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.</p>
