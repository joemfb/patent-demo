<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Systems and methods for infusion of fluids using stored potential energy and a variable flow resistor. In one aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided an infusion device that includes a plunger situated within a vessel so as to define a chamber within which a volume of fluid can be accommodated between a downstream surface of the plunger and the vessel. The infusion device further includes an outflow path through which the fluid in the chamber can be dispensed upon displacement of the plunger by a force acting thereon. A variable flow resistor is situated within the outflow path and is configured to allow a substantially constant fluid flow rate from the vessel to be maintained as the force acting on the plunger decreases.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to systems and methods for infusing drugs, and more particularly to systems and methods for infusing drugs at a constant flow rate throughout the infusion.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Infusions remain ubiquitous in healthcare, spanning a wide range of conditions, substances, access sites and venues. Despite advances in oral and other drug delivery modes (e.g. transdermal, inhaled) many critical therapies still require intravenous (IV) infusion. It is estimated that one million infusions are administered per day in the United States. Over 90% of hospitalized patients receive an IV infusion.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Infused substances may include drugs (e.g. antibiotics, chemotherapy, pain medications, local anesthetics, vasoactive agents, biologics), fluids (e.g. crystalloids, colloids, parenteral nutrition) and blood products (e.g. red cells, plasma, platelets). These substances are typically infused as a single bolus volume (a few milliliters to several liters) over a limited time period (minutes to hours) or a continuous infusion delivered a fixed or titrated rate (typical range 0.05 ml to 5 ml per minute) over a more prolonged time period (hours to days).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Infusions may be administered through a variety of routes, most commonly intravenous but also intraarterial, subcutaneous, intrapleural, intraarticular, epidural and intrathecal. A wide variety of catheters and implantable ports are available to facilitate infusions in through these various routes.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Although infusions have traditionally been administered in hospital settings, an increasing number of patients are receiving infusions in ambulatory infusion centers and at home. Because these latter settings have fewer and less-skilled clinical personnel, only certain infusions are deemed to be safe to administer in such non-hospital settings including intravenous antibiotics, certain chemotherapeutic agents, local anesthetics for postoperative pain control and certain narcotic pain medications.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Current healthcare infusions technologies typically involve the use of gravity, active displacement electric pumps or non-electric disposable elastomeric pumps. However, there maybe certain disadvantages with these approaches. Gravity driven infusions have low capital and disposable costs but require careful monitoring by a nurse, can be inaccurate, can limit patient mobility, and have no patient safety features. Electric pumps are accurate (&#xb1;3%) and have built in safety features of debatable efficacy but can be expensive, bulky, susceptible to human factors and have limited mobility. Disposable elastomeric pumps are convenient and fairly inexpensive, but oftentimes lack patient safety features, can be very inaccurate (&#xb1;15-40%) and thus have little or no role in hospital based infusions.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The landmark 1999 Institute of Medicine report, &#x201c;To Err is Human&#x201d;, attributed 40-100,000 deaths per year in the U.S. to medical errors. Medication errors, 40% of which are serious, life-threatening or fatal, are the most common medical error and cost the health care system billions of dollars per year. Intravenous medication errors are the most common medication error and over 35% of these are related to infusion pumps. Studies have shown that despite progressively feature-laden &#x201c;smart pumps,&#x201d; human factors, software and hardware issues continue to contribute to serious errors. The FDA's MAUDE Adverse Event reporting system contain numerous examples of serious injury and death related to infusion pump errors, both electric and disposable. In the past four years over 600,000 electric infusion pumps from the two leading manufacturers have been recalled over major software and hardware problems leading patient injury and death.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The current state of healthcare infusions can thus be summarized as follows. Although hospital, ambulatory center and home infusions remain central to modern healthcare, infusion pump errors remain a major problem and contribute significantly to the large human and economic burden of medical errors. Electric infusion pumps have become expensive, high maintenance, complex technologic devices with well intentioned &#x201c;smart&#x201d; features of unclear benefit. Disposable infusion pumps have many attractive features but most are still inaccurate and may lack basic patient safety features making them inappropriate for most intravenous infusions.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided an infusion device that includes a plunger situated within a vessel so as to define a chamber within which a volume of fluid can be accommodated between a downstream surface of the plunger and the vessel. The infusion device further includes an outflow path through which the fluid in the chamber can be dispensed upon displacement of the plunger by a force acting thereon. A variable flow resistor is situated within the outflow path and being configured to vary resistance to fluid flow from the chamber, so as to maintain a substantially constant fluid flow rate from the vessel as the force acting on the plunger decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a method for delivering fluid that includes a step of providing within a chamber, defined between downstream surface of a plunger and a vessel within the plunger is situated, a volume of fluid to be delivered. Next, a force may be caused to act on the plunger to displace the plunger within the vessel, such that the fluid is dispensed from the chamber. As the fluid is dispensed, the resistance to flow maybe varied within a path through which the fluid is being dispensed from the chamber as the force on the plunger decreases, so as to maintain a substantially constant rate of dispensing.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In yet another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided an infusion device including a plunger situated within a vessel so as to define a chamber within which a volume of fluid can be accommodated between a downstream surface of the plunger and the vessel. The device may also include an outflow path through which the fluid in the chamber can be dispensed upon displacement of the plunger by a force acting thereon. A variable flow resistor may be situated downstream of the outflow path and being configured to receive the fluid from the chamber, the resistor configured to maintain a substantially constant pressure therein, so that such pressure can act to deliver the fluid from the resistor at a substantially constant rate, as the force acting on the plunger decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a further aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a method for delivering fluid that includes providing within a chamber, defined by a downstream surface of a plunger and a vessel in which the plunger is situated, a volume of fluid to be dispensed. Next, a force may be caused to act on the plunger to displace the plunger within the vessel, such that the fluid is dispensed from the chamber. Subsequently, the fluid dispensed from the chamber may be received in an environment designed to maintain a substantially constant pressure that can act to dispense the fluid from the environment. In the next step, the fluid may be dispensed from the environment while maintaining a substantially constant difference in pressure upstream and downstream of the aperture, thereby providing a constant flow rate of fluid to a patient as the force on the plunger declines.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a pressure regulator that includes an inlet cavity and a housing. A plunger may be situated within the housing to define an outflow cavity between a downstream surface of the plunger and the housing. The device also includes a channel for fluid communication between the inlet cavity and the outflow cavity, so as to maintain equilibrium of balance of forces acting on each side of the plunger. The fluid can be dispensed from the outflow cavity from an outlet in the housing.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> presents an embodiment of a device <b>10</b> of the present invention for infusion of drugs and/or fluids into a patient. The infused fluid may include a wide range of drugs, fluid feedings, biological therapies, other substances and combinations thereof. The infused fluid may be administered intravenously, enterally, intraarterially, directly into a cardiac chamber, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, through another parenteral route or into a body cavity, including, but not limited to, the peritoneal space, pleural space, pericardial space, joint space, epidural space, spinal space or cerebral ventricles.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The device <b>10</b>, in an embodiment, may include a vessel <b>11</b> with one or more chambers. Of course, the vessel <b>11</b> may be of any shape or size, as desired. The vessel <b>11</b> may be made from a durable, disposable, or recyclable material. In an embodiment, the vessel <b>11</b> may have a hard shell exterior to safely enclose the pressurized fluid, gases or other substances contained therein. For example, the vessel <b>11</b> may be made of plastic (e.g. polycarbonate, polypropylene), metal, glass or any other lightweight material to facilitate portability.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an embodiment, vessel <b>11</b> of device <b>10</b> may include a main chamber <b>12</b>. Geometrically, the main chamber <b>12</b> may be a right prism such as a cuboid, cylinder or any other three-dimensional structure with fixed cross-sectional shape across a given height. As such, the main chamber <b>12</b> may have a top wall <b>14</b>, bottom wall <b>15</b> and one or more lateral walls <b>16</b>. The lateral wall(s) <b>16</b> of the vessel <b>11</b> may, in an embodiment, extend past the top wall <b>14</b> of the main chamber <b>12</b> to form a bay <b>22</b>. The bay <b>22</b> may be provided to hold a control module, tubing, connectors, adaptors and other accessories to enhance the functionality of the infusion device <b>10</b>. In addition, by extending the lateral wall <b>16</b> to match the height of outflow path <b>13</b>, the device <b>10</b> may assume a substantial practical, ergonomic shape.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As noted, vessel <b>11</b> of device <b>10</b> may include an outflow path <b>13</b> in fluid communication with the chamber <b>12</b>. In an embodiment, the outflow path <b>13</b> may be situated along an edge of the vessel <b>11</b>. Outflow path <b>13</b> may be provided with a width substantially narrower than width of the main chamber <b>12</b>. The outflow path <b>13</b> may, in an embodiment, project for a distance beyond the top wall <b>14</b> of the main chamber <b>12</b>. Although illustrated as part of vessel <b>11</b>, it should be noted that the outflow path <b>13</b> may be spaced away from the main chamber <b>12</b> and be fluidly connected to the main chamber <b>12</b> by, for example, a tube.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2E</figref>, the cross section of the main chamber <b>12</b>, as noted, may be of any shape including, but not limited to rectangular, circular, ellipsoid or other more complex shape. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B-2E</figref> show a cross section of several embodiments of the vessel with differing shapes for the main chamber <b>12</b> at the level of the dotted line A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. By the way of a non-limiting example, the vessel <b>11</b> may be provided with a rectangular shape (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>), circular shape (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>), or curved, elongated rectangular shape (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>), or the vessel <b>11</b> may bullet shaped (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>). In certain embodiments, the depth of the outflow path <b>13</b> can be less than the depth of the main chamber <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 2C</figref>, or equal to the depth of the main chamber <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>d </i>and <b>2</b>E.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Now with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref>, in an embodiment of the device <b>10</b> of the present disclosure, a plunger system <b>23</b> may reside within the vessel <b>11</b>. The plunger system <b>23</b> may partition the chamber <b>12</b> into a fluid chamber <b>26</b> for storing a volume of fluid and a pressure chamber <b>27</b> for housing a mechanism for displacing the plunger system <b>23</b> within the vessel <b>11</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows the plunger system <b>23</b> at a point in the main chamber <b>12</b> where the plunger system <b>23</b> may be positioned when the fluid chamber <b>26</b> is substantially full. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows the plunger system <b>23</b> at a point in the main chamber <b>12</b> where the plunger system <b>23</b> may be positioned when the fluid chamber <b>26</b> is partially empty. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> shows the plunger system <b>23</b> at a point in the main chamber <b>12</b> where the plunger system <b>23</b> may be positioned when the fluid chamber <b>26</b> is substantially empty.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The plunger system <b>23</b>, in an embodiment, may include a main plunger <b>24</b>. The main plunger <b>24</b> may reside within the main chamber <b>12</b> and serve as a movable wall, similar to a plunger in a standard syringe. The plunger <b>23</b> defines the fluid chamber between its downstream surface and the vessel. The main plunger <b>24</b> may move axially within the main chamber <b>12</b>, changing the relative volumes of the fluid chamber <b>26</b> and the pressure chamber <b>27</b> respectively. In addition, as it moves within the main chamber <b>12</b>, the main plunger <b>24</b> may provide a substantially tight seal with the walls of the main chamber <b>12</b> to prevent leakage of gas or fluid between the fluid chamber <b>26</b> and the pressure chamber <b>27</b>. To that end, the main plunger <b>24</b> may be of an appropriate shape and structure to allow the main plunger <b>23</b> to provide such a seal, while being able to slide freely within the main chamber <b>12</b>. In an embodiment, the main plunger <b>24</b> may form a substantially snug fit with the main chamber <b>12</b> of the vessel <b>11</b> to provide coefficient of friction between the main plunger <b>24</b> and the walls of the main chamber <b>12</b> that may be sufficiently low to so as to permit the main plunger <b>24</b> to move it within the main chamber <b>12</b>. In an embodiment, the main plunger <b>24</b> may be made of a pliable material such as silicone, latex or other rubber material. In another embodiment, main plunger <b>24</b> may be made of a rigid material such as plastic or metal with an outer gasket made of a pliable material such as rubber or silicone. In an embodiment, the main plunger <b>24</b> may include a gasket to further facilitate isolating the fluid chamber <b>26</b> and the pressure chamber <b>27</b> from one another. The gasket may be sufficiently lubricated to allow the main plunger <b>24</b> to move freely within the main chamber <b>12</b>. The main chamber <b>12</b> may, in an embodiment, include one or more guide mechanisms to stabilize the main plunger <b>24</b>, as the main plunger traverses the main chamber <b>12</b>. Such a guide, in one embodiment, can be a post through the center of the main chamber <b>12</b> or ridges and/or grooves in the inner aspect of the lateral wall(s) of the main chamber <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">To displace the main plunger <b>24</b>, the pressure chamber <b>27</b> may, in an embodiment, house a driving mechanism configured to store potential energy and to release potential energy to displace the plunger system <b>23</b> within the vessel <b>11</b>. Such driving mechanism by its nature may store sufficient amount of the potential energy to displace the main plunger <b>24</b> sufficiently to infuse the fluid into the patient without the need for any outside power source, pump or gravity. The potential energy, in one embodiment, may impart a force on the main plunger <b>24</b> sufficient to administer the fluid from the fluid chamber <b>26</b> through the outflow path <b>13</b> to the patient at a desired flow rate. To provide the driving mechanism with sufficient potential energy, the fluid chamber <b>26</b> can be filled with fluid to expand the fluid chamber <b>26</b> and drive the main plunger <b>24</b> towards the pressure chamber <b>27</b>. In that way, the driving mechanism may be compressed, causing the driving mechanism to store the necessary potential energy that can be released for the subsequent infusion.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The driving mechanism may, in an embodiment, be in the form of a compressible gas <b>28</b>, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. To withstand the force which compressed gas <b>28</b> imparts on its walls, the vessel <b>11</b> may, in an embodiment, be made of a sufficiently strong material such as plastic or metal. In addition, the seals between the plunger system <b>22</b> and the inner walls of the vessel <b>11</b> need to be sufficiently tight enough so that the compressed gas <b>28</b> may remain within the pressure chamber <b>27</b> and not leak into the fluid chamber <b>26</b> or the outflow path <b>13</b>. In an embodiment, the gas <b>28</b> can be any medical grade, non-flammable gas including but not limited to air, carbon dioxide, nitrogen or helium. Additionally, the gas <b>28</b> may be capable of being sufficiently compressed so that, when allowed to expand, the gas <b>28</b> can generate adequate force on the plunger system <b>23</b> to drive it into fluid chamber <b>26</b> to infuse the fluid in the fluid chamber <b>26</b> into the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The amount of gas <b>28</b> sufficient to achieve the desired initial driving pressure on the main plunger <b>24</b> can be determined using Boyle's Law, assuming that the gas <b>28</b> is operating as an ideal gas:</p>

Where m<sub>g </sub>is the mass of the gas <b>28</b> in the gas vessel <b>29</b>, P<sub>0 </sub>is the initial vessel pressure, V<sub>0 </sub>is the initial volume in the fluid chamber <b>26</b> to be infused, MWg is the molecular weight of the gas <b>28</b>, R is the ideal gas constant, CR is the compression ratio of the gas <b>28</b> at the beginning of infusion and T is the absolute temperature.
</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the gas <b>28</b> can simply fill the space within pressure chamber <b>27</b>. In another embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the gas <b>28</b> may reside within an impermeable, elastic gas vessel <b>29</b> disposed within the pressure chamber <b>27</b>. Having the gas <b>28</b> situated within such fully enclosed gas vessel <b>29</b> may allow the gas <b>28</b> to expand and contract, without the risk of leakage of the gas <b>28</b> outside the vessel <b>11</b> or into the fluid chamber <b>26</b>. This may permit higher pressures to be generated within the pressure chamber <b>27</b>. It may also facilitate manufacture and assembly of the devices of the present disclosure. In an embodiment, the gas vessel <b>29</b> can be filled and sealed at atmospheric pressure and then squeezed into the vessel <b>11</b> with an external mechanical force, thus eliminating the need for a high pressure gas port on the vessel <b>11</b>. In an embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, the gas vessel <b>29</b> can be bound to the plunger system <b>23</b> on top of the main plunger <b>24</b>, so the combined entity can later be placed into the vessel <b>11</b> as a single piece.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, in its neutral state (i.e. non-compressed), with the outside the vessel <b>11</b> at atmospheric pressure, the gas vessel <b>29</b> may be provided with a shape that roughly matches that of the main chamber <b>12</b>, namely a top wall <b>30</b>, a bottom wall <b>31</b> and one or more lateral walls <b>32</b>. In this neutral state, the height of the gas vessel <b>29</b> may be greater than that of main chamber <b>12</b> because the gas vessel <b>29</b> may remain pressurized throughout the duration of the infusion. In an embodiment, the cross-sectional shape of the gas vessel <b>29</b> may be the same as the main chamber <b>12</b>, but with a slightly smaller area to allow is to expand freely within the main chamber <b>12</b>. The gas vessel <b>29</b> can be made from a non-compliant, non-permeable, flexible material such as plastic (polyurethane, polypropylene, PTFE, PBAX, etc.) with an accordion or bellows-like structure which limits expansion and contraction to the axial dimension of the vessel. The top wall <b>30</b> and bottom wall <b>31</b> can be reinforced with a rigid material such as plastic, glass or metal to further force the expansion and contraction of the vessel to a single, axial dimension. Although similar functionality can be achieved using an elastic or semi-elastic material for the gas vessel <b>29</b>, the tendency for the lateral wall(s) <b>32</b> to expand outward makes manufacture and assembly more cumbersome.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In another embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>, pressure chamber <b>27</b> can store its potential energy in a mechanical device, such as one or more springs <b>33</b> situated between the top wall <b>15</b> of the main chamber <b>12</b> and the main plunger. One or more springs may be used to provide a desired force to drive the plunger system <b>23</b> and the selection of which may be in accordance with Hooke's law.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In an embodiment, the pressure chamber <b>27</b> may include one or more vents in communication with the atmosphere to provide an inlet for air as the pressure chamber <b>27</b> expands. Venting the pressure chamber <b>27</b> may prevent a vacuum from being generated in the pressure chamber <b>27</b>, the presence of which may hinder the expansion of the pressure chamber <b>27</b>. Venting the pressure chamber <b>27</b> may also help to avoid overheating of the mechanism for driving the plunger system <b>23</b>. Venting may further assist in removing any air trapped between the gas vessel <b>29</b> and the inner walls of the main chamber <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5D</figref>, in an embodiment, the device of the present disclosure may include one or more inlet ports <b>34</b>, outlet port <b>35</b>, integrated tubing <b>36</b>, terminal connector <b>37</b> and adapters <b>38</b>. These ports may include caps to seal the opening when necessary, or valves to permit fluid or gas to move in the proscribed direction. The inlet ports <b>34</b>, outlet ports <b>34</b>, terminal connector <b>37</b> and adapters <b>38</b> may possess specific connector mechanisms such as luer-lock, screw-on, bayonet or other &#x201c;quick connect&#x201d; style mechanisms to aid in the operation of the device <b>10</b> and/or the dispensing of the infusion fluid <b>40</b>. For instance, the inlet ports <b>34</b> may be used to fill the fluid chamber <b>26</b> or fill the gas vessel <b>29</b>. The outlet port <b>35</b> may allow the fluid and air to leave the vessel during deairing and fluid to leave during the infusion. The integrated tubing <b>36</b> may be of an appropriate length to reach the patient and in its preferred embodiment is coiled so that it more ergonomic. The terminal connector <b>37</b> may connect the device to a patient's catheter <b>39</b> or port, either directly, or using a matching adapter <b>38</b> previously connected to the catheter or port.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, in an embodiment, the fully assembled and charged, but empty infusion device <b>10</b> is shown ready to be filled. Vessel <b>11</b> is shown with a partially charged pressure chamber <b>27</b> containing the gas vessel <b>29</b> with the gas <b>28</b>. The gas <b>28</b> is fully expanded in the main chamber <b>12</b>, such that the volume of the fluid chamber <b>26</b> is substantially zero. As shown, the outflow path <b>13</b> and integrated tubing <b>36</b> may be full of air and the terminal connector <b>37</b> is not yet attached to the catheter <b>39</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows the same device filled with infusion fluid <b>40</b> and de-aired, ready to begin the infusion. In particular, vessel <b>11</b> is shown with the gas <b>8</b> in the pressure chamber <b>27</b> compressed. The fluid chamber <b>26</b>, outflow path <b>13</b> and integrated tubing <b>36</b>, on the other hand, are shown substantially full of fluid and devoid of air. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the main plunger <b>24</b> is at its highest position, abutting the edge of the inner wall <b>20</b>. This position of the main plunger <b>24</b> corresponds with a maximum volume of the fluid chamber <b>26</b>, a minimum volume of the pressure chamber <b>27</b> and a maximum pressure in all chambers. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5C and 5D</figref> show the device after 50% and 100% of the infusion of the infusion fluid <b>40</b> has been completed.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As the infusion fluid <b>40</b> is dispensed from the fluid chamber <b>26</b> by the displacement of the main plunger <b>24</b>, the infusion fluid may enter the outflow path <b>13</b>. In an embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref> and <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>D, the outflow path <b>13</b> may be formed between walls <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b </i>of the vessel <b>11</b>. An outflow septum <b>17</b> may be disposed within the outflow path <b>13</b>. In an embodiment, the outflow septum <b>17</b> may be fully integrated into the structure of the vessel <b>11</b>. In an embodiment, the outflow septum <b>17</b> can be manufactured separate from the vessel and inserted into a slotted channel in the vessel during assembly. This may permit a given size vessel to be married to one of several outflow septa <b>17</b>, each with its own resistance properties, to achieve the desired flow rate for that particular infusion device.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The outflow path <b>13</b> may be divided by an outflow septum <b>17</b> into two parallel outflow channels: an outer outflow channel <b>18</b> and inner outflow channel <b>19</b>. The outflow channel <b>18</b> may be defined by the space between the outflow septum <b>17</b> and the wall <b>20</b><i>a</i>. The outflow septum <b>17</b> can extend from the distal tip of the outflow path <b>13</b> down towards, but just short of the bottom wall <b>15</b> of the vessel <b>11</b>, providing a flow path from the main chamber <b>12</b> into the outer outflow channel <b>18</b>. Outer outflow channel <b>18</b> may terminate at the distal tip of the outflow path <b>13</b> as a dead end. The inner outflow channel <b>19</b> may be defined by the space between the outflow septum <b>17</b> and the wall <b>20</b><i>b</i>. The wall <b>20</b><i>b </i>may extend for a distance into the main chamber <b>12</b> from its top wall <b>14</b>, forming a portion of the wall of the inner outflow channel <b>19</b>. Inner outflow channel <b>19</b> may terminate at the distal tip of the outflow path <b>13</b> at an outflow orifice <b>21</b>. A section of the outflow septum <b>17</b> may be permeable, permitting flow from the outer outflow channel <b>18</b> into the inner outflow channel <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The infusion device <b>10</b> may further include, in an embodiment, a plunger extension <b>25</b>. The plunger extension <b>25</b> may be a reed-like projection that extends orthogonally from one edge of the main plunger <b>24</b>. As with the main plunger <b>24</b>, the plunger extension <b>25</b> may be made wholly of a pliable material such as rubber or silicone or of a rigid material such as plastic or metal with an outer layer of rubber or silicone to form a gasket. The plunger extension <b>25</b> may reside within the inner outflow channel <b>19</b> of the outflow path <b>13</b> and may form a tight seal within inner outflow channel <b>19</b> to prevent leakage of fluid or gas into the fluid chamber <b>26</b> or pressure chamber <b>27</b>. The length of the plunger extension <b>25</b> may be such that when the fluid chamber <b>26</b> is empty and the main plunger <b>24</b> is up against the bottom wall <b>15</b> of the main chamber, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the plunger extension <b>25</b> may remain engaged within the inner outflow channel <b>19</b>, with enough overlap to maintain a seal. When the fluid chamber <b>26</b> is filled with fluid, the plunger extension <b>25</b> may extend high up into the inner outflow channel <b>19</b>. In an embodiment, the plunger extension <b>25</b> may be short of the end of the channel so it does not occlude the outflow orifice <b>21</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. The inner wall <b>20</b> of the main chamber <b>12</b> may be sized such that the plunger system is prevented from rising up to occlude the outflow orifice <b>21</b>. As the main plunger <b>24</b> moves towards the bottom wall <b>15</b> of the main chamber <b>12</b>, it may pull the plunger extension <b>25</b> along with it. As the plunger extension <b>25</b> moves proximally within the inner outflow channel <b>19</b>, it may increase the height of the outflow channel <b>19</b>. The plunger extension <b>25</b> may also slide along the outflow septum <b>17</b>, increasing the area of the septum which communicates with both the inner and outer outflow channels <b>18</b> and <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In an embodiment, the infusion device <b>10</b> of the present invention may include a variable flow resistor disposed within the outflow path <b>13</b>. The variable flow resistor may assist in maintaining a constant flow rate during the infusion with a high degree of accuracy. Conventional disposable infusion pumps typically attempt to deliver a given flow rate by incorporating a fixed flow resistor in the infusion circuit, typically a segment of narrow caliber tubing interposed between the pump and the patient. The driving force for these pumps, typically provided by a recoil of an elastomeric membrane or spring, however, is not constant, but may vary throughout the duration of the infusion and may decline toward the end of the infusion. Since the resistance to flow is constant, the flow rate from such pumps may vary as the driving force varies. For instance, it has been shown that instantaneous flow rate deviations in some disposable infusion pumps as high as &#xb1;40%. By providing a variable flow resistor in the outflow path <b>13</b>, the infusion fluid may be infused into the patient at substantially constant flow rate for the duration of the infusion, even as the driving force varies:</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6D</figref>, in an embodiment, a variable flow resistor <b>60</b> of the device of the present disclosure may be formed by the interaction of the permeable portion of the outflow septum <b>17</b> and the plunger extension <b>25</b>. In an embodiment, outflow septum <b>17</b> may have a permeable portion defined by permeable area <b>41</b> and permeable area <b>42</b>. By providing the septum <b>17</b> with such a permeable area, as the plunger extension slides along the outflow septum <b>17</b> away from the outflow orifice <b>21</b>, an increasing portion of the permeable section of the outflow septum <b>17</b> may be exposed, allowing the flow between the inner outflow channels <b>18</b> and the outer outflow channel <b>19</b> to occur at a higher rate to accommodate any decrease in the force exerted by the plunger on the fluid in the fluid chamber <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The permeable section of the outflow septum <b>17</b> may, in an embodiment, be divided into two areas: the initial permeable area <b>41</b> and the adjustable permeable area <b>42</b>. At the beginning of the infusion, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the plunger extension <b>25</b> may be at its highest point. To that end, the plunger extension <b>25</b> may substantially cover the adjustable permeable area <b>42</b>, when the plunger extension <b>25</b> may be at its highest point. The initial flow may proceed through the initial permeable area <b>41</b> which is situated on the outflow septum <b>17</b> distal to the highest point of the plunger extension <b>25</b>, directly opposite the outflow orifice <b>21</b>. Permeable area <b>41</b> can be made of the same material and can be contiguous with the adjustable permeable area <b>42</b>, as shown. Alternatively, the initial permeable area can be separate and made of a different material. The resistance to flow of this initial permeable area <b>41</b> can determine the initial flow rate.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As the infusion proceeds, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the plunger extension <b>25</b> may move away from the outlet <b>26</b> within the inner outflow channel <b>19</b>, exposing an increasing portion of the adjustable permeable area <b>42</b>. According to Darcy's law, which governs the flow of fluid through a homogeneous permeable material, the resistance to flow of the adjustable permeable area <b>42</b> is inversely proportional to the exposed area. As such, when the force on the infusion fluid in the fluid chamber <b>26</b> declines as the infusion progresses, an increased permeable area is needed to lower resistance in order to be able to maintain a substantially constant flow rate of the infusion fluid from the infusion device. When the infusion is substantially completed, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, the plunger extension <b>25</b> may be at its lowest point on the outflow septum <b>17</b>, all of the adjustable permeable area <b>42</b> may be exposed and the resistance to flow may be at a minimum.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The outflow septum <b>17</b> may be made of a rigid impermeable material, similar to the vessel <b>11</b> such as plastic or metal. In an embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>, the permeable areas <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> can include a permeable material of a given shape, embedded in a cut-out in the wall of the outflow septum <b>17</b>. The material can be any porous material <b>43</b> such as plastic, metal, ceramic or fiber with an appropriate permeability index to achieve the desired resistance to flow for a given embodiment of the device. In another embodiment, the permeable areas <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> can be created by creating a pattern of pores through the outflow septum <b>17</b>. The initial permeable area <b>41</b>, can in fact be a single pore of the appropriate diameter to provide the appropriate initial resistance to flow. The adjustable permeable area <b>42</b>, can have a grid <b>44</b> of micropores of a fixed or variable size spread over a given area at a given density. The density of micropores can be fixed or variable. In another embodiment, the permeable areas <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> can be created by starting with an outflow septum <b>17</b> made entirely from the porous material <b>43</b> or <b>44</b> and applying an impermeable mask with a cutout of the shapes of the permeable areas <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> to each side of the outflow septum.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The variable flow resistor <b>60</b> may track the decline in the force acting on the plunger system <b>23</b> as the infusion progresses and may enable a decrease in the resistance to flow of the infusion flow in the outflow path <b>13</b> to maintain a constant flow. The variable flow resistor may do that by increasing the height of the exposed portion of the adjustable permeable area <b>42</b> of the variable flow resistor <b>28</b>, thereby decreasing the resistance in a predictable fashion. The relationship between the resistance and the exposed height can be derived from the two laws governing the gas and fluid in the device&#x2014;Boyle's Law and Pouseille's Law. Once this relationship is determined, the shape of the permeable areas <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> can be determined using Darcy's Law to establish the relationship between the width and height of the area as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Boyle's Law governs the relationship between the pressure and volume of the gas <b>28</b> in the pressure chamber <b>27</b>. Gas <b>28</b> may be assumed to be an ideal gas and according to Boyle's law, the product of the pressure and volume of the gas is a constant. Since the fluid is assumed to be non-compressible, the pressure of the gas may be the same as the pressure of the entire vessel under static conditions. Assuming laminar flow, Pouseille's Law governs the relationship between the driving pressure on the fluid, the flow resistance and the flow rate. At a constant flow rate, the ratio of the pressure and resistance to flow may be constant.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Using these two laws, the relationship between the exposed height, h, of the adjustable permeable area <b>42</b> of the variable flow resistor and the total resistance R along can be determined to be</p>

In a number of simulations of the device using up to 10,000 iterations across a wide variety of initial conditions, the above function generates a declining resistance which results in a constant flow within a tolerance of &#x3c;0.001%. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> shows the shape of the permeable area <b>42</b> derived from the above shape function using a set of initial conditions shown.
</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In an embodiment in which the pressure chamber <b>27</b> uses a spring instead of gas, similar resistance and shape functions can be derived. In this case, Hooke's Law governs the property of the spring which is assumed to functioning within its linear range where the force is proportional to spring displacement. As a result, the resistance function is linear</p>

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In another embodiment a mechanical variable flow resistor, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8C</figref>, is provided in the outflow path <b>13</b>. In such an embodiment, the outflow path may be a simple path, unlike the embodiment of the outflow path <b>13</b> described above in connection with the passive variable flow resistor <b>60</b>. To maintain a constant flow rate of the infusion fluid <b>40</b> to the patient, the mechanical variable flow resistor may, in an embodiment, provide an intermediate chamber in the outflow path <b>13</b> into which the infusion fluid <b>40</b> may be transferred from the fluid chamber <b>26</b>.] The mechanical flow resistor of the present invention may maintain a desired difference in pressure in the intermediate chamber and at the point of infusion to enable infusion of the infusion fluid <b>40</b> into the patient at a constant flow rate throughout the duration of the infusion. The mechanical flow resistor of the present invention may be provided with a feedback loop and a mechanism that allows to correct for fluctuations in pressure in the intermediate cavity and pressure at the point of infusion, such that the desired difference in pressure is maintained throughout the duration of infusion. Because the infusion fluid <b>40</b> is dispensed from the intermediate cavity through a constant aperture, the infusion fluid <b>40</b> may thus be administered to the patient at a constant flow rate throughout the duration of the infusion, even as the force on the plunger system <b>23</b> decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8C</figref>, an embodiment of a mechanical variable flow resistor <b>80</b> is shown. The resistor <b>80</b> may include an inlet cavity <b>81</b> in fluid communication with the fluid chamber <b>26</b> of device <b>10</b> to allow the infusion fluid <b>40</b> to be transferred from the fluid chamber <b>26</b> to the inlet cavity <b>81</b>. The infusion fluid <b>40</b>, in an embodiment, may be stored in the inlet cavity <b>81</b> at a pressure corresponding to the pressure exerted on the infusion fluid <b>40</b> by the main plunger <b>24</b>, less pressure drop in the transfer of the infusion fluid <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The mechanical variable flow resistor <b>80</b> may further include a housing <b>87</b>. The housing <b>87</b> may include a plunger <b>89</b> slidably disposed therein to partition the housing <b>89</b> into two compartments: an outflow cavity <b>91</b> and a drive cavity <b>92</b>. The outflow cavity <b>91</b> may be configured to receive the infusion fluid <b>40</b> from the inlet cavity <b>81</b>. The drive cavity <b>92</b>, on the other hand, may be configured to accommodate a driving mechanism <b>86</b>. Mechanism <b>86</b> may be a spring or compressed gas. capable of storing and releasing potential energy, such a spring or a compressed gas, for displacing the plunger <b>89</b> within the housing <b>87</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The housing <b>87</b> may, in an embodiment, be positioned in line with the inlet cavity <b>81</b>, such that a wall <b>111</b> of the inlet cavity <b>81</b> is adjacent to a wall <b>113</b> of the outflow cavity <b>91</b>. To that end, the outflow cavity <b>91</b> may serve as an intermediate chamber into which the infusion fluid may be transferred from the inlet cavity <b>81</b>. In an embodiment, the infusion fluid <b>40</b> may be transferred between the inlet cavity <b>81</b> and the outflow cavity <b>91</b> through a cannula <b>97</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In an embodiment, the cannula <b>97</b> may have sealed proximal and distal ends <b>101</b> and <b>103</b> and a plurality of perforations in a side wall, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>. In an embodiment, the plurality of perforations may be grouped into inlet perforations <b>105</b> and outlet perforations <b>107</b>, with inlet perforations <b>105</b> spaced apart from the outlet perforations <b>107</b>. In an embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9B-9C</figref>, a permeable insert <b>98</b> may be inserted into the cannula <b>97</b>. The permeable insert <b>98</b> may be aligned with the inlet perforations <b>105</b>, the outlet perforations <b>107</b>, or both, to provide a resistance to flow through the cannula <b>97</b> in order to regulate pressure drop across the cannula <b>97</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, when the cannula is positioned between the inlet cavity <b>81</b> and the outflow cavity <b>91</b>, at least some of the inlet perforations <b>105</b> may be exposed in the inlet cavity <b>81</b>, while at least some of the outlet perforations <b>107</b> may be exposed in the outflow cavity <b>91</b>, thereby allowing the infusion fluid <b>40</b> to flow from the inlet cavity <b>81</b> into the outflow cavity <b>91</b>. In an embodiment, the infusion fluid <b>40</b> may not flow through perforations covered by the septum <b>93</b>. In an embodiment, the infusion fluid <b>40</b> may enter the cannula <b>97</b> from the inlet cavity <b>81</b> through the inlet perforations <b>105</b> and exit the cannula <b>97</b> into the outflow cavity <b>91</b> through the outlet perforations <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">To control or maintain a substantially constant flow rate, the cannula <b>97</b> may be coupled to the plunger <b>89</b>, such that, the plunger <b>89</b> may move the cannula <b>97</b> between the housing <b>87</b> and the inlet cavity <b>81</b> to change the flow rate of the infusion fluid <b>40</b> into the outflow cavity <b>91</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, moving the cannula <b>97</b> into the inlet cavity <b>81</b> may expose additional inlet perforations <b>107</b>, thus allowing the flow rate of the infusion fluid <b>40</b> from the inlet cavity <b>81</b> into the outflow cavity <b>91</b> to increase. On the other hand, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, moving the cannula <b>97</b> out of the inlet cavity <b>81</b> may permit the septum <b>93</b> to cover additional inlet perforations <b>105</b>, thus causing the flow rate of the infusion fluid <b>40</b> from the inlet cavity <b>81</b> into the outflow cavity <b>91</b> to decrease.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">To ensure that the fluid that the infusion fluid <b>40</b> may be transferred between the inlet cavity <b>81</b> and the outflow cavity <b>91</b> only through the cannula <b>9</b>, in an embodiment, a septum <b>93</b> may be provided between the inlet cavity <b>81</b> and the outflow cavity <b>91</b>. The septum <b>93</b> may fluid-tight. The cannula <b>97</b> may slide through the septum <b>93</b>, such the septum <b>93</b> may cover some inlet peroration and block flow of the infusion fluid <b>40</b> through the covered perforations.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">From the outflow cavity <b>91</b>, the infusion fluid <b>40</b> may be dispensed to the patient through a tubing <b>109</b>, having a valve <b>117</b>. In an embodiment, the infusion fluid <b>40</b> may flow through a first tube <b>110</b>, through the valve <b>117</b>, and through a second tube <b>112</b> to a t-connector <b>114</b>. From the t-connector <b>114</b>, the infusion fluid <b>40</b> may flow through a third tube <b>116</b> into the integrated tubing <b>36</b>, which is connected to the patient. In an embodiment, the fourth tube <b>118</b> may connect the drive cavity <b>92</b> to the integrated through the third tube <b>116</b>, such that the pressure at the point of infusion of the infusion fluid <b>40</b> into a patient may provide backpressure against the plunger <b>89</b>, as is described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In an embodiment, the valve <b>117</b> may allow the infusion fluid <b>40</b> to be dispensed through a constant, pre-determined aperture. According to Pouseille's law, a constant flow rate may be generated by a constant pressure difference over a constant aperture as follows: Q=kA(P<sub>d</sub>&#x2212;P<sub>u</sub>), where Q is flow rate of the infusion fluid <b>40</b> into the patient, k is dynamic viscosity of the infusion fluid <b>40</b>, A is the diameter of aperture of the valve <b>117</b> through which the infusion fluid <b>40</b> is dispensed, P<sub>d </sub>is the pressure downstream of the aperture, and P<sub>u </sub>is the pressure upstream of the aperture. That is, the flow rate of the infusion fluid <b>40</b> to the patient may be proportional to the difference between the pressure downstream of the valve <b>117</b> and the pressure upstream of the valve <b>117</b>. Once a desired flow rate of the infusion fluid <b>40</b> is selected, depending on the particulars of a procedure, the difference between the pressure downstream of the valve <b>117</b> and the pressure upstream of the valve <b>117</b> needed to maintain the desired flow rate may be determined in accordance with Pouseille's law.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The pressures downstream and upstream of the inlet valve <b>117</b> may be determined from the pressure in the outflow chamber <b>91</b> and the pressure at the point of infusion, respectively, with accounting for pressure drop. In an embodiment, the pressure downstream of the inlet valve <b>117</b> may be substantially equal to the pressure in the outflow chamber <b>91</b>, P<sub>1</sub>, while the pressure upstream of the flow valve <b>117</b> may be substantially equal to the backpressure acting on the fluid being administered to the patient, which is referred to herein as the patient pressure, P<sub>2</sub>. The pressure, P<sub>1</sub>, in the outflow chamber <b>91</b> may be dependent on the pressure to the pressure of the infusion fluid <b>40</b> in the fluid chamber <b>26</b> and design of the cannula <b>97</b>. In reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the pressure in the inlet chamber, P<sub>0</sub>, may correspond to the pressure of the infusion fluid <b>40</b> in the fluid chamber <b>26</b>, with a discount for any pressure drop between the fluid chamber <b>26</b> and the inlet cavity <b>81</b>. Moreover, the pressure drop over perforations in the cannula <b>97</b> may be calculated from the following Darcy-Weisbach equation and the Moody Diagram presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>:</p>

Since R, P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2 </sub>may be estimated or known, a suitable mechanism <b>86</b> that may maintain the plunger <b>89</b> in the equilibrium position at a desired difference between P<sub>1 </sub>and P<sub>2 </sub>may be selected, or vise versa.
</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In an embodiment, a suitable mechanism <b>86</b> may include a spring which can act on the plunger <b>89</b> as needed to maintain the plunger <b>89</b> in the equilibrium position. The force exerted on the plunger by the spring may be calculated according to Hooke's Law, as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>F</i><sub>spring=k*(D+x) </sub><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where F<sub>spring </sub>is force that the spring may exert on the plunger, k is the spring constant, D is the amount the spring has been pre-compressed, and x is the amount the plunger may move to hold the plunger in the equilibrium position. In an embodiment, the spring is pre-compressed, such that small motions of the spring, such as when the difference between P<sub>1 </sub>and P<sub>2 </sub>changes, do not change the spring force.
</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">During the infusion, when a desired difference between P<sub>1 </sub>and P<sub>2 </sub>is maintained, the mechanism <b>86</b> may hold the plunger <b>89</b> substantially stationary in the equilibrium position. If, however, the difference between P<sub>1 </sub>and P<sub>2 </sub>decreases, such as, for example, due to the decrease in the force acting on the main plunger <b>25</b>, the plunger <b>89</b> and the cannula <b>97</b> may be forced to move from the equilibrium position to the left, i.e., in the direction to expand the drive cavity <b>92</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>. Such displacement of the cannula <b>97</b> may cause additional inlet perforations <b>105</b> to be exposed in the inlet fluid cavity <b>81</b>, thereby allowing the flow rate of the infusion fluid <b>40</b> from the inlet cavity <b>81</b> into the outflow cavity <b>91</b> to increase. The increased flow rate into the outflow cavity <b>91</b> may allow P<sub>1 </sub>to increase, so as to move the plunger <b>89</b> back to the equilibrium position. On the other hand, if the difference between P<sub>1 </sub>and P<sub>2 </sub>increases, such as, for example, due to the decrease in the patient pressure, the plunger <b>89</b> and the cannula <b>97</b> may be forced to move from the equilibrium position to the right, i.e., in the direction to compress the drive cavity <b>92</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>. Such displacement of the cannula <b>97</b> may cause additional inlet perforations <b>105</b> to be blocked by the septum <b>93</b>, thereby causing the flow rate of the infusion fluid <b>40</b> from the inlet cavity <b>81</b> into the outflow cavity <b>91</b> to decrease. The decreased flow rate into the outflow cavity <b>91</b> may cause P<sub>1 </sub>to decrease so as to allow the plunger <b>89</b> to move back to the equilibrium position. In this manner, the mechanical variable flow resistor <b>80</b> of the present disclosure may maintain a substantially constant difference between the pressure in the outflow cavity <b>91</b> and the patient pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Another embodiment of a mechanical variable flow resistor of the present disclosure is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A-11C</figref>. In an embodiment, as illustrated <b>11</b>A, the mechanical variable flow resistor <b>1100</b> may include an inlet chamber <b>1101</b> in fluid connection with the fluid chamber <b>26</b>, so as to allow the infusion fluid <b>40</b> to be transferred from the fluid chamber <b>26</b> to the inlet cavity <b>1101</b>. The infusion fluid <b>40</b> may be pressurized in the inlet cavity <b>1101</b> to a pressure corresponding to the pressure exerted on the infusion fluid <b>40</b> by the main plunger <b>24</b>, less pressure drop due to the transfer of the infusion fluid <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The mechanical variable flow resistor <b>1100</b> may further include a housing <b>1103</b>. The housing <b>1103</b> may be in fluid communication with the inlet cavity <b>1101</b> through an inlet opening <b>1105</b> in a top wall <b>1106</b> of the housing <b>1103</b> and with a tubing <b>1109</b> through an outlet opening <b>1111</b> in a bottom wall <b>1110</b> of the housing <b>1103</b>.

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In an embodiment, the plunger <b>1107</b> may be H-shaped, with a first side <b>1112</b> and a second side <b>1113</b> connected to the first side <b>1112</b> by a bridge <b>1115</b>. The plunger <b>1107</b> may define an outflow cavity <b>1117</b> between the first side <b>1112</b> and the second side <b>1113</b>. The bridge <b>1115</b> may partition the outflow cavity <b>1117</b> into a first void <b>1119</b> and a second void <b>1121</b>.

<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As noted above, a pressure acting on the infusion fluid <b>40</b> may cause the infusion fluid to flow from the inlet cavity <b>1103</b> into the first void <b>1117</b>. The infusion fluid <b>40</b> may then flow through the channel <b>1123</b> into the second void <b>1119</b> and out of the second void <b>1123</b> into the tubing <b>1109</b>. In an embodiment, the infusion fluid <b>40</b> may then flow through a first tube <b>1125</b>, through a valve <b>1127</b>, and through a second tube <b>1129</b> to a t-connector <b>1131</b>. From the t-connector <b>1131</b>, the infusion fluid <b>40</b> may flow through a third tube <b>1133</b> into the integrated tubing <b>36</b>. Similarly to the valve <b>117</b> described above, the valve <b>1127</b> may allow the infusion fluid <b>40</b> to be dispensed through a constant, pre-determined aperture. In an embodiment, because the infusion fluid <b>40</b> is dispensed to the patient through a constant aperture of the valve <b>1127</b>, maintaining a substantially constant difference between the pressure downstream of the valve <b>1127</b>, P<sub>1</sub>, and the pressure upstream of the valve <b>1127</b>, P<sub>2</sub>, for the duration of the infusion may allow the infusion fluid <b>40</b> to be infused at a substantially constant flow rate for the duration of the infusion.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">When a desired difference in pressure, P<sub>1</sub>-P<sub>2</sub>, can be maintained, the plunger <b>1107</b> may be held stationary in an equilibrium position. The equilibrium position may, in an embodiment, refer to a position of the plunger <b>1107</b> in which the first side <b>1111</b> blocks a portion of the inlet opening <b>1105</b>. When the difference in pressure decreases, such as, for example, due to the decrease in the force acting on the main plunger <b>25</b>, the plunger <b>1107</b> may be forced to move from the equilibrium position to the left, i.e., in the direction to expand the drive cavity <b>1108</b>. Such displacement of the plunger <b>1107</b> may decrease the blocked portion of the inlet opening <b>1105</b>, thereby increasing the flow rate of the infusion fluid <b>40</b> from the inlet cavity <b>1101</b> into the outflow cavity <b>1117</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>. The increased flow rate into the outflow cavity <b>1171</b> may allow P<sub>1 </sub>to increase, so as to move the plunger <b>1107</b> back to the equilibrium position. On the other hand, if the difference between P<sub>1 </sub>and P<sub>2 </sub>increases, such as, for example, due to the decrease of the patient pressure, the plunger may be forced to move to the right, i.e., in the direction to compress the drive cavity <b>1108</b>. Such displacement of the plunger <b>1107</b> may increase the blocked portion of the inlet opening <b>1105</b>, thereby decreasing the flow rate of the infusion fluid <b>40</b> from the inlet cavity <b>1101</b> into the outflow cavity <b>1117</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>. The decreased flow rate into the outflow cavity <b>1117</b> may cause P<sub>1 </sub>to decrease so as to allow the plunger <b>1107</b> to move back to the equilibrium position. In this manner, the mechanical variable flow resistor <b>1100</b> of the present disclosure may maintain a substantially constant difference between the pressure in the outflow cavity <b>1117</b> and the patient pressure.</p>

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">As shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, in an embodiment, the electronic control module <b>45</b> may include a binary (fully open or fully closed, default closed) flow valve <b>47</b>, such as a pinch valve which interacts with a specific segment <b>48</b> of the integrated tubing <b>36</b> and controls the outflow of the substance from the vessel; microprocessor circuitry <b>49</b> for operating the binary flow valve <b>47</b> and reading patient and infusion data from the disposable vessel's non-volatile memory unit.

Alternatively, the patient identification system may use, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</figref>, wireless technology such as radiofrequency identification (RFID) technology, whereby an RFID reader/receiver <b>45</b> in the electronic control module receives a signal from a unique passive RFID transmitter <b>46</b> incorporated into the patient's identification tag (e.g. wristband), the connector on the patients infusion catheter or implanted infusion port. Having the RFID transmitter incorporated into and long-term infusion catheter or implanted port may be particularly attractive as it is inexorably, physically linked to the patient during the period of time the patient requires infusion therapy. In an embodiment, the long-term catheter or implanted infusion port may contain a pressure sensor which can transmit additional data such as the catheter/port characteristics and the patient's venous pressure along with the patient identification to the electronic control module <b>45</b> to incorporate into the infusion algorithm.</p>

<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In another embodiment, the device of the present disclosure (not shown) may include a stand-alone electronic control module <b>45</b> designed to be used with a conventional infusion system <b>47</b> (hanging IV bag, electric or disposable infusion pump) to provide some of the patient safety features of the infusion device of the present invention. In this embodiment, the primary purpose of the stand-alone electronic control module <b>45</b> is to identify the patient and permit or prevent flow from the convention infusion system depending on whether a match is confirmed. The device may be programmable, but not rate-adjustable as the flow rate of the infusion is determined by the conventional infusion system <b>47</b>. The device may be provided with a disposable length of specialized tubing <b>48</b> similar to the integrated tubing <b>36</b> in the full device, which includes a interfacing segment <b>49</b> designed to interact with the binary flow valve <b>47</b> of the electronic control module <b>45</b>. The tubing may be provided with a variety of proximal connectors <b>50</b> (e.g. luer lock, spike) to attach to conventional intravenous tubing <b>51</b> emanating from the conventional infusion system <b>47</b> and distal connectors <b>52</b> (e.g. luer lock, needle, needleless hub) to attach to the patient's infusion catheter or port. The binary flow valve <b>47</b> of the electronic control module <b>45</b> may be closed in the default state, occluding flow from the conventional infusion system <b>47</b>. The electronic control module <b>45</b> may include a wired patient identification system such as an electronic key <b>44</b> attached to the patient which is connected to it or wireless patient identification system such as an RFID reader/receiver <b>45</b> which receives a signal from a unique passive RFID transmitter <b>46</b> attached to the patient. The patient identification system may determine whether the patient is the one for whom the infusion is intended. If a match occurs the binary flow valve <b>47</b> of the electronic control module <b>45</b> opens and allows the conventional infusion system <b>47</b> to proceed according to its own settings. If there is no match then the binary flow valve <b>47</b> may remain in its default closed position and the infusion cannot proceed. By providing patient identification functionality in a simple, compact, single- or multi-use disposable stand-alone electronic control module, the device of the present disclosure may improve the safety of existing conventional infusion devices.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In another embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the infusion device of the present disclosure may be capable of handling multiple, simultaneous, independently adjustable infusions. Such an infusion device may include a docking tray <b>53</b> with multiple slots <b>54</b> into which one or more of the above vessels <b>11</b> can be docked. The docking tray may have several (e.g. 2-5) separate outflow paths <b>55</b> each communicating with one lumen of a multi-lumen integrated tubing <b>56</b>. In an embodiment, the docking tray <b>53</b> may have one dedicated infusion vessel which infuses a carrier fluid (e.g. saline, dextrose) at a low constant flow rate into all of the outflow paths <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The multi-infusion docking tray electronic control module <b>57</b> may include a linked series of individual vessel electronic control modules <b>45</b> similar to those previously described, each with its own binary flow valve, control circuitry, memory chip reader, switches, indicators, displays, etc. A central electronic control module <b>57</b> may include a common wired or wireless patient identification system, circuitry which communicates with the individual vessel modules, its own binary flow valve (to control the carrier fluid), switches, indicators, displays, etc. The central module may determine whether the individual vessel infusions can proceed based on whether the patient identification system confirms a match.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The fluid from each vessel <b>11</b> may be directed into one of the outflow paths <b>55</b> based on known drug-compatibility data. The device can achieve this manually or automatically. In an embodiment, each slot in the docking tray may have a manual switch which allows the operator to direct the fluid from the vessel <b>11</b> into the appropriate outflow path <b>55</b>. In another embodiment, this process may be handled automatically. The electronic control module <b>45</b> for each vessel may have one binary flow valve for each outflow path <b>55</b>. In an embodiment, the central electronic control module <b>57</b> may tell each vessel's electronic control module <b>45</b> which binary flow valve to open, routing compatible drugs into the same outflow path <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In an embodiment, a method is provided for preparing and using the infusion device of the present disclosure to deliver drugs and/or fluids to a patient. In an embodiment, a fixed-rate, non-programmable device of this invention may be prepared by the manufacturer or commercial pharmacy. The appropriate size and shape vessel <b>11</b> may be selected. Generally, the bottom wall <b>15</b> of the vessel <b>11</b> may be removable so that the various internal components can be assembled.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">For a given infusion type, a limited range of vessel sizes may generally be provided. For example, for an intravenous infusion device the portfolio may include a series of vessels with fluid chamber <b>26</b> volumes similar to commonly available intravenous fluid bags (e.g. 50 ml, 100 ml, 250 ml, 500 ml, 1000 ml). For a vessel <b>11</b> of a given size, a range of maximum flow rates may be provided to accommodate the demands of different clinical scenarios. For example a vessel <b>11</b> with 1000 ml of fluid designed for rapid infusion over several minutes during a trauma resuscitation may be provided with a maximum flow rate of 500 ml per minute while another designed for a maintenance fluid infusion over several days may be provided with a maximum flow rate of 0.3 ml per minute.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In an embodiment, the maximum flow rate for a vessel <b>11</b> of a given design (size, shape, gas compression ratio) may be primarily determined by the characteristics (shape, permeability) of the variable flow resistor <b>28</b> contained within the outflow septum <b>17</b>. In order to simplify manufacture and assembly, in an embodiment, the outflow septum <b>17</b> may be created separately and inserted into a slotted, gasketed channel in the vessel <b>11</b>. That way a vessel <b>11</b> of a given size can be married to a specific outflow septum <b>17</b> with a given variable flow resistor <b>28</b> design to achieve the desired maximum flow rate. Using the above example, a single 1000 ml vessel <b>11</b> can be provided along with two different outflow septa <b>17</b>. A first outflow septum <b>17</b> may include a highly permeable variable flow resistor <b>28</b> that, when used with this vessel <b>11</b>, can provide high flow rates for the trauma resuscitation application. A second outflow septum <b>17</b> may include a less permeable variable flow resistor <b>28</b> that, when used with the same vessel <b>11</b>, can provide low rates for the maintenance fluid application.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In an embodiment, a fully charged empty infusion device may be assembled, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. The appropriate vessel <b>11</b>, outflow septum <b>17</b>, gas vessel <b>29</b> and plunger system <b>23</b> may be selected. The outflow septum <b>17</b> may be inserted into its slotted, gasketed channel of the vessel. The gas vessel <b>29</b> may be inserted into the main chamber <b>12</b> followed by the plunger system <b>23</b>. The plunger extension <b>25</b> may be inserted into the inner outflow channel <b>19</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>, the gas vessel <b>29</b> may be bound to the main plunger <b>24</b> and provided as a single piece. The bottom wall <b>15</b> may further be attached completing the assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The gas vessel <b>29</b> can be filled with gas <b>28</b> in one of several ways. In an embodiment, the gas vessel <b>29</b> may be provided prefilled and sealed with the final amount (mass mg as shown above) of gas <b>28</b>. At atmospheric pressure, the prefilled gas vessel <b>29</b> may have a significantly larger volume than the main chamber <b>12</b> of the vessel <b>11</b>. A compressing force may be applied to the gas vessel <b>29</b> and attached plunger system <b>23</b> as it is inserted into the main chamber <b>12</b>. The application of the force may be continued until the bottom wall <b>15</b> is secured to the vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In another embodiment the gas vessel <b>29</b> may be provided empty or partially filled, so that it can be inserted into the main chamber <b>12</b> along with the plunger system <b>23</b> without compression. After the bottom wall <b>15</b> is attached, the gas vessel may be filled with the remaining amount of gas <b>28</b> through an inlet port <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Next, the infusion device with the empty but charged vessel <b>11</b> maybe filled with the appropriate carrier fluid (e.g. saline, dextrose solution) while removing substantially all air from the vessel and tubing. This can be done through an inlet port <b>33</b> which communicates with the fluid chamber <b>26</b>. The fluid of course may be infused under pressure to drive the plunger <b>22</b> into the pressure chamber <b>27</b>, compressing the gas <b>28</b> in gas vessel <b>29</b> to a final pressure of P<b>0</b>. If a drug is being infused, the pharmacy staff at a commercial or hospital pharmacy can take the filled and charged vessel and inject a small-volume aliquot of the concentrated drug into the vessel, resulting in final concentration of drug within the vessel consistent with the physician's order. A label with the relevant patient, drug and infusion data, in human and, optionally, machine readable (e.g. bar code) form, may be permanently affixed or directly printed on the outside of the vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The device may be delivered from the pharmacy to the patient, who may be at a hospital, non-hospital facility or at home. The nurse or other appropriately trained person, including the patient himself, may receive the device and confirm that it is the correct infusion for that patient. This can be done by visually comparing the information on the vessel label with that on a matching patient identification tag (e.g. badge, wristband). Alternatively, machine readable (e.g. bar code) data on the vessel label and patient identification tag can be compared by a handheld reader (e.g. bar code reader). Once an appropriate match is confirmed, the operator can simply connect the terminal connector <b>37</b> on the integrated tubing <b>36</b> to a provided matching connector attached to a infusion catheter or implanted infusion port already in the patient. In an embodiment with the drug/fluid in the device is already pressurized, the infusion may begin as soon as the connection is made and continues at a constant flow rate until the vessel is empty or the connectors are disengaged.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In another embodiment, a method is provided for delivering drugs and/or fluids to a patient using an adjustable-rate, programmable device of the present disclosure. In an embodiment, the non-volatile memory chip on the vessel <b>11</b> and the separate electronic control module <b>45</b> may be provided. The device may be assembled, pressurized, filled with carrier fluid and de-aired by the manufacturer, commercial pharmacy or central hospital pharmacy in the same fashion as above. If indicated, the appropriate amount of concentrated drug may be added by the pharmacy staff according to the physician's orders as above. A label with the relevant patient, drug and infusion data may be placed on vessel as above.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The vessel's non-volatile memory chip <b>44</b> may then be connected to a pharmacy computer through its electronic lead/connector <b>46</b>. The computer may include a comprehensive drug/fluid database, complete infusion data (rate range, volume, time, etc.) and all relevant patient information (including but not limited to unique patient identification, clinical history, current kidney/liver function, known adverse drug reactions and current medications). Once the computer confirms that the infusion of the specified drug/fluid in the specified fashion is safe for the specified patient, the computer can store the appropriate patient and infusion data in the non-volatile memory unit <b>35</b> of the vessel <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">An appropriate electronic control module <b>45</b> may then be selected and attached to the vessel <b>11</b> with the binary flow valve <b>47</b> in contact with the specialized segment <b>48</b> of the vessel's integrated tubing <b>36</b>. The electronic control module <b>45</b> may also be in electrical contact with the non-volatile memory chip <b>44</b> through its lead/connector <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The completed infusion device, filled, charged, de-aired, labeled and programmed, may be then delivered from the pharmacy to the patient, who again may be at a hospital, non-hospital facility or at home. The nurse or other appropriately trained person, may connect the terminal connector on the tubing to a provided matching connector applied to a infusion catheter or implanted infusion port already in the patient. A match between the infusion device and the patient can first be manually confirmed by the operator, as above, by visually comparing the vessel label to the patient's identification tag. At the same time, the electronic control module <b>45</b> may confirm a match automatically using its patient identification system. If the electronic control module <b>45</b> uses a wired system, the patient's unique electronic key <b>44</b> may be inserted into the electronic control module <b>45</b> and its microprocessor circuitry <b>49</b> reads the patient information from the key. If the electronic control module <b>45</b> uses a wireless system, a passive RFID transmitter <b>46</b> incorporated into the patient's identification tag or infusion catheter/port digitally can transmit the patients identification information to the RFID reader/receiver <b>45</b> in the electronic control module <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The operator can then connect the terminal connector <b>37</b> on the integrated tubing <b>36</b> of the vessel <b>11</b> to a provided matching connector attached to a infusion catheter or implanted infusion port already in the patient. The operator can then press the &#x201c;Run&#x201d; button on the electronic control module <b>45</b>. If the module confirmed a match through its patient identification system, the module <b>45</b> can open the binary flow valve <b>47</b> and permit the infusion to proceed at the programmed rate. If the module <b>45</b> does not confirm a match, the valve remains closed, the infusion is not permitted to proceed and the operator is notified of the error by illuminating a LED-type indicator, generating an audible error signal or by displaying an error message on and LED/LCD display <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">If the infusion device is programmed by the pharmacy to be rate-adjustable, the operator may increase or decrease the infusion rate within a programmed range by pressing an &#x201c;Up&#x201d; or &#x201c;Down&#x201d; on the electronic control module <b>45</b>. The electronic control module <b>45</b> may change the flow rate using the digitized infusion algorithm by increasing or decreasing the frequency of the microbolus volume infusions. As previously described, each microbolus volume may be delivery by opening the binary flow valve <b>47</b> for a fixed period of time. As the flow rate is being adjusted by the operator, the electronic control module <b>45</b> may indicate the current flow rate on the LED/LCD display <b>52</b>. In an embodiment, if the flow rate is already at the programmed maximum (minimum) flow rate the &#x201c;Up&#x201d; (&#x201c;Down&#x201d;) button will have no effect. The LED indicators or LED/LCD display <b>52</b> may notify the operator that the maximum or minimum flow rate had been reached. The device may include a soft override button, permitting the operator to increase or decrease the flow rate within a broader secondary programmed range. In an embodiment, the module <b>37</b>, however, may prevent the operator from changing the rate to a value beyond some predetermined, programmed range based on the safety profile of the drug/fluid. The infusion may continue at the designated flow rate until the vessel is empty, the connectors are disengaged or the operator presses the &#x201c;Pause&#x201d; button.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In another embodiment, a method is provided for delivering drugs and/or fluids to a patient using a conventional infusion system <b>47</b> with a stand-alone electronic control module <b>45</b> of the present disclosure. The conventional infusion system <b>47</b> may be prepared by the pharmacy and nursing staff according to the physician's order. For example in the case of a simple gravity driven infusion, an appropriate amount of the prescribed drug may be injected into an IV bag with a given volume of the appropriate carrier fluid to achieve the desired concentration. The staff may select an appropriate stand-alone electronic control module <b>45</b> which may be connected to the pharmacy computer and programmed with the appropriate patient and infusion data as above. The staff may then select the appropriate disposable length of specialized tubing <b>48</b> along with the correct proximal connector <b>50</b> (in this case IV bag spike) and distal connector <b>52</b>. The specialized tubing <b>48</b> may be connected to the IV bag and a small amount of fluid is allowed to flow through it to de-air it. The programmed stand-alone electronic control module <b>45</b> may be then latched onto the tubing so the interfacing segment <b>49</b> of the specialized tubing <b>48</b> lies within the binary flow valve <b>47</b> of the electronic control module <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The assembled infusion device may then be delivered to the patient. The operator can connect the distal connector <b>52</b> to a matching connector on the patient's infusion catheter or port and initiate the conventional infusion system, in this example by simply hanging the IV bag on a pole. If a wired patient identification system is used, the patient's unique electronic key <b>44</b> may be inserted into the electronic control module <b>45</b> and its microprocessor circuitry <b>49</b> may read the patient information from the key. If the electronic control module <b>45</b> uses a wireless system, a passive RFID transmitter <b>46</b> incorporated into the patient's identification tag or infusion catheter/port digitally may transmit the patients identification information to the RFID reader/receiver <b>45</b> in the electronic control module <b>45</b>. When ready, the operator may press the &#x201c;Run&#x201d; button on the electronic control module <b>45</b>. If the electronic control module <b>45</b> confirms a match, it can open the binary flow valve <b>47</b> and permits the infusion to proceed at the rate determined by the conventional infusion system <b>47</b> (in this example, by gravity). If it does not confirm a match, the binary flow valve <b>47</b> may remain closed, the infusion is not permitted to proceed and the operator is notified of the error by illuminating a LED-type indicator, generating an audible error sound or by displaying an error message on and LED/LCD display <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In another embodiment, a method is provided for simultaneously infusing multiple drugs/fluids into a patient using the multiple-infusion docking tray and multiple individual vessels containing the individual drugs/fluids. The docking tray <b>53</b> with its dedicated carrier fluid vessel may be prepared by the manufacturer, commercial pharmacy or hospital pharmacy by loading the charged vessel with the appropriate carrier fluid (e.g. saline, dextrose solution) while removing substantially all air from the vessel, the multiple outflow paths <b>55</b> and multi-lumen integrated tubing <b>56</b>. The pharmacy staff may then select the appropriate filled, de-aired and charged docking tray <b>53</b> along with a separate filled, de-aired and charged vessel <b>11</b> for each initial drug to be infused. A small-volume aliquot of the each concentrated drug may be injected into its respective vessel, resulting in final concentrations of each drug consistent with the physician's orders.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The docking tray and each vessel may then be connected to the pharmacy computer containing a comprehensive drug/fluid database, infusion data for each drug and all relevant patient information. Once the computer confirms that the infusion of each drug/fluid in the specified fashion is safe for the specified patient, the computer may store the appropriate patient and infusion data in the non-volatile memory unit of the docking tray <b>53</b> and each vessel <b>11</b>. An appropriate multi-infusion docking tray electronic control module <b>57</b> may be selected and the multi-infusion device may then be completed by connecting it to the prepared and programmed docking tray. A label with the relevant patient, drug and infusion data, in human and optionally machine readable (e.g. bar code) form, may be affixed or printed on the outside of the docking tray and each vessel <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The prepared docking tray <b>53</b> with its attached electronic control module <b>57</b> and the individual prepared vessels <b>11</b> may then be delivered to the patient's bedside. The bedside operator may first connect the multi-lumen integrated tubing <b>56</b> from the docking tray to the respective ports on the infusion catheter already in the patient. If a wired patient identification is being used, the operator may insert the unique patient electronic key <b>44</b> into the appropriate connector on the docking tray electronic control module <b>57</b>. The operator may press the &#x201c;Run&#x201d; switch on the docking tray electronic control module <b>57</b> and if a positive patient identification has been confirmed using the wired or wireless system, the infusion of the docking tray carrier fluid at its fixed rate may be initiated. The operator may then dock each vessel <b>11</b> into an appropriate slot <b>54</b> in the docking tray. The electronic control module <b>57</b> may detect the vessel <b>11</b> and read the patient and infusion data from the vessel's memory unit <b>35</b>. The electronic control module <b>57</b> may compare the patient information on the vessel's non-volatile memory unit <b>35</b> to that on the docking tray's memory unit to confirm positive patient identification. The operator may hit the &#x201c;Run&#x201d; button for that slot <b>54</b> on the docking tray electronic control module which opens the binary flow valve <b>47</b> for that slot, allowing that infusion to proceed.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In one embodiment the operator may be provided with a choice for each slot of inserting the vessel to communicate with one specific outflow path <b>55</b> in the docking tray <b>53</b>. The operator may choose the slot to assure that only compatible drugs are sharing the same outflow path. In another embodiment, the control module <b>57</b> may be capable of routing each infusion into a specific outflow path <b>55</b> and does so based on stored drug compatibility data.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">If the infusion from a given vessel is adjustable, the operator may be able to adjust the flow rate within the ordered/programmed range by pressing the &#x201c;Up&#x201d; and &#x201c;Down&#x201d; buttons on the control module <b>57</b> that corresponds with the slot <b>54</b> on the docking tray.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">When the vessel <b>11</b> is empty, the vessel <b>11</b> may be removed and, if the infusion of that drug is to be continued, the vessel <b>11</b> may be replaced by a new filled, charged, de-aired and programmed vessel <b>11</b>. If a new drug is prescribed, an individual vessel <b>11</b> for that drug may be prepared and programmed at the pharmacy and delivered to the patient's bedside. The operator may simply insert the vessel into an empty slot on the docking tray <b>53</b> and presses &#x201c;Run&#x201d;. The docking tray electronic control module <b>57</b> may read the patient information on the non-volatile memory unit <b>35</b> of the new vessel <b>11</b> and may compare it with from the docking tray's non-volatile memory unit <b>35</b> which had been previously matched to the patient through the wired or wireless patient identification system. Assuming a positive identification has been confirmed, the new infusion may begin into the appropriate outflow path <b>55</b>, determined by the operator or automatically by the control module. The system may permit vessels containing certain emergency drugs (e.g. pressors) to be available in code carts or in the unit's medication room, fully filled, charged and ready to be used but without the specific patient information. The control module of the docking tray can allow vessels containing these drugs to proceed, under well defined circumstances (e.g. operator override) for a limited time period, without requiring patient identification.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In another aspect, a method for optimizing the mechanical variable flow resistor is provided. As noted above, the balance of forces equation for all forces acting on the plunger with, positive defined as acting to the right, can be presented as following in equation (1): &#x3c0;R<sup>2</sup>P<sub>1</sub>&#x2213;F<sub>friction</sub>&#x2212;F<sub>spring</sub>&#x2212;&#x3c0;R<sup>2</sup>P<sub>2</sub>=0, where R is radius of the plunger, P<sub>1 </sub>and P<sub>2 </sub>are pressures on each side of the plunger. According to Equation (1), with a decreasing pressure driving this system, the plunger may monotonically be moving to the left.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Further, F<sub>spring </sub>may be determined from Hooke's law, which is presented in equation (2) as follows: F<sub>spring</sub>=&#x3ba;(D|x), where D is the amount the spring has been pre-compressed and x is the amount the plunger has to move to cover the inlet pressure. The frictional force can be found from equation (3) as following: F<sub>friction</sub>=2&#x3c0;RL&#x3bc;P<sub>o</sub>, where P<b>0</b> is both a maximum drive pressure as well as a compliance pressure between the plunger and the wall and L is the total length of the plunger interaction with walls of the housing. Therefore Equation (1) can rearranged as presented in equation (4): &#x3c0;R<sup>2</sup>P<sub>1</sub>&#x2212;&#x3c0;R<sup>2</sup>P<sub>2</sub>=F<sub>spring</sub>&#xb1;F<sub>friction</sub>.
