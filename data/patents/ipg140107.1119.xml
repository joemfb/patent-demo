<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An improved system and method for data card emulation is provided that enables a single data card to emulate any one of multiple data cards. The data card includes an improved system and method for conveying data involving pulsed light that can read a barcode and can emulate a barcode. The improved system and method for conveying data may also include at least one of a magnetic stripe reader or a magnetic stripe emulator. The data card uses the improved system and method for conveying data to interface with conventional barcode and/or magnetic stripe readers, to interface with other such data cards or other devices having similar circuitry, and to interface with a data management system used to manage barcode and/or magnetic stripe information stored in a memory on the data card.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to a system and method for data card emulation. More particularly, the present invention relates to the use of pulsed light and/or magnetic field technology to read and write bar code information such that a single data card can emulate multiple data cards having different bar codes and/or magnetic stripes.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is quite common for a person to currently have to carry many different types of data cards in their wallet or purse. Such data cards include credit cards, debit cards, loyalty cards, identification cards, and the like. Keeping track of such cards and being able to quickly locate such cards can be quite cumbersome. Therefore, there is a need for an improved system and method for a single card to function as multiple data cards.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention is an improved system and method for data card emulation. A single data card is able to emulate, or function as, any one of many different types of cards that a person might otherwise have to carry in a wallet or purse. This improved system for data card emulation, often referred to herein as CardCard, includes an improved system for conveying data that enables the card to both read and write information. As such, various types of card information such as barcode and/or magnetic stripe information for multiple data cards can be read into the CardCard, stored in a memory, and then later used (in write mode) to emulate a given data card. The CardCard can also operate in a transceiver mode whereby it can communicate with another CardCard (also operating in a transceiver mode) or with some other comparable transceiver device. Various techniques are provided for identifying which entity's data card to emulate. Under one arrangement, the CardCard communicate with another device to determine which entity's card to emulate. Under another arrangement, an interface on the card is used to select an entity to emulate. A CardCard data management system is provided to manage the data residing in a CardCard's memory. In another embodiment, the improved system for conveying data is integrated into a cell phone, a smart card, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a watch, a keychain, a kiosk, or other object enabling that object to read and write information as if it were a CardCard.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The improved system for conveying data of the invention includes a first light conduit having a first opening at a first end, a second opening at a second end, and a side opening. It also includes a first light source that outputs a first light that initially enters the first light conduit through the side opening, reflects off the first light conduit, and exits the first opening. It also includes a first detector that detects a second light and a first processor interfaced with the first detector, where the first processor conveys data based on at least one of the first light or the second light.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Under one arrangement, after exiting the first opening the first light encounters a barcode having black lines and white lines. The first light is absorbed by the black lines and reflected by the white lines thereby producing the second light such that the data conveyed by the second light corresponds to barcode information in accordance with the barcode. The barcode can be passed by the first opening or the first opening can be passed by the barcode. The barcode can be on a data card or on another object. The barcode can distinguish one of a plurality of entities associated with a data card.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The first light source can be a light emitting diode (LED) or can be an ambient light source.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The system can be integrated into one of a data card, a cellular phone, a smart phone, a PDA, a watch, a keychain, a kiosk, a point-of-sale device, a data management device, a portable object, or a fixed object. It may also include at least one of a first memory, a first battery, a first switch, a first light waveguide, a first status indicator, or a first display.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Under one arrangement, the second light enters the first light conduit through the first opening and exits the second opening. Under another arrangement, the second light reflects off the first light conduit after entering the first opening and before exiting the second opening.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The first light source can be interfaced with the first processor and can output the first light in accordance with a barcode pattern. Under one arrangement, the first light source and the first detector can function as a first transmitter and a first receiver of a first pulsed light transceiver. The first pulsed light transceiver can use On-Off-Keying (OOK).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The improved system for conveying data can include a second light source that outputs the second light that initially enters the first light conduit through the first opening and exits the second opening. The improved system can also include a second detector for detecting the first light having exited the first opening and a second processor interfaced with the second light source and the second detector that conveys data based on at least one of the first light or the second light.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The improved system for conveying data can also include a second light conduit where the first light reflects through the first light conduit and then reflects through the second conduit prior to being detected by the second detector and the second light reflects through the second light conduit and then reflects through the first conduit prior to being detected by the first detector.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Under one arrangement, the second light source outputs the second light through a side opening in the second light conduit.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The improved system for conveying data can also include at least one of a second memory, a second battery, a second switch, a second light waveguide, a second status indicator, or a second display.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The present invention will now be described more fully in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which the preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention should not, however, be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, they are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The present invention provides a system and method for data card emulation. Specifically, the present invention involves a data card referred to herein as CardCard that is able to emulate any one of a plurality of data cards. The CardCard will work with existing data card infrastructure in the same manner as if a user used a different one of the plurality of data cards at respective entities (e.g., businesses).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the basic concept of the present invention where one data card is able to emulate any one of a plurality of data cards. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a plurality of data cards <b>100</b>, for example, includes various types of loyalty cards. The plurality of data cards <b>100</b> could alternatively or additionally include various types of transaction cards such as credit cards or debit cards, and generally could include any kind of data card having a barcode and/or magnetic stripe. Barcode information and/or magnetic stripe information <b>102</b> is stored on a CardCard <b>104</b> such that the CardCard <b>104</b> can emulate any one of the plurality of data cards <b>100</b> by emulating the barcode and/or magnetic stripe information normally conveyed by the card.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts an exemplary method of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the method <b>200</b> comprises a first step <b>202</b> which is to obtain magnetic stripe and/or barcode information of a plurality of data cards corresponding to a plurality of entities. The magnetic stripe and/or barcode information is stored on a portable conveyance device in a second step <b>204</b>. The portable conveyance device may, for example, resemble a typical data card. In a third step <b>206</b>, an entity is distinguished corresponding to one of the plurality of cards for which the magnetic stripe and/or barcode information is required. In a fourth step <b>208</b>, the portable conveyance device conveys to the entity the magnetic stripe and/or barcode emulation corresponding to the entity's data card.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In accordance with the invention, the magnetic stripe and/or barcode information of a plurality of data cards corresponding to a plurality of entities can be obtained in one or more of several ways including reading such information directly from individual data cards or receiving a data file or other data stream that includes such information corresponding to one or more data cards. Once obtained, such information can be stored (or otherwise described) in a memory for later use. An entity can be distinguished using various approaches including using a user interface of the portable conveyance device or a user interface of a computing device associated with the portable conveyance device to select the entity. Alternatively, a radio frequency transmission or other form of transmission could be received by the portable conveyance device or a computing device associated with the portable conveyance device, or a barcode, magnetic stripe, or other recognizable information associated with the entity could be recognized (or read) by the portable conveyance device or by a computing device associated with the portable conveyance device. Similarly, magnetic stripe and/or barcode information corresponding to the distinguished entity can be conveyed via a writeable magnetic stripe and/or a display, via an emulation approach whereby existing infrastructure reads the information as if reading the actual entity data card, or via a transmission from the portable conveyance device to a device associated with the entity that is capable of receiving the transmission, which would convey the magnetic stripe and/or barcode information corresponding to the entity (and the user of the portable conveyance device). Under one approach, a device associated with the entity would communicate with the portable conveyance device as required to search the memory of the portable conveyance device to locate and retrieve the magnetic stripe and/or barcode information that it would recognize as corresponding to one of its data cards.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts various devices that can be used to obtain barcode and/or magnetic stripe information from a data card.

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The invention includes several embodiments of an improved system for conveying data that enable a CardCard to read and write barcode and/or magnetic stripe information and to function as a transceiver. Depending on the embodiment, this improved system for conveying data is also referred to herein as a barcode reader, barcode emulator, barcode reader/emulator, light transceiver, magnetic stripe detector, magnetic strip emulator, or a magnetic field transceiver.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a </i>depicts an exemplary barcode reader in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>, a barcode reader <b>500</b> includes a light conduit <b>502</b> having a first opening <b>504</b> at one end, a second opening <b>506</b> at the other end, and a side opening <b>508</b>. Light from a light source <b>510</b>, for example a light emitting diode (LED), enters the side opening <b>508</b> and reflects through the light conduit <b>502</b> where it then reflects off a barcode <b>512</b> of a data card being passed by the first opening <b>504</b>. The light then reflects through the light conduit <b>502</b> and exits the second opening <b>506</b> where it is detected by a detector <b>514</b>. Alternatively, the first opening <b>504</b> of a barcode reader <b>500</b> can be moved relative to a stationary barcode <b>512</b>. As such, when reading a barcode, a barcode reader <b>500</b> requires the same relative movement as does a pen type barcode reader <b>308</b><i>d</i>. Light from a light source <b>510</b> is absorbed by the black lines and reflected by the white lines of barcode <b>512</b>. The detector therefore detects the presence or absence of light over time, which corresponds to the barcode sequence. Under one arrangement, the light conduit <b>502</b> is substantially flat allowing it to be configured within a data card. Under another arrangement, the light conduit <b>502</b> is substantially round, for example an optical fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b </i>depicts an alternative bar code reader in accordance with still another embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b</i>, a barcode reader <b>516</b> is the same as the barcode reader <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a </i>except the light source is ambient light <b>518</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The exemplary bar code reader <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a </i>can also be configured as a bar code emulator and/or as pulsed light transceiver. Essentially, a barcode reader/emulator-light transceiver <b>520</b> can be operated in one of three modes depending on what it interfaces with at the first opening <b>504</b> of light conduit <b>502</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>, a first mode of the barcode reader/emulator-light transceiver <b>520</b> is to read a barcode via the first opening <b>504</b>. In a second mode, the barcode reader/emulator-light transceiver <b>520</b> outputs pulsed light from a light source <b>510</b> in accordance with a barcode pattern so as to emulate a barcode to another barcode reader, a CardCard barcode reader <b>500</b> or <b>516</b>, or another barcode reader/emulator-light transceiver <b>520</b>. In a third mode, the light source <b>510</b> and the detector <b>514</b> function as a transmitter and a receiver of a On-Off-Keying (OOK) pulsed light transceiver, respectively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>c </i>depicts a barcode reader/emulator-light transceiver <b>520</b> operating as an OOK pulsed light transceiver with a second detector <b>522</b> and second light source <b>524</b> functioning as a second OOK pulse light transceiver, which might be implemented in the kiosk <b>402</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>, the CardCard data management device <b>408</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>, or another device.</p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a </i>depicts a first exemplary CardCard circuitry <b>600</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a</i>, the first CardCard circuitry <b>600</b> includes a processor <b>602</b> that interfaces with a barcode reader/emulator-light transceiver <b>520</b>, a memory <b>604</b>, a battery <b>606</b>, a first pressure switch <b>608</b>, a second pressure switch <b>610</b>, and a light waveguide <b>612</b>. The processor <b>602</b> may also interface with one or more status indicators (not shown) to include one or more additional LEDs. The processor <b>602</b> may also interface with a display such as a touch screen, which might be used, for example, to display an entity icon, status information, or other entity information, and/or to provide an interface for selecting an entity or otherwise managing the functionality of the CardCard <b>104</b>. Use of a display is discussed below in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a</i>, the pressure switch <b>608</b> is used, for example, to activate the barcode reader/emulator modes of the CardCard and the pressure switch <b>610</b> is, for example, used to activate the light transceiver mode of the CardCard. The light waveguide <b>612</b> enables any form of barcode reader to read the barcode emulator mode output of a barcode reader/emulator-light transceiver <b>520</b>. Specifically, for the barcode emulator mode output to be read by a slot reader <b>308</b><i>a</i>, the CardCard only has to be placed into the slot reader <b>308</b><i>a </i>(i.e., it doesn't have to slide). A handheld reader <b>308</b><i>b </i>and a horizontal scanner <b>308</b><i>c </i>can read the output at any angle other than exactly parallel to the light waveguide <b>612</b>, and a pen type barcode reader <b>308</b><i>d </i>can read the output by pointing the pen type barcode reader <b>308</b><i>d </i>at any location of the light waveguide <b>612</b>, where the pen type barcode reader <b>308</b><i>d </i>does not move while reading the output. The light waveguide <b>612</b> also allows two (or more) CardCards to convey information using their respective barcode reader/emulator-light transceivers <b>520</b> by merely placing their respective light waveguides <b>612</b> close enough together such that light can traverse between them.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Under one arrangement, the light from the light source <b>510</b> is visible to the user of the CardCard thereby providing an indication of status. For example, after the first pressure switch <b>608</b> is activated by a user holding the top of the CardCard, the light source <b>510</b> would stay on continuously during the barcode reader mode as required to read the barcode of an entity, which might be located, for example, at a cash register. After successfully reading the barcode, the same light source <b>510</b> would begin operating in barcode emulator mode where it would rapidly flash on and off in accordance with the appropriate barcode for data card of the recognized entity. This flashing on and off would indicate the card was ready to insert into a barcode reader. Alternatively, the same light source <b>510</b> might flash on and off with a specific pattern to indicate whether the card was able to successfully recognize the barcode of the entity. Under another arrangement one or more other LEDs are used to indicate a mode of the card and/or status information.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b </i>depicts a second exemplary CardCard circuitry <b>612</b> in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b</i>, the second exemplary CardCard circuitry <b>614</b> is the same as the first exemplary CardCard circuitry <b>600</b> except it also includes circuitry corresponding to a magnetic stripe detector <b>616</b> and a magnetic stripe emulator <b>618</b>. As such, the magnetic stripe detector <b>616</b> can be used in conjunction with the barcode reading mode of barcode reader/emulator-light transceiver <b>520</b> to obtain the magnetic stripe and barcode information related to a data card, or can be used to identify an entity, where an entity's magnetic stripe information may be read, for example, near a cash register. The magnetic stripe emulator <b>618</b> can also be used in conjunction with the barcode emulation mode of barcode reader/emulator-light transceiver <b>520</b> to convey the magnetic stripe and barcode information to corresponding reader devices, where the magnetic stripe emulator <b>618</b> generates a varying magnetic field corresponding to the information typically encoded on a magnetic stripe. A magnetic stripe detector <b>616</b> and a magnetic stripe emulator are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,701,601, which is incorporated herein by reference. Alternative magnetic stripe detector/emulator approaches are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,811,082, which is also incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The combination of the magnetic strip detector <b>616</b> and the magnetic strip emulator <b>618</b> provides for three modes of operation similar to the three operational modes of the barcode reader/emulator-light transceiver <b>520</b>. Specifically, the first mode is the magnetic stripe detector mode, the second mode is the magnetic stripe emulator mode, and the third mode is the magnetic field transceiver mode where data would be conveyed in accordance with a defined modulation scheme for modulating a magnetic field. As such, when the magnetic strip detector <b>616</b> and the magnetic strip emulator are operating in magnetic field transceiver mode with a second magnetic stripe detector and second magnetic stripe emulator then any form of data can be conveyed including information (or data) representing a barcode, an entity name, a logo, etc. A magnetic field transceiver is described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,551,795 incorporated herein by reference.</p>

As such, the magnetic stripe detector <b>616</b> can be used to obtain magnetic stripe information related to a data card and the magnetic stripe emulator <b>618</b> can be used to convey magnetic stripe information to a corresponding magnetic stripe reader device.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>d </i>depicts a fourth exemplary CardCard circuitry <b>622</b> in accordance with still another embodiment of the present invention.

In place of the barcode reader/emulator-light transceiver <b>520</b> is a barcode emulator <b>626</b> comprising a light conduit <b>502</b> and a light source <b>510</b> used to produce barcode emulator output through opening <b>504</b> to light waveguide <b>612</b>. As such, any barcode information the CardCard obtains for use by barcode emulator <b>626</b> to emulate a barcode must be received via magnetic stripe detector <b>616</b> when operating in magnetic field transceiver mode with magnetic stripe emulator <b>618</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>f </i>depicts a sixth exemplary CardCard circuitry <b>628</b> in accordance with a still further embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>f</i>, the sixth exemplary CardCard circuitry <b>628</b> is the same as the fifth exemplary CardCard circuitry <b>624</b> except it does not include a magnetic stripe detector <b>616</b> and it does include electrical contacts <b>630</b> used to provide a wired communications link to the processor <b>602</b>. As such, any magnetic stripe or barcode information the CardCard obtains for use by the magnetic stripe emulator <b>618</b> to emulate a magnetic stripe or by the barcode emulator <b>626</b> to emulate a barcode must be received via electrical contacts <b>630</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In reference to the six exemplary CardCard circuitries <b>600</b>, <b>614</b>, <b>620</b>, <b>622</b>, <b>624</b>, and <b>628</b> one skilled in the art will recognize that the locations of the various components can be varied, the number and type of switches can vary, and other changes can be made to the circuitry within the scope of the current invention such as extending the light waveguide <b>612</b> around one or more sides of the card. Furthermore, for the first five exemplary circuitries <b>600</b>, <b>614</b>, <b>620</b>, <b>622</b>, and <b>624</b>, electrical contacts <b>630</b> like those in the sixth exemplary circuitry <b>628</b> could also be used to provide an interface to the processor <b>602</b> to enable an electrical circuit for wired communications between the CardCard <b>104</b> and a kiosk <b>402</b>, a CardCard data management device <b>408</b>, or some other device. Generally, various designs of the CardCard may be employed in accordance with the invention to achieve a desired a size, thickness, and/or flexibility, for example, the size, thickness, and flexibility of a typical credit card. Under one arrangement, the CardCard circuitry can be implemented using flexible circuit board technology. Alternatively, the CardCard circuitry can be implemented using rigid-flex circuit board technology or using rigid circuit board technology.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts another view of the exemplary CardCard data management device <b>408</b> previously depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b </i>that is configured to interface with the second exemplary CardCard circuitry <b>614</b>. One skilled in the art will recognize that a CardCard data management device <b>408</b> can be configured to interface with any one or more of the six exemplary CardCard circuitries. One skilled in the art will also recognize that the basic circuitry used to interface with any one or more of the six exemplary CardCard circuitries can be employed in a kiosk <b>402</b> or some other device such as one tailored for an entity POS. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the CardCard data management device <b>408</b> has a USB cable <b>409</b> for connecting to a computer <b>302</b> and an additional USB port <b>414</b> for connecting to a barcode and/or magnetic stripe reading device such as those described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. A CardCard <b>104</b> is inserted into the slot <b>410</b> of the CardCard data management device <b>408</b>. The barcode reader/emulator-light transceiver <b>520</b> of the CardCard <b>104</b> is thereby aligned with a second detector <b>522</b> and a second light source <b>524</b> included in the CardCard data management device <b>408</b>. Similarly, the magnetic stripe reader <b>616</b> and the magnetic stripe emulator <b>618</b> of the CardCard <b>104</b> are thereby aligned with second magnetic stripe emulator <b>704</b> and second magnetic stripe reader <b>706</b> of the CardCard data management device <b>408</b>, respectively. Thereafter, CardCard data management device <b>408</b> can convey barcode and/or magnetic stripe information to and from CardCard <b>104</b> using any of several modes of communication. Specifically, CardCard data management device <b>408</b> can interface with the barcode reader/emulator-light transceiver <b>520</b> of the CardCard <b>104</b> using any of its three modes of operation (i.e., barcode reader mode, barcode emulator mode, or light transceiver mode). Using the light transceiver mode, information other than barcode information can be conveyed and other types of functions can be performed. Similarly, CardCard data management device <b>408</b> can interface with the magnetic stripe reader <b>616</b> and the magnetic stripe emulator <b>618</b> using any of their three modes of operation (i.e., magnetic stripe detector mode, magnetic stripe emulator mode, or magnetic field transceiver mode).

Furthermore, information other than barcode and magnetic stripe information can be conveyed and other types of functions can be performed using electrical contacts <b>630</b> (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the first and second activation buttons <b>700</b> and <b>702</b> are aligned with the first and second pressure switches <b>608</b> and <b>610</b>, respectively, such that, when the first activation button <b>700</b> is pressed, pressure is applied to the first pressure switch <b>608</b> and, when the second activation button <b>702</b> is pressed, pressure is applied to the second pressure switch <b>610</b>. As such, only the first activation button <b>700</b> can be pressed, only the second activation button <b>702</b> can be pressed, or the first activation button <b>700</b> and the second activation button <b>702</b> can be both pressed at the same time to control three activation states of the CardCard data management device <b>408</b>.

Such interfaces enable it to be used by an entity to add its own information to a customer's card and alternatively enable a device to scan the memory of a customer's CardCard in order to find the barcode and/or magnetic stripe information for the data card corresponding to that entity. Furthermore, the CardCard data management device enables the CardCard to be used as a smart card whereby various types of information corresponding to customer transactions could be stored on the CardCard, such as account balances and the like. When used as a smart card, various well known security features would likely need to be employed such as data encryption and user authentication techniques such as requiring a PIN and/or employing biometric authentication techniques, for example, requiring a thumb print match. One or more of such security features can also be used when a CardCard is not being used as a smart card.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> depicts an exemplary CardCard Data Management System that could be executed on a computing system <b>300</b>.

As shown, function #<b>1</b> allows a user to manage information stored in a local database pertaining to entities offering data cards. Typically, a user would use function #<b>1</b> to add, delete, or edit entity records. Similarly, function #<b>2</b> allows a user to manage information stored in the memory of the CardCard corresponding to the entities for which the CardCard has respective data card information. Function #<b>3</b> would be used to make changes to either database as appropriate to keep it current with changes made to the other database. Function #<b>4</b> would automatically log on to a CardCard website (as described below) where information pertaining to entities, particularly vendors, would be available. Function #<b>5</b> would log on to an entity website, perhaps to download entity data card information or to support a transaction. The entity may be identified via the computer <b>302</b> or may be selected via the CardCard. Function #<b>6</b> would enable a CardCard to be erased of any or all information stored in the CardCard's memory. Function #<b>7</b> would copy information contained in the memory of a CardCard into the memory of a different CardCard. Function #<b>8</b> would allow the production of any one of several different types of reports concerning the local and/or CardCard databases or, for example, could list entity websites for which data card information is available. Functions #<b>9</b> and #<b>10</b> are intended for entities and could be used, for example, by a checkout clerk. Under one arrangement a customer of an entity would place their CardCard into a CardCard data management device <b>408</b> to enable the memory of the CardCard to be scanned using Function #<b>9</b> to find the barcode and/or magnetic stripe information corresponding to the data card of the entity. Function #<b>10</b> would append data card information pertaining to a new entity into the entity database stored on the CardCard.

Such entity types, shown as Entity Type A through Entity Type T would typically correspond to categories of entities such as grocery stores, flower shops, gas stations, auto repair, tire, auto dealerships, office supply, furniture stores, home improvement stores, etc. The display lists the entities having data cards for the selected entity types where buttons from a second group of buttons <b>904</b> can be selected to identify specific entities for which data card information can be automatically downloaded. Typically, such information would be downloaded to a CardCard Club member's computer system <b>300</b> and then to the member's CardCard via a CardCard data management device <b>408</b> and a CardCard Data Management System or similar utility program. The CardCard website provides an easy to use interface for accessing data card information corresponding to a large number of entities, which can be categorized in various ways (e.g., small business, environment friendly, etc.) in order to tailor the entities listed to the member's tastes and desires. Because of its utility, entities can be charged a premium to advertise on the site in an attempt to convince the member to select them. As shown, the website might have one or more sponsors that are always shown or perhaps shown at different times or to users living in certain regions. Logos or advertisements by entities of the selected entity types of interest can be displayed.

If two-way communications are employed, the identity of the entity can be conveyed as part of the communications thereby eliminating the requirement for the user to identify the entity as described above. A CardCard data management device <b>408</b>, or similar device, can also be used to scan the memory of a CardCard to search for data card information corresponding to an entity data card.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> depicts an exemplary second method corresponding to usage of a CardCard at an entity point-of-sale as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the second method <b>1200</b> is the same as the first method <b>200</b> except the third step <b>206</b> of distinguishing an entity of the first method <b>200</b> is more specifically defined in the third step <b>1202</b> of the second method <b>1200</b>, as using the portable conveyance device to read a magnetic stripe and/or barcode that identifies an entity of the plurality of entities for which the stored magnetic stripe and/or barcode information of the data card of the entity is required (for the POS). Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a customer having a CardCard at an entity's POS (e.g., a grocery store checkout register) could use the CardCard's magnetic stripe and/or barcode reader capabilities to read a magnetic stripe and/or barcode to identify the entity. Thereafter, the CardCard would output the appropriate magnetic stripe and/or barcode information corresponding to the data card of the entity. As such, from a customer's perspective, it would be very simple and intuitive to swipe the CardCard through an entity identifying device <b>1004</b> prior to using the CardCard with the data card reader of the entity. Depending on which of the possible configurations for the CardCard and/or a data card reader that is employed, any of various modes for identifying the entity prior to conveying the appropriate magnetic stripe and/or barcode information corresponding to the data card of the entity can be used in accordance with the invention including swiping the CardCard through one or more devices, touching the CardCard to one or more devices, and/or inserting the CardCard into one or more devices, and various combinations thereof. Ideally, a CardCard would only have to be inserted, touched, or placed into a single device, for example one configured similar to a CardCard data management device <b>408</b>, to identify the entity and output the appropriate information. But, this approach would require the modification of existing POS infrastructure to include such a device. Because such modifications occur over time, it is very likely that a version of the CardCard will at some point be configured to work with existing infrastructure and with a single device.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>a </i>depicts an exemplary CardCard display. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>a</i>, a CardCard <b>104</b> has on one side a touch screen display <b>1300</b>. The touch screen display <b>1300</b> has a first group of icons <b>1302</b> used to identify an entity type of interest (or category). A first Right Arrow <b>1304</b> and a first Left Arrow <b>1306</b> are used to cause the first group of icons <b>1302</b> displayed above to shift right or left. A user can at any time select an icon by pressing it thereby selecting an entity type of interest where typically the selected icon could somehow be identified (e.g., by a different brightness level, color, thicker border, etc.). Based on the selected entity type of interest, the entities populated in the CardCard that correspond to the selected entity type would be displayed in a second group of icons <b>1308</b> used to identify the entity for which the CardCard should output the magnetic stripe and/or barcode information corresponding to the data card of the selected entity. A second Right Arrow <b>1310</b> and a second Left Arrow <b>1312</b> are used to cause the second group of icons <b>1308</b> displayed above to shift right or left. A user can at any time select an icon by pressing it thereby selecting an entity where typically the selected icon could somehow be identified (e.g., by a different brightness level, color, thicker border, etc.). Thereafter, the CardCard <b>104</b> would output the magnetic stripe and/or barcode information corresponding to the data card of the selected entity. It should be noted that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>a </i>the CardCard is oriented in what is commonly referred to as a portrait orientation (instead of landscape orientation). The CardCard could alternatively be oriented in a landscape orientation and could be configured to recognize how it is being held by a user to change the orientation of the display from portrait to landscape and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>b </i>depicts a second exemplary CardCard display. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>b</i>, a second display <b>1320</b> is shown on one side of CardCard <b>104</b>. The second display <b>1320</b> includes a logo display area <b>1322</b> where a logo of the selected entity is displayed to identify the entity. The second display <b>1320</b> also includes a barcode display area <b>1324</b> used to display a barcode corresponding to the data card of the entity such that it can be read by a barcode reading device. It should be noted that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>b </i>the CardCard is oriented in what is commonly referred to as a landscape orientation. The CardCard could alternatively be oriented in a portrait orientation and could be configured to recognize how it is being held by a user to change the orientation of the display from portrait to landscape and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Although not required, the CardCard <b>104</b> could have substantially the same shape (i.e., length, width, and thickness) of a conventional credit card so it could be swiped through a conventional card reader and could fit in a wallet storage slot as would a conventional credit card. However, the CardCard does not necessarily have to resemble a credit card or a data card. The portable conveyance device of the present invention may alternatively be a cellular phone, a smart phone, a PDA, a watch, a keychain, or any other portable device incorporating circuitry comparable to the exemplary CardCard circuitry previously described. Such devices may utilize a non-battery power source that can be used instead of a battery <b>606</b> and may have various controls that can be used instead of pressure switches <b>608</b> and <b>610</b>. Such devices may or may not include a component that can be inserted into a slot reader. For example, an Apple IPhone could be modified to include appropriate CardCard circuitry and have a display interface to select an entity similar to what was described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>a </i>(except the arrows would not be required since the IPhone interface allows a user to use a left or right swipe to vary the icons displayed).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> depicts examples of various types of devices that could employ CardCard circuitry to enable them to provide CardCard functionality such as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the CardCard would be configured to receive a RF transmission, for example, a RFID transmission that identifies an entity, for example, the store in which the CardCard is located, causing it to display the logo and barcode corresponding to that entity (as with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In still another embodiment of the invention, the CardCard would have a voice recognition capability allowing the user to provide a voice command to identify the entity causing it to display the logo and barcode corresponding to that entity.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In yet another embodiment of the invention an entity of interest is not identified in which case when activated the CardCard would repeat the sequence of all barcodes (or subset of barcodes determined via an interface) on the CardCard and the entity would recognize the barcode that corresponds to the entity.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">While particular embodiments of the invention have been described, it will be understood, however, that the invention is not limited thereto, since modifications may be made by those skilled in the art, particularly in light of the foregoing teachings.</p>
