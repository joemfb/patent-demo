<p id="p-0004" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">The present invention generally relates to an improved process for preparing strontium ranelate and its hydrates.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">Strontium ranelate, the distrontium salt of 5-[bis(carboxymethyl)amino]-3-carboxymethyl-4-cyano-2-thiophenecarboxylic acid, is represented by the structure of Formula I.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002">
<img id="EMI-C00002" he="33.44mm" wi="65.45mm" file="US08624041-20140107-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/>
</chemistry>
<br/>
Strontium ranelate has very valuable pharmacological and therapeutic properties, especially pronounced anti-osteoporotic properties, making this compound useful in the treatment of bone diseases.
</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">EP 0415850 and related U.S. Pat. No. 5,128,367 (&#x201c;the '367 patent&#x201d;) disclose divalent metal salts of 2-[N,N-di(carboxymethyl)amino]-3-cyano4-carboxymethylthiophene-5-carboxylic acid such as strontium ranelate and its tetrahydrate, heptahydrate and octahydrate. The '367 patent further discloses the synthesis of strontium ranelate from the tetraester compound of Formula II:</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00003" num="00003">
<img id="EMI-C00003" he="29.72mm" wi="63.33mm" file="US08624041-20140107-C00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/>
</chemistry>
<br/>
wherein the process involves heating the tetraester compound of Formula II at reflux in an aqueous alcoholic medium in the presence of a sodium hydroxide solution and then hydrolyzing the heated solution in an acidic medium to provide an acid of Formula IV.
</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00004" num="00004">
<img id="EMI-C00004" he="22.35mm" wi="62.06mm" file="US08624041-20140107-C00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/>
</chemistry>
<br/>
The acid of Formula IV is thereafter converted into its sodium salt and then converted into strontium ranelate using strontium hydroxide or strontium chloride in water.
</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0010">Another process for preparing strontium ranelate disclosed in the '367 patent includes heating the tetraester compound of Formula II at reflux in a 50/50 mixture by volume of a normal sodium hydroxide solution and ethanol, distilling off the solvents to obtain the tetrasodium salt which is thereafter treated with an aqueous chloride solution of, for example, strontium dichloride.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0011">Yet another process for preparing strontium ranelate disclosed in the '367 patent includes heating the tetraester compound of Formula II at reflux in an aqueous alcoholic medium with a hydroxide, for example, strontium hydroxide. The process disclosed in the '367 patent requires heating at higher temperature, which is believed to generate impurities.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0012">However, industrial production of a compound such as strontium ranelate requires a detailed study of all the reaction steps and of the selection of the starting material reagents and solvents in order to obtain an optimum yield and purity.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0013">Accordingly, there remains a need for a simple industrial process for preparing strontium ranelate and its hydrates in relatively high purity and yield on a commercial scale in a convenient and cost efficient manner. Additionally, it would be desirable to provide a process for preparing strontium ranelate and its hydrates in a shorter reaction time and under mild reaction conditions in which the isolation of the free acid or sodium salt intermediates are completely avoided.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0038">Any lithium base can be used in step (a) of the process of the present invention. A suitable lithium base includes, but is not limited to, lithium hydroxide, lithium carbonate, lithium hydroxide monohydrate and the like and mixtures thereof. If desired, the lithium base can be an aqueous solution containing at least the lithium based. Generally, the lithium base can be present in an amount ranging from about 25% w/w to about 80% w/w and preferably from about 35% w/w to about 65% w/w.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0039">Soluble solvents for use herein include, but are not limited to, alcohols, cyclic ethers, water, ketones, nitrites, and the like and mixture thereof. In one embodiment, the solvent is one or more polar aprotic solvents. Suitable alcohol solvents include C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>10 </sub>alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, isopropyl and the like and mixtures thereof. Suitable cyclic ethers include tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and the like and mixture thereof. Suitable ketones can have from 1 to about 20 carbon atoms such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone, methyl propyl ketone, methyl isopropyl ketone, ethyl propyl ketone, ethyl isopropyl ketone, dipropyl ketone, diisopropyl ketone, methyl butyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and the like. Suitable nitrites include, but are not limited to, acetonitrile and the like. The solvent will ordinarily be present in an amount of about 1 to about 10 volumes.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0040">Suitable inorganic acid salts of strontium for use in step (a) of the process of the present invention include, but are not limited to, strontium chloride, strontium nitrate, strontium bromide, strontium sulfate and the like and mixtures thereof. Generally, the amount of the inorganic acid salt of strontium, e.g., strontium chloride, can range from about 1 mole to about 2.5 moles per one mole of the tetraester compound of Formula II.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0041">In general, step (a) of the process of the present invention can be carried out at a suitable temperature and for a sufficient period of time to form the strontium renelate or hydrate thereof. A suitable temperature will ordinarily range from about 0&#xb0; C. to about 70&#xb0; C. In another embodiment, the temperature is room temperature. The time period can range from about 15 hours to about 45 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0042">In one embodiment, the preparation of the strontium ranelate or hydrate thereof from the tetraester compound of Formula II can be via formation of a lithium salt of Formula III in situ. For example, the reaction can be carried out by forming a first solution containing at least the tetraester of Formula II, a lithium base and a first solvent such that a lithium salt of Formula III is formed in situ and then adding a second solution containing at least the inorganic acid salt of strontium and a second solvent to form strontium ranelate or a hydrate thereof. The first and second solvents can be any of the aforementioned solvents. In one embodiment, the first and second solvents are the same. In another embodiment, the first and second solvents are different. In another embodiment, the first solvent is an alcohol or cyclic ether and the second solvent is water. When water is employed as a solvent, it is ordinarily added in an amount ranging from about 3 to about 10 volumes.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0043">In another embodiment, the preparation of the strontium ranelate or hydrate thereof from the tetraester compound of Formula II can be carried out by first forming a lithium salt of Formula III; isolating the lithium salt by conventional techniques, e.g., filtration, and then reacting the lithium salt with at least the inorganic acid salt of strontium to form the strontium ranelate or hydrate thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0044">If desired, the strontium ranelate or hydrate thereof thus obtained can then be isolated and recovered. For example, when carrying out the reaction in a solvent which the reactants are relatively more soluble than the strontium ranelate or hydrate thereof, e.g., water, the strontium salt forming reaction will be accompanied by a spontaneous precipitation out of solution of the strontium ranelate or strontium ranelate hydrate. The precipitated strontium ranelate or hydrate thereof can then be recovered by conventional techniques, e.g., filtration or centrifugation, optionally followed by washing and/or drying.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0045">The strontium ranelate and its hydrates thus obtained can be of relatively high purity, e.g., a purity greater than or equal to about 99% and preferably greater than or equal to about 99.5% and in a yield of greater than about 85%, which is reproducible on an industrial scale.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0046">Yet another aspect of the present invention is directed to pharmaceutical compositions containing at least the strontium ranelate or hydrate thereof of the present invention. Such pharmaceutical compositions may be administered to a mammalian patient in any dosage form, e.g., liquid, powder, elixir, injectable solution, etc. Dosage forms may be adapted for administration to the patient by oral, buccal, parenteral, ophthalmic, rectal and transdermal routes or any other acceptable route of administration. Oral dosage forms include, but are not limited to, tablets, pills, capsules, troches, sachets, suspensions, powders, lozenges, elixirs and the like. The strontium ranelate or hydrate thereof of the present invention also may be administered as suppositories, ophthalmic ointments and suspensions, and parenteral suspensions, which are administered by other routes. The dosage forms may contain the strontium ranelate or hydrate thereof of the present invention as is or, alternatively, may contain the strontium ranelate or hydrate thereof as part of a composition. The pharmaceutical compositions may further contain one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Suitable excipients and the amounts to use may be readily determined by the formulation scientist based upon experience and consideration of standard procedures and reference works in the field, e.g., the buffering agents, sweetening agents, binders, diluents, fillers, lubricants, wetting agents and disintegrants described hereinabove.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0047">Capsule dosages will contain the strontium ranelate or hydrate thereof of the present invention within a capsule which may be coated with gelatin. Tablets and powders may also be coated with an enteric coating. The enteric-coated powder forms may have coatings containing at least phthalic acid cellulose acetate, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate, polyvinyl alcohol phthalate, carboxy methyl ethyl cellulose, a copolymer of styrene and maleic acid, a copolymer of methacrylic acid and methyl methacrylate, and like materials, and if desired, they may be employed with suitable plasticizers and/or extending agents. A coated capsule or tablet may have a coating on the surface thereof or may be a capsule or tablet comprising a powder or granules with an enteric-coating.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0048">Tableting compositions may have few or many components depending upon the tableting method used, the release rate desired and other factors. For example, the compositions of the present invention may contain diluents such as cellulose-derived materials like powdered cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, microfine cellulose, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose salts and other substituted and unsubstituted celluloses; starch; pregelatinized starch; inorganic diluents such calcium carbonate and calcium diphosphate and other diluents known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Yet other suitable diluents include waxes, sugars (e.g. lactose) and sugar alcohols like mannitol and sorbitol, acrylate polymers and copolymers, as well as pectin, dextrin and gelatin.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0049">Other excipients contemplated by the present invention include binders, such as acacia gum, pregelatinized starch, sodium alginate, glucose and other binders used in wet and dry granulation and direct compression tableting processes; disintegrants such as sodium starch glycolate, crospovidone, low-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose and others; lubricants like magnesium and calcium stearate and sodium stearyl fumarate; flavorings; sweeteners; preservatives; pharmaceutically acceptable dyes and glidants such as silicon dioxide.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0050">In one embodiment, the strontium ranelate or hydrate thereof disclosed herein for use in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can have a D<sub>50 </sub>and D<sub>90 </sub>particle size of less than about 400 microns, preferably less than about 200 microns, more preferably less than about 150 microns, still more preferably less than about 50 microns and most preferably less than about 15 microns. The term &#x201c;micronization&#x201d; used herein means any process or methods by which the size of the particles is reduced. For example, the particle sizes of the strontium ranelate or hydrate thereof can be obtained by any milling, grinding, micronizing or other particle size reduction method known in the art to bring the solid state form of the strontium ranelate or hydrate thereof of the present invention into any of the foregoing desired particle size range. As also used herein, strontium ranelate or hydrate thereof particles with reduced size are referred to as &#x201c;micronized particles of strontium ranelate or hydrate thereof&#x201d; or &#x201c;micronized strontium ranelate or hydrate thereof&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0051">Actual dosage levels of the strontium ranelate or hydrate thereof in the compositions of the invention may be varied to obtain an amount of strontium ranelate or hydrate thereof that is effective to obtain a desired therapeutic response for a particular composition and method of administration. The selected dosage level therefore depends upon such factors as, for example, the desired therapeutic effect, the route of administration, the desired duration of treatment, and other factors. The total daily dose of the compounds of this invention administered to a host in single or divided dose and can vary widely depending upon a variety of factors including, for example, the body weight, general health, sex, diet, time and route of administration, rates of absorption and excretion, combination with other drugs, the severity of the particular condition being treated, etc.</p>
