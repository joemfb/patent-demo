<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments relate to semiconductor devices and, more particularly, to a local self-boosting method of a flash memory device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Semiconductor memories are considered to be the most vital microelectronic components of digital logic system design, e.g., in computers and microprocessor-based applications ranging from satellite to customer electronics. Therefore, advances in fabrication of semiconductor memories, including process enhancements and technology developments through scaling for higher densities and faster speeds, help establish performance standards for other digital logic families.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, semiconductor memory devices are categorized as volatile memory devices or non-volatile memory devices. In volatile memory devices, logic information is stored by setting a logic state of a bistable flip-flop in case of a static random access memory (SRAM) or by charging a capacitor in case of a dynamic random access memory (DRAM). In a volatile memory device, data is stored and read while power supply is continued and lost when power supply is interrupted.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Nonvolatile memory devices (e.g., MROM, PROM, EPROM, and EEPROM) can retain their stored data even when their power supplies are interrupted. The data stored state of a non-volatile memory may be permanent or reprogrammable according to applicable manufacturing techniques. A non-volatile memory device may be used for storing programs and microcodes in a wide range of applications, e.g., computers, avionics, communications, and consumer electronic technology industries. If a system requires a non-volatile memory that is reprogrammable and is capable of promptly combining of volatile and non-volatile memory storing modes in a single chip, a non-volatile RAM (nvRAM) may be used for the system. Moreover, a certain memory structure with additional logic circuits has been developed and may optimize performance for an application oriented task.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">With non-volatile semiconductor memory devices like MROM, PROM, and EPROM, it may not be easy to erase and write data, and a general user may experience difficulties in updating memory contents. On the contrary, EEPROM may erase and write data electrically without difficulty and may become widely used in system programming for continuous updating and also auxiliary memory devices.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A flash memory device is a kind of EEPROM where a plurality of memory regions called cells can be erased or programmed through a single program operation. A conventional EEPROM enables only one memory region to be erased or programmed at onetime. This means that a flash memory device can operate at a higher and more effective speed. After a specific number of erase operations, all types of flash memories and EEPROM may wear out due to a breakdown of an insulating layer covering charge storage means used to store data.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure provides methods for use with a flash memory device including at least one string having memory cells respectively connected to wordlines and a flash memory device using the same.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some exemplary embodiments, a local self-boosting method may include forming a potential well at a channel of the string and forming potential walls at the potential well to be disposed at both sides of a channel of a selected one of the memory cells. The channel of the selected memory cell is locally limited by the potential walls and boosted when a program voltage is applied to the selected memory cell.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In other exemplary embodiments, a program method may include precharging a channel of the string according to program data, driving the wordlines with a first pass voltage, driving at least one wordline adjacent respectively to both sides of a selected one of the wordlines with a second pass voltage, and driving the selected wordline with a program voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In other exemplary embodiments, a program method may include precharging a channel of the string according to program data, driving the wordlines with a first pass voltage, driving at least one wordline adjacent respectively to both sides of a selected one of the wordlines and the other wordlines except the selected wordline with a second pass voltage, and driving the selected wordline with a program voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In still other exemplary embodiments, a flash device is provided which includes at least one string having memory cell respectively connected to wordlines and a control logic configured to control voltage to be supplied to the wordlines during a program operation. The control logic controls voltages of the wordlines such that the program operation is performed by a local self-boosting manner including forming a potential well at a channel of the string and forming potential walls at the potential well to be disposed at both sides of a channel of a selected one of the memory cells.</p>

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the flash memory device <b>100</b> may further include a row decoder circuit <b>120</b>, a voltage generator circuit <b>130</b>, a read/write circuit <b>140</b>, an input/output circuit <b>150</b>, and a control logic <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The row decoder circuit <b>120</b> may be controlled by the control logic <b>160</b> to select and drive rows of the memory cell array <b>110</b>. The row decoder circuit <b>120</b> may be configured to drive rows of the memory cell array <b>110</b> with a positive high voltage and a negative voltage. The voltage generator circuit <b>130</b> may be controlled by the control logic <b>160</b> to generate voltages (e.g., program voltage, read voltage, negative voltage, etc.) to be supplied to the memory cell array <b>110</b>.

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A flash memory device according to an exemplary embodiment of the present inventive concept may be configured to inhibit a memory cell from programming using local self-boosting. Especially, a flash memory device according to an exemplary embodiment of the present inventive concept may control a voltage of a string channel corresponding to a program-inhibited memory cell such that local self-boosting is conducted while a low voltage is not used. For example, a channel of a program-inhibited memory cell may be locally limited by potential walls. The locally limited channel (corresponding to the program-inhibited memory cell) may be boosted without charge sharing. These potential walls may be established by various wordline bias conditions, which will be described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an example of an organization of a memory cell array into memory blocks for an all bitline memory architecture or for an odd-even memory architecture. Exemplary structures of a memory cell array <b>110</b> are described. As one example, a NAND flash memory device having a memory cell array <b>110</b> partitioned into 1024 memory blocks is described. The data stored in each block may be simultaneously erased. In one embodiment, the block is the minimum unit of storage elements that are simultaneously erased. In each block, for example, there are 8512 columns corresponding to bitlines (e.g., bitlines of 1 KB). In one embodiment referred to as an all bit line (ABL) architecture, all bitlines of a memory block may be simultaneously selected during read and program operations. Storage elements along a common wordline and connected to any bitline, may be simultaneously programmed.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In an exemplary embodiment, a plurality of storage elements along a column may be serially connected to form a NAND string. One terminal of the NAND string is connected to a corresponding bitline through a select transistor controlled by a string select line SSL, and another terminal thereof is connected to a common source line CSL through a select transistor controlled by a ground select line GSL.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In another exemplary embodiment referred to as an odd-even architecture, bitlines are divided into even bitlines (BLe) and odd bit lines (BLo). In the odd/even bitline architecture, storage elements along a common wordline and connected to odd bitlines are programmed within an hour, while storage elements along a common wordline and connected to even bitlines are programmed within two hours. Data may be programmed into different blocks and read from different blocks, which may be accomplished concurrently.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In an exemplary embodiment, memory blocks of a memory cell array may be arranged to have a two- or three-dimensional array structure.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a flowchart of a program method of a flash memory device according to an exemplary embodiment of the present inventive concept. Hereinafter, a program method of a flash memory device according to an exemplary embodiment of the present inventive concept will now be described with reference to accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In operation S<b>100</b>, data to be programmed is loaded onto the read/write circuit <b>140</b> through the input/output circuit <b>150</b> under the control of the control logic <b>160</b>. The read/write circuit <b>140</b> may include page buffers connected to each bitline or each pair of bitlines along a bitline structure. For example, in case of an ABL structure, the read/write circuit <b>140</b> may include page buffers connected to each bitline. In case of an odd/even bitline structure, the read/write circuit <b>140</b> may include page buffers connected to each pair of bitlines (BLo and BLe). After the data to be programmed is loaded onto the read/write circuit <b>140</b>, i.e., page buffers, the flow proceeds to operation S<b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the operation S<b>120</b>, channels of strings may be precharged according to loaded data under the wordline bias condition that wordlines are driven with a predetermined voltage (e.g., 0 volt or higher voltage or lower voltage). For example, when loaded data is data &#x2018;1&#x2019; indicating program inhibition of a memory cell, a string channel may be precharged to a voltage of Vcc&#x2212;Vth under the above wordline bias condition (Vcc being a power supply voltage supplied to a bitline, and Vth being a threshold voltage of a string select transistor). On the other hand, when loaded data is data &#x2018;0&#x2019; indicating programming of a memory cell, a string channel may be precharged to a ground voltage under the above wordline bias condition. During the channel precharge operation, a string select line SSL and a ground select line GSL may be biased to a power supply voltage and a ground voltage, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">When the channel precharge operation is completed, the flow precedes to operation S<b>140</b> (program execution operation S<b>140</b>) in which memory cells belonging to a selected wordline (the memory cells including memory cells to be programmed and memory cells to be program-inhibited) are substantially programmed. Particularly, the flash memory device <b>100</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the present inventive concept may perform program inhibition of memory cells by means of a local self-boosting scheme. In case of a flash memory device according to an exemplary embodiment of the present inventive concept, a low voltage for dividing a string channel may not be provided to a wordline (wordlines) adjacent to a selected wordline. Although a low voltage for dividing a string channel may not be provided to a wordline (wordlines) adjacent to a selected wordline, a channel of a memory cell to be program-inhibited may be locally self-boosted. The local self-boosting may be done by locally limiting the channel of a memory cell to be program-inhibited via potential walls, which may be achieved under various wordline bias conditions and will be described in detail later. Memory cells may be selectively programmed under the condition.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In operation S<b>160</b>, whether the programming of the selected memory cells is &#x201c;PASS&#x201d; determined. This may be done based on data read from memory cells. For example, the read/write circuit <b>140</b> reads data from selected memory cells through bitlines in compliance with the control of the control logic <b>160</b>. A pass/fail check circuit (not shown) of the control logic <b>160</b> may check whether bits of the read data are all pass or if any fail. The pass/fail circuit may be embodied using various manners. For example, a pass/fail check circuit may check whether programming is &#x201c;PASS&#x201d; using a wired OR manner, a column scanning manner, or any manner known in the art. If a checking result is &#x201c;PASS&#x201d;, the flow comes to an end. On the other hand, if the check result is &#x201c;FAILURE&#x201d;, the flow proceeds to the operation S<b>120</b>. The operations S<b>120</b>&#x2dc;S<b>160</b> are repeated until checking the programming of the selected memory cells is &#x201c;PASS&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">An example of a pass/fail check circuit is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,282,121 entitled in &#x201c;FLASH MEMORY DEVICE WITH PROGRAM STATUS DETECTION CIRCUITRY AND THE METHOD THEREOF&#x201d;, which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">According to an exemplary embodiment, the above-described operations S<b>120</b>&#x2dc;S<b>160</b> may constitute a program loop. During repetition of the program loop, a program voltage may increase operation by operation.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Exemplary embodiments of wordline bias conditions required for the local self-boosting described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> will now be described below with reference to accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">For the convenience of description, a local self-boosting method will now be described with reference to one string channel corresponding to a memory cell to be program-inhibited.

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">When a string channel corresponding to a memory cell to be program-inhibited is precharged, as fully understood, it may be floated.

As the wordlines WL<b>0</b>&#x2dc;WL<b>15</b> are driven with the first pass voltage Vpass<b>1</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, a global potential wall <b>201</b> may be formed at a string channel. Thereafter, wordlines (e.g., WL<b>8</b> and WL<b>9</b>) adjacent to the upper side of the selected wordline WL<b>7</b> and wordlines (e.g., WL<b>4</b> and WL<b>5</b>) adjacent to the lower side of the selected wordline WL<b>7</b> may be driven with a second pass voltage Vpass<b>2</b> by the row decoder circuit <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">According to an exemplary embodiment, the first pass voltage Vpass<b>1</b> may be higher by the second pass voltage Vpass<b>2</b> by &#x394;V. The first pass voltage Vpass<b>1</b> may be determined to the degree where pass voltage disturbance does not occur. The first and second pass voltages Vpass<b>1</b> and Vpass<b>2</b> may be determined within a pass voltage window. The &#x394;V may be experimentally determined considering a pass voltage, the number of cells, the number of electrons in a channel, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to an exemplary embodiment, a wordline (e.g., WL<b>8</b>) adjacent to the upper side of a selected wordline WL<b>7</b> and a wordline (e.g., WL<b>6</b>) adjacent to the lower side of the selected wordline WL<b>7</b> may be driven with the second pass voltage Vpass<b>2</b>. It will be understood that the number of wordlines adjacent to opposite sides of the selected wordline WL<b>7</b> is not limited to that disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As wordlines WL<b>8</b> and WL<b>9</b> are driven with the second pass voltage Vpass<b>2</b>, a potential wall <b>202</b> may be formed at a channel below the wordlines WL<b>8</b> and WL<b>9</b>. Similarly, as the wordlines WL<b>5</b> and WL<b>6</b> are driven with the second pass voltage Vpass<b>2</b>, a potential wall <b>203</b> may be formed at a channel below the wordlines WL<b>5</b> and WL<b>6</b>. In this case, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, a potential well <b>204</b> defined by the potential walls <b>202</b> and <b>203</b> may be formed at a channel below the selected wordline WL<b>7</b>. Moreover, a potential well <b>205</b> may be formed at the upper side of the well potential well <b>202</b> and a potential well <b>206</b> may be formed at the lower side of the potential well <b>203</b>.</p>

With the electron migration, electron deficiency may occur at the potential walls <b>202</b> and <b>203</b> (especially, edge portions (dotted portions) of potential walls). The migration of the electrons through a string channel may be limited by the potential walls <b>202</b> and <b>203</b>, i.e., electron deficiency. This means the string channel is cut by the potential walls <b>202</b> and <b>203</b>. In other words, a local channel corresponding to the potential well <b>204</b> may be electrically disconnected from local channels each corresponding to each of the potential walls <b>205</b> and <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Afterwards, the selected wordline WL<b>7</b> may be driven with a program voltage Vpgm by the row decoder circuit <b>120</b>.

Electrons of the potential walls <b>202</b> and <b>204</b> may additionally migrate to the potential well <b>204</b>. Thus, the local channel corresponding to the potential well <b>204</b> may be electrically and more strongly disconnected from the local channels each corresponding to each of the potential wells <b>205</b> and <b>206</b>. That is, charge sharing does not occur between the local channel corresponding to the potential well <b>204</b> and the local channels each corresponding to each of the potential wells <b>205</b> and <b>206</b>. As the selected wordline WL<b>7</b> is driven with the program voltage Vpgm, a channel defined by the potential walls <b>202</b> and <b>203</b> may be locally boosted.

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Since a string channel including a memory cell to be programmed is connected to a bitline driven with a ground voltage, the above-described voltage change of the string channel may not occur.

Wordlines (e.g., WL<b>8</b> and WL<b>9</b>) adjacent to the upper side of the selected wordline WL<b>7</b> and wordlines (e.g., WL<b>4</b> and WL<b>5</b>) adjacent to the lower side of the selected wordline WL<b>7</b> may be driven with a first pass voltage Vpass<b>1</b> by the row decoder circuit <b>120</b>. The selected wordline WL<b>7</b> may be driven with a program voltage Vpgm by the row decoder circuit <b>120</b>. As the selected wordline WL<b>7</b> is driven with the program voltage Vpgm, a channel below the selected wordline WL<b>7</b> may be locally boosted. That is, local self-boosting may occur and thus a memory cell connected to the selected wordline WL<b>7</b> may be program-inhibited. The channel potential change according to the wordline bias condition is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>. Charge deficiency may occur at edge portions (dotted portions) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>. As set forth above, due to the charge deficiency, a channel of a program-inhibited memory cell may be locally limited.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">According to an exemplary embodiment, a wordline (e.g., WL<b>8</b>) adjacent to the upper side of a selected wordline WL<b>7</b> and a wordline (e.g., WL<b>6</b>) adjacent to the lower side of the selected wordline WL<b>7</b> may be driven with a first pass voltage Vpass<b>1</b>. It will be understood that the number of wordlines adjacent to opposite sides of the selected wordline WL<b>7</b> is not limited to that disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Since a string channel including a memory cell to be programmed is connected to a bitline driven with a ground voltage, the above-described voltage change of the string channel may not occur. For this reason, the memory cell may be programmed by a well-known mechanism.</p>

The selected wordline WL<b>7</b> may be driven with a program voltage Vpgm by the row decoder circuit <b>120</b>. As the selected wordline WL<b>7</b> is driven with the program voltage Vpgm, a channel below the selected wordline WL<b>7</b> may be locally boosted.
