<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of a Japanese Patent Application No. 2002-347985 filed Nov. 29, 2002, in the Japanese Patent Office, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention generally relates to work support methods, work support apparatuses and computer-readable storage media, and more particularly to a work support method suited for assigning work, a work support apparatus which employs such a work support method, and a computer-readable storage medium which stores a program for causing a computer to carry out such a work support method.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, the work assignment for a certain work is made by assigning each worker based on job time information which is obtained from skill factors including proficiency and capacity of each worker, as proposed in a Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 10-261122, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a case where the worker is an employee, the skill management of the employee can be made accurately by holding training seminars within the employer company, receiving reports on qualifications obtained by the employee, and the like. In addition, it is to a certain extent possible to grasp the personality of the employee. Hence, it is possible to easily convert such information into numerical values and manage the numerical values.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, the work format or environment is changing. Instead of the employee commuting to an employer company and doing the work, the work may be done by people called &#x201c;teleworkers&#x201d;. The teleworker is not an employee of a company but do the work for this company by receiving an order from this company directly or indirectly via an intermediating agent or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The teleworker is basically not an employee of a company. For this reason, it is difficult to obtain accurate proficiency information of the teleworker and manage the proficiency information in the form of numerical values. For example, the proficiency information of the teleworker is based on information submitted by the teleworker himself to the intermediating agent or, is determined by the intermediating agent based on a work history of the teleworker with respect to the work assigned to the teleworker in the past by the intermediating agent. The work assignment to the teleworker must be made based on such proficiency information which may not always be accurate.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The work assigned to the teleworker is made based on a work contract signed between the company that places the order and the individual teleworker who receives the order. Hence, it is generally considered that the reliability of the work with regard to the quality and time limit of delivery is poorer compared to the case where the company places the order to the employee thereof or to another company. As a result, there is a tendency not to place the order of important work to the teleworker, thereby accounting for one of the reasons the work orders to the teleworkers are not increasing.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, it is a general object of the present invention to provide a novel and useful work support method, work support apparatus and computer-readable storage medium, in which the problems described above are eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another and more specific object of the present invention is to provide a work support method, a work support apparatus and a computer-readable storage medium, which output support information related to work assignment when work order information is received, based on the work order information and skill information of individuals which is successively stored and updated, so that a manager who manages the work order can make a suitable work assignment.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Still another specific object of the present invention is to provide a work support method, a work support apparatus and a computer-readable storage medium, which manage work contents and showings of past work of each of teleworkers, and a history of trainings received by each of the teleworkers, and also manage schedules of the teleworkers so as to improve reliability of the work performed by the teleworkers.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A further object of the present invention is to provide a work support method comprising storing skill information of workers in a skill information storage section; storing work item information with respect to a work in a work item information storage section; storing worker information of each work item with respect to the work in a work information storage section; and extracting a worker corresponding to each work item by referring to the skill information storage section and storing the extracted worker in the work information storage section, with respect to each work item stored in the work item information storage section, in response to a work order. According to the work support method of the present invention, it is possible to output support information related to work assignment when work order information is received, based on the work order information and skill information of individuals which is successively stored and updated, so that a manager who manages the work order can make a suitable work assignment. In addition, it is possible to manage work contents and showings of past work of each worker, and a history of trainings received by each worker, and also manage schedules of each worker so as to improve reliability of the work performed by the workers.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another object of the present invention is to provide a work support method adapted to a work support apparatus comprising a skill information storage section to store skill information of workers, a work item information storage section to store work item information with respect to a work, and a work information storage section to store worker information of each work item with respect to the work, the work support method comprising extracting a worker corresponding to each work item by referring to the skill information storage section and storing the extracted worker in the work information storage section, with respect to each work item stored in the work item information storage section, in response to a work order. According to the work support method of the present invention, it is possible to output support information related to work assignment when work order information is received, based on the work order information and skill information of individuals which is successively stored and updated, so that a manager who manages the work order can make a suitable work assignment. In addition, it is possible to manage work contents and showings of past work of each worker, and a history of trainings received by each worker, and also manage schedules of each worker so as to improve reliability of the work performed by the workers.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Still another object of the present invention is to provide a work support apparatus comprising a skill information storage section to store skill information of workers; a work item information storage section to store work item information with respect to a work; a work information storage section to store worker information of each work item with respect to the work; and a worker extracting section to extract a worker corresponding to each work item by referring to the skill information storage section and storing the extracted worker in the work information storage section, with respect to each work item stored in the work item information storage section, in response to a work order.

<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Next, a description will be given of a teleworker selecting process which is carried out by the person in charge of placing work order to the teleworkers at the ordering company that owns the company terminal <b>4</b>, by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. This person in charge operates the company terminal <b>4</b> to place the work order with respect to the server <b>7</b> which registers and updates the information related to the teleworkers. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is a flow chart for explaining the teleworker selecting process. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, it is assumed for the sake of convenience that the processes of the server <b>7</b> related to the communication with the company terminal <b>5</b> are carried out by the project accepting section <b>702</b>, the processes of the server <b>7</b> related to the actual teleworker selecting process are carried out by the teleworker selecting section <b>703</b>, and the communication with other terminals and servers is made by the communicating section <b>713</b> via the communication network <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">First, when the person in charge operates the company terminal <b>4</b> to select the teleworker to which the work order is to be placed, an ordering screen <b>911</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref> is displayed on the company terminal <b>4</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref> is a diagram showing a display of the ordering screen <b>911</b> for placing the work order to the teleworker. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref>, the ordering screen <b>911</b> includes input fields to input information related to a company ID, a project name, a desired delivery date, a desired price, a priority order, and a backup which will be described later. The priority order indicates the order of priority of the conditions, that is, the desired delivery date and the desired price. The ordering screen <b>911</b> also includes a &#x201c;send&#x201d; button which is selected when sending the work order information to the server <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">When the person in charge inputs the work ordering information into the input fields of the ordering screen <b>911</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref>, an ordering screen <b>912</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</figref> is displayed on the company terminal <b>4</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</figref> is a diagram showing a display of the ordering screen <b>912</b> after the ordering information is input on the ordering screen <b>911</b>. In this particular case, (1) the desired delivery date has a higher priority than (2) the desired price, because &#x201c;(1)&#x2192;(2)&#x201d; is input to the input field of the priority order.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The field to input the backup indicates &#x201c;YES&#x201d; when the backup may be used, and &#x201c;NO&#x201d; when no backup may be used. In a case where the selected teleworker cannot complete the work by the desired delivery date due to some reason but the selected teleworker is permitted to receive assistance from an alternate teleworker or to have the alternate teleworker take over and continue the work so as to meet the desired delivery date, the person in charge indicates in the ordering information that the backup may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The teleworker is different from a normal employee of a company, such as the employee of the ordering company that owns the company terminal <b>4</b>, and it is difficult to positively bind the work hours of the teleworker. In addition, in the work support system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the ordering company may wish to use a teleworker at a remote location. In this situation, it is difficult for the ordering company or the intermediating agent to confirm the progress of the work order to the teleworker at the remote location. For these reasons, it may be regarded that the probability of meeting the desired delivery date is poorer when the teleworker performs the work, compared to the case where the employee of the ordering company performs the work. The backup is used to prevent such inconveniences and ensure that the delivery date is met.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The alternate teleworker, who assists or takes over from the originally selected teleworker, basically does not work unless the work performed by the originally selected teleworker is delayed. But since the alternate teleworker cannot perform other work during a time the backup may be required, that is, during a time when the originally selected teleworker performs the work, it is necessary to pay the alternate teleworker who stands by for the possible backup. However, from the point of view of the ordering company, it is unreasonable to pay the fees for two teleworkers, that is, twice the normal fees, with respect to a single work item. For this reason, this embodiment increases the normal fees by 20% when the backup may be used, which is more reasonable for the ordering company. On the other hand, the alternate teleworker is guaranteed at least 20% of the normal fees for standing by as the backup, regardless of whether the alternate teleworker assists or takes over from the originally selected teleworker. The information necessary to calculate the fees for the originally selected teleworker and the alternate teleworker for the case where the backup may be used, is managed by the server <b>7</b>, and the work order from the company terminal <b>4</b> is sent to the teleworker terminal <b>6</b> or the intermediating agent terminal <b>5</b> based on the managed information.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Accordingly, it is possible to place a work order for the work which will positively be delivered by the delivery date at a cost which is considerably lower than the fees for using two teleworkers for a single work item, even when the alternate teleworker is used for the backup. As a result, the use of the backup provides a kind of &#x201c;insurance&#x201d; with respect to the work order to teleworkers, thereby making it safer and more reliable to place work orders to the teleworkers.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In addition, the alternate teleworker is guaranteed at least 20% of the normal fees for standing by as the backup, even when the alternate teleworker actually does not assist or take over from the originally selected teleworker. Consequently, although the 20% of the normal fees may sound low, it may be regarded that the alternate teleworker is unlikely to refuse accepting the backup work. Therefore, the ordering company or the intermediating agent can easily and smoothly place the work order to the teleworkers using the backup.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">When the person in charge selects the &#x201c;send&#x201d; button on the ordering screen <b>912</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</figref> after inputting the work ordering information, the company terminal <b>4</b> sends the input work ordering information to the server <b>7</b> in a step <b>5001</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> shows the teleworker selecting process for a case where the intermediating agent is used.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The server <b>7</b> receives the work ordering information from the company terminal <b>4</b>, and relays the work ordering information to the intermediating agent terminal <b>5</b> which is owned by the intermediating agent who intermediates between the ordering company and the teleworkers, in a step <b>5002</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The intermediating agent terminal <b>5</b> receives the work ordering information relayed from the server <b>7</b> in a step <b>5003</b>, and displays a project information input screen <b>913</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25A</figref> in a step <b>5004</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25A</figref> is a diagram showing the project information input screen <b>913</b> for ordering teleworker work from the intermediating agent. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25A</figref>, the work ordering information related to the ordering company ID, the project name, the desired delivery date, the desired price and the priority order, and an input field to input the project are displayed on the project information input screen <b>913</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The intermediating agent considers the work and inputs the project information on the project information input screen <b>913</b> by operating the intermediating agent terminal <b>5</b> in a step <b>5005</b>. As a result, a project information input screen <b>914</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25B</figref> is displayed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25B</figref> is a diagram showing the project information input screen <b>914</b> which is input with the various project information. Since the work in this embodiment relates to creating the homepage, the input field to input the project in the project information input screen <b>914</b> is input with &#x201c;director&#x201d;, &#x201c;designer&#x201d; and &#x201c;programmer&#x201d;, to indicate that the project is made up of three projects.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">After the project information is input, when the intermediating agent operates the intermediating agent terminal <b>5</b> to send the input project information, the intermediating agent terminal <b>5</b> sends the input project information to the server <b>7</b> in a step <b>5006</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">The server <b>7</b> receives the input project information from the intermediating agent terminal <b>5</b> in a step <b>5007</b>. In addition, the server <b>7</b> extracts from the work item information storage section <b>704</b> the work item information corresponding to each received project information, in a step <b>5008</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">After setting the time of each work process from the start of each project, by setting the starting year, month and day and the ending year, month and day, for example, the server <b>7</b> refers to the acquiring skill level storage section <b>705</b>, the delivery rank information storage section <b>706</b>, the integrated level information storage section <b>707</b>, and the individual schedule information storage section <b>710</b>, and to search for a teleworker who satisfies a certain condition, in a step <b>5009</b>. In this case, the teleworker whose schedule is free during the time when each work process of the projects is to be performed, and simultaneously satisfies both the &#x201c;desired delivery date&#x201d; and &#x201c;desired price&#x201d; included in the received project information, satisfies the certain condition.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">As described above, the unit price of each teleworker (unit price charged by each teleworker) is determined by the integrated level of the teleworker for the work item. Hence, if the cost is to be suppressed to a low value but the time to the date of delivery is relatively long, a combination of the teleworkers having a relatively low integrated level may be selected from the integrated level information storage section <b>707</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">On the other hand, if the time to the date of delivery is relatively short and the cost is set to a high value, a combination of the teleworkers who can meet the date of delivery with a high reliability and even cope with early delivery before the desired date of delivery, may be selected from the integrated level information storage section <b>707</b>. For example, if the delivery rank <b>301</b> is set in the delivery rank information storage section <b>706</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a combination of the teleworkers having the delivery rank <b>301</b> greater than or equal to &#x201c;3&#x201d; may be selected with priority over other teleworkers, so as to be able to cope with early delivery before the desired date of delivery.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Of course, other searches for the teleworkers satisfying the certain condition may be made to find an optimum teleworker combination.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In a case where the teleworkers cannot meet the desired price or the desired date of delivery, the server <b>7</b> refers to the priority order information included in the received project information, and confirms whether the desired price or the desired date of delivery is to have the priority over the other. In this embodiment, the desired date of delivery has the priority over the desired price as may be seen from the ordering screen <b>912</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</figref>, and for this reason, the teleworker combination which can meet the desired date of delivery is searched even if the price becomes higher than the desired price. On the other hand, if the desired price has the priority over the desired date of delivery, the teleworker combination which can meet the desired price is searched even if the date of delivery becomes later than the desired date of delivery.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">The server <b>7</b> decides whether or not the teleworker combination satisfying the certain condition is found, in a step <b>5010</b>. If the decision result in the step <b>5010</b> is YES, the process advances to a step <b>5012</b> which will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">If neither the desired price nor the desired delivery date cannot be met and the decision result in the step <b>5010</b> is NO, even after the search described above, the process advances to a step <b>5011</b>. In the step <b>5011</b>, the server <b>7</b> performs the search, by including in the search the teleworker who has not yet reached the desired delivery rank at the present but is expected to be able to perform the work with respect to the work item after receiving the training during the work period. More particularly, the server <b>7</b> makes a reference to the individual skill information of each teleworker, by referring to the individual skill information storage section <b>709</b>. Since the individual skill information includes the scheduled end date when the training will be completed as described above in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, it may be assumed that the teleworker will have the improved delivery rank after the scheduled end date. Hence, the search is made by including the teleworker who will have the desired delivery rank which satisfies the certain condition after the scheduled end date. The process advances to the step <b>5012</b> after the step <b>5011</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">In this embodiment, the search including the teleworker who is expected to complete the training required to achieve the desired delivery rank is made after making the search excluding the teleworker who is expected to complete the training. This is to more positively ensure the delivery of the work, because the training of the teleworker may be delayed, and the teleworker immediately after achieving the desired delivery rank is still not as experienced as the teleworker who originally has the desired delivery rank.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">When the search for the teleworker combination by the server <b>7</b> is completed and the teleworker combination to perform the work with respect to each work item is determined, the teleworker information is stored in the temporary storage section <b>712</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> is a diagram showing tables <b>1210</b>, <b>1220</b> and <b>1230</b> of the teleworker information stored in the temporary storage section <b>712</b>.

<p id="p-0149" num="0148">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, each of the tables <b>1210</b>, <b>1220</b> and <b>1230</b> stores a work item <b>1201</b>, a teleworker ID <b>1202</b> of the teleworker to perform the work, and a processing time <b>1204</b>. A backup teleworker <b>1203</b> is not yet stored in the tables <b>1210</b>, <b>1220</b> and <b>1230</b> at this stage.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Thereafter, the server <b>7</b> makes an inquiry process to inquire the teleworker terminal <b>6</b> whether or not the work can be performed, in a step <b>5012</b>. This inquiry process may be performed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> is a flow chart for explaining a procedure for performing this inquiry process.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">In a step <b>6001</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, the server <b>7</b> notifies the work items, that is, the work contents, to the teleworker terminal <b>6</b> of each teleworker who is selected and stored in the temporary storage section <b>712</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The teleworker terminal <b>6</b> receives the work items from the server <b>7</b> in a step <b>6002</b>, and displays the received work items on a work order accepting screen <b>915</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, in a step <b>6003</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> is a diagram showing a display of the work order accepting screen <b>915</b> on the teleworker terminal <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">The teleworker operates the teleworker terminal <b>6</b> to input information indicating whether or not the teleworker will accept the work order, in a step <b>6004</b>. In this particular case, a &#x201c;YES&#x201d; button on the work order accepting screen <b>915</b> is selected when accepting the work order, and a &#x201c;NO&#x201d; button is selected when not accepting the work order. Then, the teleworker terminal <b>6</b> sends the information indicating whether or not the teleworker will accept the work order, to the server <b>7</b>, in a step <b>6005</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">The server <b>7</b> receives from the teleworker terminal <b>6</b> the information indicating whether or not the teleworker will accepts the work order, in a step <b>6006</b>. Then, the server <b>7</b> decides whether or not the received information indicates that the teleworker will accept the work order, in a step <b>6007</b>. The process advances to a step <b>6016</b> which will be described later if the decision result in the step <b>6007</b> is YES. On the other hand, if the decision result in the step <b>6007</b> is NO, the server <b>7</b> searches for another teleworker other than the teleworker who sent the information indicating that the teleworker cannot accept the work order, in a step <b>6008</b>. More particularly, the step <b>6008</b> refers to the individual skill information storage section <b>709</b>, the individual schedule information storage section <b>710</b> and the project information storage section <b>711</b>, and searches for the other teleworker satisfying a predetermined condition, that is, the other teleworker whose schedule is free during the time the work items were scheduled to be performed by the teleworker who could not accept the work order and has a technical skill level comparable to that of the teleworker who could not accept the work order.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">The server <b>7</b> decides whether or not the other teleworker satisfying the predetermined condition is found. If the decision result in the step <b>6009</b> is NO, the server <b>7</b> performs a search in a step <b>6010</b> by including in the search the teleworker who has not yet reached the desired delivery rank at the present but is expected to be able to perform the work with respect to the work item after receiving the training during the work period, similarly to the step <b>5011</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The process advances to a step <b>6011</b> if the decision result in the step <b>6009</b> is YES or after the step <b>6010</b>. The server <b>7</b> makes a work order notification with respect to the teleworker terminal <b>6</b> of the teleworker who is newly selected by the above described procedure, in the step <b>6011</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">The work order notification from the server <b>7</b> is processed in steps <b>6012</b> through <b>6014</b> by the teleworker terminal <b>6</b> of the teleworker who is newly selected, similarly to the steps <b>6002</b> through <b>6004</b> described above. In addition, the teleworker terminal <b>6</b> sends information indicating whether or not the teleworker will accept the work order, to the server <b>7</b>, in a step <b>6015</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">In response to the information received from the teleworker terminal <b>6</b>, the server <b>7</b> repeats the processes of the steps <b>6006</b> through <b>6011</b> until the decision result in the step <b>6007</b> becomes YES. If the decision result in the step <b>6007</b> is YES, the server <b>7</b> updates the teleworker ID of the corresponding work item in the temporary storage section <b>712</b> to the teleworker ID of the teleworker terminal <b>6</b> (or teleworker) from which the information indicating that the teleworker will accept the work order is received, and thereafter performs processes similar to those described above with respect to the other teleworkers in a step <b>6016</b>. The procedure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> ends when the teleworkers for all work items are determined.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">By completing the above-described procedure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, the teleworker IDs (teleworker information) of the teleworkers who are determined to perform the accepted work order are stored in the temporary storage section <b>712</b> for each work item, and this teleworker information is stored in the project information storage section <b>711</b> in a step <b>5013</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Next, the server <b>7</b> refers to the information which is included in the project information received from the intermediating agent terminal <b>4</b> and indicates whether or not the backup may be used, and decides whether or not the backup is to be used in a step <b>5014</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> is a flow chart for explaining the teleworker selecting process. The step <b>5014</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> is carried out after the step <b>5013</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">If the decision result in the step <b>5014</b> is NO, the server <b>7</b> does not perform the processes for using the backup, and the process advances to a step <b>5018</b> which will be described later. On the other hand, if the decision result in the step <b>5014</b> is YES, the server <b>7</b> selects from the teleworkers having the teleworker information not stored in the temporary storage section <b>712</b>, that is, the teleworkers who have not yet been selected, the teleworker having a technical skill level comparable to or higher than that of the teleworker who accepted the work order, with respect to each selected work item, in a step <b>5015</b>. The selection of the teleworker in the step <b>5015</b> may be carried out similarly to the step <b>5009</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> described above which selects the teleworker satisfying the certain condition, and a description thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">The server <b>7</b> makes an inquiry process to inquire the teleworker terminal <b>6</b> whether or not the work can be performed, in a step <b>5016</b>. The inquiry process of the step <b>5016</b> may be performed similarly to the step <b>5012</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, that is, the steps <b>6001</b> through <b>6016</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, except for the following two points.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">First, in the case of the step <b>5016</b>, the information which is sent in the step <b>6011</b>, that is, the information displayed in the step <b>6013</b>, is different from that of the step <b>5012</b>. In the case of the step <b>5016</b>, a backup work order screen <b>916</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> is displayed on the server <b>7</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> is a diagram showing a display of the backup work order screen <b>916</b>. As described above, the alternate (or backup) teleworker is guaranteed at least 20% of the normal fees for standing by as the backup, regardless of whether the alternate teleworker assists or takes over from the originally selected teleworker. The backup work order screen <b>916</b> includes information indicating whether or not the alternate teleworker accepts the backup work order. In the backup work order screen <b>916</b>, a &#x201c;YES&#x201d; button is selected when accepting the backup work order, and a &#x201c;NO&#x201d; button is selected when not accepting the backup work order.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Second, when the alternate teleworker accepts the backup work order, the step <b>5016</b> updates the teleworker ID, but in the case of the step <b>5012</b>, the teleworker ID is stored in the backup teleworker <b>1203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">After the step <b>5016</b> is completed, the server <b>7</b> stores the corresponding teleworker information in the teleworker ID <b>1202</b> of the teleworker to perform the work and the backup teleworker <b>1203</b> of the tables <b>1210</b>, <b>1220</b> and <b>1230</b> of the teleworker information stored in the temporary storage section <b>712</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>. Based on the information shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, the server <b>7</b> updates or replaces the information stored in the project information storage section <b>711</b> in the step <b>5013</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, in a step <b>5017</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> is a diagram showing the information stored in the project information storage section <b>711</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">After the process of the step <b>5017</b> is completed, the server <b>7</b> sends information such as the determined teleworkers, price, date of delivery and the like to the intermediating agent terminal <b>5</b> in a step <b>5018</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">The intermediating agent terminal <b>5</b> receives the information, such as the determined teleworkers, price and date of delivery, from the server <b>7</b>, in a step <b>5019</b>. Then, the intermediating agent terminal <b>5</b> displays a teleworker selection screen <b>917</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, in a step <b>5020</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> is a diagram showing a display of the teleworker selection screen <b>917</b> on the intermediating agent terminal <b>5</b>. The teleworker selection screen <b>917</b> includes a total work time, a total price and a backup price (price of backup), as well as information indicating the teleworkers who are to perform each work item. In this particular case, one teleworker selection screen <b>917</b> is prepared for each work item, and the intermediating agent operates the intermediating agent terminal <b>5</b> to switch the teleworker selection screen <b>917</b> for each work item, so as to confirm the contents of the selected teleworkers. However, if the size of the display permits, one teleworker selection screen may be displayed for a plurality of work items, so that the contents of the selected teleworkers can be confirmed simultaneously for a plurality of work items.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">In this embodiment, there is only one final teleworker selection pattern. However, it is possible to select the teleworkers with a plurality of teleworker selection patterns, and finally select one of the plurality of teleworker selection patterns on the teleworker selection screen <b>917</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">The intermediating agent operates the intermediating agent terminal <b>5</b> to input selection information indicating whether or not the work may be performed under the condition displayed on the teleworker selection screen <b>917</b>, in a step <b>5021</b>. In this particular case, an &#x201c;execute&#x201d; button on the teleworker selection screen <b>917</b> is selected when permitting the work, and a &#x201c;cancel&#x201d; button is selected when not permitting the work. The intermediating agent terminal <b>5</b> decides whether or not the input selection information indicates that the work may be performed under the condition displayed on the teleworker selection screen <b>917</b>, in a step <b>5022</b>. The process returns to the step <b>6006</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> if the decision result in the step <b>5022</b> is NO, so as to set the condition over again. On the other hand, if the decision result in the step <b>5022</b> is YES, the intermediating agent terminal <b>5</b> sends confirmation information indicating that the work may be performed under the condition displayed on the teleworker selection screen <b>917</b>, that is, the work order acceptance confirmation information, to the server <b>7</b>, in a step <b>5023</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">The server <b>7</b> receives the work order acceptance confirmation information from the intermediating agent terminal <b>5</b>, and sends work order acceptance information indicating acceptance of the work order for the project to the company terminal <b>4</b>, in a step <b>5024</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">The company terminal <b>4</b> receives the work order acceptance information from the server <b>7</b> in a step <b>5025</b>, and the process advances to a step <b>5026</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> is a flowchart for explaining a teleworker selection process.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, the company terminal <b>4</b> displays the received work order acceptance information on a work order acceptance confirmation screen <b>918</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> is a diagram showing a display of the work order acceptance confirmation screen <b>918</b> on the company terminal <b>4</b>. The teleworker information is displayed on the intermediating agent terminal <b>4</b>, but the teleworker information is not the most important information for the ordering company that places the work order. Hence, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, the work order acceptance confirmation screen <b>918</b> includes information other than the teleworker information, so as to facilitate confirmation of the acceptance of the work order.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">The person in charge at the ordering company operates the company terminal <b>4</b> while inspecting the information displayed on the work order acceptance confirmation screen <b>918</b>, and inputs confirmation information indicating whether or not to permit the confirmed work order, in a step <b>5027</b>. In this particular case, an &#x201c;execute&#x201d; button on the work order acceptance confirmation screen <b>918</b> is selected when permitting the confirmed work order, and a &#x201c;cancel&#x201d; button is selected when not permitting the confirmed work order. The company terminal <b>4</b> sends the confirmation information to the server <b>7</b>, in a step <b>5028</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">The server <b>7</b> receives the confirmation information from the company terminal <b>4</b>, and relays the confirmation information to the intermediating agent terminal <b>5</b>, in a step <b>5029</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">The intermediating agent terminal <b>5</b> receives the confirmation information relayed via the server <b>7</b>, in a step <b>5030</b>. In addition, the intermediating agent terminal <b>5</b> decides whether or not the confirmation information indicates that the confirmed work order is permitted, in a step <b>5031</b>. The process returns to the step <b>5005</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> if the decision result in the step <b>5031</b> is NO, so as to perform the teleworker selecting process over again under another condition. On the other hand, if the decision result in the step <b>5031</b> is YES, the intermediating agent terminal <b>5</b> sends work reservation information to the server <b>7</b>, in a step <b>5032</b>. The work reservation information indicates that the work related to the project is formally reserved.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">The server <b>7</b> receives the work reservation information from the intermediating agent terminal <b>5</b>, in a step <b>5033</b>. Furthermore, the server <b>7</b> performs a work order notification with respect to the teleworker terminal <b>5</b>, in a step <b>5034</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> is a flow chart for explaining a teleworker notifying process performed by the step <b>5034</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, the server <b>7</b> makes a formal work order notification with respect to the teleworker terminal <b>6</b> of each selected teleworker, in a step <b>7001</b>. The teleworker terminal <b>6</b> receives the formal work order notification from the server <b>7</b> in a step <b>7002</b>, and displays the formal work order notification in a step <b>7003</b>. Hence, each selected teleworker can recognize from the formal work order notification displayed on the teleworker terminal <b>6</b> that a formal work order has been received.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">Then, the server <b>7</b> refers to the project information stored in the project information storage section <b>711</b>, and updates each individual schedule information stored in the individual schedule information storage section <b>710</b> depending on the project information, in a step <b>5035</b>. Thereafter, the server <b>7</b> sends a reservation completion notification, indicating the completion of the reservation process to reserve the work, to the intermediating agent terminal <b>5</b>, in a step <b>5036</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">The intermediating agent terminal <b>5</b> receives the reservation completion notification from the server <b>7</b> in a step <b>5037</b>, and sends confirmation information, indicating that the reservation completion has been confirmed, to the server <b>7</b>, in a step <b>5038</b>. The intermediating agent terminal <b>5</b> displays the confirmation information in a step <b>5039</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">In addition, the server <b>7</b> receives the confirmation information sent from the intermediating agent terminal <b>6</b> in the step <b>5038</b>, and relays the received confirmation information to the company terminal <b>4</b>, in a step <b>5040</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">The company terminal <b>4</b> receives the confirmation information relayed via the server <b>7</b>, in a step <b>5041</b>. Moreover, the company terminal <b>4</b> displays the received confirmation information in a step <b>5042</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">In this embodiment, the integrated level is judged from two elements, namely, the &#x201c;delivery rank&#x201d; and the &#x201c;technical skill level&#x201d;, so as to obtain the unit price information. However, if is possible to judge the integrated level from more detailed elements. For example, a rank may be set with respect to skills including &#x201c;delivery meeting percentage&#x201d;, &#x201c;customer evaluation&#x201d;, &#x201c;acquired certificates&#x201d;, &#x201c;received training&#x201d; and &#x201c;past achievements&#x201d;, so that the integrated level may be determined from a combination of such elements (skills). It is desirable that the &#x201c;customer evaluation&#x201d; in particular is further divided into more detailed elements such as &#x201c;quality of creation&#x201d;, &#x201c;communication&#x201d; and &#x201c;total evaluation&#x201d;, so as to enable more detailed determination of the rank.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">In addition, the embodiment described above selects a target teleworker using the skill and the schedule of the individual teleworker. However, the target teleworker may be selected based on further information, such as information indicating whether or not the teleworker can travel from his home to a remote location for consultation and/or work, and information indicating the priority of work to be performed depending on a handicap in the case of a handicapped teleworker. For example, this information indicating the priority of the work to be performed depending on the handicap, indicates that the work which enables consultation in a barrier-free building is to be selected with priority over others in the case of a handicapped teleworker using a wheelchair.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Moreover, although the embodiment described above sets the selection and the processing time of the teleworker depending only on the kind of work, the precondition of the work and the like greatly affects the amount of work. For example, in the case of the work to create the homepage, the amount of work greatly varies depending on the number of pages to be provided by the homepage, and the functions required by the homepage. The functions required by the homepage may include functions of using an object-oriented language, creating the homepage using a simple language such as HTML, and including a dynamic image (or animation) or a photograph image, for example. Therefore, by taking into consideration the amount of work when actually placing the work order, it is possible to more positively have the teleworkers perform the work.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">Further, the present invention is not limited to these embodiments, but various variations and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
