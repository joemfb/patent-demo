<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The semiconductor integrated circuit (IC) industry has experienced rapid growth. Technological advances in IC materials and design have produced generations of ICs where each generation has smaller and more complex circuits than the previous generation. However, these advances have increased the complexity of processing and manufacturing ICs and, for these advances to be realized, similar developments in IC processing and manufacturing are needed. In the course of IC evolution, functional density (i.e., the number of interconnected devices per chip area) has generally increased while geometry size (i.e., the smallest component that can be created using a fabrication process) has decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">These ICs include high voltage semiconductor devices. As geometry size continues to be scaled down, it has become increasingly more difficult for existing high voltage semiconductor devices to achieve certain performance criteria. As an example, a breakdown voltage may become a performance limitation for traditional high voltage semiconductor devices. In conventional high voltage semiconductor devices, improvement in the breakdown voltage by reducing drift region doping may lead to an undesirable increase in an on-state resistance of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Therefore, while existing high voltage semiconductor devices have been generally adequate for their intended purposes, they have not been entirely satisfactory in every aspect.</p>

<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is to be understood that the following disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of the invention. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. Moreover, the formation of a first feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed interposing the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. Various features may be arbitrarily drawn in different scales for the sake of simplicity and clarity.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a flowchart of a method <b>10</b> of fabricating a high voltage semiconductor device according to various aspects of the present disclosure. The method <b>10</b> includes a block <b>12</b> in which a drift region is formed in a substrate. The drift region includes doped regions with different types of conductivity. The method <b>10</b> includes a block <b>14</b> in which a dielectric isolation structure is formed over the drift region. In some embodiments, the dielectric isolation structure includes a local oxidation of silicon (LOCOS) that protrudes out of a surface of the substrate. The method <b>10</b> includes a block <b>16</b> in which a gate of a transistor is formed over a portion of the dielectric isolation structure. The method <b>10</b> includes a block <b>18</b> in which a resistor device is formed over the dielectric isolation structure. The resistor device includes a plurality of winding segments. In some embodiments, the winding segments have substantially uniform dimensions and spacing. The method <b>10</b> includes a block <b>20</b> in which a source and a drain in the substrate. The source and the drain are separated by the drift region and the dielectric isolation structure. The resistor device and the gate are disposed between the source and the drain.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is understood that additional steps may be performed to complete the fabrication of the high voltage semiconductor device. For example, the method may include a step in which an interconnect structure is formed over the substrate. The interconnect structure either electrically couples the resistor device in parallel to the transistor, or leaves the resistor electrically floating.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a diagrammatic fragmentary cross-sectional side view of a high voltage semiconductor device <b>20</b>A according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. It is understood that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> has been simplified for a better understanding of the inventive concepts of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the high voltage semiconductor device <b>20</b>A includes a portion of a substrate <b>30</b>. The substrate <b>30</b> is doped with a P-type dopant such as boron. In another embodiment, the substrate <b>30</b> may be doped with an N-type dopant such as phosphorous or arsenic. The substrate <b>30</b> may also include other suitable elementary semiconductor materials, such as diamond or germanium; a suitable compound semiconductor, such as silicon carbide, indium arsenide, or indium phosphide; or a suitable alloy semiconductor, such as silicon germanium carbide, gallium arsenic phosphide, or gallium indium phosphide.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A buried well <b>35</b> is formed in a portion of the substrate <b>30</b> through an ion implantation process known in the art. The buried well <b>35</b> is formed to have an opposite type of conductivity than that of the substrate <b>30</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the buried well <b>35</b> is N-type doped, since the substrate <b>30</b> herein is a P-type substrate. In another embodiment where the substrate <b>30</b> is an N-type substrate, the buried well <b>35</b> is P-type doped. The buried well <b>35</b> may be formed by an implantation process having a dose that is in a range from about 1&#xd7;10<sup>12 </sup>atoms/centimeter<sup>2 </sup>to about 2&#xd7;10<sup>12 </sup>atoms/centimeter<sup>2</sup>.

The high voltage doped well <b>50</b> may be formed by an ion implantation process known in the art. For example, the doped well <b>50</b> may be formed by an implantation process having a dose that is in a range from about 3&#xd7;10<sup>12 </sup>atoms/centimeter<sup>2 </sup>to about 4&#xd7;10<sup>12 </sup>atoms/centimeter<sup>2</sup>.

A patterned photoresist layer (not illustrated) may be formed over the substrate <b>35</b> as a mask during the implantation process.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The high voltage doped well <b>50</b> is doped with the same type of conductivity as the buried well <b>35</b> (i.e., opposite from that of the substrate <b>30</b>). Thus, the high voltage doped well <b>50</b> is a high voltage N-well (HVNW) in the illustrated embodiment. The high voltage doped well <b>50</b> may also be referred to as a drift region <b>50</b>. In some embodiments, the buried well <b>35</b> may be considered to be a part of the high voltage doped well <b>50</b> and may be considered to be a part of the drift region <b>50</b> as well.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A plurality of isolation structures are formed over the drift region <b>50</b>, for example isolation structures <b>80</b> and <b>81</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The isolation structures <b>80</b>-<b>81</b> may include a dielectric material. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the isolation structures <b>80</b>-<b>81</b> are Local Oxidation of Silicon (LOCOS) devices (also referred to as field oxide). The LOCOS devices may be formed using a nitride mask and thermal-growing an oxide material through the mask openings. At least a portion of the LOCOS devices protrude downwardly into, and protrude upwardly out of, the drift region <b>50</b>. Furthermore, the LOCOS devices may have uneven thicknesses (or depths). For example, the edge portions of the LOCOS devices may have tapered shapes and thus smaller thicknesses. In some embodiments, the non-edge portions of the LOCOS devices have a thickness <b>90</b>, which may be in a range from about 0.2 microns (um) to about 1 um in certain embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Alternatively, the isolation structures <b>80</b>-<b>81</b> may include shallow trench isolation (STI) devices or deep trench isolation (DTI) devices. The isolation structures <b>80</b>-<b>81</b> help define boundaries of certain doped regions to be formed later, for example boundaries of source and drain regions of a Field Effect Transistor (FET) device.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A doped extension region <b>100</b> is formed in the drift region <b>50</b>. In the embodiment shown, the doped extension region <b>100</b> is formed between the high voltage doped well <b>50</b> and the buried well <b>35</b>. The doped extension region <b>100</b> has the same type of conductivity as the substrate <b>30</b> but an opposite type of conductivity as the drift region <b>50</b>. Thus, in the embodiment shown, the doped extension region <b>100</b> has a P-type of conductivity.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In certain embodiments, the doped extension region <b>100</b> may be formed by two separate ion implantation processes. The first ion implantation process forms a doped region at least partially in the upper portion of the drift region <b>50</b> (near the upper surface of the drift region <b>50</b>). The second ion implantation process forms a deeper and wider doped region that &#x201c;extends&#x201d; or &#x201c;protrudes&#x201d; laterally outward. Subsequently, a thermal process may be performed to inter-diffuse and merge the two doped regions into a single doped region, thereby forming the doped extension region <b>100</b>. As a result, the doped extension region <b>100</b> has a protruding portion <b>105</b> (or protruding tip) that laterally extends or protrudes partially into the drift region <b>50</b>. Therefore, the doped extension region <b>100</b> may also be referred to as a P-body extension region <b>100</b> herein.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the protruding portion <b>105</b> is buried inside the drift region <b>50</b>, rather than being located near the upper surface of the drift region <b>50</b>. In other words, the protruding portion <b>105</b> is located away from the surface of the drift region <b>50</b>. One benefit offered by the protruding portion <b>105</b> is that it can provide extra conduction path to reduce an on-state resistance of a transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Using the same implantation processes that form the doped extension region <b>100</b>, a doped isolation region <b>110</b> is also formed. In an embodiment, the doped isolation region <b>110</b> is formed using the second ion implantation process (the one that forms the wider and deeper doped region). To define the lateral size of the doped isolation region <b>110</b>, a patterned photoresist mask layer may be formed that has an opening, and the above-mentioned second ion implantation process may be performed through the opening to define the doped isolation region <b>110</b>. Stated differently, the doped isolation region <b>110</b> is also formed during the formation of the protruding portion <b>105</b> of the doped extension region <b>100</b>. Thus, the doped isolation region <b>110</b> may have a dopant concentration level that is approximately the same as the dopant concentration level of the protruding portion <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A gate <b>120</b> is formed over the drift region <b>50</b>. Specifically, the gate <b>120</b> may be formed on a portion of the isolation structure <b>80</b>.

The silicided surface may include tungsten silicide, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A resistor device <b>130</b> is formed over the isolation structure <b>80</b>. In some embodiments, the resistor device <b>130</b> includes a polysilicon material, and may therefore be referred to as a polysilicon resistor. For example, the resistor device <b>130</b> may include an undoped polysilicon material, a P-doped polysilicon material, or a silicide on polysilicon material. The resistor device <b>130</b> is designed to handle high voltages, for example voltages greater than about 100 volts, and may be as high as a few hundred volts. Thus, the resistor device <b>130</b> may also be referred to as a high voltage resistor device. In some embodiments, the resistor device <b>130</b> is formed at the same time as the gate <b>120</b>. In other embodiments, the resistor device <b>130</b> and the gate <b>120</b> are formed at separate times using different processes.</p>

In some embodiments, the winding segments of the resistor device <b>130</b> have substantially uniform vertical and lateral dimensions (i.e., heights/thicknesses and widths). For example, each winding segment's vertical and lateral dimensions may vary within a few percentage points (or less than a percentage point) of those of another winding segment.

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A heavily doped drain region <b>150</b> is formed at the upper surface of the drift region <b>50</b> on one side of the isolation structure <b>80</b>, and a heavily doped source region <b>160</b> is formed at the upper surface of the doped extension region <b>100</b> on the opposite side of the isolation structure <b>80</b>. In other words, the drain region <b>150</b> and the source region <b>160</b> are located on opposite sides of the isolation structure <b>80</b>. A heavily doped region <b>161</b> is also formed adjacent to the source region <b>160</b>. In some embodiments, the heavily doped region <b>161</b> may serve as a guard ring.</p>

Thus, in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the drain region <b>150</b> the source region <b>160</b> are N-type doped, and the heavily doped region <b>161</b> is P-type doped. The drain region <b>150</b> and the source region <b>160</b> have dopant concentration levels that are significantly higher than the dopant concentration level of the drift region <b>50</b>. The heavily doped region <b>161</b> has a dopant concentration level that is significantly higher than the dopant concentration level of the doped extension region <b>100</b>. Therefore, in the embodiment shown, the drain region <b>150</b> and the source region <b>160</b> may be referred to as N+ regions, and the heavily doped region <b>161</b> may be referred to as an P+ region. Conductive pads such as pads <b>170</b> may also be formed on the source or drain regions (or the doped isolation region <b>110</b>) to help establish electrical connections to these source and drain regions.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The gate <b>120</b> (which is located between the drain region <b>150</b> and the source region <b>160</b>), the drain region <b>150</b>, and the source region <b>160</b> are components of a FET transistor device.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">An interconnect structure <b>200</b> is formed over the surface of the substrate <b>30</b>. In other words, the interconnect structure <b>200</b> is formed over the isolation structures <b>80</b>-<b>81</b>, the gate <b>120</b>, the resistor device <b>130</b>, and the source and drain regions <b>160</b> and <b>150</b>, among other things. The interconnect structure <b>200</b> includes a plurality of patterned dielectric layers and conductive layers that provide interconnections (e.g., wiring) between circuitries, inputs/outputs, and various doped features (for example, the drift region <b>50</b>). In more detail, the interconnect structure <b>200</b> may include a plurality of interconnect layers, also referred to as metal layers. Each of the interconnect layers includes a plurality of interconnect features, also referred to as metal lines.

In this manner, the resistor device <b>130</b> is electrically coupled to the FET transistor device in parallel, specifically, to the drain and source/substrate of the FET transistor device in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to the various aspects of the present disclosure, the parallel-coupled resistor device <b>130</b> improves the uniformity of the electric field in the drift region <b>50</b>. As discussed above, the resistor device <b>130</b> has a plurality of substantially uniform winding segments, whose spacing there between is also substantially uniform. As such, each winding segment can bear a substantially fixed and uniform amount of electrical voltage. In other words, when a high electrical voltage (for example on the order of a few hundred volts) is applied to the FET transistor between its source and drain, that high electrical voltage is applied to the resistor device <b>130</b> as well, since it is electrically coupled in parallel to the FET transistor. The uniformity in the dimensions and spacing of the resistor device <b>130</b> segments allows the high electrical voltage to be spread evenly and uniformly across the span of the resistor device <b>130</b>, thereby improving the uniformity of the electric field in the drift region <b>50</b> below the resistor device <b>130</b>. As a result of the more uniformly distributed electric field, the breakdown voltage of the FET transistor is increased as well.

One difference between the high voltage semiconductor devices <b>20</b>A and <b>20</b>B is that, unlike the high voltage semiconductor device <b>20</b>A, the high voltage semiconductor device <b>20</b>B is electrically floating. For example, none of the segments of the resistor device <b>130</b> is directly electrically coupled to any components of the FET transistor device. Nevertheless, the resistor device <b>130</b> may be viewed as being electrically coupled in parallel to the FET transistor device through induction. In a sense, the drift region <b>50</b>, the isolation structure <b>80</b>, and the resistor device <b>130</b> form a capacitor. In particular, the isolation structure <b>80</b> serves as the insulator component of the capacitor (since the isolation structure <b>80</b> is dielectric), and the drift region <b>50</b> and the resistor device <b>130</b> each serve as the electrical conductors sandwiching the insulator component. This also helps improve the uniformity of the electric field within the high voltage semiconductor device <b>20</b>B. Stated differently, even though the resistor device <b>130</b> is implemented as an electrically-floating resistor device, the high voltage semiconductor device <b>20</b>B still offers an increased (and thus better) breakdown voltage over conventional high voltage semiconductor devices.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a high voltage semiconductor device <b>20</b>C is similar to the high voltage semiconductor device <b>20</b>A in many regards. One difference between the high voltage semiconductor device <b>20</b>A and <b>20</b>C is that the high voltage semiconductor device <b>20</b>C includes an electrically floating metal conductor <b>230</b>. The electrically-floating metal conductor <b>230</b> is disposed over the resistor device <b>130</b>, but it has no direct electrical connections to components of the FET transistor. For reasons similar to those discussed above associated with the resistor device <b>130</b>, the implementation of the electrically-floating metal conductor <b>230</b> also helps improve the uniformity of the electrical field within the high voltage semiconductor device.
