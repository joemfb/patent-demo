<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a novel transparent Chitam gel and a process for the preparation thereof. The present invention particularly relates to a crystal clear, colourless, nontoxic, biodegradable, biocompatible gel from xyloglucan and chitosan co-polymer which is herein after referred to as chitam gel. The invention also relates to an improved process for the preparation of the said non thermo reversible, gel using a copolymer of modified xyloglucan with chitosan. The process is simple, cost effective and can be scaled up. The gel can be used for a variety of applications, such as make-up cosmetic or basic cosmetic such as face wash, milky lotion, cream or foundation, with excellent elasticity and aging stability, giving refreshing feeling, free from stickiness and having excellent usability, as a ultraviolet protective agent or as a tissue adhesive which can be used, including haemostasis, wound sealing, tissue engineering or localised drug delivery as capsules &#x26; tablets and also can be used as a food ingredient, and supplement for metabolic disorders since it is not digested by the human digestive enzymes and yields zero calorie to the diet.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Today's consumers in the cosmetic, food and beverage market are increasingly interested in healthy life styles, a trend which has produced a sky rocketing demand for health oriented products. Cosmetic and personal care products manufacturers claim that there is burgeoning trend for transparent products for instance those which use clear formulation techniques in their gels and emulsions. Pure xyloglucan extracted from tamarind seed as such does not form a gel; however, it is reported that it forms a thermoreversible gel in the presence of a large amount of alcohol or sugar or by the addition of a polyphenol such as epigallocatechin gallate. It was also reported that xyloglucan alone can form a gel if a part of the galactose is removed. The gel strength became greater with increasing removal ratio of galactose from xyloglucan. Xyloglucan along with xanthan or gellan or curdlan is reported to have synergistic interaction at low temperatures and results in an increase in the elastic moduli. The gelation scheme is different from that observed for an aqueous solution of enzymatically degraded xyloglucan which forms gel at a higher temperature. In the case of enzymatically degraded xyloglucan, the cross-linking domains are composed of aligned xyloglucan chains in the shape of flat plates, whereas no ordered structure was found for the cross-linking domains in the xyloglucan/ethanol system at lower temperatures. Xyloglucan undergoes thermo reversible gelation in the presence of ethanol. The cross-linking domain seems to be formed by random aggregation of xyloglucan chains due to poor solubility in ethanol. The analysis by time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering has revealed that the complete dissolution of aggregates corresponds to the gel-sol transition. Here the cross-linking domain seems to be composed of random aggregates and has no ordered structure. Hence the gels which is crystal clear, colorless, not thermo reversible, non toxic, biodegradable, biocompatible and having an ordered structure and from renewable resources and hence, cost effective are in great demand globally.</p>

Nishinar Nishinari, Biomacromolecules, 5, (2004), 1206-1213, wherein the interaction of tamarind seed xyloglucan and epigallocatechin gallate to induce a thermo reversible gelation was investigated and the draw backs are the gel formed was thermo reversible and was not transparent.</p>

<p id="p-0059" num="0079">The product as provided by the process of the present invention is a crystal clear Chitam gel which is a copolymer of two naturally occurring polysaccharides. The coarsely powdered tamarind powder was made into slurry with water of acidic or alkaline pH, heated to 10 to 100 degree. C preferably 40 to 80 degree C., cooled and precipitated with suitable solvents such as ethanol, methanol, benzyl alcohol, Isopropanol, isobutanol, n-butanol, etc in a concentration of 10 to 100% (v/v). The precipitated xyloglucan was dried under vacuum or freeze dried. Powdered xyloglucan was dispersed in water or any other solvents such as DMSO, DMF, THF, dichloromethane, hexane, benzene, acetone acetic acid, formic acid etc under alkaline conditions. Stirred the above reaction mixture with any of the oxidative reagents such as hydrogen peroxide, potassium periodate, sodium periodate at a temperature 2 to 10 degree C. for 1 to 15 h. Reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml ethylene glycol. The product formed was purified by any method such as dialysis or column chromatography. Pure oxidised sample was mixed with 1 to 10% chitosan in acidic medium and was stirred for 1 to 5 minutes to form cross links. Consequently, a clear chitam gel was obtained. About 1 gram dry weight raw material gives 100 gram wet, clear and sturdy gel.</p>

        <li id="ul0010-0004" num="0099">4. Zero calorie gel useful as a diet replacement, especially for diabetic patients can be incorporated on beverages, Jam, jellies, marmalades, to give the desired viscosity, gel characteristics and mouth feel compatible with edible colors, flavors and artificial sweeteners.</li>
        <li id="ul0010-0005" num="0100">5. Very stable at acidic to neutral pH of 3.0 to 7.0 and hence can be used as a vehicle for drugs in oral, topical, or wound healing patches.</li>
        <li id="ul0010-0006" num="0101">6. The chitam gel is easy to handle and hygienic and nontoxic.</li>
        <li id="ul0010-0007" num="0102">7. No need for heat or long periods of stirring for the gel preparation since the gel is formed at room temperature and at atmospheric pressure; hence costly processing equipments are not necessary.</li>
        <li id="ul0010-0008" num="0103">8. The desired final product viscosity can be tailor made from the chitam gel either modifying the percentage of xyloglucan, chitosan ratio or by diluting with suitable media.</li>
