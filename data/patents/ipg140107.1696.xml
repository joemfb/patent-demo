<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention is directed to fitness equipment, more particularly to a system designed to help a user stretch and maintain a stretched position without straining.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Stretching, while an important part of fitness, can be very difficult for some individuals. For example, many people have difficulty maintaining a stretched position without straining. The present invention features a stretching assistance system designed to help a user to easily stretch areas including but not limited to the calves, hamstrings, lower back, and groin muscles. The system of the present invention helps a user maintain a static stretch and allows for a quick release if necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The stretching assistance system helps provides mechanical assistance in stretching the hamstrings, lower back, calf muscles, and groin muscles by allowing the user to control the intensity of different stretch positions (e.g., five positions, e.g., toe touch, right leg toe touch, left leg toe touch, spread eagle and butterfly stretch) and &#x201c;locking&#x201d; them into place so that the user can relax and quickly release when finished. In some embodiments, the system adjusts for heights between about 3 feet to 6.5 feet. The footrest has a support flap used for some stretches, for example a spread eagle stretch and butterfly groin/lower back stretches. The system can fold to a storage position (e.g., generally flat) for easy storage under a bed or in a closet.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Any feature or combination of features described herein are included within the scope of the present invention provided that the features included in any such combination are not mutually inconsistent as will be apparent from the context, this specification, and the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art. Additional advantages and aspects of the present invention are apparent in the following detailed description and claims.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention features a stretching assistance system. In some embodiments, the stretching assistance system comprises a generally elongated base having a front end and a back end, the base functions as a seat for a user; a generally elongated pivoting platform pivotally attached to the back end of the base via a first hinge, the pivoting platform functions to contact a user's back, the pivoting platform can pivot between multiple positions including a folded position wherein the pivoting platform is folded inwardly and positioned atop the base and generally flush with the base, and an extended position wherein the pivoting platform is at an angle (e.g., 120 degrees) with respect to the base, in the extended position a user can comfortably sit on the base; a footrest assembly disposed atop the base, the footrest assembly comprises a footrest base disposed atop the base at or near the front end of the base and a footrest platform pivotally attached to the footrest base via a footrest hinge, the footrest platform faces the back end of the base and can pivot about the footrest hinge between at least an extended position wherein the footrest hinge extends upwardly and generally perpendicularly from the footrest base and a storage position wherein the footrest platform is pivoted toward the footrest base such that it is atop and generally flush with the footrest base, the footrest assembly functions to support a user's feet when the user is sitting on the base with his back to the pivoting platform; an adjustment means for adjusting a position of the footrest assembly with respect to the front end of the base, the adjustment means functions to allow the stretching assistance system to accommodate users of various heights; a first pulley component disposed in the pivoting platform at or near a top end of the pivoting platform, and a second pulley component disposed in the footrest platform at or near a top end of the footrest platform; a rope having a first end and a second end, the first end of the rope is attached to the footrest assembly, the rope extends from the footrest assembly to the first pulley component and wraps around the first pulley component and further extends to the second pulley component and wraps around the second pulley component, the second end of the rope extends outwardly from the second pulley component; and a handle attached to the second end of the rope; and a locking cleat disposed on the footrest platform.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When the second end of the rope is pulled, the pivoting panel pivots toward the footrest. The locking cleat functions to temporarily hold the rope in a fixed position so that the user does not have to continue to pull on the rope during a stretch. Excess rope can be coiled around handle as it is rotated to keep handle in comfortable position for pulling.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, the stretching assistance system further comprises a first padding material (e.g., foam, rubber, or a combination thereof) disposed on a top surface of the base to provide comfort to the user. In some embodiments, the stretching assistance system further comprises a second padding material (e.g., foam, rubber, or a combination thereof) disposed on an inside surface of the pivoting platform (the inside surface faces the users back) for comfort. In some embodiments, the stretching assistance system further comprises a third padding material (e.g., foam, rubber, or a combination thereof) disposed on the inside surface of the footrest platform (the inside surface faces the users feet).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the adjustment means comprises a plurality of adjustment holes disposed in the base at and near the front end of the base and hardware temporarily disposed in the footrest assembly and engaged in the adjustment holes. In some embodiments, the handle is a dowel handle for coiling up excess rope. In some embodiments, the stretching assistance system further comprises a side panel pivotally attached to a first side edge of the footrest platform via a side panel hinge to support the footrest platform when the users feet are not touching nor supporting the footrest platform in a vertical position (e.g., in the spread eagle and butterfly stretches).</p>

Positions in between the folded position and the pivoted position may be used for stretching purposes (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, wherein the pivoting platform <b>120</b> is generally perpendicular to the base <b>110</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> wherein the pivoting platform <b>120</b> pivots inward toward the base <b>110</b> for a more flexible user). In some embodiments, the pivoting platform <b>120</b> (e.g., the inside surface <b>125</b>) is covered with a second padding material <b>118</b><i>b</i>, for example foam, rubber, the like, or a combination thereof. The second padding material <b>118</b><i>b </i>may help provide comfort to a user's back and/or prevent damage when the top surface of the pivoting platform <b>120</b> comes in contact with the top surface (or first padding material <b>118</b><i>a</i>) of the base <b>110</b> when the pivoting platform <b>120</b> is moved to the folded position.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, the angle <b>105</b><i>a </i>is about 120 degrees. In some embodiments, the angle <b>105</b><i>a </i>is between about 30 to 60 degrees. In some embodiments, the angle <b>105</b><i>a </i>is between about 45 to 90 degrees. In some embodiments, the angle <b>105</b><i>a </i>is between about 60 to 90 degrees. In some embodiments, the angle <b>105</b><i>a </i>is between about 90 to 120 degrees. In some embodiments, the angle <b>105</b><i>a </i>is between about 120 to 150 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The system <b>100</b> further comprises a footrest assembly <b>130</b> positioned at or near the front end <b>115</b> of the base <b>110</b>. For example, the footrest assembly <b>130</b> comprises a footrest base <b>130</b><i>b </i>disposed atop the base <b>110</b> at or near the front end <b>115</b> of the base <b>110</b>. The footrest assembly <b>130</b> further comprises a footrest platform <b>130</b><i>a </i>that is pivotally attached to the footrest base <b>130</b><i>b </i>via a footrest hinge <b>130</b><i>c</i>. For the purposes of describing orientation, the footrest platform <b>130</b><i>a </i>is closer to the back end <b>116</b> of the base <b>110</b> than is the footrest base <b>130</b><i>b </i>and the footrest hinge <b>130</b><i>c </i>faces the front end <b>115</b> of the base <b>110</b>. The footrest platform <b>130</b><i>b </i>can pivot about the footrest hinge <b>130</b><i>c </i>between an extended position (wherein the footrest hinge <b>130</b><i>c </i>extends upwardly and generally perpendicularly from the base <b>100</b>, e.g., when in use) and a storage position wherein the footrest platform <b>130</b><i>a </i>is pivoted toward the footrest base <b>130</b><i>b </i>such that it is atop (and touching) the footrest base <b>130</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The footrest platform <b>130</b><i>a </i>may be a generally flat panel, however the footrest platform <b>130</b><i>a </i>is not limited to this configuration. The footrest platform <b>130</b><i>a </i>provides a platform for a user to place his/her feet (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The footrest platform <b>130</b><i>a </i>has an inside surface <b>133</b>, the inside surface <b>133</b> being the surface that faces the pivoting platform <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, the footrest platform <b>130</b><i>a </i>(e.g., the inside surface <b>133</b>) is covered with a third padding material <b>118</b><i>c</i>, for example foam, rubber, the like, or a combination thereof. The third padding material <b>118</b><i>c </i>may help provide comfort to a user's feet.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, the position of the footrest assembly <b>130</b> can be adjusted. For example, in some embodiments, a plurality of adjustment holes <b>170</b> are disposed in the base <b>110</b> (e.g., in the top surface at and near the front end <b>115</b>), wherein the footrest base <b>130</b><i>b </i>(and effectively the footrest hinge <b>130</b><i>b </i>and footrest platform <b>130</b><i>a</i>) can be attached to the adjustment holes <b>170</b> (e.g., via hardware <b>172</b> such as two sets of bolts, screws, washers and wing nuts). In some embodiments the footrest assembly <b>130</b> adjusts along a track disposed on the base <b>110</b> (at the front end <b>115</b>). With the hardware <b>172</b> removed, the track allows the footrest assembly <b>130</b> to slide forwardly (toward the front end <b>115</b> of the base <b>110</b>) and backwardly (toward the back end <b>116</b> of the base) along the track until the appropriate position is achieved for the user. Then, the hardware <b>172</b> can be reinstalled to secure the footrest assembly <b>130</b> in place. The adjustability of the footrest assembly <b>130</b> allows the system <b>100</b> to accommodate users of various heights. The present invention is not limited to an adjustment hole system or a track system of adjusting the footrest assembly <b>130</b> into different positions.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A first pulley component <b>140</b><i>a </i>is disposed in the pivoting platform <b>120</b> at or near the front end. A second pulley component <b>140</b><i>b </i>is disposed in the footrest platform <b>130</b><i>a </i>at or near the top end of the footrest platform <b>130</b><i>a</i>. A rope <b>150</b> engages the first pulley component <b>140</b><i>a </i>and the second pulley component <b>140</b><i>b </i>(e.g., the rope <b>150</b> connects the two pulley components <b>140</b> together). Generally, the rope <b>150</b> has a first end <b>151</b> that is attached to the footrest platform <b>130</b><i>a </i>(e.g., near the second pulley component <b>140</b><i>b</i>). From the footrest platform <b>130</b><i>a</i>, the rope <b>150</b> extends to the first pulley component <b>140</b><i>a </i>and wraps around the first pulley component <b>140</b><i>a</i>. From the first pulley component <b>140</b><i>a</i>, the rope <b>150</b> extends to the second pulley component <b>140</b><i>b </i>and wraps around the second pulley component <b>140</b><i>b</i>. The second end <b>152</b> of the rope <b>150</b> extends outwardly from the second pulley component <b>140</b><i>b </i>(e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), passes through the locking cleat <b>190</b> see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), and attaches to a handle <b>180</b> (e.g., doe handle).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">When the second end <b>152</b> of the rope <b>150</b> is pulled (e.g., via the handle <b>180</b>), the pivoting panel <b>120</b> pivots toward the footrest assembly <b>130</b>. This movement can help press slightly upon the user's back, helping the user achieve a stretch without having to strain and allows the stretch to be held as long as desired. As the user continues to pull on the handle <b>180</b>, excess rope can be coiled up on the handle <b>180</b> to maintain a comfortable position for the user. When the user releases the rope <b>150</b> (for moving the rope upward), the pivoting panel <b>120</b> is no longer pulled toward the footrest assembly <b>130</b> and the pressure on the user's back is relieved, thereby ending the stretch.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A locking cleat <b>190</b> is disposed on the footrest platform <b>130</b><i>a</i>, for example below the second pulley component <b>140</b><i>b </i>(e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The locking cleat <b>190</b> functions to temporarily hold the rope <b>150</b> in a fixed position so that the user does not have to continue to pull on the rope <b>150</b> (and therefore can relax in the stretched position). Locking cleats are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, a side panel <b>160</b> is pivotally attached to a first side edge of the footrest platform <b>130</b><i>a </i>(e.g., via a side panel hinge <b>160</b><i>a</i>). The side panel <b>160</b> functions to support the footrest platform <b>130</b><i>a </i>in a generally vertical position. For example, the side panel <b>160</b> may be used for stretches including but not limited to a spread eagle stretch and butterfly stretch (e.g., when the user's feet are not in contact with the footrest platform <b>130</b><i>a </i>to support it vertically). Generally, the footrest assembly <b>130</b> must be in a vertical position for the locking cleat <b>190</b> to function properly.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The system <b>100</b> of the present invention may be constructed in a variety of sizes. For example, in some embodiments, the base <b>110</b> is about 54.5 inches in length as measured from the front end <b>115</b> to the back end <b>116</b>. In some embodiments, the base <b>110</b> is between about 50 to 60 inches in length as measured from the front end <b>115</b> to the back end <b>116</b>. In some embodiments, the base <b>110</b> is between about 60 to 70 inches in length as measured from the front end <b>115</b> to the back end <b>116</b>. In some embodiments, the base <b>110</b> is more than about 70 inches in length. In some embodiments, the pivoting platform <b>120</b> is about 41.5 inches in length as measured from the top end to the bottom end. In some embodiments, the pivoting platform <b>120</b> is between about 40 to 50 inches in length as measured from the front end to the back end. In some embodiments, the pivoting platform <b>120</b> is between about 50 to 60 inches in length as measured from the front end to the back end. In some embodiments, the pivoting platform <b>120</b> is more than about 60 inches in length. The present invention is not limited to the aforementioned dimensions.</p>
